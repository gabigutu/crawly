		<shortDescription>Not Jem. No holigrams.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Hollywood. This is how to do it wrong. Take a much loved nostalgia item and childhood institution like Jem, Ignore the source material, alienate the true fan base, Fail to advertise to the tween girl fan base and fail to mention its a family movie suitable for moms and daughters. I hate this movie. Because it is not what it claims to be. Jem and the Holograms. This is Hanna Montana with a be yourself and love your friends final moral. Advertised as a re imagining(under a different Title) and presented to moms and daughters as a good family movie it could have done well. It is a touching and well told story, The acting is good and the plot is OK. But It is Not Jem. It was not well advertised and Kids now Don't know or care who Jem was. This was a film for 30+ year olds who grew up with it. And had we been given what we remembered we would have rewarded the studio with our money. But it was made for 14 year olds who have seen the same thing before as Hanna Montana. So ends the one shot we will get at a Jem movie. A badly presented/advertised fraud that was a good family movie and had its potential ignored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People... i think the 8-10 star reviews must be cast and staff of the film... bad... really bad... call it Hanna Montana the reckoning before you call it Jem. Please don't believe what they are saying above.. they already used social media to trick fans with their bogus casting call out and nicked you-tube scenes...The acting is phoned in and talentless... the plot is recycled bumph that a four year old would wright and was mind numbing boring.. so much so i counted the hairs in my forearm to keep sane.... there were 12 as i pulled the rest out to form my own entertainment. Buy the DVD if you want a shiny Frisby or wind catcher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Outrageous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really - it was truly outrageous because of how terrible it was. Jem in name only. This movie resembled absolutely NOTHING from the series and the acting was so cringeworthy, I could barely watch them spew their lines out. I would like to blame it on their youth, but there are many young female actors who are far superior. I really am disappointed in this movie, the trailer on YouTube has more dislikes than likes, that's how terrible it is. After all the excitement I had about finally seeing a Jem movie in the works, I can't really explain how I feel let down by it. If you grew up wanting to be Jem, like I did, then seriously you're going to leave the theatre feeling annoyed and quite frankly bored. The storyline left a lot to be desired, it really felt more like Hannah Montana than the Holograms - a pretty-yet-plain "uncool" sobbing girl who magically becomes a web sensation overnight, even though she's not a cat playing the piano - it just didn't feel real, especially when a wig and pink eyeshadow are hardly the tools of a master of disguise. It was genuinely nothing like I remember, nothing like the girls who inspired me to dye my hair bright colors and it was a total waste of money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>kind of an insult to human intelligence, and to its target target audience (whatever that is) as well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get down to brass tax, folks: Jem and the Holograms is out to rob you of your money. I don't mean that literally, like the movie comes in to your pockets and takes it all away, but... well, it's pretty close to that. Now, first off, two positive notes here: 1), the lead of the movie as "Jem", Aubrey Peeples, is a charming young actress and is ideally cast (Juliette Lewis is good too... at first, until she has to repeat the same thing scene after scene). Peeples is not a mind-blowingly amazing singer, but she is decent enough with just her screen presence on her own, and I hope to see her in other movies. Secondly, the cinematography, for the *actual film*, is nice to look at, at least when you can tell what's going on (some of the film is edited quickly in its clichéd style. So, not completely terrible. Just mostly.Why does this movie 'pocket' your money? It has no good reason to exist, for one thing. It posits itself as being out there for fans of the show and young girls, that I assume is the primary audience for this movie (and I guess people like me who hear about a notorious movie and get curious, but I digress). It's not good for either; while I have not seen much of the original 80's show - it had its 15 minutes just before I got into TV as a kid, and it didn't seem to have the longevity that other shows at the time did, even as nostalgia - I don't know what it has to do with the series except for the smallest references. Maybe because it would be slightly less intolerable as a cartoon(?) Who knows. As for young/teenage girls, it just loads up so many clichés into one movie to the point where it looks like it's about to explode: it's all about telling girls to keep positive and put their music out there... because people can become sensationally famous from 36,000 YouTube views, you know.It's supposed to have some kind of basis with the Justin Bieber phenomenon (the Bieber doc from a few years back had the same director as this by the way, mega-hack John M Chu). Forget that it took Bieber years of putting his stuff out there, and putting *himself* out there, but the fame for Jerrica-cum-Jem comes from one not-very-good song that gets a ton of hits. This movie doesn't understand how social media or youtube or fans of pop music really works, and that's what makes it insulting since, well, young girls and teenagers use this stuff practically more than anyone else out there! As for the plot, goodness, which part? There's a robot named Synergy which Jerrica's (dead) father made when she was a little girl, and the robot has been in her possession for all these years and it finally comes alive as this super-advanced-piece-of-AI (i.e. this could've been a robot in WALL-E), and what does the robot do... it gives Jerrica clues that are sending her to different parts of the city - one of them just happens to be one of the gigs that Jem plays with her sister and fellow foster-family people - and it all leads up to a revelation that is... a video that is a, well, should I spoil this? To say that it is one of the most underwhelming things in movie history isn't hyperbole, especially if you are actually invested (somehow) in this story.This movie jumbles this half-***ed plot with the rise-and-sorta-fall-and-OK thing with this pop group and what happens when Juliette Lewis' would-be evil music promoter gets her hands on them and after forming them into pop stars she makes Jem sign with her to go solo... because she's somehow so far more talented than the rest of the group(!) The idea is to emphasize the theme of togetherness of family, but the filmmakers go through the clichés of a group falling apart and coming back together in such a short span of time it doesn't mean anything. The conflict here is confounding and lame, and it leads up to a wholly, ridiculously unnecessary heist sub-plot involving objects that should NOT have to be stolen. And how do these objects work as they do in the movie? Jem and the Holograms is also cheap as hell, which is interesting given how this is from a major studio (Universal, mostly on a roll this year with mega-hits), and also from the same toy company that put out this show as well as Transformers and My Little Pony in the 80's. I think Corman put more money into Rock N Roll High School. I'd say it was a cash grab about the property of the cartoon, but were people clamoring for it? It's a cynical move that even involves just regular people - I doubt the YouTube commenters who are featured in the film were paid much less are actors - and if it didn't have this name and licensed piece of whatever then it would be at best on the Disney channel. So much of the movie either doesn't make sense, or features to keep people's attention the lamest pop music ever; I was pining for the days of Tiffany, it's that level of WTF.It's one thing to make a movie that panders to an audience. It's another thing to mess up which audience it's for and mess up the attraction part of it all. It's not even the Transformers for girls, it's too cheap for that (and distractingly so, notice the audiences for the Jem shows that is cheated to look bigger than it is). To put it another way, look how the actual NAME of the movie is crowbarred in at the very end. It's that level of monumental (if occasionally watchable) BS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meh and the Hollowgrams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure what the point of calling this Jem and the Holograms is. It bears no real connection to the fun '80s cartoon series. Instead, this is a boring and predictable teen drama that rips off everything from Hannah Montana to Earth to Echo. So you make a property based on an old cartoon and toy line and then proceed to alienate any viewers who might want to check it out for nostalgia's sake. On top of that, your movie kinda blows anyway so you can forget adding any new fans. The songs suck, the actors are forgettable, and the script doesn't have a single original idea. There's also this annoying YouTube crap that keeps popping up. I get it. You're trying to make a Jem for the generation that has such a thing as "YouTube popular." That's an idea that should have been killed in any of the pre-production meetings they undoubtedly had before this thing was made. It's a misfire from start to finish. It likely won't appeal to any of the fans of the original Jem and I can't imagine it will hold much appeal to any younger fans, excepting those who might be crushing on a couple of the actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Is An Outrage! Truly, Truly, Truly an Outrage!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just don't understand why the people who made this terrible movie would even bother calling it "Jem and the Holograms" if it's not going to resemble almost everything from the cartoons or from the IDW comic books. I mean, all it is to me, is just some generic, bubble-gum, behind-the-music, "rags-to-riches" story about some internet sensation getting a record deal over night by uploading a video on you-tube with only 3 million views?! Are you kidding me?! That's not how you-tube works!!!! Oh and slap in a pointless scavenger hunt with a fake-ass Wall-E/BB 8/Earth to Echo robot and call it "5.1N3RGY" or "Synergy" even though in the cartoons, Syngery is a highly-advanced super computer with a built-in artificial intelligence created by Jerrica and Kimber's father.But, what's really sad about this movie is that they didn't get Christy Marx, the creator and head writer of the Jem and the Holograms cartoons, involved as a consultant or as an executive producer for this movie. So, without her, the people who worked on this movie completely missed the point.Bad writing, bad direction, lack-lustering songs, save for a few, horrendous editing and the acting was alright. But, I feel like the cast of this movie should have gotten better movies than this one.If you're a true fan of "Jem and the Holograms", or if you have a teenage daughter, or relative and if you want to get them hooked into knowing about the franchise, just stick with the cartoons or go pick up an issue of the IDW comic books instead. But, stay as far away from this movie, period!!! "Show's Over, Synergy!!!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Came off like a bad TV movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Highly disappointing movie. I am a fan of the original Jem, yes, but I am also a teen and part of the target demographic of this monstrosity of a failure. Even if I look at it without comparing it to the original it's just overall bad. The plot was sloppy and cliché (often making no sense how they got from point A to point B), the characterization was poorly done and all over the place, and the dialogue was awkward. The story was much too rushed and was highly unlikely. Normally I'm fine with implausible stories in a fun, light-hearted sci fi about a pop star and her sisters, except they removed all the fun and sci fi and attempted to replace it with forced angst. The most accurate part of the movie was the fact that Rio is just as unlikable as he was in the 80s. If you're looking for a laugh, you came to the right place. If you want modern Jem, look to the comic book series because it is a 100% better reboot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>they literally raped the cartoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jem and Holograms" is just a bad, freakin move. I can't put it simpler than that.In case you're wondering, I grew up on the Hasbro produced cartoon int he 80's, it was great, cool songs, fun fashion and funky characters, and contrary to popular belief, they did tackle some issues, like drug abuse, post traumatic combat disorder, absentee fathers, love triangles, sexual identity, jealousy, etc. Damn good cartoon. All of this makes the movie such an incredible disappointment!Just on it's own this movie blows chunks, we start of with shaky cam, and we get this again and again. Then we are introduced to Jem, unfortunately Audrey Peeples has the charisma of a limp carrot. Sorry, but that hurts. What follows from director Chu, who apparently never met a scene he didn't like, is boring, boring and well, boring. There's no reason to care about this, the message goes against the very concept of the plot. Synergy, a rather cool holographic babe on the cartoon, is reduced to a cheesy looking 80's style robot from Kenner!! One horrendous scene has Jem and girls harmonizing for Rio, this develops into nothing,but goes on for like 20 minutes!!! Seriously this movie hurt my brain, it literally made me sick, it is the cinematic equivalent off root canal. Didn't anyone ever hear of editing!? 2hrs to tell this story !?!?!? SO much of this movie is WTF, but I did give it 3 or 10. Why u might ask? Juliette Lewis as Erica Raymond nails her character, she's spot on snarky and the only fun character in the flick. Plus there is a entertaining cameo that pops up in the middle of the credits. Alos,well they did get the names right...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Show's over, Synergy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It always amazes me when the big shots of Hollywood decide to adapt a popular property into a film and then change everything about it and expect the fans not to notice. "Jem and the Holograms" is yet another such cautionary tale, proving once again that for an industry whose job it is to figure out what people like, they can still be surprisingly clueless.For those who don't know, "Jem" was an unmistakably 80's cartoon about an all-female rock band fronted by two sisters, whose deceased father left them an insanely advanced computer that could produce realistic holograms which the heroine, Jerrica Benton, used to alter her appearance and live a double life as a world famous rock star. There was also a rival girl group called the Misfits who, with their unscrupulous manager, Eric Raymond, sought to unseat Jem from the top of the charts. I remember it being notable because of the fact that, despite being a show targeted towards girls, it seemed to connect with boys as well.OK, Now forget all that. Jerrica and her band are now foster teenagers, Eric Raymond is a woman who now owns the company that Jerrica originally owned, and is the mother of Jerrica's future boyfriend, Rio. Synergy has gone from a supercomputer to a tiny robot with missing pieces scattered all over Los Angeles County. Drummer Shana is no longer black. The Misfits do appear but only at the very end for a sequel hook. It comes off as more of a cross between "Hannah Montana" and "Earth To Echo." This movie tries too hard to be hip. Jerrica gets discovered through Youtube, and lip service is paid to twitter and instagram throughout the movie. I understand thinking a younger audience would be turned off by the big hair and gaudy costumes of the original but in doing so, they likely alienated older fans and the movie is so bland it failed to excite younger ones.This movie is also crippled by a woefully tight budget. Jem's live performances are in small clubs vainly dressed and shot to look bigger than they are. Footage of Jimmy Fallon, Duane Johnson, and Chris Pratt are used to emphasize Jem's fame but their quotes are obviously out of context and the editing is bungled horribly. One of the most baffling decisions is to use random Youtube clips for scene transitions, montages, and even in place of music cues or camera work to build tension. In other spots, Google Earth is used for location transitions and at one point they don't even hide the logo.The script is filled with odd plot twists and the characters frequently behave like idiots. For starters, these people have little understanding of the music business. Erica Raymond signs Jerrica after one viral video with a paltry 35K views in Jerrica's own house because who needs an office? Then Jerrica refuses to sign unless she can bring her band despite the fact that her bandmates are an unproven commodity and Erica actually acquiesces. Of course, evil Erica eventually seduces Jerrica to go solo out of desperation to save her aunt's mortgage and Jerrica just signs without going to her friends for help.The Synergy robot awakens upon arriving in LA and leads them on a wild goose chase for its missing parts just to give Jerrica a farewell video from her dad. Her dad is seen in flashbacks constantly doting on Jerrica but acting like her sister doesn't exist. Synergy's final missing part is Jerrica's star earrings which Erica has locked away in her office. Does she simply ask Erica for them? No, she decides to break in at night and steal them, not to mention the ridiculous deduction involved in figuring out they were the last piece. Finally, Rio just happens to find his father's will in the safe with the earrings naming him the owner of Starlight Records. Wouldn't the family lawyer have told him this already? The worst part is that this film has hardly any music. The cartoon managed to feature three songs in its half-hour episodes and didn't reuse them until years later. They weren't always good, but it couldn't have been worse than the bland tween pop featured here. There are only really three songs (four if you count the acapella on the pier with Rio) and the only one that even barely rises above mediocrity is "Youngblood." The performances are probably the best part of the movie though that's not saying much. Aubrey Peeples as Jerrica is OK, not great. The other girls do all right despite not having much of a character. Juliette Lewis gives the best performance mainly because, as the villain, she gets to have the most fun. The worst performance is from Kesha's brief cameo as Pizazz at the end. She tries to be wicked with her one big line, but mostly comes off looking stoned. I'm almost glad there won't be a sequel because she would likely ruin it.I really don't understand what they were thinking here. "Jem and the Holograms" is an insulting, poorly made cash grab that deserved better and the worst part is that movie studios will use its failure as a reason not to give it another shot. It's one of those movies that makes you wonder why they didn't just call it something else if they weren't going to be faithful to the source material. It's also one of those movies that makes you think it turned out the way it did because the studios feared a faithful adaptation wouldn't be successful, and maybe it wouldn't have been, who knows? It certainly couldn't have done worse than the (current) fourth lowest wide screen theater gross and getting yanked from theaters after two weeks, I know that.</fullReview>

Granted, the animation was simple, story was practically non-existent and the characters were so transparent that the adult me cried blood. But I had no idea that the movie people would do this.Jem and the Holograms the movie is like they dug Jem from her grave, put some ground meat on her using a duct tape and finally sprinkled glitter all over the corpse. Yes, it's that bad. And no, I'm not exaggerating.The only good thing about this movie is that we, who have seen it, can warn the others from watching it. Avoid the urge of clawing your eyes out and don't watch this. Also avoid getting your blood pressure skyrocketing by not watching this.Did I emphasize it enough? Don't. Waste. Your.

This movie has made me happier than I have been in years (it is sad that more people do not like this movie). Its story may seem simple a the character development a little predictable but this is a solid movie that moves me in a positive way. I hope that the cast and crew are PROUD of this movie and hope that more people discover this gem among so many "standard" Hollywood movies that have been coming out.

It was heart warming, fun, great music, and showed creative characters that teen girls can look up to. A clean, fun film that doesn't make me question if it's appropriate. This 39 year old loves the film. Great job with casting. Awesome tunes. So creative for today's young people. Good strong teen young ladies that are a great role-model today. Give it a chance and clear your mind if what your night think it should be. It's a good story about a family different from the "normal". Wooot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy homage to a classic series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up watching Jem the series in the '80's, so I did have certain expectations going into this. And while it wasn't everything I'd hoped for, there was enough of the original spirit left for me to recognize the things that I enjoyed so much about the series. There were a lot of changes to the original story, but that was to be expected, given that this movie was aimed at a new audience in a new millennium. This film has a good story with a lot of heart, some excellent music, and performers who worked hard to make this the best film they knew how to make. And at its heart, this movie has a message of inspiration, courage, strength, and perseverance for anyone who has something they want to share with the world. Like Jerrica says near the end, "We're all Jem."I heard that there might not be a follow-up and I am a little disappointed by that, since Erica's meeting with the Misfits all but promised one. Perhaps something in the made-for-cable category? Who knows? In any case, this is one film that should be viewed at least once before forming an opinion. You never know; it could be a diamond in the rough. Thank you for listening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let's talk about WALL-E... Er, I mean Echo... er, I mean Synergy, yeah that's the one. While I wasn't expecting this cute little robot to be THE Synergy, it did give Jerrica/Jem a tangible device to interact with on a more personal level rather than just a voice to talk to most the time. However, communication through the earrings would keep it discrete and subtle when Jerrica needed to talk to Synergy in moments where talking to the little robot would be awkward. All in all, I think if there is a sequel (please do make one), it would be cool if the girls found some kind of super computer (whether made by Jerrica's father or not) that the robot could be integrated with to create the Synergy that we remember (but the robot can stay, and give it a voice after integration too). I did like the "scavenger hunt" the girls went on.Second, let's talk about the songs. While none of the songs really grabbed me or spoke to me, they were close to the same quality as the show (maybe a little better). That being said, since they reminded me of the show, I'll have to say that I liked them and I for one think the singers vocals were really good.Third, the holograms, or lack thereof... this was a cool aspect of the show but not very prominent in the movie, would like to see more in the sequel (yes, even the girls costumes). With the added power of the super computer it could be done with ease.Lastly, the girl's ages. Though not a big deal to me, I think they were too young. I don't remember what the girl's ages were in the show but they looked older than the ones in the movie. The Misfits looked about the right age though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great family movie you miss due to the critics...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I am over 40 with some pretty old fashion music sense. I didn't watch Jem, maybe an episode or two.... I watched Transformers and GI Joe, but I sort of knew the characters. Well, we missed this in theaters last year and finally rented it over the weekend. My kids have been biting at the bit to see this, so we did. I have to admit, I thought this was a wonderful family made origin story for an update on the Jem idea. The girls (eventually Rio) helping Jem solve the robot's puzzle had the mystery energy of the old cartoon. Many of the outfits were reminiscent of the cartoon's style too. The whole idea used using internet viral videos was pretty neat, considering this whole "ME" era of our country currently in this very hi-tech and very selfish times. Yet, Jem's viral music video was different, and her FAME helped give others a very inspirational type of not just viral fame, but a positive energy helping others 'feel better' not found in any other movies. The music, while admit, not very memorable, had energy and was enjoyable to listen to. Wish the music had been a little more.... Bubblegum Crisis style to it... or use some of the music from the old cartoon, did they? I have no idea. But it was good. Finishing the robot was not the real main plot, but in a way it was... the plot revolved around Jem and her band. They fall out, and eventually get all back together again due to an interesting twist. This leads me to the ending. Wow. The majority of the people that either, failed to see the movie due to the trailer, or failed to see the ending, really missed the end to the end. The Misfits DO fit into the plot. They WERE there prior to Jem's rise to fame (we just don't see that part). And the ending leads to a possible sequel, I guess we're just not going to see... I would have LOVED to see the Misfits modern techno music go against the more funk/rock of the Jem &amp; the Holograms. If I was a betting man, I bet they were going for a trilogy... and all we've seen is their origin story. Origin for Jem's band and the Misfits origin... unfortunately we're not going to see a sequel. Where it could very well spurned more meat &amp; potatoes from the original cartoon stories with both bands in play in the sequel and a possible all-out cat fight. All girls, all music, mystery and a rise to fame. Jem, it's not a bad movie if you watch it. Or you can be in the other camp, and say it's bad, not see it because in your mind you 'know' its bad and critique it before even seeing it. Which tends to be the norm today and the easiest way to destroy good family movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They ruined Jem for everyone. Other then name Jem nothing in the movie was about Jem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so excited about the movie as i loved the series growing up and was excited to see it brought to the big screen. But the movie while in itself is not that bad the problem is they took the name Jem and the holograms and just made a movie using almost nothing from the series. While i knew it would be brought in the 21st century and not the totally outrageous 80s i still had high hopes. Had they made this exact movie and just used some name and created this girl group it would likely not have bombed as bad. The problem was they hyped it and had all of us Jem fans and they could have helped sales of the DVD because people coming to the movie never knowing Jem they would have gone to watch the original series.. The movie just was not that great the acting was so so. The story line had nothing to do with the cartoon series at all. And yes i know this is not the first time they have taken a 80s cartoon and brought to the big screen. GI JOE while i think that movie was better it still missed allot of the cartoon and what made it great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's pretty easy to spot the industry reviews here. Took my niece and nephew over the weekend to see this one and afterwards they told me that they would have rather stayed home and been forced to do cleaning chores around their house for 2 hours. It simply amazes me how God awful some kids movies like this one can turn out to be. They have to be paying the actors minimal scale. There didn't seem to be any vision or direction with the script in this one. Seems like they were trying too hard to make the 80s out to be even more cheesier than it needed to be. The acting was terrible in this one. I would not waste your time or money going to see this. It isn't even worthy of watching as a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Quality Girl power Movie with Heart UNDERRATED</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly was blown away by the directing, acting, and interactions of emotions, characters, and even a decent plot and story. The music was even likable. Jem is an unconventional movie that dares to take chances and it actually works. Jem taught me that we are just too used to formulas and stereotypes. Being a guy that generally hates chick flick/ girl power type movies this movie holds on its own. Way to go to the actresses in this that made this movie actually realistic and believable. The main actress that plays Jerrica is very well cast and doesn't overdo her character. She brings a real maturity to it that's hard to do in this kind of setting. Jem is dramatic dynamite ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bad story writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerrica Benton (Aubrey Peeples) and her sister Kimber (Stefanie Scott) are orphans. At the age of ten, they moved in with their Aunt Bailey (Molly Ringwald) in California, and her foster girls Shana (Aurora Perrineau) and Aja (Hayley Kiyoko). Jerrica misses her father who called her Jem and left her with the small robot Synergy. Shy Jerrica makes a video of her singing. Kimber uploads it as Jem without Jerrica's knowledge and it becomes a viral hit. Aunt Bailey faces dire money trouble. Jerrica signs with Erica Raymond (Juliette Lewis) of Starlight Productions insisting on keeping her sisters. She falls for Erica's son Rio but Erica doesn't have her best interest in mind.The positive is that the young actresses are perfectly fine. The problems have very little to do with any of them. This is almost entirely due to the bad writing. I never watched the cartoon but I understand it does not resemble this movie. I expected something bad after the critical panning but I hoped for simply bland. It starts off bland with a standard script. Juliette Lewis is unappealing. Then the movie starts piling on the problems. The robot is far too advanced to be made so long ago. The scavenger hunt is excessive nonsense. The Youtube cuts lower the cinematic value. The performances and songs are unremarkable. This movie would be a lot better by simplifying into something more traditional. The other option is to stick to the cartoon. The plot is simply badly written.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the Jem I fell in love with</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK finally found a site to watch that jem movie and FFS I must have been in a tree bc it was full of sap. protip: watch it on a food coma bc you'll need it to cope. so much was wrong with it. Jem was everything but.She was awkward, iffy, and not near as ballsy,Jem is NOT AN AWKWARD TEENAGER!! the whole "starlight music" thing was ass backwards from the story, and synergy was an aiboo on meth. Just a fancy projector that they needed to get random pieces to put together when the original story synergy was already there? Also the whole putting some "youtube" clips was just cheap and screams desperation. Also the YT uploading process does not work the way they depicted, the characters were completely off and thrown together. It was messy and meh. This would have worked as a standalone under another name, however when they tried to put Jem into it it failed miserably On the positive side the music was kinda nice, the vibe was kinda cool, and the record label exec's son was kinda cute. But that's it. The original Jem vibe wasn't present in any capacity, however. This made me cry bc they ruined my childhood on this and they should have never had the rights to use the name.Rating 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jem and the hologram is a first-rate write-off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still find it hard to believe that my best scene in the film comes after a few seconds into the end credits. More so because I believe that the studio had plans for sequels -that scene says it all. And it even becomes annoying because this other bunch of singers Erica tries to recruit are more interesting than the film's main-making this setup for a sequel-that-would-never-happen attention-grabbing.Normally in films, actors are just supposed to play their part and let the audience decide if they feel pity or loathing for the roles they are trying to fit into. Usually, I squirm when there are visible attempts to elicit emotion from me; be it sympathy or disgust. It only just induces apathy on my own part. And Jem and the Hologram strives continually, with feeble results to draw out compassion from its audience. Still, no matter the number of minutes Jerrica spends in front of her camcorder recounting her life experience, travails and fears- I felt nothing for her. Nothing, nothing at all!Plot wise, the film revolves around four coming-of-age girls (sisters) who are a band, with Jem (Jerrica) as the lead singer. She becomes famous after a video of her singing is released into the internet and goes viral. The film is based from a 1980s Hasbro cartoon of the same name. Analysing the story, we can conclusively say it's terrible especially in the third act. But there are tints of a if-not-good, then mediocre-at-best story behind all the pity-me narrative and face-to-the-audience monologue. It's simple. First, remove that hologram-robot figure that sorts of serves as Jem's entourage. Second, scratch all that time wasted on Jerrica-to- audience monologue or even that of her fans. It's redundant. Jerrica bemoans of her desire to let people see her, yet there is no concrete basis of that entire soft core whining. No proper context for the audience relation to her character! Then after the first two actions, make it a clichéd rag-to-fame story if the writers are devoid of ideas. But then, we still have to deal with elements in the film that can be easily predicted or those so stupid you can't help but say it. What's up the romance with that Erica's character alleged son? It's unnecessary. That would have filled up time in a sequel. Then, there comes the issue of inheritance and whatnot. In fact, there are so many wrongs to this- it would be a waste of time listing it out. But most notably, is how the supporting characters are not properly developed---- more like a screen parade. Jem and the Holograms is worth your while in the perspective of what-could-have-been in reference to that end scene. I still believe that if proper changes are made to the plot, provided a sequel is made-the end results would be better. That I can probably guarantee. But this.... is a woefully failed attempt to make an all-girl-band, female empowerment and discovery film. A first-rate write-off</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really enjoyed this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, yes I'm a 30-something year old person, yes I did wake up on Saturday mornings as a child to watch Jem and The Holograms, yes I have also indulged in re-watching those same episodes streaming through Netflix. I was impressed with the movie. I know it's not exactly like the cartoon, but this movie was done very well. Unfortunately I do not have children, but I would have enjoyed watching this with my young daughter. The characters, the plot, and the music all very good. I was especially inspired by the music. I rented Everest and Jem and The Holograms, and had to pay for an extra night with Everest because I wanted to watch Jem and The Holograms again. I thought it was a feel good movie, and since I'm a bit of an old schooler, I will buy this movie on DVD. Definitely enjoyed the movie, and wish others liked it as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERSYea so its not like the 80s cartoon, It may not be the same plot line like the cartoon but at least it has the same characters.. I hope they can give this movie a second chance if there is a sequel. Since they added the Misfits at the end. But then again its just my opinion.I believe it was meant to be a film for family to watch and enjoy, and to not look at the negatives even though most of the people who watched it are furious by the fact that its nothing like the TV show. I rate it a 7-10 because the acting was pretty great and so were the songs... I think if they advertised it a little more it could've done better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needs a Sequel...Here's Why:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off, I agree with a few other reviews that it could have been better, sticking to the Hasbro's cartoon series plot.The original plot was great without having to tweak or change anything, even though making Jem into an ordinary girl is a nice touch. Also making the main antagonist into a woman which I think is more appropriate (seems to fit better). Which also makes the reason for Rio to be Erica's son make perfect sense. Which helps to understand why Erica wants to take revenge on Jerrica, beyond the fact that she lost Starlight. Yet it would have been nice to see Rio as the way he is in the series, not knowing Jerrica's other persona Jem, thinking that they are two different people and seeing how Jerrica handles their relationship.What really got me interested was the last scene with Erica and The Misfits. I would definitely look forward to see a sequel with Kesha and her band, with a more solid story line.Overall music was good. I'm not sure I understood why (too many) people were talking about Jem via Instagram and videos of people making music were put in through the end.My opinion, I would love to see a sequel, hopeful learning from the first movies issues and making something great (since there is still a lot of potential and story line still to be used). Jem and the Holograms plus The Misfits...very interesting. Hope they try to redeem themselves by making this sequel that they left us hanging with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie destined to be a cult classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of the TV show from back in the 80's and I loved this movie! I think they made a great film with a very small budget and I would love nothing more than to see a sequel. If the film takes off on home video, here's hoping it becomes a cult classic like I think it will be one day.Aubrey Peeples has a great voice and was a good choice to play Jem. Aja is great with her tech (and a total bad ass!), Shana brings the fashion to the glitter and fame and Kimber steals the show with her song and video. Not to mention super hot Ryan Guzman as Rio. Yum.Casting Molly Ringwald should please fans of 80's rat pack movies. Juliette Lewis as Erica Raymond is deliciously evil, while Nathan Moore as Zipper is hilarious. There are lots of great cameos from new actors like Ryan Hansen and Nicholas Braun that add memorable funny moments, too.The editing of this film is quite unique as it juxtaposes real you tube footage with scenes in the movie. Nice work! I'm not sure if this technique has been used anywhere else, but I loved it! Have an open mind and enjoy this film for what it is: a low-budget, modern interpretation of an 80's classic with a lot of heart. Unfortunately, this film was severely bashed by the supposed 'true' fans of the TV show since the first trailer emerged, but I know that, in time, people will come around to it. This isn't Kubrick or Scorsese, but it shouldn't be, either. This is a fun film meant to be enjoyed by old and new fans alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good film; Needs to be re-released NOW.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was waiting with high expectations for this movie, but couldn't find a theatre. Eventually I got to see it by extraordinary means. I felt quite satisfied after watching it. The film is a 'very good' contemporary adaptation of the original series by any standard. Not 'excellent' for middle aged men like myself, but particularly 'excellent' for little boys and girls. Nonetheless, the film can make a grown man, especially if he has a daughter, cry 'like a little- boy'.This was probably the most 'feel good movie of the 2015'. There were many excellent roles for women. All of the actors are well chosen, and the characters are memorable. There was a humanitarian emphasis in the plot as well, though slightly different from the original series.The music is very catchy but not overly pretentious.The story works through an exposition of right and wrong in a manner that matches the original series- it has a moral. There is also a lot of media literacy built into the plot, and this is relevant and timely. As a fan of the original series, this update is very good, and though it makes a few changes, it was loyal. Any change from the original is definitely respectful, and some of these changes lead to the most touching moments of the film.The roles were all quite difficult, involving the mix of dance, song and acting, but seamless performances and excellent direction made this innovative plot work like magic.I saw many of the big films of 2015- this movie is in my top three for 2015. I enjoyed it far more than the recent Abrams-Disney-Lucas blockbuster.I think the film needs to be re-released in the next month or two. It has a lot to offer, and it deserves to be the beginning of a trilogy.I know time will change the rating, but the ridiculously low rating makes me question the value of IMDb ratings, or whether the movie is being sabotaged by Hollywood insiders. Was it a failure of marketing? Did some Hollywood person need little girls to remain media illiterate? I think the movie needs to be re-released!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a 36 year old male and did watch the show back in the 80s along with G.I.Joe and Transformers. Unfortunately, I didn't get to see it in theaters since only one theater showed it for one time slot and it was pulled after two weeks. The day it came out on DVD/Blu-Ray, I went to my local Target and bought it, even with all the negative reviews and such. My wife and I sat down and watched it and absolutely loved it. She and I collect the IDW comic book series that is more like the cartoon than the movie. We both felt that the movie had a positive and great message. Yeah, the movie had a few differences from the cartoon, but you need to have a worldwide audience. There was enough in the movie that gave nods to the cartoon that should have made fans of the original happy.I'm a die hard Transformers fan and I love all the live-action movies even though they are different from the original. I can accept that. But so many fans can't accept change and in Jem and Hologram's case, I think the new change was for the better.I felt that there just wasn't enough to promote the movie. Just suddenly, a Jem and the Holograms movie. There was no cartoon on television and as far as I know, re-runs of the original weren't being played. There was no merchandise at stores or toys to get people interested. It was just poorly promoted and advertised and I just don't understand why Universal or Hasbro didn't get the word out for this movie. I do hope they make a sequel. I loved all the actors in the film and they leave it wide open for a sequel anyways.Jem and the Holograms in TRULY OUTRAGEOUS!!!Please rent this movie! Or buy it like I did! Tell your friends how good this movie is and maybe their friends will tell others and so on!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why all the hate for pretty good movie? Spoilers inside.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually liked the movie and I can't fathom on why there is so many 1 and 2 stars. It's a movie about a shy girl and her 3 sisters (2 are adopted/foster) trying to help save their family and their home. There is some good original songs and music. It's a good clean movie that you can watch with your whole family. Which is rarity now a days. Though the script is pretty predictable, I think the target audience of teen girls wouldn't see most of it coming. Overall is kind of feels like Glee, a clean Lady Gaga and Coyote Ugly mixture. And by that I mean, it has the "Be who you are. Do what you want. Become whatever you dreamed about" type message.Most of the acting is pretty good. But Juliette Lewis' acting was really bad. She was way over the top. If you seen Josie and the Pussycats, she would be perfect with Alan Cummings character. Where this movie actually tries to be kind of realistic/possible. It's like she was thinking it's was like the 80's cartoon. The camera switching back and forth from Jerrica narrating to the actual movie was overdone. They could of done that at the beginning and at the end and I think the movie would of flowed better. I get that they were trying to have that video blog / you-tube feel. But it takes away from the actual movie. Which also brings up the length, it's nearly 2 hours long! There was plenty of scenes that could of been trimmed back or deleted. And would of made for a lot better paced movie. Spoilers below: I found it enjoyable on how they made Jem an actually believable story. A You-Tube sensation that gets grabbed up by a corrupted music exec. Though I was disappointed that they ditched the whole hologram angle. The part that got me though, was that Synergy didn't activate until she returned to Los Angeles. Then Jerrica has to do a treasure hunt. So her dad leaves a touching message but Jerrica would never of seen it if she never went back to LA. What if she never went back? What kind of father would do all of that work to simply leave a hologram saying he loved her? They really dropped the ball on that plot line. They need to edit the movie, trim out 30 minutes of Jerrica talking to the camera. Tone down Juliette Lewis' acting. Then re-release it, and ADVERTISE it. It's like the movie tested bad in focus groups and they decided to forgo editing and advertising. I saw 0 commercials for it's release. Bottom line. If you like a clean positive message movie with good original music. Then you'll enjoy this. It reminded me a lot of Coyote Ugly. But without the bar and with campy 80's outfits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A diamond in the rough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The imagination that was caught by my sister as a child when Jem came out on television back in 1985 was amazing. She wanted to be her and like the movie I got to see the same reaction in my daughter. I knew if the movie was good by her reaction she would give me a thumbs up and how some of the cast were seen in other movies that she has seen before drove her nuts. Aubrey Peeples did a stupendous job as Jerrica Benton aka Jem. She had the look and the appeal of the character of the 1980's bringing in a new Jem to this day and age. The story line was well done and Ryan Guzman from Step Up did an excellent job as Rio. This movie might have been better coming out on Television versus the theaters because of the reintroduction of the character. In my opinion the movie was fun, exciting,and it was great to see my daughter enjoy the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few movies that parents can have no problems letting their teens watch over and over. Terrific message.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I always knew you'd go viral." Jerrica (Peeples) and her sisters are very close but are in danger of being split up. After a YouTube video made by her goes viral she is approached by music executive Erica Raymond (Lewis) the girls think their problems are over, little do they know they are just beginning. This is a hard movie to review. I am a 37 year old man and I have a 12 year old daughter. I open with that because had this been just me watching it I would have probably shut it off 20 minutes in. My daughter loved it and was hooked from the beginning. That said, the message of this movie is excellent and anyone with a teen, boy or girl, will appreciate it. That message is really the reason to watch and makes the movie better and worth watching for that reason alone. Overall, made for teen girls, and one of the few movies made for that group that parents can have no problems letting them watch over and over. Terrific message. I give this a B, for that reason, my daughter gave it an A.</fullReview>

I am hoping for a sequel and it set it up for one. Don't be fooled by the low box office and the low rating. There was a lot of haters cause it didn't match the cartoon perfectly.

I love that they cut to YouTube videos of music and incorporated it into the movie. It was awesome how they showed the Instagram videos of their their fans. I really liked the message in this movie.

		<shortDescription>This is not the Jem, you know and love, but it's a good movie though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Warning here, For everyone that wants to watch the movie without knowing any secrets, you might want to skip this review, and for the one's that are looking for a reason to watch the movie.I just finished watching Jem and the Holograms. I've known for a very long time now, that Hollywood has taken another well written story, and destroyed it, to make their own. Usually, they fail every time, and never learn from their mistakes. This is Jem and the Holograms in name only, all the characters, and music is different then the original.This is probably the only chance Jem and the Holograms will have to come to life, and they threw that chance away. They basically lied to the fans, got their hopes up, and now both the fans, and the movie are paying for it.That said, it's a good movie. Just not what we paid for. __Knowing that this wasn't the Jem we dreamed of, I scrapped all those dreams, and watched this movie with a open mind for what they tried to make, and not for what I wished it was. I had a great deal of time to prepare myself to do that.This film apparently only cost $5 Million to make, which is pretty cheap for a movie. If they were more open with the fans about lack of holograms, or other things, or if they planned for the next film to bring the real Jem and the Holograms to life, the first time they battle The Misfits, and this movie was just the creation of Jem and the Holograms, and the magic is still to come, then this movie would have probably done a great deal better in theaters. Instead it bombed. They could still bring Jem and the Holograms to life, if their is still one more piece they need to find to complete Synergy, to create real Holograms. But I have my doubts that they will do this.For the lack of money, it was done well.Spoilers ahead.Things they could have done to make this movie better.1. I think Jem should have secretly made a few dozen music videos, and Kimber should have secretly been putting them online. This should have been shown in the movie, and gave the feel of a natural building of a fan base, that started to get huge numbers, then the attention of the media, and finally forcing Kimber to reveal what she had been doing. Instead, the movie makes it seem like just one music video can make you a super star. Personally, I didn't think that one song was that good, and I didn't think her voice sounded that good for this song. So, it breaks the belief that she got famous from just this.2. Erica Raymond is a really unlikable character, and felt fake. They show no back story for her, and there is no evidence, that she deserves to be such a big shot. Eric Raymond was much better, and much smarter character, and he fit the part better, and made you believe he belonged where he was.3. Their first concert was good though, the song was good, and how they showed their real talent, in the end, was good, makes you believe they deserve to be there.4. Spoiler here, Erica forces Jem to go solo, and for some reason doesn't explain this to her sisters, they find out and instantly leave Jem feeling all alone. This felt unnatural, to abrupt. Jem is doing this to save her Aunt's house, their home. So, she has to suck it up and perform. She cleans up her makeup, and walks out into the crowd, and starts singing. This is the best song in the movie. She really seemed to deserve the fan adoration, she really felt like a star here, more so, than any other time in the movie.The flaw here, they should have shown flashes of her doing many of these performances, struggling with the loss of her sisters, feeling alone, and showing her Aunt's house being saved, because of her efforts, instead, after just one supposed performance, her sisters forgive her. This feels again, unnatural, and to abrupt. But you're glad that they are back together.Conclusion: I really liked this movie for what it was. But they could have added like 10mins, filling in the back story of making her a you tube star, and also, showing her struggling with being alone, and away from her sisters, while doing her solo career, to save her Aunt's house. I think it would have grounded this movie more in reality, made it feel more real, instead, in some parts it felt unnatural, and a bit abrupt.I love the original series. I've watched it many times. I watched the series, from the first time it aired on TV, when it only got like 10mins a week, and had to share it's time slot with 2 other cartoons.Try to watch this movie with a open mind, with the understanding, that this is a completely different take on these characters, story, and music. It's worth watching IMO, anyway. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why everyone hates this movie! sure its not exactly like the cartoon but i don't think that it was meant to be that way. in my opinion i think that the director wanted to create a modern version of Jem and the holograms to help us connect it to our lives in the more modern world. being a fan of the Jem cartoon, i thought this was a great way to re- introduce Jem and the holograms to the world. while watching the film, i was brought back to when i was much younger and had a dream of becoming a world wide sensation and inspired me to follow my heart. this was an amazing film to watch and i hope that a second film will be created! i know most of the people who will read won't agree with me but just remember this is my opinion, not yours. have a nice day:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very well made inspiring movie that adults need to stop breaking down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although many say that this movie is absolutely terrible. I disagree, mostly all the reviews have been made by people in there mid 30's who obviously are still worrying about a childhood cartoon that is loosely based off of the movie, not an identical match to what the cartoon was. So all you angry 30 year old's need to just focus on your bingo and Sudoku because obviously this movie wasn't made to please you. The age range for this was made for young teens. sorry that this movie didn't fit you're needs but seriously this has awesome music, good acting, and an AMAZING story line that can really go somewhere. To conclude I would like to say that this movie inspired me as a person like the cartoon did for you. Young teens now want to be just like Jem and you 80's kids are stopping that. They altered the movie a ton to make it more interesting for today's young teens/teens. This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life. As I was walking out of the movie theater I was already downloading the soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this even after it got pulled from the theatres. I was pleasantly surprised at how fun and quirky the movie was. Loved the soundtrack. Not sure why this got pulled to be honest. I've seen worse movies that did fairly well at the box office. This is definitely worth watching if it gets released on DVD or Bluray. It doesn't hold true to the 80s cartoon its based on, but neither do a lot of the remakes. The musical performances were very good, and the story has a very good and deep meaning to it. So if you have some time over the holidays, go and watch this Jem of a movie :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jem and the Holograms was one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life, and so far it's currently my top pick for 2015.It really does hit your heart with open-minded messages: fame is never good and always comes with the consequences.My 8 year old daughter fought back against her leash, but by the time the movie ended, her opinions had changed. She totally loved it and she wanted it on Blu Ray instantly. Obviously though, it's not out on Blu Ray yet which really upset her. Just goes to show how good it was!My favorite part was the acting. We've got some really good performances here and I can tell these actors/actresses are upcoming mega-hitters!Go see Jem and the Holograms and your money will be in safe hands for a sequel, and boy, do you want a sequel after watching this! AMAZING! People who hate it are clearly sinners who don't understand the messages. You want blood and death, really? NO! This is 2015, and with feminism up and coming in the world, I think this shows really strong political values!It's okay to be yourself! You are a woman and proud! These men don't need you!Come into the light away from these Star Wars nonsense alien rubbish movies! Jem and the Holograms opens up a new path for strong women into the future of 2016!Thanks.~TurnYourWeaponsToSnow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was super cute, very funny in places, and I was really surprised by the acting, the acting was incredible. The music was fun! I could definitely see the cartoon inspiration. Don't go into the movie theatre expecting the cartoon, it was loosely inspired by it, but it paid a lot of homages to it. Molly Ringwald was in it (love her), Juliette Lewis was in it (incredible actress), and Ke$ha has the most BADASS cameo in the post credits that really sets this movie up for an incredible sequel. I'm praying to the glamor, glitter, fashion, fame and pink Gods to get a sequel. (wait a little bit while the credits are rolling, the post credit scene is to die for.) I will be devastated if this doesn't get a sequel. Don't believe the haters who've been bagging on this film by calling it a Hannah Montana knock off. It is far from it. Also, for a movie about holograms with a budget of only $5,000,000, I was very impressed. GIVE IT A CHANCE! I will be seeing this movie again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with mid level expectations. I'm the type of person to give anything a chance if I call myself a fan of what it's based on. Jem is one of those instances. I grew up on Jem and have loved every aspect since I was a small child and my sister brought it home, by mistake, for me from the video store. This movie was a glorious surprise for me, it had everything I wanted and if anybody is a fan of marvel comics, think of this movie as Jem's "ultimate" universe. A modern refashioning of something classic with a great potential to be amazing and in my opinion it succeeded in being amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think I'd like it because it changed so much from the 80's cartoon it was based on. I gave it a shot and took my 10 and almost 12 year old nieces to see it. We all loved it. Sure it's not the 80's cartoon accurate Jem and the Holograms movie all of its fans wanted but it is a good movie and has the great message that Jem had of believing in your self and not giving up. The music is good and the after the credits scene is giving a hope for a sequel life. Molly Ringwald as Aunt Bailey is amazing so is Juliette Lewis as Erica Raymond. I liked it so much that I'm going Thursday to go see it again. I'm going to pre order it on DVD on amazon and get the soundtrack from them also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New imagining of a Crazy Cartoon Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying I love the Jem franchise. Since I was a kid, Jem has always been in my life. When I heard there was a movie in the making, my excitement was palpable. Finally got to see "Jem" last night and I was not disappointed. It's a wonderfully fresh take on the Jem universe with real life scenarios- not time travel and the misfit felonies of the 80's. Even though there isn't a Rockin' Roadster or that one Felony where The misfits kidnap Jem or that one time the President is kidnapped and Jem saves him, the movie truly holds the Heart of Jem and the Holograms. Sisterhood, self reliance, and rad music. Loved the movie from start to finish- from seeing the girls argue the first time to the end credits with a fabulous surprise. It was moving and endearing at all the right parts. And can I just say how fabulous Molly Ringwald looks?! I won't mention the numerous nods to the original cartoon-- too many to count and made me so stoked as a fan. Go see this movie for great music, fun adventure and self-discovery in a tween/young adult vein. It's Truly Outrageous!!</fullReview>

Jem Rocks!! They really amazed this Jem fan! Any Jem fan as a child will really enjoy this movie. It really rocks and might just be in the top 3 on Monday.

		<fullReview>This movie was actually very true to the original cartoon. My review does contain a spoiler. The plot of the movie actually followed the plot of the first few episodes of season 1 very closely. In the original cartoon Jerrica is running a home for foster kids along with Kimber, Aja, and Shana. It's going broke. She needs cash. And she's lost control of her company to Eric Raymond. (The movie's villain, Erica Raymond, basically acts exactly like Eric did?which made her a great villain).Fortunately, they find Synergy, launch Jem and the Holograms, play a concert and save the day. A few seasons later the band briefly breaks up because Jem is getting all of the attention and being treated like a solo act?and Jem is letting herself be treated like a solo act. She has to get out there and fix it. Again, this happens in the movie.Jem goes through the movie with a great deal of agency. It all had the classic Jem spirit. I was able to sit through the film going: "Yep, that happened in the cartoon, and that happened, and that happened?"Give it a chance. You might be pleasantly surprised if you are a fellow JtH fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read a few reviews before this film came out and they were all wrong. It's a nice take on the cartoon. I wouldn't change it for some cheesy 80's perm and spandex flick. This movie feels like its messages come from the heart. The actresses were all excellent. Their outfits were all cool and respectable looking. Back in the day, I watched the Jem and the Holograms cartoons with my younger sister, they were on after my G.I.Joe and Thundercats. Yesterday, decades later, I went to see it with my young daughter. She loved it, wants it on DVD and I was pleasantly surprised at the emotion and acting conveyed to the audience. I give it a 10, for all those premature whiners out there, who judged this movie from the very first trailer. Quality family entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has a good theme and the plot causes one to reflect upon what one would do in a similar situation in life. It is not only thought-provoking but also entertaining. It has a good balance of likable and unlikable characters. There are serious moments as well as comedic situations and sentimental moments. The movie points out that one has to make hard decisions in life, sacrifices in life (whether good or bad) and it really causes one to look at one's own value system. A question that one will eventually face in life is how far am I willing to go or what am I willing to sacrifice in order to achieve success or fame or one's life goal? Is what was important to me at one time worth sacrificing to in order to go to the next phase?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This isn't your old school Jem. So get over it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't compare it to the old Jem then this movie is awesome. I think it was smart to take an icon from the past where us parents know but make it relatable to the younger generation. I think it had a valuable message to give the kids without sexualizing everything. It really shows how social networking and the Internet generation works. It is a positive message about being yourself no matter what and how family is forever. I think this movie and the idea went over people's heads. It is not a hard concept to understand why they did the story this way. If you want the old Jem go watch the cartoons and stop hating on a great movie with an outstanding message. I would definitely recommend preteens and teens to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe all these negative reviews! Yes it was cheesy but of course it was, haven't you all seen the cartoon?! The movie is a modern take on the original cartoon but I think it works well. Having watched the original cartoon again as an adult with my daughter I have come to realize it's essentially a wacky 80s soap opera. The cartoon is awesome but would make for a really weird movie, and maybe not weird in a good way. The modern storyline is quite clever and all the major elements of Jem are there but most importantly it has the same lovely message of sisterhood and believing in yourself!! As a Jem fan since childhood I wasn't disappointed at all and I loved all the celebrity cameos!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been a good film -- watch the 1st and 3rd acts. Mild spoiler.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, if you were not a fan of the TV series, then pay no attention to all the 'this is not like the original Jem' hate. This is a complete reboot (like Batman or Spiderman) and should be judged only on its own merits--which are many, including fast pacing and some good music. Second, though Juliette Lewis is great, her cartoonish, super-bogus music-producer villain character is the big problem with this movie. The whole second act, from when Lewis as 'Erica Raymond' shows up to when Jem starts to rebel against her, is terrible. We see from the first moment that Erica is the villain and we see where things are headed -- no suspense, no fun, just squirming. For Erica to work, her character should look like a good guy at first, and the audience should realize only gradually, along with the girls, that she is evil. The only other problem with the movie is that it is earnest and sweet and heart-warming. SO, if you are not allergic to sweet and earnest, then watch the beginning, and when you see where things are going (painful), skip ahead to the third act -- it's fun to see Jem and friends getting back to themselves.</fullReview>

But the singing was really nice. The explanation of synergy has no relation to the original show. The ending also seemed a little rushed as suddenly there is a final summation. This was definitely a feel good movie and my daughter really enjoyed it but definitely would say rent it. I look forward to seeing more stuff from peeples.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of the cartoon, I was thrilled beyond measure when I heard that it was going to get a live action movie. Then as information started to come out I jumped on the "gonna hate it" bandwagon. I did not see it in theaters and hesitated once it was available to watch outside of theaters. I now have to admit I was wrong. If you watch the movie and don't try to compare every little thing to the source material it is not that bad. It has it's flaws with the story, but the pacing was good. The music was fun and even sounded a bit like how I remember the TV series, yet more modern. The usage of faux social media inter-cut into the movie was a little gimmicky but it works and the message is a good one. Overall I just have to admit that I liked it. It's not going to win any awards, but I might just watch it again some day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching the cartoon series Jem on Saturday mornings. I have the complete DVD collection, so I know the cartoon history of the show. This movie failed to follow it. First, the main "villian" was Eric Raymond, not Erica. Second, Synergy in the cartoon looked like a giant organ, and projected itself to look like a female. This version looked like a reject R2D2. Third, the rest of the band were made up of girls who were adopted by Jerrica's father, and were not delinquents (as the film portrays when running from cops). Rio in the cartoon was not related to Eric(a) Raymond at all, and were closer to same age. Plus cartoon Rio was not a singer. The people who made this flop of a movie obviously didn't do research. Some things should not be re-invented. Classics should be left alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My angry rant on Jem and the Holograms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jem and the holocaust is one of the most annoying piece of sh*t film making I've seen since Home Alone 4. The whole movie tries so hard to be inspiring, uplifting and mainstream, but it fails on doing that and it just came off embarrassing. I also have to comment on is how freaking unrealistic the movie is, I mean how Jem gets famous is so freaking stupid. She makes an ordinary, unoriginal and just by the books YouTube video of herself singing (Just like everyone else on YouTube), but suddenly over night she becomes a smash hit, everyone loves her and shes going to be on TV, even when the video itself was alright and very basic with nothing special or even famous worthy about the video, but nope, in this movies dumb logic that's what it takes. I'm not joking, that's what happens in this movie and it annoyed the crap out of me, just because the movie acts like this stuff happens in real life when it doesn't, I mean it took Justin Bieber awhile to get famous and he had to work hard for it. Another thing that made this movie truly awful is how the movie tries to have a "message" about today's music, because the main characters talk about how music today has lost it's touch and how generic it is, and somehow they music is going to bring the music we love back on it's feet, but this is where the movie really shoots itself in the foot, because the music is this movie is some of the most generic, soulless, bland and just a rip-off of other pop artists that we have right now. This movie has the balls to call today's songs "generic", even when the music is this movie might be ten times more generic or worst. The movie acts like it has a point even when it doesn't, it's atrocious and came off pretty pretentious when it came to the "message". I can't imagine people listening to this music and call it "good". This is the type of music that 10 minute year old babies will enjoy. The character's are bland, the acting is sh*t and the music is so generic. I feel so bad for the fans of the original Jem for witnessing such a train wreck like this. Overall Jem and the Holocaust (And yes, I'm still calling it that), is just atrocious, awful and unspeakable. Everything in this movie failed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of course it was a flop... Jem is a silly little series of mistakes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the first trailer came out, it get me hooked... The rise and fall of a young pop-star, that started with a video that went viral and signed with a major label... Sounded cool...I wasn't aware that it was inspired or adapted from a 80's cartoon... But it probably wouldn't make any difference... Jem and the Holograms is a miss in many ways...The beginning with the vlogs were pretty nice... It made sense... Then it pulled the presentation of the characters, which as also fine... And came that moment they start to harmonize together, that sounded silly, but in some way made think that it is pretty cool... They were fighting, out of tune and then they start to harmonize and realize that they are fine together... Sounded silly but I'm not heartless... And then came the trouble with money, with felt so forced, like "Okay, we need put a problem in the point... Oh, I got it! Money problems!"... Unnecessary at some point... Then they decide to make a video-clip in a DIY way... I thought, oh that's how they become a band... Cute... They make a couple of those and voil? they get notorious... But it didn't happened like that... I was OK with it... Jerrica was a shy one, OK... She remember her dad and decide to record a song on her own... Try a dozen times until she realize that Jerrica is an horrible name (with all the respect to all the Jerricas in the world) and becomes Jem... The nosy sister post the video and it goes viral... Uhull!And it is downhill from here... Until this point it wasn't a bad movie, neither a really good one... It was just OK...Jem went viral and so and so... My problem is that she posted ONE song and then a major label already wants to sing with her... WHAT THE HELL... And then the head of that label just shows up, IN PERSON, at her door, being a corporative b*tch villain type... WHAT THE HELL!!!They go to LA, start a going pro montage...They go home, then protagonist has a moment with the young nice looking guy, who is responsible for them... Cliché as hell... But one note... Jem and the girls are like somewhere between 17 and 19... Rio is at least in his late 20's if not in his early 30's... I mean, c'mon that's creepy!AAAAAAANNNNDDD THEEEEEN... F*ck... I don't even know how to say it... And then the robot starts to work... Jesus H... YEAH...A discount crossover between R2-D2 and Echo from Earth to Echo, which is an homage to ET... So... Synergy is 4th class rip-off... Or, if you like better, it is just bullsh*t...Then, just as in Earth to Echo, the kids go around trying to fix the robot... They trespass and are busted by the young guy who they stole... And they run from the police by jumping from the pier... In the middle of the night... In a sea that does not look calm... THEY ARE DEAD!!! Sadly they survive... AND START TO SING UNDERNEATH THE PIER! Oh and he reveals that he is son of his b*tchy boss...Man... Is hurting writing this...Lets resume 'cause it doesn't get any better or interesting... They do a show in a legendary house... It is sold out... The power goes off... The money problem forces Jem to accept the offer of going solo... The girls fight over that... She has a minor break... And the girls make up... And because of the robot have to break in the label building and recover the earrings that are in the vault... Elaborate a ridiculous plan, instead of just ask for them to the b*tch, who had no reason to say no to that! Then they discover that Rio's father left the Label to him... So he takes over, fires her mother, Jem makes a speech and the girls play the gig... And the end...IT HAD SO MUCH Potential... Visually is pretty good... You can see some kind of change in the characters along the way of becoming pop- stars... The clothing and the makeup of the band is nice... The videos as tension builders during some scenes is quite cool... As the vlogs that appear all along the movie...The characters were simply flat... All of them... And Juliette Lewis character is just too much...It has a surprisingly "high" metascore... I mean 42? Really? Max Joseph's We Are Your Friends is a way superior movie and has only 46... Kirsten Sheridan's August Rush has only a 38, and it is one of the most brilliant family movies about music ever made...Jem and The Holograms could be the movie to truly capture the essence of the music scene in the era of the internet... And fails... I'm really disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well this film really was not truly outrageous at all i loved Jem in the 80's it was what i grew up watching among other iconic cartoons. They really have not done this film in the right way it is not true to the cartoon in many ways. Although i was not a fan of the film as a whole Aubrey Peeples was OK but maybe not the best person to play Jem the thing i thought was cute though was Synergy.Speaking of Synergy she created the holograms for Jem in the cartoon that is not the case here which was disappointing they could have made such a good film here if they had followed the cartoon have Jerrica still saying show-time Synergy and touching her earring ( which she does but only once) and they get transformed into Jem I really can't see them making anymore films in this series despite setting it up for one in the credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>&#x200b; Jem and the HologramsHolographic performers are only successful in hip-hop because bullets faze right through them.Unfortunately, the pop group in this drama is intangible only in name.Sent to live with their aunt (Molly Ringwald) and foster cousins - Aja (Hayley Kiyoko) and Shana (Aurora Perrineau) - after their father dies, Jerrica (Aubrey Peeples) and her sister Kimber (Stefanie Scott) find solace in music.When an online video of her singing under the sobriquet Jem goes viral, Jerrica and her sisters are signed to Starlight records. However, producer Erica (Juliette Lewis) wants Jem to drop the Holograms, while her son Rio (Ryan Guzman) simple wants Jerrica.More a follow-your-dreams commercial for the Youtube generation than an homage to the '80s cartoon, Jem manages to utilize the material but distorts it in a way that is unrecognizable to fans, and unexciting to newcomers.And well Jerrica may secretly be Jem; Jem is actually Barbie with keytar.

However, as they say, there's a lot in a name, so I don't feel too bad for the low rating. This is basically Jem and the Holograms, reinvented, because we were to lazy to think of another title. If they had made it just like the Cartoon, it would probably have actually been pretty awesome. This is more like a lifetime movie that stole it's name from an 80s cartoon. If your looking or something meaningless to plop your kids down in front of, this would be a choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I know I am totally in the minority......but I liked the movie. I am 36. I loved the TV show but honestly do not remember the exact plot of the show. So, it really didn't bother me that they deviated from that. I took my daughter out on a date (she's 5). We were planning to see Goosebumps but it was sold out. We ended up going to Jem. My daughter really loved it and we both loved the songs from the movie. I purchased 4 off itunes the day after. We both loved the costumes and the make-up. I thought that stayed true to the original character. Anyway, overall I liked the movie and am glad my daughter enjoyed it too. The original series is on netflix so I've been showing her that too. I thought having Molly Ringwald and Juliette Lewis were good choices to appeal to my age group. I liked the actor that played Jem!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just came out of the theatre about 90 minutes ago. Loved it. It was fun, the music was terrific, and the cast was great.I don't know why people thought recreating the original as a live-action movie would be a good idea. It was about a young woman (18 years old at the start of the series) who ran a record company, was a rock star, managed an orphanage, and two-timed her own boyfriend.Given today's focus on authenticity vs. cultivated image, I thought the movie hit the nail on the head. I'm tired of remakes and remakes of remakes (Fantastic 4, anyone? Spiderman?). This one isn't a remake. Chu &amp; Co. took the basic concepts (girl power, the question of identity) and redid it for this day and age.If you're expecting the original, then watch the original. For once, Hollywood tried to make something original from the original. I, for one, am glad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Jem for a new generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't know why this film has had so many bad reviews as a long time lover of the cartoon series Jem I thought this was done very well, I loved the songs and even had to download the soundtrack as soon as the movie had ended. Apart from missing the magical closet that would appear when ever Jem would rub her famous earrings I thought it really showed the fickle nature of the music business and how young and struggling artist are manipulated in the industry!Personally the Rio character was about as redundant as he was in the cartoon, but I guess you always need a love interest ,but still I could of done with just concentrating on the music and the struggle that the band had.Also the only other disappointing factor was the lack of the misfits on screen, but if they are setting up for a second movie then Keisha was an excellent choice!! Can't wait for a second film as long a they try and stay away from the love triangle that they have obviously put forward to the audience and concentrate more on the music and character development, then these series of films could really settle for a second place medal after the cartoon in my heart!! Must watch and any one with teenagers girls would love this!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will start out by saying that I was excited to see this. I enjoyed the cartoon. I just bought this movie and watched it. I can honestly say this is not the same Jem that many older folks know and love. This is watered down and is awful as far as adaptations go. However as a stand alone movie, without the title that made me have a set of expectations. This is not a horrible movie, nor is it good.The movie has some good music in it. Aubrey Peeples definitely has a voice that is to die for. The storyline is recycled but still done in a fresh enough manner that it is fun. The acting is sub par and it reminded me of a made for TV ABC movie. I would not say "Go spend 20 bucks on it" but it is worth watching, especially if you have children and want to watch a family movie. I hate Hannah Montana but most young girls love it, just like they will love this.I give it a B- or 5/10 Let go of your expectations and just sit back and spend 2 hours not thinking too hard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**you should not watch this movie but in case you do not read all of the other reviews that say this movie is garbage and still want to watch it, i've included a few spoilers...but I think 'spoiler' for this movie is an oxymoron**So my boyfriend and I saw previews for this in the movie theater and we both thought it looked cool. I'm from the Jem era so it looked like a fun trip down memory lane. It was far from that...it was painful to watch. My boyfriend immediately tuned out except when he would throw in 'It's show time synergy' when he heard a ridiculous line. Acting was garbage, I couldn't follow the plot, completely removed from reality. The 'Synergy' toy, or whatever the hell it was, was so dumb. The story about the dad loving Jerrica so much was sad, hello she has a little sister that he didn't seem to give a crap about. The Holograms were completely cut out - they made an initial appearance but then Jem had to save Molly Ringwalds house and so she signed away her 'sisters' to get money and then everyone cried and then videos of Jem's dad played and then Starlight's producers' son fell in love with Jem....trust me A COMPLETE TRAIN WRECK. The only two bright spots in this mess were seeing Molly Ringwald, she's actually still alive! and being inspired for my Halloween costume this year. I'm really sad I spent play credits on this crap heap of a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up with the cartoon (I'm 32, and it was my FAVORITE when I was a little girl) and I loved the update that this movie gave to the original material! I took my daughter along, who is completely unfamiliar with the property, and she loved it, too! I don't get where all the hate is coming from, honestly. The music was very reminiscent thematically of the music I remember from the show, just updated to modern pop rather than 80's pop; though there was a nice little homage to the 80's hair and music near the beginning of the film. I thought that the costume updates were a nice change, to be honest. All in all, we enjoyed ourselves, I got a little nostalgic twinge, and my kid wants to see the Jem cartoon now. Well worth our time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's effort to watching things that look this good but don't really pan out. In theory, the narrative, like the viewing experience, should, in fact, be effortless. The story of a group of viral sensations turned international superstars, this premise is simple and should play as such. The complexities of sibling-hood be damned, which if you were going to explore, then the beast should be tackled in the writing phase, not when the girls are challenged to play it out in their performances.Also, seeing 'Jem' in the title reminded me of the mid-2000s UK pop star. This film has nothing to do with her.Jon M Chu's past movies show gorgeous looking cinema ? excellent choices as far as cinematography is concerned, that don't quite add up to great directing ones. I don't mean to speak, like many other critics/cynics/viewers, on knowing how a production works end-to- end. I mean to say here that if you're going to watch something which, for the most part, is a mess, it should at least be watch- able, and from his track record, I credit Chu with that and wish for him more fulfilling projects in his future.As the film's poster suggests, the future of the stars in this film will get a chance to shine at some point. This just isn't it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie with my little cousins, and they loved it. LOVED it. Yes, as an adult, it wasn't that great of a movie, but it was little and tween girls who watched the original cartoon back in the day, and it is the little and tween girls who love the movie now. It had great story lines about girls and families sticking together, forgiving mistakes, putting family first, and following dreams. It wasn't a great movie, but the girls who went with me to see it really loved it. The music wasn't bad, and the fact that it included social media and had cameos of real people made it seem like it was true, that following your dreams can lead to success.

		<fullReview>I was a big Jem fan back in the 80's so of course I was going to watch this. After all the slagging off I've heard I was quite surprised, the film was OK and they have tried to bring it up to date with involving the internet fame and stuff but there were quite a few bits that they kept in as well. First things first, this is a PG movie mainly geared towards young girls/tweens, I don't know what the people giving bad reviews were expecting - it is hardly going to be Shakespeare. The cast carried off their roles well and seemed to be having fun with it. The songs are OK, personally I would've liked a few stronger numbers but that's just me. The only thing I did have an issue with is Synergy - why has it gone from a powerful computerised system that conceals Jerrica's identity to a rather rubbish R2D2 that doesn't really do much. On the whole it was enjoyable and I hope they do another one as it was good to see The Misfits at the end. Watch it and make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Jem and the Holograms" isn't the former and is too much of the latter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies are just dumb. But I don't mean to say that the people making the movie are dumb. Unfortunately, in spite of the best efforts of many smart, talented and hard-working people, "dumb" is the first word that comes to mind when thinking about a particular movie. Take "Jem and the Holograms" (PG, 1:58) for example. Just look at the title. The lead character is a singer who performs under the nickname that her father gave her? but "Jem" should be spelled with a "G"! And why call the band members "the Holograms" (something that isn't really there) when part of the point of the movie is that Jem's musicians are an indispensable part of the act? Now, before someone says that I don't know what I'm talking about, yes, I am aware that this movie is a live action version of a popular mid-late 1980s animated TV series of the same name (and the same spelling), but that doesn't mean that the adaptation (or the original) doesn't contain some dumb ideas. The TV series was only created to help sell toys! That may be good business, but it's kind of a dumb reason for people to start watching a new show, which basically amounts to a half-hour toy commercial. Still, having said all that (and with more "dumb" complaints to come), I admit that "dumb" is rarely an all-or-nothing proposition and even "dumb" movies can be mildly entertaining.Jem, whose real name is Jerrica Benton (Aubrey Peeples), is a teen who lives with her younger sister, Kimber (Stefanie Scott) and their aunt Bailey (Molly Ringwald), who took the girls in after their father died. Also in the house are Bailey's two previously adopted daughters, Aja (Hayley Kiyoko) and Shana (Aurora Perrineau). The four teenage girls live as sisters and are all into music and fashion. Jerrica and Kimber write songs and all four girls play instruments. They also all comment on each other's clothing and hairstyle choices, sometimes even doing the "favor" of making changes in each other's styles.One day when the girls all decide to entertain themselves by putting on fun make-up, wigs and clothes to make a "music video", the chronically private Jerrica is inspired to record one of her songs on video and in costume as "Jem". Kimber, who is the opposite of Jerrica and lives her entire life online, gets a hold of Jerrica's video clip and posts it on YouTube. "Jem" becomes, quite literally, an overnight sensation. The video goes viral and everyone is asking "Who is Jem?" One of those asking is Starlight Music CEO Erica Raymond (Juliette Lewis) who finds Jerrica and offers her money to perform three shows in L.A. Jerrica agrees ? on one firmly-held condition ? that her sisters come with her as her band.Erica (the female version of television Jem's nemesis, Eric) isn't the magnanimous God-send she appears to be. Erica's the kind of person who casually insults people when she talks, insists on having her way, and isn't above manipulating people to get it. Even after meeting Erica, Aunt Bailey lets the four teenage girls go back with Erica to L.A. (pretty dumb, if you ask me) without any more supervision than Erica, her driver, Zipper (Nathan Moore), and Erica's son and employee, Rio Pacheco (Ryan Guzman). Erica has the girls stay in the "Rock Star Suite" in Starlight Mansion. Rio is right down the hall, but that still doesn't stop these very independent girls from getting into some serious mischief. "That's when things start to get weird," says Jerrica's narration, referring to their first night in Starlight Mansion. (Taking out the word "weird" and substituting "dumb" and/or "dumber" would be more accurate.) A small robot which Jerrica and Kimber's dad invented (but could never get to work) and which Jerrica holds onto for inspiration, suddenly starts beeping and flashing. The robot, 51n3rg.y (pronounced "synergy"), leads the girls ? and the audience ? into a subplot which has Jerrica searching for clues to something that her father left for her to find when she became old enough to do so.Back to the main story. The girls perform in L.A. and they're a hit, even though Jem ends up looking like Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Sia somehow joined their DNA, had a child and worked together on her look. Jerrica's conflicted about the artifice of her on-stage persona, but at least she's happy thinking that she's going to make enough money to help Aunt Bailey out of some financial trouble, and then the other shoe drops. Erica kicks her manipulations into overdrive, reveals her true intentions and forces Jerrica into a very difficult choice that will have long-term implications for all involved (especially if a planned sequel is filmed, as foreshadowed in a mid-credits scene which features Ke$ha as a character from the TV show)."Jem and the Holograms" has its charms, but it's still basically pretty dumb. Besides my earlier points, there's Jem's super-fast rise to stardom (ridiculously fast - even for the internet age), Erica's ridiculous statement that she can find another "Jem" and no one would notice (even in the internet age), that robot's capabilities and how they come about, and a major conflict's resolution that is sappy and rushed.On the positive side, Ringwald gives an excellent performance and the band performs some well-written songs that have a good beat. The movie is family-friendly and gives us some good lessons in loyalty, integrity and being yourself, but the film is unlikely to hold much appeal for many people beyond die-hard fans of the original TV show or girls currently between the ages of 6 and 12. Unfortunately, there's only so much dumbness that some decent acting and a few good songs and positive messages can overcome in one film. Heck, maybe you think this review is dumb, but I'm still giving this movie a "C-".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jem and the Holograms Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Teenager Jerrica (Aubrey Peeples) is an extremely shy but talented singer-songwriter whose dreams of stardom come true when she forms the group Jem and the Holograms. Other members include her younger sister Kimber (Stefanie Scott) on keyboards, drummer Shana (Aurora Perrineau) and bassist Aja (Hayley Kiyoko). With help from Rio (Ryan Guzman), the son of the CEO, Erica Raymond (Juliette Lewis) of Starlight Music, the four young band members find their own voice while taking the world by storm.On paper this seems like an odd choice for me but I was just trying to be thorough. I've heard of the television series which this is based on but I have never seen an episode. I can't personally speak to the differences between this film and the TV show but this can. So this should not come as much of a surprise that this film is drowning in girliness so if you're not comfortable with that, then you probably won't enjoy this. There are a lot of things going on in this film but the main thing to take away is the message of being yourself, some girl power stuff, and some general empowerment in there (stop me if you haven't heard any of this before). Based on that, this film definitely does not bring anything new or original to the table. The way it goes about doing this definitely isn't new or original either. They're all together, one of them starts to lose their way, and then they find their way back (stop me if you haven't heard any of this before). So that is pretty much is how the main plot functioned more or less but there was more going on than just that. I guess that was the only way they could have justified the two hour running time (which is probably 15-20 minutes too long in my opinion). I thought the film could have gone without maybe a few of those subplots but I am not in a position to judge their importance because of my unfamiliarity with the series but I was still a little bored and disinterested in them nonetheless. I am also not a big fan of films where the main character narrates the story because I often found this to be unnecessary and redundant as they always just seem to repeat what we are already seeing which I found happened a few times here. I think they could have either toned it down or just gotten rid of it altogether. I was not a big fan of the soundtrack either as I found it to be a little overbearing at times. A thing that annoyed me about this was the use of video throughout the film. During certain dramatic moments, they would cut to what looks to be YouTube videos and the sound from them was used to try to elevate the tension which was just weird to me. Also the film kept showing what looked like fan made videos where they would talk about how Jem helped their lives which just seemed unnecessary to me. The film's pacing felt odd to me as it was unclear as to how much time had passed. I thought the acting was decent throughout despite the cheesy dialogue. The only exception to this has to Lewis' Erica Raymond who just felt wrong to me. The musical performances were well done as I thought they looked good and sounded good despite me trying to figure out whether or not they were lip syncing the whole time (I think they were). Overall, this is a decent teen film with some good plot elements with catchy music that is still in my head as I am writing this.Score: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scummy way to treat a series and its namesake, even one as obscure and low-key as this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even as someone who has only seen a handful of episodes and clips of the originals 1980's cartoon show "Jem and the Holograms," there's something to be said about the scummy way that series came to get a mainstream film adaptation. The project was largely helmed by director Jon M. Chu and co-producer Scooter Braun, two individuals responsible for furthering the career of Canadian pop singer Justin Bieber by way of two mediocre documentaries in the earlier part of this decade. It would appear upon seeing even the trailer for the feature-length adaptation of "Jem and the Holograms" that this film has desperately little to do with the Television program on which it was based, and the story and characters have been incredibly modernized to fit the internet generation, as well. What seems to have happened here is that Chu, Braun, and screenwriter Ryan Landels saw an opportunity to make a film about the perils of the music industry, but instead of marketing it as an original property - an uphill battle - they decided it would be easier to more-or-less hijack the namesake of an eighties cartoon show, a relatively obscure one in order to refrain from an explosive public outcry about sanctity and nostalgia, and use what minimal relevance it has in the modern day to promote their story. The result is a mediocre film that spits in the face of the loyalist fans of the program, and its legendarily bad box office haul go down in the books as a case for what occurs when executive producers think they know better than the masses and choose to alienate rather than incorporate.The cartoon show was a bonafide piece of eighties camp, heavy on glam-rock and wildly colorful, animated backgrounds and had enough pleasant musical numbers to warrant some warm fuzziness. It was never anything bigger than its twenty-two minute network timeslot, but it had its charm and its run. The film focuses on Jerrica Benton (Aubrey Peeples), an aspiring but self-conscious singer who lives with her sister Kimber (Stefanie Scott) and her friends Aja (Hayley Kiyoko) and Shana (Aurora Perrineau), all of whom also aspiring musicians. When Jerrica, often nicknamed "Jem," a name her father by which her later father referred to her, records a video of herself doused in makeup and a costume, performing a simple, acoustic guitar, the quiet decision Kimber makes to upload it to Youtube results in incalculable overnight popularity for her bashful sister.When Jerrica finds out what her sister did, she has no time to be angry because famous record label and music industry mogul Erica Raymond (Juliette Lewis) contacts her with plans to sign her to a lucrative record label. While Jerrica has seen unfathomable viral love because of her talent and her enigmatic look and identity, she sees her potential breakout move as something that should be embraced by her sister and friends, as well. Jerrica, in turn, only agrees to the record label if Kimber, Aja, and Shana can come along too, to which Erica and her partner/son Rio (Ryan Guzman) accept for now.Then there's "Synergy," a small, unfinished robot device that Jerrica's father made shortly before his passing. It was said to be one last gift for her, and its significance in the film is to inspire goofy moments of beatboxing and certain science-fiction circumstances. It was something that worked well in the realm of animation - especially for the kind of time-specific era of the 1980's - but feels corny and unbelievably out of place in this adaptation.What also feels completely foreign to this film is subtlety in any conceivable manner. This is the kind of film that feels it's being hip and in-the-know by emptily referencing Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram in every other scene, or going as far to showing screen-caps of social media activity on such websites. It also, paradoxically, finds a way to make the most artificial and unbelievable film about remaining true to oneself and maintaining their dignity and family roots that I have yet to see. Characters speak less like humans and more like guidance counselors, pre-programmed with morally uplifting and reassuring buzzwords and phrases to make one another feel better. The scene where Jem's bandmates ditch her upon finding out her creative decision is resolved about as quickly as the conflict is introduced, with no kind of expository development as to how or why the women came to such a decision. As a result, unlike the two hours I spent watching "Steve Jobs," which flew past me, the two hour runtime of "Jem and the Holograms" felt like a dreary, neverending slog through the realm of music industry clichés and "family is first" testimonies iterated by people that did nothing but eventually break those promises.While the ever-changing costume and makeup designs provide for a consistent kinetic element to the film and the performers, particularly Peeples, have an admirable amount of energy, none of these moving parts can disguise "Jem and the Holograms" from being a deceptive and thoroughly lackluster affair. Even thoughtful commentary in the film's conclusion about the overarching reason why many of us love to listen and embrace music, as it often channels emotions that are otherwise incapable of being summoned from conversation or any other form of expression, comes in a belated fashion. It exists as a generic vehicle that turned an original, if campy, eighties cartoon into a boring and unenjoyable parable on personal pride and commitment.</fullReview>

Why NOT cast the roles of four teen sisters with actresses who look to be in the same age group as "Mom," and have a 30-day story arc which makes the Beatle's rise to success look more prolonged than that of Grandma Moses? Maybe Blumhouse could try BARNEY DESTROYS MANHATTAN or MISS PIGGY DOES DALLAS for their next attempt to attain that elusive Box Office Nadir of Absolute Zero in Gross Ticket Sales (that's assuming that the sequel promised in the JEM closing credits does not pan out).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that a lot of the movie bombs are due to 3 things: Animation/CGI, movie rights and movie stars salaries. 1. Too much CGI/Animations. Especially in big budget films like Iron Man, and The Avengers and the like. It take a lot of money to make these movies believable for today's audience.( I was born in the 50's..can you say Mothara or Godzilla? (the 60's)) Next how much can an author charge for the rights to his/her book, if it might not be a hit? Even Stephan King has written some stinkers, yet almost anything he writes will be made into TV or Big Screen movie. Now to actors salaries, $20,30,50+ Million and even their names won't make it a hit. Let them get a percentage of the movie. Movie made $250,000,000, get a big percentage, movie made $250,000, get $10,000 and a case of beer. (I'm basing my figures on a movie budget of let's say $3,000,000 ) Just my two cents. I didn't see Jem but when my daughter was little, watched it all the time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I had feared</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a fan of the cartoon originally. My 11-yr-old daughter has now watched the DVD sets a million times. So there was a high bar here, and we were curious, but afraid that this film was going to be absolutely horrible. We decided to give it a chance.Despite making comments about how they "ruined the story" and about some of the changes, my daughter was laughing at the jokes, commenting on the looks of the actor playing Rio, and loving the music. I had to buy the soundtrack for her. After seeing the mid- credits scene, she can't wait for a sequel. Sadly, it likely won't be made.As a Jem fan, yes I'd have liked something that was closer to the source material. But it wasn't *that* bad and shared some of the same themes from the cartoon. (Face it, Jerrica has always had a love/hate relationship with Jem, and is often jealous of her alter-ego on the old show. It was a constant source of conflict.) Easter eggs: there are MANY. So, sure, it wasn't all laid out on the surface, but there were a lot of ties to the cartoon, far more than I had expected.As a parent, it was a great family film. My daughter has never seen Hannah Montana (just before her time), so comparing the two as many reviewers have done doesn't mean anything to her. Even if she acknowledged that it wasn't quite the Jem she has known through the cartoon, she enjoyed it for what it was, and really wants to see the next one.</fullReview>

I understand for the movie version they would need to water that down as Jem does not have the same feel as a Michael Bay extravaganza, but the issue that seem to bring was the film maker still tried too hard to force feed us every single element of the Jem series as if he was selling those toys.Updating the story for contemporary times, Jem starts out as a Youtube sensation that gets discovered by a major record label that wants to exploit the mystery behind Jem, but Jerrica, Jem's secret identity, is losing herself in this image, while at the same time attempting to put together the last gift her father gave her.The two stories did not mesh together well. If you are not fully familiar with the Jem saga than the sub story is there for no reason and badly distracts from the main plotThat's never a problem if what I'm watching is interesting enough, but the acting was so bad in this. Even from Juliette Lewis who played Erica Raymond, as a stereotypical evil record label owner, it was so cheesy. Everyone was so cheesy as they painfully forced the "individual" personalities on us. Everyone was "so cool" everyone was trying so hard not to be the formulated pop stereotype they really are. And in forcing all of this on us, we get nothing. The adventure they go upon to find the pieces of the puzzle that will complete Jerrica's Father's last invention, synergy seems odd in the movie as it connects to nothing that's important. The music is weak and unimportant. The characters are too one dimensional to be important.I kind of had the feeling this movie was going to be a bust when I saw the trailer, but I was hoping to get some sort of satisfaction with the film for what it is, but it really is not worth seeing at all weather you know who Jem and the Holograms are or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as everyone thinks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of the animated series grouping up (it was an animated MTV for kids back in the day, back when MTV still played music videos), so I decided to see the movie last night.I have to say the movie isn't as bad as people are making it out to be. Granted, they took some liberties updating it for social media and YouTube generations, but I think they made the right call with it. And while the dialogue was pretty sappy at times (which actually works to its benefit considering how sappy the dialogue was in the original series), and that they tweaked other changes (Synergy is now a robot instead of a holographic supercomputer, Rio is the son of the record producer Erica Raymond, and a few others), overall, I think the story of empowerment and being true to yourself and expressing your voice shouldn't be lost in the mix. And I also enjoyed the mid-credits scene, which people should stay for to see for themselves! Plus, they made sure to include some of the classic lines from the animated series into the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was skeptical about this since the first trailer, but I didn't go into the theater with a bad attitude. Some people involved with the film asked the detractors of the film to reserve judgment until they'd actually seen it. That seemed fair. Maybe there was more to it than meets the eye.There wasn't.The vivid and colorful animation of the cartoon is somewhat translated into film here, but only for the handful of performance sequences. The "Holograms" part of Jem and the Holograms is, quite frankly, gone, and the band is only arbitrarily named as such at the end. Synergy is basically a low rent R2-D2, it's obvious that the $5 million budget wasn't enough to properly adapt the series. Had they spent another $10 million and used it to realize the characters and the style of the series, maybe this wouldn't be flopping so badly.Aubrey Peeples' acting is fair, and I think she actually put some effort into her performance, but she just doesn't have an air of excitement about her. Jem/Jerrica just isn't that fun or adventurous. Juliette Lewis is a pretty generic Cruella DeVille corporate type, but I won't pretend Eric Raymond was all that interesting to start with (although he served his purpose well enough).Most frustrating of all is the mid-credits stinger. This is the only time you see the Misfits in the movie, and unlike everything else in the movie, they nail them. They're mischievous, they've got attitude, and they can't wait to get to the top. Perfect. Kesha appears as frontwoman Pizazz, and vows that she'll get back at Jem, setting up a sequel that almost certainly won't happen.Too bad they didn't just make the movie they chose to set up in the last two minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nowhere in the film rule book does it require a girl empowerment movie to be cheesy. Cliché I suppose, but not cheesy. But I can't hate on Jem and the Holograms for trying. If you're not familiar with the source material, this movie actually stays fairly true to the spirit of the original '80s cartoon--laughable dialogue and all.In the film Jem (Aubrey Peeples) and her sister Kimber (Stefanie Scott) are sent to live with their Aunt Bailey (Molly Ringwald) and their two foster sisters after their father passes away. Before he died he was working on Synergy--a mysterious robot device that he never completed. The girls, minus Jem, all play music for fun at the house. Jem has stage fright and, despite her sisters' mediocre attempts, doesn't want anyone to hear her songs or her voice. So one night she records herself singing in her bedroom with the door cracked--not a quiet performance, but one sung at full volume. So cue the sister standing outside of Jem's room secretly listening. That night Kimber uploads the video to YouTube behind Jem's back and somehow it receives thousands of plays before morning and Jem gets an offer from famed record mogul Erica Raymond (Juliette Lewis). While Lewis' presence immediately increases the entertainment value of the movie, it doesn't diminish the ridiculousness of the premise. Raymond agrees to sign Jem to the label. She also agrees to sign Jem's sisters as her backup band without hearing them play a single note.The notion of overnight success is highly embellished here. The song that Jem sings in the video is the weakest one in the whole film, and with the excess of amateur singers on YouTube, what makes her's standout above the rest to garner her national news coverage? It's trying to inspire, I get it. I just think that these unrealistic results that kids witness in film, and mostly television, is raising their expectations along with their disappointments. It's an argument for another time, but Disney is doing plenty to accomplish these results. We don't need it elsewhere.Sure, the movie's trying to send a message to young girls, which is fine, and it gets that message across easily, but it does so with too much conviction. Promoting empowerment for women is perfectly fine, however, it would have been nicer if they didn't alienate everyone else in the process.After the girls move to Los Angeles, Jem discovers that the Synergy robot her dad created is coming to life and that he left pieces for her all over the city so that she could finish Synergy. The pieces include messages directed towards Jem in order to help her achieve her goals, which he had no inkling of when he died because she was 6. It's a surprise Kimber doesn't have mad jealousy issues since everything their father left behind is directed towards Jem specifically. In fact, the entire time it's barely stated that Kimber and her father even knew each other. Also, the girls' mother is literally never mentioned even once in this movie. I guess she was unloved.Oh, and throughout the whole film is Raymond's son, Rio (Ryan Guzman), who is in charge of keeping an eye on the girls around the clock. He's present in almost every scene following his introduction into the movie. He's even there when it's most unnecessary for him to be. He and Jem's infatuation-turned-relationship is forced upon us the entire time. His overuse for the target demographic's approval is evident. It gets to the point where the audience is unanimously recognizing this and laughing each time the character appears on screen. For instance, there's a pretty emotional scene where Jem is watching an old video that her father records for her before he dies. She's crying and the audience is possibly realizing their investment in her character. But instead of Jem's sister being present, sharing the experience with her, Rio is there to comfort her. We begin to forget that he's there until after the video when he goes up to her and rubs her back--presumably to get a happy sigh out of its naive and artless audience. They could have used that moment to really build upon the sisters' relationship, but instead sacrificed that in order to get a cheap reaction.Despite my scathing feedback, the film doesn't do everything wrong. It soars high in the sound department. The songs are catchy and the filmmakers do something really creative by using viral YouTube videos as background score throughout various scenes.But at its most enjoyable, we are constantly reminded that Jem and the Holograms takes itself too seriously and is too cool for its own good. The dialogue is so self-aware that it just adds to the film's impracticality. Despite a couple of good bits and some scene stealers by Lewis, it's mostly broad humor set to indulge young girls, and it's obvious. It does very little to appease parents bringing their kids to the show, when they're the ones who best remember the source material and are perhaps most excited about this adaptation. The best scene is during the end credits, which brings the darker side from the original show and shoots a nice wink towards fans.The music is good and the film has its entertaining moments, but overall Jem and the Holograms panders its target demographic a bit too much for it to be glorified by anyone else. It means well and I credit it for staying fairly true to its source, but it may have served better as a Disney Channel movie.Twizard Rating: 54 **Review can also be found at movies.mxdwn.com**</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May the gods of cinema forgive me, I can't stop myself from enjoying JEM AND THE HOLOGRAMS. Despite its imperfection and the fact that it's pretty generic, this movie is charming and fun, and simply irresistible. We've danced this tango before, but the characters themselves are aware of the generic nature of it all, they embrace it, so I think that just spells out the word awesome. And make way for Aubrey Peeples, Stefanie Scott, Hayley Kiyoko, and Aurora Perrineau. These beautiful talented young ladies are going places! Aubrey Peeples plays a small town girl by the name of Jerrica Benton who lives with her sister, Kimber (Stefanie Scott) and her friends, Aja (Hayley Kiyoko) and Shana (Aurora Perrineau). Each of them has distinct personality but they get along and compliment one another. The legendary 80s sweetheart, Molly Ringwald plays their guardian whose store business isn't doing so well, so their little family is struggling financially. Jerrica often finds solace in her music and the memory of her late dad. Kimber tries to get Jerrica to take more faith in her music, to put herself out there, so she secretly uploads Jerrica's personal song video online and voila! It goes viral. All of a sudden, the whole world is talking about this character Jem, Jerrica's alter ego, it certainly arrests the attention of record label producer Erica Raymond who wants to capitalize on Jem. Four aspiring musicians taking the world by storm until they realize that fame isn't all that it's cracked up to be, it certainly means nothing without your family or the people who accept you for who you are.This film is based on Hasbro's popular 80s animated series of the same name. But if you come into the theaters expecting something exactly like the one you grew up watching, then take your expectation down a notch because there's no 80s hairstyle here, no 80s vibe, no 80s music, what screenwriter Ryan Landels and director Jon Chu did was that they updated story and the characters in order to cater to today's generation and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It has some throwback to your favorite lines, you'll catch several things that remind you of the animated series, but for the most part.. let's just put it this way, keep in mind that even the four lead stars of this movie weren't around when "Jem" was on TV. And so how to connect the original fans with today's youth who just want to watch a hip and vibrant movie, that was the challenge and I think JEM AND THE HOLOGRAMS did a fantastic job of bridging that gap.Just like many of you, I'm a huge fan of Molly Ringwald and Juliette Lewis, so to see those two legendary actresses practically sparring is one of this film's many treats. Their characters are like the yin and yang in this film, opposite ends of the spectrum. Juliette in particular is so freakin' good as the villain, you can't take your eyes off her. As Erica Raymond who embodies the bad side of capitalism, Juliette Lewis plays it to perfection so much so that there's a side of you that wants to root for Erica Raymond. So sassy, I just love her.The songs are extremely catchy. I was at the press screening and I found my foot tapping to every beat. I think the soundtrack is going to be a big hit. Granted, there are moments or sequences in this film that are silly, they're straight out of a cliché manual, at times it feels like you're watching a Disney channel production, not to mention the third act which is just riddled with morality and motivational speeches, one after another. But again, I think the combination of magnetic actresses like Molly, Juliette, Hayley, Aurora, Stefanie, Aubrey, (who by the way looks like a cross between Jena Malone and Kat Dennings, all three equally beautiful of course) and the super catchy music, and their never-ending supply of energy, everything about them would draw you in.I think there are parts about this film that fans of the original can appreciate, like the theme of sisterhood and of course the flashy glamorous pink, but what director Jon Chu ("Step Up") has pretty much done here is he incorporates what fame means to today's generation. Teenagers these days can quickly name their favorite YouTube stars in a heartbeat. But not all of them would recognize someone like Chris Pratt, for example. We're living in this social media day and age where anybody can create their own identity and share it with the world and be famous on their own doing, a world in which stardom can be reached within just a click of a button or a touch screen press on your smart phone, JEM AND THE HOLOGRAMS makes you wonder if fame is worth pursuing if you're pursuing it alone. Let me tell you this much, I walked out of the theater wanting more of JEM AND THE HOLOGRAMS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply An Amazing Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jem and the Holograms is an upcoming 2015 American musical fantasy drama film based loosely on the toy line and 1980s animated television series of the same name.Singer Jerrica Benton (Aubrey Peeples), her sister Kimber (Stefanie Scott), and her friends Aja (Hayley Kiyoko) and Shana (Aurora Perrineau), aspiring musicians, embark on a quest to become superstars.I really loved this amazing movie. The musical fantasy drama was indeed impressive especially in the great acting.Concerning the music and the songs,honestly this excellent movie reminded me of Fame ( A top,classical and musical film ).Definitely A Top 10 Or Top 5 Movie. Don't be surprised if this film gets in straight in at number 1!.</fullReview>
