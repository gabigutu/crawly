		<shortDescription>An uncommonly strong sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2 doesn't waste time in bringing the scares in. By that, I mean you're pretty much in the thick of it within three minutes or so, being given some background (via another very notorious haunting incident) for what is to follow.The Warrens are sent on behalf of the church to investigate some paranormal activity which is whipping up a media storm in Enfield, England and, as per the first movie, they go and attempt to work their magic on the situation. As per the first movie, a family is being haunted and they fear for their sanity and lives. There are a few new twists this time round, so all does not play out as before - but it's not a complete departure from the format, which might have made it a bit more gripping in places. James Wan's trademark visual style is repeated in this movie - his bag of tricks sometimes yielding a sense of deja vu but generally working like a charm. When it's intended to scare, it really does. The scares come a bit more frequently than in the first movie and do manage to build a lot of tension, even if you've seen the original, so well done to Wan for that.What's really enjoyable about this movie, is its nostalgic recreation of 70s England. Wan has really done a great job of this, which is surprising given that he's not from there. Also, the central support role of Janet Hodgson is pretty crucial to empathising with the Enfield family and Madison Wolfe gives a solid performance.It's arguable this one is as strong as the first. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed part one, or indeed likes movies of a haunting or possession theme. Stick around for the credits - the music is seriously unsettling!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow wow wow!! I've never been much of a fan of sequels but The Conjuring 2 was incredible. I'm never one to jump at everything 'scary' I see in movies as usually you've seen it all before &amp; let's be honest, nothing really scares you much when your not a teenager anymore. However The Conjuring had me jumping all over the place. At one point I even yelped, much to my embarrassment, but that's why we go to horror movies! To be scared &amp; the conjuring didn't disappoint. All actors gave amazing performances &amp; the story had you never in a state of boredom. Walking out of the cinema I couldn't wait to see what The Conjuring 3 would bring! (Assuming we're lucky enough for another). Definitely a movie to see in the cinema. I give it 10/10!! Great movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conjuring 2 is best when it sticks to the basics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, the all-important question: Is The Conjuring 2 scary? Like, jump out of your seat, watch through your outstretched fingers scary? The answer to that is "yes." Under James Wan's direction, even the most clichéd haunted-house tropes (and this movie is bursting with them) are genuinely creepy, and although the movie isn't overly reliant on jump scares, the ones it does use?well, they work. On a lizard-brain level, The Conjuring 2 taps into the universal childhood fear of the dark, and some of its simplest moments?like a little girl hiding under the covers with a flashlight?are its most effective, bolstered by skillfully executed sound design and Don Burgess' gloomy cinematography.Speaking of tropes, that's where the "based on a true story" bit comes in. The main plot of the film revolves around a real-life incident known as the Enfield Poltergeist, an extremely well-documented case of a supposed ghost who terrorized the Hodgson family of North London from 1977 to 1979 and was apparently a fan of the classics: knocking on walls, shaking beds, throwing furniture, and even the occasional haunted kid's toy. And as malevolent spirits often do, it picked on one of the children in particular, 11-year-old Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe). Call it a collective delusion, or a desperate cry for attention from a disturbed child. Or call it what the movie very explicitly calls it: The Devil.With this installment, the Conjuring movies may have overtaken The Exorcist as the most Christian of horror franchises, taking place in a universe where the Catholic Church is the spiritual S.H.I.E.L.D. and demon hunters Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) its holy roller super-agents. The film opens with the Warrens investigating the famous Amityville case, during the course of which Lorraine first encounters the hellish presence that will haunt her for the next few years. Fearing for his life, she begs her husband to suspend any future paranormal investigations, to which he reluctantly agrees. Until, that is, a priest arrives to give them their next mission: Travel to London and confirm the veracity of reports of a demonically tinged haunting.Both Farmiga and Wilson are given their chance to shine in spooky set pieces?Farmiga early on in the film, Wilson later. But while they're both convincing in spiritual warrior mode, Wan's decision to play up the romance between the two doesn't quite work. We knew that the Warrens were a happily married couple in the first movie, but having them each individually tell the story of their paranormal love and Ed make suggestive comments about the sleeping arrangements seems odd, maybe because they're flirting in front of a possessed pre-teen whose soul is currently in the process of being swallowed by the Pit. (On the other hand, this is just another day at the office for the Warrens.) The non-horror elements of the film are uneven in general: The score, so effective in the fright scenes, suddenly evokes eye rolls when things start to get sentimental, and there's one scene of unintentional comedy where the film's retro '70s setting?another element downplayed in the first film but foregrounded here?collides with its demonic imagery in an honestly pretty silly way. (The Conjuring 2 shares its predecessor's eye for period details, some of which seem out-and-out ridiculous until they're juxtaposed with photos of their real-life counterparts in the end credits. The on-the-nose pop music gets no such redemption.) That being said, there are also some truly funny moments, like a shot of the Hodgson family running from their haunted house after a particularly intense bout of psychokinetic activity that riffs on smartasses' favorite retort, "Why don't they just move?" (And, for the record, they don't move because it's public housing, and the local council, which is naturally quite skeptical of the whole "ghost" thing, has to approve the relocation.) It's also worth noting that The Conjuring 2 is more than two hours long, allowing for lots of escalation. And while each individual haunting scene can be white-knuckle intense, by the dozenth or so such shock, the film starts to lose momentum. So the final confrontation, when it does come, is a relief in more ways than one. The long running time also allows Wan to overthink his demonology: The main villain, an infernal nun, is appropriately nightmarish, if reminiscent of the veiled "Bride In Black" from Wan's own Insidious. What's less compelling is the insertion of the "Crooked Man," a storybook scarecrow monster that starts spreading Babadook-esque chaos about halfway through and is explained as the demon assuming a form that's familiar to the Hodgsons. Which would be fine, if it weren't for the two familiar forms that the spirit has taken already.When The Conjuring 2 focuses its efforts on scaring the audience, it succeeds, wildly. And why wouldn't it? Wan's got his horror technique locked down at this point. It's the parts where it wanders away from the basics of creating and releasing tension that prevent it from outdoing its predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conjuring 2 Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2 is directed by James Wan and stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. The Conjuring 2 is an excellent horror movie and just a flat out great movie in general. From the camera-work to the performances this movie delivers on all fronts. The plot follows a family in poverty in Einfield,England that start experiencing strange happenings in their home. After things become much worse over a period of time The Warrens are contacted to come and help. This is a very scary movie thanks to James Wan's direction from lingering and tracking shots he is truly a master behind the camera. The scares come quite often as scenes will linger and bring a huge sense of tension and get you when your not expecting it bringing some very frightening scenes. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilsons performances are excellent as you buy into their relationship and learn some lessons on marriage. The children actors have the be given credit too as they are great in this film. These kids are terrified of the haunting and you will feel their dread. I am so satisfied with this film generally people worry about horror sequels usually because they can turn out unsuccessful, but I am happy to report as a big fan of the first movie this is just as great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever enough to scare us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Conjuring 2" is an excellent example of what more sequels should aspire to be. It is a perfectly executed haunting movie from James Wan that dives deep below the surface to explore themes of vision, belief and faith. The family drama is still right at the center and is quite effective, and Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are excellent to their roles. The film doesn't give anything new at the horror movie genre, but its set pieces are often impressive, even if sometimes rely a bit on jump scares. The truth is that "The Conjuring 2" has enough suspense and story to have appeal for all kinds of horror fans and is a film clever enough to scare us. nikisreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gerne-bending, ground-breaking and an absolute classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing about The Conjuring series is that it screams classic right at the first few scenes and just works its way up from there. While The Conjuring is definitely being remembered as one of the most excellent horror movies in decades, its sequel does even a better job by providing some extra well-done scenes that are not normally seen within the gerne. But how about the scare part? Is it scary? Definitely yes. Don't bother comparing it to the first one. Just enjoy the movie and you will find yourself holding your breath until the very last moment. Vera Farmiga was superb. Her presence was so strong, and powerful that she managed to pull the viewer through all kind of emotions. Patrick Wilson was also wonderful indeed. There are some subtle little hints about a sequel here and there in the movie. If those two continues to star (and also with James Wan), there is no doubt that it would be another masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, better than the first one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really surprised about what an amazing job James Wan did with this sequel. From the very start it captures you and keeps you attached to the screen. There is no way you can get bored. I loved the suspense that goes increasing pretty quickly through the whole film, I could feel my heart in my ears beating faster as the atmosphere grew creeper and creeper. I enjoyed all the small details threw around such as the name of the demon that was showed in the Warren's house more than once in the background, leaving me with the question "Why that word keeps being repeated? Nobody in that house has that name!" only at the end I figured out what it meant. I absolutely adored the whole plot and the plot twist within. Make up and special effects were crazy, they made you get chills running down your spine. The soundtrack was impeccable, it played a big part in creating the right atmosphere. Few jump scares, very well situated, some of them very unpredictable. Didn't see a couple of them coming, at all. I found that Vera Farmiga was absolutely stunning with her performance in this movie. I loved the way Lorraine had her "moment" when stepping in to save her husband condemning the demonic entity back to hell. She was incredibly intense. Personally, I think Patrick Wilson did a better job in this movie compared to the first. I felt like Ed and his relationship with Lorraine was a lot more highlighted. I highly recommend this movie. If you are a fan of the paranormal you can't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genre saturation Showcase.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't take me wrong. I did not hate The conjuring 2. It is an enjoyable film, in many terms. But I need to stress out, that this is one of the many films that have come lately, which is absolutely all about selling the product. The Hype. The anticipation. The goal of the producers lies 1 second after the ticket is sold, and not quite 1 second after the film is over. The conjuring 2 takes its context out of a very documented paranormal case which took place in England in 1977. It narrates the story of a family of 5, single mom, and 4 children, which are tormented by a spirit, and who eventually, get to be assisted by experts-in-these-topics Ed and Loraine Warren.The premise might not be original at all, but it still works. The problem comes when such a premise is used at an attempt to pull off an over 2 hours long feature film. About 30 minutes in, you will start to notice that this film is desperate. It is desperate to make you scared and live up to its own trailers and expectations. It might succeed on some (mostly children under 14 who sneaked inside the theater or whose irresponsible parents lied about their age at the ticket booth). But seasoned horror film enthusiasts will be able to anticipate almost every single jump-scare or even take a leap of faith and predict the outcome of a whole scene. Why? Because everything that happens in the conjuring 2, you have already seen or experienced in other films. This is the type of film you can watch with a notebook and start checking those clichés as they appear. The effort through which the writers struggled to come out with anything barely original or "never seen" before is noticeable, and every time they fail. Now considering this film is 110+min long, you will get tired quickly of hearing a loud noise, the a scream, and the some generic paranormal door slam, or furniture dash, because it happens a lot, and it get old a lot faster.Don't get me wrong. It is not a trash film. Production values alone are worth the ticket. The film is beautifully filmed, in dark and ominous colors, and the house looks stunning even in almost 95% darkness. The music is interesting and tense, and the acting is top notch. (And the vile nun got myself quite convinced it was Marilyn Manson) But if you're there for the technical specs of it, you could have gone to other place to watch Citizen Kane.It saddens me a little, to be witness of the decadence of the horror genre. Where most of the production money goes towards jump-scare roller-coaster rides like this one. The recipe for box office success was found, and they just keep making the same cake with different glazing. You will probably notice that before the film even starts, when you see that 4 trailers, and then you cannot make the difference between the 4 generic horror movies you've been shown. Probably you won't even be able to recall the names of the films. Because it doesn't matter. 3 stars. Enjoyable overall, but terribly generic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely scarier than the first!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really counting on this movie to raise my scare level to the top, and if you haven't seen this movie, you have no idea what I am talking about! Oh my gosh, this film was freaking terrifying! For three years I was plagued with nightmares of the first movie, and i didn't think any movie could be more scary. Conjuring 2 definitely proved me wrong! Not only were there jump scares but REAL horror, not just being startled by a loud noise but James Wan shows us what real horror is. There were many rising suspense scenes and you have no idea what will happen. That is what scary is! Demons are what true scariness are. What lurks in the darkness is something to be terrified about. And this movie shows us this perfectly. Like I said it does have jump scares, and I appreciated that, why? BECAUSE NONE IF THEM ARE FALSE, they were not a cat jumping out or a character popping out, every single one was real and lived up to the rising suspense that was built up. Not only is it scary but it is an awesome story. As a matter of fact a TRUR STORY. It was very well told and unlike most horror movies today it actually had a PLOT. The twist in the end is brilliant, unpredictable and pieced together the plot elements well. Also greatly shot, greatly acted and great character development. Unlike most horror movies this has Likable CHARACTERS. Unlike most horror movies it's not a gore fest or has countless swear words, it's rated R JUST because of how SCARY it is. I love James Wan he is terrific at what he does. Every horror director now days NEEDS to see the insidious trilogy and of course the 2 conjuring movies. This has restored my faith in horror movies! I definitely recommend it. See it with your spouse, friends, girlfriend or boyfriend (definitely do not bring your kids) and you will have the thrill of a lifetime! By the way you might want to look under your bed tonight! &#x1f609;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has it's flaws, but overall even scarier than it's predecessor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was able to see 'The Conjuring 2' at an advanced screening last night and I left feeling surprisingly satisfied. I can't remember the last time I saw a horror sequel that was able to hold it's own against it's predecessor, but with James Wan at the helm; I went in cautiously optimistic. Let me say off the bat that this movie is legitimately scary. It's the scariest horror film I've seen in a while and it does have genius scares, despite having many in the first half that felt a little cheap. This brings me to my biggest problem with 'The Conjuring 2'. Though this movie is consistently intense and definitely never boring, I felt that the first 50-or-so minutes were often formulaic and ineffective. This is a structural problem that I had and I'm sure it won't be a problem for many audience members. That entire first act consists of many individual scenes that all end in a scare, and the majority of these scares don't necessarily feel earned. So as a result; this section of the film often feels repetitive and drawn out. By this, I mean that one specific character reacts to one disturbing scare by not telling anyone about it. It also includes a few clichés that didn't greatly affect the plot and wouldn't be missed (e.g Ouija board, children hearing something and getting out of bed to look for it; seriously this happens way too many times in this movie). I'm perfectly fine with film-makers experimenting with structure, but I'm afraid it just didn't work for me in this movie. In fact it's a-scare-a-scene design came off as conventional and peddling to the masses. I think the film would have benefited from a greater focus on slow-building tension.Any problems within the troubled first act are nothing in comparison to the tension and legitimate terror rife throughout the last hour. In fact I feel confident enough in saying that I found this film to be even scarier than the first in the series. I found the music to be nothing particularly standout on it's own, but it worked well within the context of the movie and is greatly responsible for the tension created throughout. The performances from Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga were very good and the child actors were able to hold their own and not be just "good for kids". This film took risks in it's presentation including the design of many of the entities seen throughout, and I thought that this mostly remained effective. So overall; I found this to be an extremely successful horror film. I admire James Wan's ambition and I was impressed by his masterful use of long takes. I felt that the flaws in this film were greatly outweighed by it's achievements and I will definitely be checking it out again soon. In my opinion this is the best horror sequel since 'Evil Dead II' and I would definitely recommend it. Go check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the biggest disappointments of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK everyone you can choose what to believe when it comes to the user reviews but my point of view this has to be on the low end of James wans' work. The movie had its moments of scary things happening but juxtaposing to all his other works this quite a let down. Majority of the "tension" scenes were very obvious and highly predictable e.g boy hears something scary, looks around corner to be nothing, looks away and spooky noise happens again, he's confused, slight tension then boom jump scare.Comparing to the original that shy'd away from using cgi or any kind of "showing" of the haunting The Conjuring 2 reverted to using concerning B grade level of cgi which did not flatter anything.There were plot holes, poor dialogue in some cases too many supernatural story lines going on at once that had me going "why is this even included" The ending had me wanting to leave the cinema because it pretty much reminded me of PIMP MY RIDE. With it concluding as a demon possessing a ghost with that ghost possessing a young girl... "Yo dawg we heard you like hauntings so we possessed your ghost with a demon so you can get possessed while being haunted" *peace signs* *hip-hop music playing*tldr; its a money grab movie and don't waste your time with it, see it if someone else pays for it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too dumb to be scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be fair, the movie is scary (at least if you watch it in a theater) for about one hour, not because of the story, but because of its typical jump scares: the music, the camera movement, the light, and everything else prepares you for something horrible to happen, but it does not happen when you expect it; a couple of seconds later BAM! Even though I don't like jump scares in the movies (for the same reason I don't like them in real life), they can at least scare you. The other supposedly scary parts, like throwing furniture around or making loud and non-sense noises are not scary, but rather dumb and boring.After one hour, the movie becomes dumb and dumber. I believe the most ridiculous scene is the one that Ed communicates with the Bill's spirit through Janet and tries to talk him out of harassing the family: they first introduce each other; then Ed asks the spirit very nicely to leave the poor family alone; the Bill's spirit argues that this is his home and they should go; Ed replies that Bill is dead, so technically speaking he cannot have a house, etc. In my opinion, knowing who the demon is and what it seeks is bad enough to ruin a horror movie, but bringing the demon into the negotiating table and getting to know him through a face-to-face meeting is beyond my imagination. This ridiculous scene ends with Ed pointing a cross at the Bill's spirit to repel it from Janet's body. I'm really wondering that if a cross is powerful enough to get rid of the evil, does it really have to be pointed at the evil to work? After this scene, nothing makes any sense any more. We just have to wait for the nights to come, because that's when the bad things happen. But we don't really know what it is that the "demonic presence" of the house wants. If it wants to get rid of the family, it can kill them all quite easily, as it seems to be very powerful: it can throw the furniture around, destroy the walls, control all the objects, teleport people and stick them into the walls or the ceilings. What are the powers and the limits of such demon? In one scene, we see it repelled by a cross; in another scene, it puts on quite a show by rotating several crosses. If the demon is after Ed and Lorraine, why does it devise a plan to make them leave the house? Why don't the family move out from this place? It's not like other haunted house movies when nobody believes the possessed person; in this movie, the paranormal events occur right before everybody's eyes. As I said, there is no logic in this movie at all.Furthermore, I found most of the "smart" scenes of the movie quite funny as well: the way Ed discovered the actual demon of the house by playing two records simultaneously; or the way Lorraine found out the demon's name in her dream, and the way she just needed to say the demon's name to send it back to hell, and the part that Ed talked to Bill's spirit in the first place. Finally, I really enjoyed the fact that Ed and Lorraine keep souvenirs of the "cases" they solve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>something wicked this way comes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first conjuring was scary tense and original. It scared you when you least expected it and it scared you even when you expected it. the sequel However is the first time a horror movie ever gave me Goose bumps. Never has a movie ever given me goosebumps.Does that tell you something ? the direction is top rate and the acting is solid. The pacing is superb as the director lets the story unfold at it's own pace. Like the first movie. The conjuring 2 borrows from the real life case files of Ed and Lorraine Warren two real life Ghost hunters that had a knack for getting the truth out. The Film opens up in the famous Amityville Horror house and goes from that investigation which Lorraine said the evil in that house is as close to Hell as she ever wanted to get. Then the story moves to England and the house of a normal family named Hodgson and the stark horror that awaited them, The Enfield Haunting as it came to be known has the distinction of being one of the most documented cases in the area of the paranormal. Things occurred there that no one can explain. From Cops to Paranormal scientists no one could explain how it was done from scratching inside the walls to the Young girl named Janet being tortured and speaking in voices. Of course there is the people that tried hard to disprove it and only muddled the waters further. When the attacks intensify and the Catholic Church is brought into it the Church sends in Ed and Lorraine to investigate Not to get involved just observe. Lorraine is plagued by fear that if they do get involved it'll mean Ed's death. but from the moment they get there things escalate to the point that the warrens realize they can't just sit back and observe. there is danger here and Janet is targeted for death by the vengeful spirit.And so begins a struggle to find out just what it is they're dealing with a ghost Demon or hoax. That struggle is going to lead the warrens to the edge of despair and it might cost them dearly in the end.the Story is based on true events. But like the conjuring the conjuring 2 is based on the fact that the warrens investigated the haunting. they never solved it. They never had epic battles like the films suggested. but that's reality and we are looking for entertainment and as entertainment this is entertainment of the finest kind. Best money you'll ever spend at the movies this year. and best money you'll send renting or buying the DVD. In other Words Go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap and full of stupid clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, I don't understand why this movie got such a high rating on IMDb (7.9 at this moment).First. The whole thing is boring and predictable. And come on, it doesn't take much skill to scare a viewer with a sudden and loud shriek, accompanied by some puppet jumping into the screen. And they do that in the movie all the time, they do it a lot. And this is very low class for a horror movie, if you ask me.Second. The music and sound effects. They serve just one purpose here - to teach the stupid spectator how to react at certain moments. Like "look, if you didn't notice, it's a really tender family moment, say 'awww, how sweet'", "and here it's ominous". Come on, we're not that stupid! We don't need THAT many hints! Third. There's a lot of clichés. I mean it. Wind-up toy truck moving on it's own - how original! Then some vintage-looking toy with spooky pictures that come alive, then happy children's lough in the distance, then some background cathedral singing, then scary faces that only show in the mirror, then low-frequency growling - I can go on and on. It's boring. I know I've said earlier, but it really is.But what got me the most, is that the creators of the movie exploit that "based on true events" line, and they are quite shameless on that. It's NOT based on true events in the full sense of this word. It's based on the STORY which is told by a couple of very successful hoaxers. And the main female character - her acting was all about delivering just one image, it was all about that look on her face: "ah, I'm so enlightened, I posses hidden wisdom, I pity you, stupid hectic humankind"Not a good movie. Just a bunch of old and cheap tricks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Conjuring 2" Is Equivalent To Its Predecessor, Diabolically Creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Wan is the genuine Sir Alfred Hitchcock of the 21st centuryThree years ago, the world went crazy with the 5th invention of the Malay director, James Wan - my king, master and role model -. "The Conjuring" triumphs in critics and box office bringing a breakthrough and resurgence to horror movies in the last decade, it was compared with classics like "The Exorcist" and "The Omen" and is considered as the master jewel of Malayan and the cinematographic of horror. Wan has continuously been providing us great achievements in commercial films, since his major debut as a director with "Saw" in 2004 to his first action film "7 Furious" last year; his shiny and original style to portray suspense and horror through each frame, has made to the director reaches to the top of podium of the films, not only in the horror genre, also the action genre, and we hope more he'll try to experiment. "The Conjuring 2" opens the same iconic way that its predecessor, now is the famous case of Amityville (112 Ocean Avenue) which reveals to Ed and Lorraine Warren, the renowned paranormal investigators duo. Amityville was the event that gave them renown and recognition to investigators, but not by their horrible experiences, but by unbelief and ignorance of the people, which didn't believe it possible that those things happen. Later, within the film, we continue to validating in a 90s TV Show lack of confidence and credibility of the people towards the Warrens. Ironically, that skepticism would be powered once more with the Enfield Poltergeist, the case more documented to paranormal level. The famous massacre (DeFeo family) has been adapted millions and millions of times a big screen, however, Wan manages to save that gloomy essence of the night of the murder and projects it of a delirious and disturbing way in Lorraine's head, from the first minutes, "HORROR" genre shines.The Enfield Case is adapted with purity and splendor of a script credited to Carey Hayes and Chad Hayes &amp; James Wan and David Leslie Johnson. Wan dodges references of the two small programs have focused on the event (BBC's "Ghostwatch" and Timothy Spall's miniseries) to develop to Ed and Lorraine in the story (in real life, Warrens had not the least significance in the case, they only evidenced it one night). The film takes its time - somebody says that enough, I for one, the more see James's delights more I go crazy - to introduces the destabilized life of Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor). The events happened in a interval between 1977 and 1979, to capture each sublime moment of the epoch, it was vital the intervention of the Department of costume led by Kristin Burke, the Department of light and art led by Fiona Gavin, A. Todd Holland and Andrew Rothschild, which not exaggerated in capturing the atmosphere of the 70s and 80s. Wan is amazing to recreate complex and refined milieus and sets, every shadow, square, furniture, door, toy and even each color play a fundamental role in the creation of the style of the director, a director who is delicately precise with his details, even though was a humble house, without many luxuries or support tools, the visual tension is concurrent.On a night as any, Hodgson family is sleeping peacefully after a tiring day. Two of the four children, Janet (Madison Wolfe) and Margaret (Lauren Esposito) are awakened abruptly from their nap by an unknown entity, immediately, they go to tell what happened them to her mother, who refuses to believe and finds an Ouija board manually made by her daughters. Next day, harassment persist more sharply up to the point that the mother experiences with her own eyes paranormal events - James's interesting proposal to not to fall into the cliché that nobody believes them. Meanwhile, a suggestive sub-plot takes place in Warren family. Lorraine tends to keep fragments of each case and in their latest investigations, she sees to the Demon Nun (Bonnie Aarons), a superb and shocking demonic nun who torments them with a sinister intent, that purpose will intertwine of a sumptuous way with Hodgson's ending (which never happened).Wan knows how to distort every trick in his favor, rung by rung construction makes that final climax has really earned. Wan is distinguished by the ability to frighten or intimidate the audience with shots both day as at night, he knows play and combine the tools that possesses, knows to keep constant tone of his film, he doesn't allow his audience to sleep, and even though this time he uses to more jump-scares than its predecessor, are equally enjoyable and are not shamelessly used. All of the above is essential in the foundations, however, the actors take all the credit Ed, Lorraine, Peggy and her four children (especially Janet) are fabulous, measured and charismatic."The Conjuring 2" is credited with the title "Horror film of the year" and is used for viewing the constant advancement of its director within the genre, it's hard to watch and hear, the film is not suitable for hearts or minds weak, "The Conjuring 2" an instant classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>definitely not the "masterpiece/modern classic" it has been hyped up to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is going to be less of a review and more of a rant, so let me get the good parts of the movie out of the way. It's competently acted, and there isn't a bad child actor in the bunch. It's also pretty well shot, with James Wan using long shots where the camera floats around and through windows and walls, giving it a feeling of omnipotence. Now for the bad.The intro is god awful. I'm not exaggerating when I say it made my entire theater erupt in laughter as Lorraine Warren pulled out in invisible shotgun to murder a family in a sort of dream-sequence. This accompanied by the fact that her hands are sped up every time she pulls the lever back to reload turn an intentionally "intense" introduction into a self-parody. Next, this movie's CGI is also god awful. They were so lazy with so many parts that it's almost unbelievable how this movie has been made out to be a masterpiece by so many people. Instead of using a prop cigarette that produces smoke they said "f**k it" and just made crappy CG smoke. Instead of using machines to produce fake snow or create realistic rain effects the crew must have decided that was gonna take too much effort so they instead just CG'd the rain and snow effects. And they aren't even good CG like in the fast and furious movies that Wan does. It's like he decided his VFX and FX crews should be made up of entirely by monkeys with down-syndrome. The 2spooky4me memelord skelingtons in this movie don't look any better. The possessed girl (yeah I'll get to the clichés of the story later) is completely CG, including her fake face veins and Sh**ty cat-monster eyes, and the evil nun demon monster that makes no sense has a Cg mouth tentacle thing that looks straight out of the resident evil movies that shouldn't be getting made anymore. But the icing on this @ss flavored cake is the amazing idea to put the skeleton from "The Nightmare Before Christmas" in this movie, complete with the wonky frame rate that comes with claymation that makes things look like they aren't really moving right. It doesn't make sense on an artistic level (cause it isn't F!^&amp;%%!%^@CKing scary!), and even less sense in a real life level. The dog literally transforms into the monster in front of a little boys very eyes. Like if it has this power why did it decide to use it only right there and never again. That's probably more useful than just about every other monsters' power in this movie, yet it just decides to do it once and only for the spooks cause lol this movie is so scary right guys gosh James Wan u master of horror u. ALso CGI tree spikes killing major characters in hallucinations is definitely 100% super intense not fake looking at all gr8 job m8 8/8.OK for my favorite part, the story. It. Doesn't. Make. F**king. Sense....... Like I've seen so many message boards trying to understand certain motivations and all I can think is "guys. No one writing this movie gave a sh!t. There is no explanation...". So first off the main antagonist is valak or whatever and he can only be defeated by finding out then saying his name yadda yadda yadda cliché cliché cliché sure whatever. Now this nun monster valak enters the movie in physical form to terrorize Lorraine Warren once in her little spirit world, and once inside her house (btw the house scene, this movies so-called "scariest scene of the decade", is absolutely retarded. the demon literally grabs a picture, uses it as a face, and runs at Lorraine while both its hands are still holding the picture. It looks like those kids that try to do Naruto ninja running because their parents don't love them). Now you might be saying, why does she do that? Well wouldn't you know it, the house the Warrens investigate just so happens to be terrorized by Valak. So Valak must have been f@cking with Lorraine to try and draw her and her husband to the house right? Except as soon as they get to the house the demon tries to make it look like the family is faking everything, and therefore tries and almost succeeds in making the paranormal investigators leave. What was the point in haunting Lorraine then? If it wasn't to draw her to the house the only explanation can be just to scare the audience. In fact drawing them to the house only leads to the demon being defeated. There is absolutely no reason Lorraine should be seeing this ghost unless it is through some kind of ghost world logic that the movie never explains. If that is true then it's pretty f*&amp;#*cking stupid to not explain a major lore/plot element like that to the audience once... God this movie makes me want to jump off the roof of my house more than everyday life already does so i rate it 3/10 don't see it unless you want cancer I hope somebody actually reads this big wall- of-text review</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre jump scares, no originality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As horror movies go, it has some passable scares and the acting isn't bad, but it's ridiculously contrived and predictable. The director (James Wan) is talented but he's seriously lacking in originality.The biggest issue I have with this movie is the story. It's painfully obvious throughout that the narrative is heavily edited by the bias of the Warrens themselves, especially with the scene on television where the skeptic shares the stage, and not in a helpful way, as far as the plot is concerned. It ends up being quite muddled and eye-rollingly forced.If you enjoyed The Conjuring (2013) you'll probably enjoy this one too, but for people looking for genuinely terrifying movies, you'll probably be disappointed. Instead, check out Shutter (2004), The Orphanage (2007), and Mama (2013).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read a lot of reviews on here about how this movie was extremely scary and it was better than the first movie. After watching it I totally disagree. I was hoping to be scared, although it just seemed like all the scares were all just quick jumpy scares, and that gets boring if that is what all the scares are. Over time the scares began to become less frequent which made the movie very tiresome near the end. I was really trying my hardest to stay awake near the end of the movie because it got really slow and boring. The ending was very weak as well, nothings worse than a quick ending almost like a snap of your fingers and its over. That is what this movie felt like at the end. I didn't really even like the first movie, however It had my attention more in this movie. My review may have been higher if i had some green helpers with me to watch the movie although i did not and I was disappointed because of it. Wait to see it on DVD when it comes out are my thoughts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Un-Scary Schlock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm easily frightened by movies. I've never been able to get through Disney's "Pinocchio." "The Conjuring 2" is one of the least scary movies I've ever seen. I laughed out loud several times. I thought it was so ridiculous, heavy-handed, absurd, over-the-top. I was actually scared during one scene. Patrick Wilson, as paranormal investigator and allegedly Catholic anti-demon commando Ed Warren, wades into standing water underneath a suburban home. Everyone knows anyone who wades into standing water in a domestic setting risks being electrocuted. Alas, the only menace Warren faces is the cardboard outline of a standard-issue specter who rolls up behind him. Boo! The other scary factor: how old Franka Potente, who plays paranormal investigator Anita Gregory, has gotten. Back in 1998's "Run Lola Run" Potente was the embodiment of youth. Now ? she's in her forties. Scary. I honestly don't know what filmmaker James Wan was trying to achieve. Was he really trying to make a scary movie, or was he trying to make a meta-commentary on how schlocky scary movies can be? I hope the latter, because that is what he has achieved. The saving grace of the film is the presence of Vera Farmiga, an actress who deserves so much better than this, but who shines like sterling amidst the dross. "The Conjuring 2," just like the original "The Conjuring," is based on an allegedly true story. In 1977, in Enfield, England, two sisters, 11 and 13, claimed to be experiencing demonic possession. They were the child of a single mother and lived in a council house, that is a government welfare house. There was video footage proving that one of the girls was faking. Never fear. Ed and Lorraine Warren, an American couple who sold themselves as real live paranormal investigators and exorcists, showed up. "The Conjuring 2" wallows in 1970s nostalgia. That there even is such a thing as "70s nostalgia" is evidence of the demonic. The men all wear wide lapels and wolfman sideburns. There is a lot of emphasis on retro tech, like bulky reel to reel tape recorders ? the kind that actually could capture Satan's voice, whereas today's hand-held digital devices just don't pack the same punch. There is a loooong pointless scene where Patrick Wilson, as Ed Warren, treats the possessed children to an imitation of Elvis Presley singing "I Can't Help Falling In Love with You." Watching this endless scene, I really wondered what was going on with James Wan, the director. Is he tired of cheap, teen horror and does he want a career as an artiste and auteur? "The Conjuring 2" is really hard to look at. The allegedly haunted Enfield council house is visually repugnant. There are threadbare, royal blue chairs on a threadbare, royal blue rug. If you have any taste at all, you know what horror I dare invoke with these words. Everything in the house is begrimed. It looks as if a toddler had been rolled in molasses and car exhaust and then set loose on every fixture. And of course the family is so poor that they can't afford a single one-hundred watt bulb. The house is kept at forty-watt level throughout the film. The allegedly scary stuff: kids levitate and speak in deep voices. A scary nun appears. If you've ever gone to Catholic school you are laughing as hard as I was at this point. The nun looks so much like Marilyn Manson that I'm sure his lawyers are asking for their cut of the film's box office. There are some cinematic classics in the horror genre. James Whale's Frankenstein is indelible. "The Haunting" from 1963 is one of the most profound and disturbing films ever made. These films are about so much more than James Wan's bag of tricks, which consists of sending an impaired person into a dark space ? say, Patrick Wilson after he's been partially blinded by escaping steam from a broken radiator, having that person stumble about, holding the camera on one spot for a long time, and then having a scary nun pop suddenly into the frame. Horror classics have something truly menacing and challenging behind the costume. There is something truly scary behind "The Conjuring 2" and behind the Amityville Horror, another Warren cause celebre. In both cases, we are talking about broken families. We are talking about kids who have troubled relationships with their parents, or absent parents. Shenanigans like the Warren's obscure the real facts that really need to be addressed. At least two of the children who grew up in the Amityville home say that they were abused by their stepfather. We were so busy looking for demons in that house we couldn't see the kids being hurt. Another disturbing aspect of this film. I'm really sick of James Wan's exploitation of Catholicism, a religion he evidences zero respect for but loves to exploit in order to plump up his box office. Wan is constantly tossing crucifixes, rosaries, and clerical garb onto his piles of junk. Ed Warren, in "Conjuring 2," references the Catholic Church so many times it is monotonous. Wan is from Malaysia, a Muslim majority country. He is himself Chinese. I do not see him denigrating Islam or Confucianism in his films. He wants to avoid any risk of true horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love the first Conjuring movie. When I watch that movie, it gets under my skin. I actually feel troubled and somewhat terrible after watching it. I rank the first movie rather high. It bothers me almost as much as the Exorcist does. I don't even like to watch it at night. The feeling of dread in that movie is heavy. In the sequel, my patience was challenged a bit. It plays out like a sampler of far better films such as Poltergeist and The Evil Dead. It's fun for what it is: a popcorn movie. If you enjoy fun ghost movies, see this one. If you're expecting a movie on the level of the first Conjuring, you may find yourself a bit disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Wan has proved himself again as The Conjuring 2 outshone the first one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THIS IS A NO SPOILER REVIEW Wow. Trust me guys, this movie is extremely good. The casting is perfect. The storyline is very very good, and as a 'Horror' movie, it's very very scary. This movie has everything really. But more importantly, James Wan has proved us again that he's the best horror movie director today. The Conjuring 2 and Insidious 1 are the two scariest horror movies that actually have a great plot in both that I have ever experienced in the 21st Century. I looked at every single details in this movie and it is f**king flawless. The casting of Janet (Madison Wolfe) is brilliant. This is her biggest performance ever in a movie and she is fantastic. She is a star, and throughout this movie, she really shines. The music is fantastic. It's very very old schooled. One scene involving a music will warmth your heart. It teared me up a little bit, and if you have watched it, you know which one I'm talking about. But my God, the music, the setting, and all of these little details supported how the movie feels like we're watching a 1977 movie. Most of all, James Wan directed it perfectly. For once in a horror movie, it actually have stories. I mean the other horror movies are just there to grab people's money. Paranormal Activity is an example. This movie involved a family, the power of love, religion, and supporting one another until the end. This movie contained messages and there are themes. There's a difference between a 'horror' movie involving killings and deaths and blood, and a true horror film involving a story based on a true story and a very good plot and characters. Finally, Patrick Wilson. I love this man. He is truly perfect for Horror movies as he has starred in Insidious and Conjuring (Both the most successful horror films directed by James Wan), and he made that character alive in this one. There is one 'Con' about this one and it really doesn't affect how the viewers see it but I just need to point it out. The ending made the 'true story' into a fantasy really as it involved the power of love and a happy end. But really, the ending was good in my opinion, but it just doesn't seem real at all, but do not let this ending be an excused to not watch the movie because you will miss out. If you love movies, this is a fantastic horror film. If you love horror films, this is a must watch. Overall, this movie deserves a 9.4/10. Thanks for reading the review guys, and if you like it, hit the yes button.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seriously don't get the hype around The Conjuring &amp; Insidious. They go so over the top I can't take them seriously. What ever happened to a slow burn or subtlety in horror? Don't get me wrong, I love high concept horror or a good cheese fest too. Evil Dead, Poltergeist, Hellraiser... they're not exactly documentary level BUT Conjuring sets itself up as some kind of 'realistic' horror. Constantly reminding us 'Based on a true story' well then give me a little credibility. 'The Amityville Horror' or 'The Haunted' have a foot in reality that revvs up near the end to good effect. This film lets go of reality from the beginning and personally no amount of loud jump scares can make up for a complete lack of atmosphere. They even cram in things that didn't even happen in the 'real' story. A freaking ghost nun demon? Or how about a scene were a dog turns into an 8 foot tall crooked man? A scene so far out the box even a Nightmare on Elm Street sequel looks low key by comparison. The actors playing the mother Peggy and the oldest daughter put on the worst 'cockney' accents I've heard since my high school presentation of Oliver Twist.</fullReview>

I loved the first one and when I found out about the 2nd one I thought, "Yeah I don't know, most likely going to be really bad." Then I saw the trailer and thought" Hmmm this doesn't look half bad." Then I finally got to see it tonight and I couldn't believe how amazed I was at it! It was scary, suspenseful and jumpy. One thing I loved about it is that they get straight into the action, they don't wait 20 minutes to scare the living hell out of you. They like to throw in a jump-scare 2-3 minutes into the film. They don't add some crappy, boring, 20-minute introduction scene know one cares to see. It's BOOM into it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Wan fails yet again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Wan is creatively bankrupt, and grossly over rated. I went to see The Conjuring 2 today with a friend and I was completely fed up by the end.The movie starts off with a blatant marketing pitch for what I'm guessing is going to be 'The Conjuring 3'. Why else introduce the Amityville Horror at the beginning which has absolutely nothing to do with the Enfield Poltergeist? It's just so James Wan can keep milking his franchise like he did with The Conjuring 1 with Annabelle, and the god awful Insidious series etc. Either that or they will make a spin off featuring Marilyn Manson in a nuns outfit.So then the film shifts to London, with a cringe-worthy attempt of signifying that we are now in London by playing London Calling by The Clash. Cue stock footage of very British things and blah blah blah we are in a school playground where we meet Janet and then its over to her house to meet her caricature mother. The mother who has the most fake sounding cockney accent you will ever hear. In England we refer to it as 'mockney'. It's so over done and put on you wonder why Wan didn't just hire an actress from Eastenders. The acting may have been worse but at least you'd have more of a real sounding London accent. That scene where she goes into the basement of the house with a mate to mess about with the washing machine, I felt like I was watching a live London stage show. Where the actors over do the acting and accent.Thankfully, I wasn't the only one in the cinema who laughed out loud at the actor playing Maurice Grosse. Another awful, awful representation of a real person. His moustache and hair looked glued on and again was nothing more than a hilarious caricature. Most of the extras in this movie (people playing the police etc) had no fluidity at all, just a stale rigid performance devoid of anything you could relate to real people.Every 'scary' scene is a loud bass thump accompanied by a jump scare. This is the extent of James Wans creative vision. Mind you, I will give him credit for the chair scene where Janet is blurred out in the background and old Bill comes for a chat with Patrick Wilson. You can see bills face form slowly as he talks. Thats as good as the film got.There was no tension, no atmosphere, nothing. The inside of the house was HUGE for a London council flat. Flats like that are tiny in reality.And the demons great plan for Mr Warrens demise was to make him fall from the top window and impale him on a sharp tree branch below? LOL. Come on Wan, this is something a child would come up with.The film got silly at many points, especially that cgi demon that came out of the dog. Just degraded the movie further and was comical more than anything.The first time BIll speaks through Janet when the press are there in the living room just sounded ridiculous.Again, the use of religion to combat the evil just got on my nerves. Apparently Ed Warrens cross on his necklace warded off evil spirits but Janets room full of crucifixes on the wall did diddly squat. Any one else getting fed up to the back teeth of good vs evil involving religion? The acting was adequate enough but Madison Wolfe makes no impression what so ever. The other child actors were good enough I suppose.There's nothing here you haven't seen before. James Wan uses the same old tedious, trite tricks and just copy and pastes from his other movies, with the exception of a differently arranged type of jump scare etc. He lacks vision and creativity. All he is, is a commercially viable hack making watered down 'horror' for the lowest common denominator. Generation 'apphole' will eat this crap up like its the best thing 'evaaaa' and hail Wan as a movie making god.The emperor has no clothes.</fullReview>

It was scary, the psychologically horror was present but not for long, until the second and the third act. It became another jump scare horror. And it became a bit predictable at worst. You know exactly what's going to happen next. On the other hand, my girlfriend, who was a bit wuss at horror movies, enjoyed the movie and she was genuinely scared as well.Therefore 4 stars from me, making it decent horror/jump scare movie, enjoyable fun for the whole family maybe not for the children, but for friends and adult family.</fullReview>

In my opinion he could have paid a little more attention to the plot and story which miserably fails to grabs you for more than 10 minutes. Also he just killed the main ghost of the movie who has hardly managed to scare us, just like that, where did the old man went??? The CG is pathetic, specially the dog turning into old man scene, hideous. Admit it James Wan you have failed again and stop making cheap publicity stunts "like people are dying in cinemas and all the crap".

I can't see why it has such a high rating, probably there are people who want other people to make the mistake to watch this movie just to feel better for themselves for wasting 2 hours and 14 minutes of their lives. Though, the nun was pretty cool and that's the only reason I'm giving this 4/10. Have I forgot to mention there were some cringey moments who shouldn't even be there, were they supposed to make me feel connected to the characters?

		<fullReview>I honestly preferred the first Conjuring. The sequel didn't live up to my expectations. Having researched the real recordings and such this should have never been made into a film. I really wish they would have chosen a more "Involved" case file that the Warrens had actually had a huge part in. I feel like "The Conjuring 2" could have been so much better if there were a different case they were focusing on. This movie could have exceeded it's potential, but for me at least it just wasn't the right focus for a sequel. I do have high hopes for a "Conjuring 3" in the attempt to make up for "The Conjuring 2". In my book this just didn't scare me at all as a horror fanatic and I'm a very disappointed fan. I really had high hopes for this sequel and it let me down dramatically.</fullReview>

Don't waste the 2 hours and 18 mins. watching this stinker.......come on James, go back to making really scary movies like the first one, or Dead Silence. This was just awful. Went with others who were ready to walk out.If you want the scary version watch the 6 hour docu-series that was just on BBC America last month or so, that was so so so so boring, but at least it was more interesting than this was.

Such a mighty ghost and just bothering a handful of people, uh...Not a big fan of horror, but like good ones, this one is not. If you want to see some girls flying around or stick to the ceiling, go for this. Otherwise save your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jump Scares and very little else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of the horror genre, one must be disappointed with the quality of movies being churned out by "Hollywood" in the last 4-5 years. Conjuring was one of the exceptions, albeit partially. It managed an effective combination of jump scares and build-up. I, for one, love the horror genre, not for the former but the latter. Extensive experience in this genre has trained us well on the wheres, hows and whats and hence, build-up is what should matter most.It is extremely disappointing to see the extent to which jump scares were employed by the makers having established themselves in the 'true story' mould with the first movie. They even aped camera angles adopted in the documentaries on the Enfield haunting, for crying out loud!I was distraught when I read somewhere that the nun sequences were added as an afterthought. Wonder if the movie would have been better without these scenes?!The Elvis part, bad. The climax, worse. The unwanted VFX, worst.Hoping for a better 'true story' with the next installment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very worth your time if you are looking for a good scare. With no swearing literally at all, not much violence or gore, and no drug or alcohol use, this movie gets its r rating solely for how scary it is. James Wan is a genius director. I hope for more installments to this series. I mean, thats all i really have to say. Im now just typing to fill 10 lines so i can send this review. This is no "jump scare slasher" film, this is real terror. There are jump scares, but more like you jump and then stay in the air. the scare keeps going. I audibly screamed a few curse words at the screen. A single tear shed from my eye at one point. This movie is very very scary. Its scary but so good! I loved every second of it! Sorry for mistakes or confusion. This is my first review. This is hopefully the very last sentence that i will have to write.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Scary....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not enjoy the first film so going into this I wasn't expecting much. This film did not surprise me in any way. This film was carried by the acting which was worth 2 stars. However, the story which was convoluted and predictable is worth 0. The cinematography was good, but it was brought down by all the other troubles the movie had. A very distracting film. Imagine a two year old with the lungs of an Olympic swimmer screeching into your ear. That was 75% of the sound design. This film would have made a great made for TV movie on the CW. Skip this film please, because you're not missing anything. In a word, forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing here for seasoned horror fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I re-watched the first one on Friday night and enjoyed it a lot more than the first time I watched it. Having seen nearly all of the James Wan Horror films (Insidious, Annabelle, Saw) you have to appreciate that The Conjuring 1 &amp; 2 are the best of these types of 'horror' film. I say 'horror' because this isn't true horror. There is nothing in any of these films that any long time horror fan hasn't seen many times before. James Wan seems to have an approach where instead of trying to avoid the clichés and tropes of modern day horror, he just throws EVERY conceivable 'trick' into a blender and hopes for the best. The first few scares of Conjuring 2 fell completely flat with me. Just when I was beginning to lose all hope of seeing anything remotely scary, they did just about start to improve.One of the things that really grated me with the first film, was the horribly out of tone use of 'Time of the season' by The Zombies and a completely pointless long shot. An odd tone shift that doesn't suit anything before or after it in the film. The sequel suffers from similar unwarranted tone changes. Patrick Wilson pulling out his guitar to give a rendition of an Elvis song is this films 'Time of the season'. It just doesn't work. In fairness though, this is an attempt at character development, it doesn't work, but at least they tried.Another major gripe is that all of the Enfield based English characters sound like they've been taught diction by Don Cheadle in Oceans 11. Or perhaps Wan told them to base their accents on that little lad from Bedknobs &amp; Broomsticks? Either way it's off putting and distracting.Watching a James Wan produced/directed horror film is the cinematic equivalent of accompanying a toddler through the haunted house at the local fair; The loud noisy things that keep jumping out are very effective at scaring the younger ones, but only because it's all new to them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High-hopes sequel that does not live up to its potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>::This review may contain potential minor spoilers, but no blatant and major giveaways::The first Conjuring was something of a very nice surprise for me. I'm not one to usually buy into major release Horror films, but heard so many good things about it from audiences and critics alike that I caved in. What I didn't expect was that it ended up being a very solid and very traditionally done ghost story, with effective character development and slow burn buildup. It had its moments of cheap jump-scares and gags here and there, but overall it was surprisingly effective. Jump forward to the sequel, and there's problems from the start. To parrot its predecessor, the film opens with a previous case of the Warrens (this time the infamous Amityville haunting). Though the Annabelle sequence from the first film felt a bit contrived, it was still effective, it didn't run away with the 'cliche creepy doll' thing too much and the sequence was creepy, despite being relatively mundane. The Amityville sequence thrusts the viewer into a jump-scare filled climax right off the bat, leading the way for the inconsistently toned and paced remainder of the film. The immediate next gripe was setting the scene for London. Using the Clash's London Calling, along with kiddies calling each other that word that starts with 'W' and rhymes with Tanker (a word that apparently makes IMDb's prohibited word list) made the viewer very well aware that the film takes place in jolly old England. I don't think I could've come up with more painfully obvious and groan-worthy (not to mention cliché and distilled) references to English culture if I tried. Already, the movie was off to a bit of a rocky start, but I gave it a chance. I really did. So from here, I will point out some of the things the film did do right. The performances are all handled well, and the kids are particularly strong in their roles. Wilson and Fermiga are once again, a believable on-screen couple. The strong eerie atmosphere from the first film is back and better than before, as the camera compositions and movements are much more dynamic and interesting. The entities in the Conjuring 2 are a bit of a mixed bag however. On one hand, the old man in the chair is appropriately subdued and fairly nuanced, but then you have a demonic nun, that while creepy enough, has a design that feels old and tried, and felt as though it was trying too hard. Lastly, you got the Crooked Man, which while rather cool looking I must admit, felt pretty out-of-place within the grounded reality the narrative set up thus far, contributing to the film's already inconsistent nature. For a dark horror movie, The Conjuring 2 also felt unnaturally sappy and saccharine. While some moments of levity among the scares and foreboding terror are more than welcome, much of the dialogue reeked of forced sentimentality and hammy cheese, ultimately taking me out of the horror of it all. So, to recap, the Conjuring 2 is far from being a bad film. It outperforms its predecessor in some ways, but falls very low in others. Its tonal inconsistencies make for a very odd structure, yet one that is still rather predictable. It still looks very good, and delivers on some chilling moments, but isn't nearly as effective as the first in this ever-growing franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There should have only been The Conjuring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I have to say I had difficulty trying to figure out why the first one was so much better but I think I have some theories. I feel the family in the first film was more likable probably for reasons that seem wrong. The family in the first film was more traditional. They were a two parent household with a dog and probably easier for me to relate to as an American because they were American. The family in the second one is British and run by a single mother who at the start doesn't seem to be the best mother but then again she had her moments; I.E buying biscuits for her son instead of cigarettes.The first one had more unpredictable scares and more genuine scares. In this one it seemed as though there were times when James Wan was like "oh yeah we gotta throw in a scare". The firetruck rolling into the tent and then back out was so predictable it was borderline boring. Also in the first one you found out how much evil had happened on the family's land whereas in this one it just seemed as though the little girl was possessed by an old man for most of the movie and at times it got old. When the dog ringing the bell stood up and became the man from their toy I practically laughed at the stupidity of it. It just seemed random and unnecessary. Of course with these stories it's always hard to tell what's for the movie and what actually happened seeing as how they're "true stories". I would bet the majority of what you see in these films is rubbish as the Brits say. Also the house in this film is so dark and so dilapidated it looks like it's condemned. Lest we forget all the scariest moments were seen on the preview thus making them not effectively scary in the film. Though what I did like about the film was the tribute to Ed and Lorraine Warren who I think were very brave, good people who truly did want to help people. They seemed like very down to earth people despite their occupation and also seemed to be very in love and made for each other which was beautiful to watch. I also liked that they touched on the Amityville investigation which is probably the most popular investigation they ever did. However I think this film like most sequels was not necessary and tried too hard to top the original but in my opinion fell short and I even found myself dozing off here and there. I think Lights out will be the scariest film of the year so in comparison this was just a horror film that falls on the pile of mediocre films such as The Boy and The Forrest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyed the first one, although I'm afraid I didn't have the patience to watch the second one. 30 minutes in I found it tiresome and boring. Hope I got to the point quicker than the second movie. This movie was more carnival than horror.Too formulaic to ever be remembered, indeed, the ending happened exactly as contrived. The horror genre shouldn't be 'just' about making people jump at specific moments of drawn out tension, That's not radical, clever or new. Sometime you have to go with gut instinct to make a sequel worthy of it's predecessor, and I feel that this sequel fell someway short. by a substantial n=margin I'm sorry be of this opinion, because I know hoe talented the guys are, however it could be time constraints/issues and a myriad of other factors.

		<fullReview>A terrible chaotic plot with a lousy narrative. The single scenes do not fit together in a satisfying way. The final showdown was exceptional unsatisfying. The defeat of the demon with some sort of guessing spell worked out - it seem, just to get the movie finished. The final picture with people hanging around on the street - we have seen this already in hundred movies. I wonder, whether horror plots are coming to an end. It seems, that people are afraid of only the same demons all the time. Nothing new on the planet to be afraid of? Or are the writers of the plots themselves too afraid to bother with today's fears of normal people? It is not the demons, it is sickness, age, religion, weapons, missed education ... time to mix that together to horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by horror veteran James Wan, "The Conjuring 2" picks up 6 years later of its predecessor and finds Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and Lorrain Warren (Vera Farmiga) struggling with their marriage in the face of Lorrain being haunted by a demon whilst they accept to travel to London to help a single mother (Frances O'Connor) and her four kids whose house is being haunted by a malicious spirit trying to corrupt the younger sister (Madison Wolfe).When the first "Conjuring" came out the out-pour of love for it left me absolutely incredulous, I will admit it had a couple of good scares and overall empathetic characters, but the handling of the true story aspect of the film was disastrous, the direction wasn't particularly inspired and it was basically not scary to me and relied too heavily on what are only jump scares that are a little less noticeable because of how James Wan masks them.Still, I went into "The Conjuring 2" very open minded and wanting to be proved wrong, but most of all, I wanted a good horror ride filled of tension and scares. Just as with its predecessor, I find myself disagreeing with the love for this film. What I got was an overlong, bloated and occasionally offensive film. Normally if I find a movie to be offending my intelligence I go really low on it, yet "The Conuring 2" has enough moments to distract me from the very brief ones in which I found the filmmakers to be talking down on the audience and not treating them as equals.Just as with "The Conjuring", the haunted characters we are presented to are well fleshed out. They aren't by any stretch of the imagination as deep as a "Chris MacNeil" in "The Exorcist", but they do have a dynamic that's interesting and you can't help but stick behind them as they battle with their struggles because of how ordinarily they are presented to you and for my money there is a pretty clear inspiration on Wan's part from a much superior recent horror film: "The Babadook". There are some striking similarities in how the weight of being a mother is represented to you and whilst the inspiration is a little too evident, it really does work in getting you behind a mother continuously on the verge of breaking.Moreover, there is a strange bipolarism in the way this film is shot and edited. It looks like it was done by two different people. I'll talk later about the dullness of a half of the film, but there is some really inspired stuff in certain points and what makes it frustrating is that repeatedly when the film is having these great moments, it decides to cut away from them and go for some cheap horror tricks that result completely ineffective in the face of what was being built up. Indicative of this is a moment, at the start of the second act more or less, where the little boy goes down the house in the middle of the night to drink and we see him drink from the outside, on a steady shot showing just two windows in the house, it is a very simple shot, but in that moment a whole lot of possibilities open up and sprinkle amazing tension. And then what do the filmmakers decide to do? Cut to the garden outside where a swing is creaking.That is the kind of stuff that happens throughout the movie that left me baffled. Not to mention, the ridiculous use of jump scares by Wan. I honestly and unfortunately don't get why he is hailed as the greats horror director of our time. Really this sh*t is supposed to be scary? My suggestion to everybody is to watch "Rosemery's Baby" and get a real taste of what scary is, there are one, two at best, jump scares. What Wan does here is simply make everything culminate in a jump scare of some sorts, visually, with sound or dialogue, it's always there and by the third scare in I had given up on it. He is trying to build tension in some ways which always result cheap, because they are only there to serve the final moment and not the story. At no point I felt stakes for what was happening, it was all just so predictable and uninteresting from a horror point of view, I found it to be very unsophisticated, culminating in a finale that I had very little investment on, once again it was having good moments, but they were all overcome by the dullness of their surroundings.Which brings me to the next point: this script is a mess. With the exception o the above mentioned empathetic relation with the characters who are haunted, the rest of it terribly mishandled. Vera Farmiga gives a cringe worthy performance because of the ridiculous arch she is asked to handle. The mythology is all over the place, it is co chaotic and unclear it becomes offensive: there is no logic to what happens, which demon is which and why they collide together, I have literally no idea what was going on, who was haunting who, it was a disaster and just as messy was the handling of the true story element which isn't ever addressed in the film and asks the viewers for a suspension of disbelief that is just preposterous.Whilst there is respect for the filmmakers in what they are trying to do and for some of their inspired ides, I am very sorry that this is the type of horror that is being hailed at the moment and wouldn't recommend this ride to people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I am always a bit doubtful when it concerns sequels because most of the time they are no match to the first one. But in this case the sequel is even better then the first one. And I did like the first one as well. With The Conjuring part 2 they bring us horror at it's best. I thought there were more then enough scary moment in this movie. The entire movie feels like evil. You expect at any moment to jump out of your seat (what my wife did a couple of times eventually). It's a really dark and well made movie for this genre. The cast is perfectly chosen. I can't really fail anyone. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are perfect in their roles. The whole family Hogson did a brilliant job playing the attacked family. Bonnie Aarons as the demon nun is really scary, as well as the old guy and the crooked man. A must see if you are into possession horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conjuring 2 is one of the best horror film and its doing justice to its first part.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Year 2013, The Conjuring was released and Its just the beginning of these Series. Its took 3 Years for its Sequel The Conjuring 2 released these Friday, which comes to definitely gives you nightmares. Question is Will Its live up to expectations and hype or will it fails. Let's analyze.Movie Starts with an Story of The Amityville Horror. Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) &amp; Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) arrives to Amityville for investigation of what happens to Lutz family and for what reasons they have to run from Amityville at midnight. for sometimes we may get confused whether its sequel to The Conjuring or Its Sequel to The Amityville Horror. The Conjuring 2 is little bit connected to The Amityville Horror. While investigating Lorraine experience the strong spirit, for what they have to left the Amityville. Then suddenly movie moves to North London, Enfield where a single mother raising her four children alone in a house. Suddenly they came to know they are plagued by malicious spirits. Lorraine and Ed Warren travels to enfiled, north London to help her. Whether they success to help her out? for that you have to be witness of these Spine Chilling Horror.The Conjuring 2 takes viewers to thrilling ride that keeps you on the edge. Its is too scary and Spooky in some parts and giving you goosebumps at several intervals. First Half is too much interesting, while Second half is little bit talkative but its due to demand of script. but the movie change the real gears before Climax. The last 20 minutes are just awesome.Director James Wan was know for his Horror Movies like Insidious 1 &amp; 2, The Conjuring, Dead Silence and Saw 1. These time too He has done an Excellent job. He achieves his motive of shocking to viewers almost in every scene. In a Horror Movie, It's always the background score that either make or break the movie. In The Conjuring 2 background score definitely comes across as driving factors of the Movie. Its superb.Overall, The Conjuring 2 is one of the best horror film and its doing justice to its first part. The film with its thrilling and chilling experience makes its a worth watching. Must experience these horror on big Screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2 exceeded my expectations. After a lot of horror movies going downhill and failing ridiculously, James Wan comes back for his 'Conjuring' franchise and rips it. Most of horror sequel don't live up to the expectations of it's predecessor but The Conjuring 2 was, IMO, better than the first one. James Wan has done a magnificent job here. You know a horror movie is scary when the title comes on and it scares the hell out of you. The cinematography, the tension the movie builds is on point. Even paintings and pictures scare the **** out of you. The movie includes no blood or gore (except the first scene) and still manages to scare the life out of you. James Wan doesn't follow the horror movie blueprint. In a regular horror movie, traditionally, when you're trying to prove a ghostly creature in your house to someone but the unusual doesn't show up until the people are gone. James Wan isn't following the tradition, instead the unusual happenings happen in front of anybody, there's no hiding. You see a lot of movies where actors are trying to investigate and all those stupid thing that you'd never do in real life, The Conjuring 2 is as same as what we'd do if we were in those situation. First time ever i've seen smart people inside a horror movie who do the sensible thing to get out of the house. There are lot of things James Wan has done by not following the horror movie blueprint and it has absolutely paid off. The movie is 10/10 scary. Actors are smart and acting is very good. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are back again as the paranormal investigator and demonologist. Acting is top notch. Even those 5 British kids and Frances O'Connor playing British mom was outstanding. A huge performance mainly by Madison Wolfe A.K.A Janet and her acting was marvellous. For those who liked The Conjuring would really love The Conjuring 2. It's 10/10 scary, 10/10 acting, 10/10 creepy soundtrack. 10/10 jump scares, 10/10 scary creatures and 10/10 movie. Well done to James Wan for single handedly carrying horror franchise. Would go first day for The Conjuring 3 if it is to ever happen.</fullReview>

Although it doesn't have the uniqueness which the first one had. It relies a bit more on jump scares. But I enjoyed it as much as the first one. James Wan again does a stellar job with the direction. The cinematography is awesome which helps a great deal in building up the tension. The acting is great all around. The most important thing is we care about the characters.

		<fullReview>I was a fan of the first movie and a big fan of all of James Wans horror movies. I love his unique skill of creating tension and keeping you on your toes. But I feel like he has taken big steps to becoming one of the best directors there is.The movie itself has pretty similar structure than the first one. That is not a bad thing though. It has some good scares and nice tension, like a horror movie should. But the cinematography and the quality of directing in the movie kind of surprised me. The movie looked really beautiful and and it's something that I personally appreciate a lot. The characters in the movie were very likable. For a horror movie it's very important to be able to care for the characters. I think that is something that separates good horror from bad. Their relationships were well written and the actors did a really good job. I especially liked Patrick Wilson. I have always liked him but after seeing this I like him even more. In the middle of all the horror and frustration of the nasty situation the family had, there was a really beautiful scene that actually made me emotional. It's pretty rare when watching a horror movie.I think the movie was just really well made. Horror movies used to be low budget and low effort films in the past. Nowadays some are made with great talent and effort. It's not just good horror movie. It has heart and style and great acting. The very ending of the film made me give it 9/10 instead of 10/10. But can recommend this to anyone who likes horror or just appreciates movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Conjuring was a surprise hit, so it is no surprise that we get this sequel. This one sticks closely to the original in some ways; again, a family is menaced by the supernatural, and Lorraine and Ed Warren come to help. But this film also builds on the first, especially in its depiction of the Warrens.Lorraine and Ed Warren are much more central to the story here; although the film is based on the famous Enfield haunting, the Warrens get as much focus as do young Janet Hodgson and her family. This is good news to those of us who would have liked to see more of the Warrens in the first film. This also gives the movie more narrative interest for those who already know the Enfield story. In this version, the Warrens play a much larger role. Thus, even if you know the original story, you won't know how this one turns out. This is not the greatest horror ever, but it is pretty good. Like all good horror films, it focuses more on the characters and their emotions than on the spooks, although the latter are (mostly) satisfyingly scary. (The CGI Crooked Man feels out of place, as if from a different movie.) The horror emerges from the fears and conflicts of the characters. I guess it depends on whether the viewer likes or sympathizes with Lorraine, Ed, and Janet. I did, so I found the story involving. It helps that the cast is excellent, especially Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as the sweetly anachronistic Warrens. Madison Wolfe is also very strong as Janet, the little girl at the center of the Enfield case. The movie focuses on Janet about half the time, and Wolfe carries her half very effectively. Ultimately, this is not so much a story about ghosts as it is about love and belief -- not only in the supernatural, but in other people as well. The message of the film seems to be that successful, lasting relationships require "a leap of faith" (to use a phrase repeated more than once in the movie). The film shows us the dangers involved in taking such a leap -- and the greater dangers of not taking it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes it's been done before......and yes it's still very scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many reviews on here that try to tell us that we don't need these formulaic things, and that we have grown tired of the same old nonsense. That we crave something different. I'm here to say that those reviews should speak for themselves. I for one am a cinema goer and film watcher. When I go to see a particular type of film it's because I want to feel a certain way, whether that's excited, moved, horny or scared. Experience therefore tells me what to expect, but and here is the big but......it doesn't tell me how I'll receive it or when to receive it. In other words, I may well have seen it all before, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. After first watching The Conjuring, I loved it so much I watched two more times within a year. It was good old classic scare without the gore. I hoped they would make a 2nd one and was excited when it came round. The Conjuring 2 is more of the first but told in a different way, with different scares and different oh-dear-I-nearly-crapped-me-pants moments!! It's good old classic scares without the gore that peppers so many of what passes for today's horrors. It takes the same formulas that made the first one so good and adds a few more in for good measure. Its length allows the story to be told first from the the children's perspective and then adds in the main characters. For those that haven't seen the first one, we are given a brief synopsis of what they do and how they do it. Rather like the opening set piece of an action hero at the beginning of an action film. We are then taken on what I consider to be an emotional ride through the ordeal of the young girl. I felt for her, I really did. I felt for the mother who not only had to watch her children helplessly be tormented by the goings on the house, but also had her own worries of trying to keep her home and deal with the schools allegations of one of her children....all as a single mum. I felt for each if the girls siblings as they tried to do what they could to protect their sister from something they could not possibly explain. Then of course there's the two main characters battling their own demons as well as trying to save a family from theirs. The tension is built up through the bonds the viewer has formed for the main characters so that when the scares happen you feel like you're in the room with them. There's no obvious CGI, the sun isn't always shining and there are no obvious dispensable characters. It's a simple horror film that scared me witless.....more of the same please!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Masterwork Of Horror Filmmaking That's Arguably Better Than Its Predecessor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conjuring was a welcome return to old-school scares &amp; vintage thrills, for it drew upon the style of 1970s chillers, abstracted horror from its foreboding atmosphere, and eliminated uncalled violence, tiresome gore &amp; mindless killings from the equation to deliver some genuine frights to its viewers, and also solidified James Wan's status as one of the finest talents around when it comes to mainstream horror.The Conjuring 2 adopts the same formula, bringing another one of Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren's cases to cinematic life by building upon the solid groundwork paved by the first chapter. It may feel like a repeat of the same phenomena all over again but there is more to this movie. The way it handles its characters and stages some genuinely effective moments of unrelenting terror are few of the many positives in a sequel that's arguably better than its predecessor.Set in Enfield, London around 1977, the story of The Conjuring 2 unfolds at the Hodgson residence where all the members of the family begin experiencing escalating events of poltergeist activities. With police failing to offer any solution and Britain's own paranormal investigators arguing over the legitimacy of the case, the family's desperate plea for help is answered by two people across the Atlantic who travel all the way to help the family, and collect evidence on behalf of the Church.Co-written &amp; directed by James Wan, who certainly knows a thing or two about horror filmmaking, The Conjuring 2 begins with a prologue that briefly covers the Warren's most infamous case, The Amityville haunting, and fills the sequence with elements that plays a key role in their next assignment. The plot then moves to 1970s London where the main premise is set and an ominous atmosphere is quickly established, thus allowing the terror to surface early into the story and it only escalates from that point onwards.If The Conjuring was an amalgamation of all the skills Wan had acquired over the years, then The Conjuring 2 is an even more refined exhibition of his talents and presents the Australian filmmaker in complete control of his craft. Many sequels suffer from their inability to keep the freshness of the original alive but by setting its plot in a different continent and adding believable characters into the mix, the script helps eliminate that issue for this film, not to mention that the story is lean and packs one expertly staged scary moment after another.Its visual design is in tune with the first film but there are a few enhancements. The cold colour palette conjures up a darker tone than before and London's overcast weather further magnifies it. Camera is utilised as per the requirements of the scene, opting for slow movements when silence permeates every frame and turning all the more chaotic when terror reigns supreme. Editing gives its story a tightly-knitted structure and ingeniously paces it while Joseph Bishara returns with another ill-omened score. And last but not the least, its sound design is impeccable.Coming to the performances, The Conjuring 2 finds Patrick Wilson &amp; Vera Farmiga reprising their respective roles of Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren and their chemistry once again turns out to be the core ingredient that helps viewers invest in their story, not to mention that their on-screen relationship has a very genuine &amp; heartwarming feel to it. Amongst the new cast, Frances O'Connor sells her character's despondency brilliantly, Simon McBurney's input has a calm demeanour to it, while Madison Wolfe balances her act accordingly to deliver an outstanding performance.On an overall scale, The Conjuring 2 is another gem of horror filmmaking from James Wan and is a worthy &amp; welcome addition to both its franchise &amp; its genre. Sequels are often no match to their predecessors and the number is even lesser when it comes to horror flicks, thus making Wan's latest effort all the more commendable. As before, a few moments still come off as unintentionally hilarious than frightening but there is less of that shortcoming in this sequel. In short, The Conjuring 2 is mainstream horror at its most thrilling &amp; effective, and is one of those rare sequels that improves upon its predecessor. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple supernatural horror in the hands of a skilled director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what it looks like when you take a decent script and put it in the hands of a highly skilled and experienced director in the prime of his career.James Wan directed the first Saw movie, as well as The Conjuring, and the Insiduous movies. He also directed Furious 7 and is currently working on Aquaman. It almost seems like he is showing off in this movie. It seems like he is having fun and pulling all his tricks out with confidence and ease to make a movie that is just plain awesome.This is one of those movies that could have been terrible with the wrong director. The script really isn't anything all that special. It works, but there is nothing terribly new and original here, and the resolution to this movie is so bad it made me laugh out loud. (**Spolier**) This big powerful demon is terrorizing this family throughout the movie, and Lorraine is able to destroy it by "saying his name." And guess what? The demon told her what his name is... oops! I guess the demon didn't think that one through very well. To be scared of this demon for over an hour and then see the whole problem solved because she simply says his name, after he told her what it is, was kind of a let down for me. But then again, we're talking about demons here, so it's all kind of silly to begin with, and there really isn't any solution that would make much logical sense.That being said, I don't really watch a movie like this for the plot, I watch it for the horror, and this movie has lots of it. They used a clever plot device that the demon is "hiding" by acting through other spirits. This gives the director a chance to use a wider variety of techniques and keeps things interesting. It's clear that James Wan really knows what he is doing and he plays with everything from CGI, to stop-motion, to jump-scares, and creepy sound effects. He has a lot of tricks in his bag and it makes for a movie with some great scenes.He is especially good and using cinematography and color grading to darken areas of the frame just enough that you can't quite make out what you're looking at. I can't think of many other directors who do this as often and as well, but it really works.Another scene I really love is the one with Lorainne by herself where the painting comes to life. Scenes like that are so cool, so well directed, and so scary, that they are instant classics in my opinion. If I were teaching a class on the greatest scenes in horror films, there are a few in this movie that would make the list.Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are no strangers to horror films. Besides being in both Conjuring movies and the Insiduous movies, Vera was also played the mom in Orphan, another great horror film. I think they were well cast and do a good job playing Ed and Lorraine. This movie relies heavily on child actors, which can be tough, but they all do a great job. The main girl who plays Janet is really the main character in this film, and she does an admirable job. I found it somewhat unconvincing at times when she was doing the different demon voices, but I don't think that is her fault.If you are a fan of horror, you will love this movie. Don't go in expecting a great story, but you can expect to see a really scary movie with a director who has become a master of his craft and is really given an opportunity here to do what he does best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, but mostly forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was decent enough. It pretty much follows the same formula as the first film, but honestly, this did not need to be over two hours long. They overdo the set-up in the first hour. There's so much repetitiveness in its jump scares and horror scenes. By the time the second hour does come along, it also overdoes it to an even larger extent. A lot of scenes kept making me roll my eyes. It also seems that despite wanting to make Patrick Wilson's character more important, it managed to restrict Vera Farmiga's character. Despite following much of the formula of the original film, this still felt really cluttered and messy. It spins its wheels a lot. Despite the many criticisms I have of it, it did manage to entertain me. I don't think the original film is entirely greatness by any means, but it was still better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much flashier than the first *very minor spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that the conjuring 2 is a very entertaining movie that is well worth a watch. However it doesn't have that "instant horror classic" feel that the first one did. One of the main differences in this movie was that there was much more effort put into special effects and trying too hard to make the evil characters creepy. At times it felt a bit like I was watching the first insidious movie, with the bad guys caked in makeup and always making quick jerking motions. The second conjuring movie also doesn't have that same sense of dread and realism that the first one has. Rather it feels as though I am just watching a well made horror movie. This takes away from the actual lingering fear that there was so much of in the first movie. It seems as though to try to combat this, more jump scares were added which I'm not a huge fan of, (even though some of the jump scares in this were top notch and even managed to catch me off guard). The build up in the first conjuring was phenomenal as the movie starts off completely normal and you feel as nothing can wrong. This movie however starts right off the bat by showing you evil entities, which takes away from the buildup and prepares you for what's to come. It feels like a very cheap start that is just paying homage to the first movie and flaunting the fact that Ed and Loraine deal with "big bad evil spirits". So to summarize, it didn't give that same sense of sheer horror that the first one managed to, but Its still an unsettling film that has high entertainment value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a quality horror , something rare today , James Wan Best Director of terror today, and watching Madison Wolfe , she has a great future.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2 achieved something rare for a horror movie, be the same level or better than its predecessor which is very good, the first spoke about the case of Harrisville, United States. A couple moves to a new house next to his five daughters to. Inexplicably, strange events begin to frighten children, the father and especially the mother. already that the plot is based on the case Enfield Poltergeist, recorded at the end of the 1970s the beginning of the film is very good, and very interesting, we has a notion of the Lorraine Warren can do, the cast is back Vera Farmiga who indulges in the role, she is excellent, Patrick Wilson this very well also, Madison Wolfe steals the show whenever she is present on the screen, it makes an excellent performance, the cast still has, Frances O'Connor, Simon McBurney , Franka Potente, Steve Coulter, etc., the chemical Patrick Wilson with Vera Farmiga is excellent, you what feel each character feels for the other, the picture is very good, and the direction of James Wan to back this sequence, is excellent he usually give some unpredictable scares even some being predictable, but I took a lot scares, the way the Wan films is excellent, it does some very good camera games, some moments are very tense, and the nun Demonic gave me a lot fear, and the soundtrack is eerie, as well as the first, the final scene I found good, but was a little fast, the script is good, more is some very quick things, in my opinion the film should be about 10 minutes more, to better develop some things, the Conjuring 2 is one of the best films of the year, in my opinion is better than the first, it gave me more scares, and the villain was interesting to come the Conjuring 3.

		<fullReview>Wow. I cannot believe I am saying this, but this "ghost" story is one of my favorite horror movies in the past several years.I'm not a fan of ghost stories/haunted house tales. Maybe it's a Catholic thing. No offense to the followers or religion itself, but perhaps the reasons why Priests and the Catholic Church are brought up in so many haunted flicks, these kinds of "true stories" hit closer to home to that faith. Maybe, that's why so many followers are scared of these possession flicks.Personally, I don't believe in the roaming spirits, so I am not frightened by any of these types of movies, including this one. But, I do believe in trying to broaden my horizons. So, a few years ago, I gave the infamous ghost trilogy a shot. These included the most popular haunted movies: The Conjuring, Sinister and Insidious. Truthfully, I wasn't a fan, myself, of any of the three, and most of them blended in so much I couldn't tell you which was which.That said, I do recall I cared a tad bit more for the Ethan Hawke one. I believe that one was named Sinister. That one I did like, but only a bit more than the other two. Since, again, I'm not on board with these supposedly "true" event films, I ended my open-mindedness with the originals. I wasn't about to waste my time with the sequels or spin-offs when I knew I would never fully enjoy them.This ended now. I was convinced by a friend and enormously high ratings for The Conjuring 2 to finally sit down and watch it. By far, it surpassed its original tenfold and the other two tremendously. In fact, I can safely say, this, 1408 and original Blair Witch Project are my favorite intentionally scary ghost movies.The Demonbusters of the 70s are back to co-investigate an English Estate that may/may not be possessed and if spooky, the Catholic Church might step in to help. But, they might be too late by then.Boy, did I summarize this movie with zero spoilers. I am proud of myself! But, it was easy. This movie is pretty straight-forward in regards to synopsis. The real meat of the experience was the acting, the heart and depth of the characters. That was one major positive.The other for me was the fact that what started off as yet another clichéd, by the book haunted house movie quickly turned into a real movie, an original take and ghosts that freaking did stuff. Most of it blew me away and I liked the ghosts out of the shadows. Finally! It wasn't a movie so reliant on showing barely any movement until the end.Sure, they say "less is more" in horror, but damnit, that's so overdone by now. I really want to see something. I want the other characters to see the same thing, as well. And this movie delivered in spades after about 20 minutes or so. The action, if you can call it that in this kind of film, was well thought-out and inventive. The characters, namely our favorite Demonbusters, made us really care about them. And the ending was exactly how I wanted it to play out. (Selfish, but that's what I like to see and not the same ole finale most horror filmmakers think is still original and wanted.)Not only would I recommend this movie, I would just say skip that Ghost- Trilogy I spoke about and just watch this. Again, I can't speak for the almost countless sequels and spin-offs, but I can say this beats any "original" any day of the week.***Final thoughts: Chris. You owe me a new phone. No. You know exactly what I am talking about. Pay up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched The Conjuring 2 last night and I was clinging onto my wife more than she was to me! I loved this film! It's rare that a sequel is better than the first, but this movie proves that it does happen. Looking at the total production cost of this movie and what it's made to date...it's staggering. 40 Million to make and 40 million on it's opening weekend! Most movies these days don't make that in six months! The acting is top notch...even for the kids in this movie! You can feel their fear and utter desperation in their situation as they try to cope and get through it. The demonic spirit that plagues them throughout the movie will make you reconsider using a nightlight when you go to bed after you watch this movie. All in all, a great movie. I normally don't watch horror movies twice...but I'm buying this one when it comes out for sale!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable but not without mistakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen the movie, I urge you not to read this review as it contains spoilers and basically will ruin the whole experience.As far as horror movies go, Conjuring 2 is among the scariest I've seen. Decent plot, a little too much at times and I wonder if the movie could have ended in the traditional 1 hour and a half, but still, worth your time if what your looking is a good shoulder exercise.Ed and Lorraine Warren continue their search for paranormal activity this time in England, where a family is haunted by a spirit that claims ownership of their home, and apparently, the body of one of the little girls. Story starts with Lorraine having a vision of a young boy, who, while possessed by an evil entity, murders his whole family, parents-2 brothers-1 sister, in their sleep with a shotgun. Even though the scene started with his mother yelling at him before she hit the sheets of her bed covered in blood and the blast of the shotgun, his 2 brothers somehow continue sleeping unaffected by the hell that broke loose 3 meters away. The scene continues with the brother(the viewer actually sees Lorraine as she envisions the whole massacre) entering the bedroom of his two brothersm and initially shoots the 1st boy. 2nd boy is still sleeping despite his mothers screams and the 3 shotgun booms, so he also ends up dead. Sister in a 3rd room equally doesn't hear the 4 now gunshots and subsequently ends up dead.The Warrens eventually end up in Britain to investigate the haunted house case on behalf of the Church that wishes to put an end to the families screams. Decent acting and some pretty scary scenes follow, but before the Warrens, the police is called up to the scene, when the spirit for the first time decides to become a little too friendly with the Hodgsons. 2 officers, a woman and a man arrive to investigate and actually witness a chair without a driver, gracefully slide across the floor in front of them also in the presence of the single mother who now owns the house and a neighbor who offered to help. Scene is actually pretty good, but what follows surely isn't. After they see with their own eyes something that would make any living soul, sh*t in his pants, all 4 exit the house pretending nothing happened. No running like headless chickens, no stumbling on the floor, going through windows, or even a scream. 2 officers actually stand in front of the haunted house and explain to the lady why they couldn't file a report about it.Plot continues with the Warren's stepping in and finally managing to defeat the spirit. While doing so a thunder cuts a tree just outside of the house in half, which was a pretty decent touch and so were the scenes inside the house up to the point that the neighbor from before attempts to chop a door down with an ax while inside world war 3 was climaxing. Movie finishes without him managing to enter that door, despite the fact that Lorraine squeezed in, and just before the end, 4 neighbors in total come to celebrate the demise of the paranormal. House is almost demolished, screams, a thunder, and in the morning no one beside the victims and the ghost hunters seemed to care.Apart from these 3-4 mistakes in my opinion, film was actually pretty good but a little too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinema entertainment, not much more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conjuring relied mostly on jump scares and thrilling long sequences that would make you wait for something showing up right in your face ? The Conjuring 2 relies on the same concept, but with a demon hunting the hunters themselves and a different case of paranormal activities, in England.I am a sucker for British people living in the suburbs or small outer areas with thick accents, needless to say This is England is one of my favourite movies (and series). But, I still got quite sceptic when this movie started with a rip off of TIEs' intros/starts (they go through what's happening in England "right now" to music with TV-clips) and The Conjuring 2 took that and made it to the very classic London Calling (The Clash). Taking a concept is never a nice move, and especially not at the start of the movie.The rest was a very typical horror/paranormal movie. Not much special, but it definitely works while watching it at a cinema, but if I had watched it home on my computer I'd probably start doing something else while watching.The animation (and some of the effects) was poorly executed. It was so, so, badly made. I cannot understand how they didn't notice it? The demon, Valak, is a nun. The original Valak is not a nun, so they basically just took a cool name and went with it. Apparently they made the design for the demon at the final cuts, and that is definitely noticeable. Ed (one of the main characters) got his first cross from a nun, so maybe it's some symbolism but that doesn't cover it for me. The Crooked Man (also a creature) was poorly animated, but creepy when it was shown in shadows (reminded me of Babadook) but in light it looked like a cartoon character. When the child that became possessed eyes turned yellow at her most "controlled" part and I could just think about how POORLY IT WAS MADE. Why rely on animation when you can create intense feelings with just shadows and sounds? I don't understand.The events that this movie was based on had nothing to do with these creatures and demons, so the based on a true story concept is kind of ?? NOT EVEN TRUE ?? (But what do you expect?)I had no trouble with the child actors though. One of the children was supposed to be stuttering all the time, but that magically disappeared in the middle of the movie. One thing I liked was that Judy, that got possessed, was a very kind person. It felt so unfair that she was getting into this mess.SPOILERTo the ending. I absolutely hated it, and I think that was the poorest done thing with this movie. It ended happy, not even a cliffhanger.It would've been so good if Ed or Judy died. It would be like Satan, or the demon won over them and faith can't predict everything (or stop some things). It's not common to have important characters die, but since the movie isn't much based on the real events they could go with something new, and make the movie unique.I don't know, it just felt so weird since everyone was screaming and crying 15 minutes before these scenes?SPOILER ENDEDI think that overall it was an okay film, perfect to watch in the cinemas and exciting with jump scares but not a long lasting bone- chilling. (unless you're afraid of nuns). Good actors, Vera Farmiga is amazing as usual and I think that the cinematography and aesthetics (except the demons) were "okay".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The promise shown in the first part encouraged me to watch this. The movie has a decent plot and the atmospheric setting is excellent. However, the bleakness could not be adequately sustained till the end. It becomes a happy movie, not a spine-chilling one. The director I thought lost an opportunity presented to him by the story writer. He was not much helped by the screen play. I think they can learn a thing or two from The Witch. Having said this, I must agree that the actors have done well and help the movie. A few scenes are worth remembering. But one time good watch and low horror quotient!

		<fullReview>**This review is a detailed review without any spoilers, so you can know if it contains some stuff you like or don't.**I'll tell you right now, the movie is scary. I made some jumps and had chills on the first half of it and then some parts in the second half. The atmosphere is great, the spirits are scary as hell, but it is sometimes wasted on cheap jump scares that you can see miles away.What throws me off was the doggy thing where it reminds you of a poor version of then babadook character which in this case is absolutely useless to put into the script. The way the characters interact is something we've seen millions of time in bad horror movies that throw you out of the "reality" of the movies. What i mean by that is when we look at the first movie, the characters were not venturing alone in the dark like in every other stupid horror movies, they were going as a group, except for one time. But in this movie, every character doesn't seems to realize that the ghost can actually hurt them even after multiples encounters. One more stupid thing is the ending. The script on how they find out how to beat the spirit is so dumb, i never thought a super spirit would allow them to beat him in a single stupid attempt. It's almost as the spirit committed suicide for no reason at all. There needs to be an investigation for a movie to have a suspenseful ending, but sadly this movie decided to go for the cheap way.Overall, go for it if you like the Insidious series, it's pretty much the same, but if you expect a great movie script with a good intrigue, this is not the case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "The Conjuring 2", starring Patrick Wilson-Fargo_tv, Watchmen; Vera Farmiga-Bates Motel_tv, The Departed; Frances O'Connor-Windtalkers, Bedazzled and Madison Wolfe-Keanu, Home Sweet Hell.This is a sequel to the 2013 movie that tells the real life stories of Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren, paranormal investigators-portrayed by Patrick &amp; Vera. They make a great team, with Vera having psychic visions and Patrick handling all the heavy lifting. James Wan is once again the director-besides the 2013 original Conjuring, he also directed Furious 7, Insidious &amp; Saw. This story takes place in 1977, just as Patrick &amp; Vera have finished checking out the unwanted horrors in Amityville-Yep, THAT Amityville-and are about ready for a well deserved rest. The first movie takes place before the Amityville investigation and this one is after it. The Church has another case lined up for them in England. It seems that a single mother of 4 children, Frances, is having problems with some sort of demonic possession of one of her daughters, Madison. When Patrick &amp; Vera arrive, they are met with lots of skepticism, both from the regular public and professional scholars. FYI: Even in our present time, there are people that believe it was all just a hoax. There are lots of good, scary moments and as the end credits start, you get to see photos of the real participants and also hear an actual recording of an interview between the Warrens and the possessed little girl-played in the movie by Madison. It's rated "R" for terror and horror violence and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 13 minutes. I enjoyed it as much as the first one and would buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

I wasn't scared or even interested in the plot because every single time something "scary" happened, it stopped before anything ACTUALLY happened and cut to the next scene. Like nice family moment, then predictable jump scare, then right back to nice family moment. Ugh!! Predictable and cliché scares. And the Elvis part was awful!

		<fullReview>A man I trust very much told me to not see THE CONJURING 2 because it is a bad film. I did not heed his advice because I had just loved THE CONJURING though I had seen it on DVD. So I went to see THE CONJURING 2 in a multiplex. I really should start listening to wise things that people tell me.THE CONJURING 2 was disappointing. Vera Farmiga, Frances O'Connor, and the child actor Madison Wolfe are the only saving grace. I still don't understand what Franka Potente was doing in this film. I could find only one scare moment in the film&#x2796;when the demon makes a sudden appearance before Vera Farmiga's character towards the end of the film. And this wasn't exactly a scare-scare moment, it was a shock-scare moment. In fact, the only exciting part during this film was when in the basement scene with Patrick Wilson and Frances O'Connor, someone in the audience made a scary noise. Quite obviously, the rest of us laughed.Avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectations of the movie having read the reviews despite having reservations after watching the first instalment. My expectations were not met, there was no scare factor or suspense in the movie, my wife only got one shock throughout and she loves a good horror. It may be that I am now completely desensitised to the new horrors that the movie industry has to offer but I feel that my time and money was wasted on this release. The acting was fine, nothing special offered by the cast although Wilson stood out in his role as Ed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary as hell!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film might have had faults, and it did, but I have a habit of going light on films that fulfill its purpose. The purpose of this one was to scare the hell out of you, and by God it deserves hundred percent marks for doing that so well. Not a minute goes by without killing suspense. The best of the lot was the knocking on the door, which I am sure they must have done using a hammer or something. It was terrifying, every little scene.What was so unique about this horror flick was, and I have only watched a handful of those in my entire life, that the ghost in this one did his tricks when when other people were present. It usually goes like this in films that they make a target and then that target goes through all the haunting, he/she isn't trusted by anyone because the ghost goes completely missing when others are present. Here was a ghost with a clear thought process and a brave one too. Secondly, the usual script is that it takes off lightly and keeps getting stronger, but each scene in this film has been given equal and as much attention as for example an ending scene would. It was balanced out intelligently. So it was a lot different from many of the mainstream horror films. The film- makers deserve a huge amount of credit for making it feel so real. There might have been many other horror flicks that caused me nightmares in childhood and made me many sleepless nights, but as a grown-up into mid-20s, I can definitely attest that I haven't seen a film like this. Terrifying!A bit sad that I only got time to watch this one nine days into its release over here in Germany. There were hardly eight people present in the theatre, two girls who screamed occasionally and were very noisy, but couldn't quite have the added fun that I did whilst watching 'Annabelle' (2014), which was a full house and very noisy (the noise is only good for a film of this genre mind you, not many others).I was most curious about the whole story this film was based upon and did some reading into it. Interesting stuff. Whilst not necessarily needing to come to believe in ghosts and demons, I still respect what the family might have gone through back then. As someone who has been through a lot of medical conditions, some of which may sound outrageous to others, I have learnt that we should respect others' experiences and suffering. I'll just leave at that, without the need to get into whether the family played a prank, whether it could be a mental condition of the girl that might have led the family into believing that something else is going on, or even, again, there were demons indeed. You never know when the day might arrive that you suffer from something and no one believes you, therefore, I will just respect their experience.Watching this film has reminded me of a couple of fears that I had in my childhood for example. One which stayed with me till we moved to Germany was, that whilst being asleep a dog would come and bite off my feet. This had history. Back in our village we used to sleep outside the rooms in summer, and a dog from our neighbourhood was notorious for having previously bitten people. As it happened, it climbed the wall and landed in our house, by a whisking passing by by uncovered feet. That frightening moment stayed on for months and months. The other being, watching a horror drama on some Pakistan TV channel. Actor Nabeel, who now works in the comedy TV serial 'Bulbulay' on ARY Digital, worked in it and would haunt his mother at night who masterminded his death in an accident. He would walk from one wall of the house to the other at nights, muttering "Aeyh zaalim maa'n (O' cruel mother)!" That was horrible for me! For months afterwards I regretted watching it, and only I know how much I went through and how much time I took to come out of them.Lastly, I must add something outrageous here. Now, had I seen any pictures or videos of the film, or even had slight knowledge of this, I wouldn't have watched the film, or at least not taken my brother with myself. Coming straight to the point, the house in it, its shape, form and appearance from outside 10 out of 10 matches to the building in which my brother has an apartment. I was left speechless at the very first sight of the house from outside and from then on we both watched the film with as much personal touch as not many would possibly have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>3 months ago my daughter bought herself a little fluffy puppy called " Lottie",it's basically a little cute ball of cuteness with some cute thrown in..it is also scarier than this pile of clichéd drivel.I went expecting a horror and I got a silly story with wooden acting with a script they must have spent at least ?5 on.Full to the brim with clichés...a Mad nun with big teeth???come on...An old man creeping around???A possession of a young child???I have never seen any of these ideas before.A couple of jump moments but that is not so difficult if you push the volume up every now and again.Not really anything to compare with so shall not bother..save your money and buy a fluffy puppy if you want some proper scares.The director did try to use clever camera work early on but I get the feeling he got bored and threw in the mad nun to speed things up.Not good...Not good at all..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unwritten rule - sequel 99,9% of the times is much worse than the first movie. Why? There are stories that just can't have a sequel, because there's just no new tricks to show for us. I thought this will be next boring mistake. But I was surprised... The Conjuring 2 enters to that 0,1% when sequel is as good as original or even better!I don't want to talk a lot about it's content, because nobody likes spoilers, but the story is kinda repetitive. Big family, big old house, Warrens come, fall in love with the family and wishes to help them... Yes, just like the first movie. But director surprised Me second time that day. He added things that is exact opposite for all horror movies. Ghost talks with journalist in front of cameras? It was something new for Me.Talking about horror genre, everyone wants to know: "was it scary?" Was it? Yes, indeed. Well, it had jump-scares, if your curious about that. But it was scary in a different way. Some scenes gave Me creeps, I don't know how to call it, maybe it's pure horror? Fear? But there isn't many movies which can do this. But if it, however manage to do this, I call it - successful.So all in all, for Me, amateur, who loves horror movies, Conjuring 2 was almost excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>North London haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review of The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case (spoiler free)***** (5/5)Cast: Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Madison Wolfe, Frances O'Connor.Plot: Lorraine (Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Wilson) travel to north London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by malicious spirits. I just want to start by saying this the best sequel to a horror that I have ever seen, the first Conjuring (2013) was the only horror to scare me and this, this is exactly the same. Director James Wan is known in most parts as the master of horror I think he is living up to that name. After the previous movie he directed Fast &amp; Furious 7 (2015) which made a billion dollars worldwide, he said however before making that he was never going to make anymore horrors which is fine because loads of directors change their genre. Just like the original this has a very good plot which is known all around the UK as fake it was made up, because a poltergeist is a spirit that is made normally by teenagers, this is basically the story of how real those were. The original one the reason why I like these films so much is because they have a dark atmosphere, a good plot, good acting and basically just feels real like you're really there it's terrifying. Also I like to add that in the first each time before the scare there was suspense and the suspense is exactly the same in this one if not better. In my opinion a horror is supposed to scary and this just like the original are way better than the PG-13 jump scares, like the Paranormal Activity series.In the first one we saw that the spirit was haunting a child and this is the same except somewhat different, the spirit is haunting 11 year old Janet Hodgson (Wolfe) but not just her it seems the spirit wants the whole family out. They seek the help of spirit hunters Ed (Wilson) and Lorraine (Farmiga) Warren to see if they can help their haunting problem it's basically the same as the first but who said you can't follow originality. It feels real as you're watching it, it genuinely feels like there is something behind you. The first Conjuring as I previously was the first actual to scare the living daylights out of me, and this as I said before is the same.Here are some reasons as to why I think this is a horror not to be missed:Story: Like the first one this has a terrific story which is conveniently based on a true story which everybody around the UK knows it was made up. This time it is set 6 years after the events of the first one. There is the connection in this story however it doesn't even show you a glimpse of what happened last time but this is still the sequel. It's basically the same story as first except no creepy doll this time and that is when you should keep the originality. The story is truly scary and will probably scare you too.Connection between movies: There isn't really a connection it just continues of sorts but it is the sequel because as it says on the poster The Conjuring 2. There is little connection however not shown anywhere in the film. I am just glad there is a sequel.The real moral of this story is that it's not about ghosts or ghouls, or anything creepy, it just shows you how bad the weather is in England. The real reason I gave it 10/10 is because it is the perfect sequel to a perfect horror that is of course an opinion. At this point I would be stating the faults of this movie but there really isn't any. The special effects are amazing and it is truly a terrifying spectacle that is just as good or better than the first. Just a true delight.Verdict: Terrifying, and will hopefully scare the living daylights out of you. A worthy sequel James Wan you are the king. 10/10 worth every single penny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Conjuring 2' is a perfect example of what more sequels should be. It is a perfectly executed horror sequel and Director James Wan effectively explores themes of vision,belief and faith. The family drama is very effective and Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are efficient in their roles. The film doesn't provide anything new in horror genre, but its set pieces are often impressive even though it rely on jump scares. 'The Conjuring 2' has good story &amp; suspense to have appeal on all kinds of horror fans. Unlike Sinister 2, it sticks to the basics and efficiently delivers a solid horror film. I give 4/5 for this efficiently made horror sequel by James Wan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holy Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been on this site for years and have never reviewed a title. Even the ones I really loved and have felt the urge to - I just never did. Something about The Conjuring 2 is changing that for me. I went to see this just yesterday after weeks of anticipation. I was a fan of the first and honestly didn't expect this one to be any better from the preview(s), even with all the hype and the praise.But I was wrong.This did not feel like a sequel to me at all. I started to forget that it was during parts of the film. It definitely had the first films feel and vibe but also mixed in with some "Insidious" and a dash of "The Babadook". If you're a fan of either of those films I'm sure you'd be into this. My friends and I decided we'd go to the city to see this. When we got there it was packed with people as expected and we had no choice but to sit in the very front row, same thing was actually happening to my sister who went to the same city at the same time but to a different theater. Anyway, as soon as the opening credits started rolling up I got chills and everyone went silent, my friends and I completely forgot all about our uncomfortable seating situation and it was as if the audience became one. Fortunately our audience was great, there were no cell phones going off and no one was being louder than they should. Everyone payed full attention to the film, clapping and cheering as well as screaming and laughing in unison throughout it. Some even stayed sitting in their seats after all the end credits were over and the lights had came back on to let it sink in. My friends and I felt emotionally drained (in a good way) after exiting the theater. The thing about this film is that it makes you feel a range of emotions you didn't know a horror film could do. There was fear, happiness, sadness, and just pure anxiety and unease. You definitely felt awake and at the edge of your seat at all times. At first seeing how long this film was going to be I was scared that it might drag on or get boring at some point but this never bored me and there were no parts that I feel I could say weren't needed for the story. The 2 hours went by so fast in my opinion, making it feel like it was shorter than it actually was, that's how good it was and how much fun it was to watch. I don't scare easily as I've seen it all so this didn't exactly make me cover my eyes at any points or make me feel scared once I turned the lights out and went to bed but, gosh this film was so good. Everything about it was good and might be my absolute favorite of the year. The actors were great, the writing was great, cinematography, atmosphere, etc etc etc... I feel like I can't praise this film enough! My friends and I all give this one, without a doubt, a 10 out of 10.(Also the people saying that this was a snooze fest are the same people who thought the poltergeist remake was a 10/10 horror film).</fullReview>

However, the foundation of the fear the demon and the source of those things was too weak as per my perception. So when it was really getting better I only felt silly. I simply find no ground to find it scary or horror movie. When the movie was getting better they just killed it. So I did not enjoy it as a horror movie.Just some scenes, the girl is being possessed by the demon inside the house. The guys cannot get inside. Someone brings an axe and cannot penetrate the wooden door. It took him long long time to finally break that door. A guy goes inside and Then, he is acting all delirious, weak and so on...

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words alone cannot describe how clever and scary this sequel is. While the Autistic Reviewers thought the first one was decent enough to give us some scares and nightmares, this one goes beyond all those expectations. The way the timing is done in this film is brilliant. The villain(s) in this one are extremely intimidating and enough to give you goosebumps. The two main characters from the first one return and their performances are even better than the first.A demon/spirit is haunting a family in the city of London and as each day goes by we get to see just how worse it gets! Each night is incredibly scary and has you on the edge of your seat. And once it gets to the final showdown it's one of the years best face offs! All in all, the acting was great, the humor worked, he demons/supernatural creatures are incredibly intimidating and are the best on screen Horror Villains we have had for a very long time.The Autistic Reviewers give The Conjuring 2 5/5 stars, 10/10. We loved it. The best Horror sequel that has come out in a VERY long time. Want to have a good scare and have goosebumps running down your spine? Go and see this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel deserving of being made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part, I came out with a positive vibe with the film. Production-wise, I thought it was exceptionally well done, and coming off the original one I can definitely say this held its own very well. Sequels have this innate ability to overdo what the previous installment did, and one might say this did it in some sense, but for the most part it played with a dialed-back approach. I mean look, what am I supposed to say about a film that is supposedly based on a true story? Sure, they will take their liberties here and there regarding what to make happen and how, but if they say it happened what am I to do in telling them they're doing what happened wrong or overly much? It was the right amount of "more done."In my opinion alone (which will not be consistent with everybody here), the first hour was terrifying (depends on what one considers scary). The crowd interacted with the film appropriately, and the actors on screen did their due diligence to make you fearful for their well-being. Pacing-wise, the second hour took a strange turn. I was fine with what they did by creating more of a slow-burn effect to build up to a large climax, but considering there wasn't much to be considered scary in the second hour, it kind of felt like we got slow-burn for nothing (the end punch was fine, just not nearly as frightening as anything in the first hour is all). I can't really explain it. That's okay I guess, but I'm sure this film ran over two hours long, and I think the most appropriate cut would have been about right at two hours. I was only slightly fatigued by the end of it all.James Wan has a terrific eye for the horror genre, and likes to display an array of emotions in his films, especially comedy where needed. Nothing slapstick at all, just the perfect blend of realism like "This is how a person acts in real life," something that Christopher Nolan has never been able to do himself. The characters aren't just pieces to tell a larger story, they are the story. Patrick Wilson is silently one of my favorite actors, often taking the non-blockbuster role but still holding his own in a natural way. I have only seen Vera Farmiga in a few films now (The Departed, Orphan, Up in the Air, Source Code, Safe House, and The Conjuring), and with every scene she is in, she just encapsulates me. I would love to sit down and have a dinner conversation with her, if you know what I mean.Compared to the first film I'd say this resorted with a few more jump scares, but I'm going to credit Wan for not cheapening them and doing them where they fit (no kids scaring each other, etc). This film did not play with the "less is more" mantra as much as the first film though, but like I said I'll go with that in a sequel. The first one also had much more even pacing and left with the right amount of questions unanswered; not to be unfair with this, but I also "believe" the story of the first film more than this one (only regarding what was seen on the screen). However, in The Conjuring 2 I cared more about this family, and I think the tension was equally as good in this film, save the night scenes being just a little too well-lit for my taste. I'd say I might like the first one just a little bit more, at least in that I own the first one on Blu-ray and I don't know if I need this one immediately. Oh, and just be aware that the official trailer reveals way too much. I'm not even talking about jump scare material (which it does overdo), but I mean story material. Avoid please! Watch the teaser trailer instead, that one is perfect and reveals nothing substantial. Also make sure you stay for the first billing credits sequence at the end of the movie just because of how well it is crafted, as was the film itself! If only they cut out 10 minutes and maybe even $10 million in the budget, I think it would have served its purpose a little more appropriately. Unlike Sinister 2 though, this film didn't disappoint in the slightest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was waiting for this sequel, after part I &amp; every one was hyped so much... Yesterday I watched it &amp; all I can say it's way too overrated. It wasn't as good as the part I &amp; even more - it was disappointing &amp; not scary at all. And there was one mistake which ruined whole movie for me. They saw lots of evidence: moving objects in the house, bite on the hand of mother when she and Ed were in the water of basement &amp; most of all, biggest evidence - face of that girl with unusual eyes &amp; veins on her eyes &amp; speaking with male voice (in short obvious possession signs) and after that, they say it was fake, girl was pretending, because they saw on the camera how she broke some chairs and objects. lol I can't believe how they made such a big mistake in movie. You must be really blind and dumb to ignore all these things and say it was fake &amp; leave them. This moment ruined whole movie. Another disappointment was some computer effects which they decided to add. This movie doesn't deserve more than 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i did not watch the first film, because, generally speaking, i need to be dragged in chains to any theater showing horror films.But The Conjuring (2) has all the things i love in a good film; it's perfectly cast, the production is exceptional, the direction, sound editing, pacing, writing, dialogue, costumes (!!!), it's all really some of the best i have seen in .. quite a few years. And on top of it, it has that charm of the horror films of the 80s, before gore and silly monsters took center stage.However, it's not quite The Ring. I'm sorry if i have to be dismissive .. this is a really good film. It's really that i'm no good at judging horror films. Actually, that's not quite true.See, for example; i love the film The Ring. I would recommend everyone to watch it, because the way the story is built, the writing choices that were made, make it into a masterpiece. The Conjuring is not like that; it's a classic, old-skool scary-stuff film. It goes through the motions, instead of breaking new ground. It does so masterfully, and it's a pleasure to watch, but the scary stuff kinda gets in the way of everything else. It's really the same story as The Amityville Horror - and also of every scare-jump film made in the past 20 years. So, here is my advice: if you are into horror films, go immediately to watch this awesome film. On the other hand, if you are not, then skip it. I cannot repeat enough times how well made this film is (aside from a single really bad CGI use), but you would probably get annoyed at the horror bits more than you are amused by the production.i'm having a hard time vote this film properly, but i would give it at least 8/10 - incredibly well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After enjoying the first installment I was expecting to be let down with the sequel of the conjuring; lets face it that's usually the case. However I loved every minute of The Conjuring 2 from the get go. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson really held this movie together; the chemistry between them was believable and the acting superb. I'm from the UK and at an age where I remember the story causing hype in the media. I've seen the documentary's and other versions of this story in screen plays, but they always fell short of being authentic, especially with the set and backdrop of the era. However The Conjuring 2 does not fail to add every detail by showing just how decrepit and humble life on welfare was in London during this time. I love a good ghost story and this movie did not disappoint. I really hope there will be another Conjuring movie in the future, with the same leading actors. This movie is now in my top 3 scary movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Great Supernatural Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1977, in London, Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) has financial difficulties to raise her children Margaret (Lauren Esposito), Janet (Madison Wolfe), Johnny (Patrick McAuley) and Billy (Benjamin Haigh) since her husband has left her to live with a neighbor. When her daughter Janet sleepwalks and claims to talk to the spirit of an old man, Peggy does not believe in the beginning. But soon she witnesses supernatural phenomena in the house and concludes that Janet is possessed by a demon. Her neighbor and friends call the police and the officers also see the mysterious event. One of them tells the local priest and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and his wife Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) are invited to travel to London by the church to team up with the paranormal investigators Maurice Grosse (Simon McBurney) and the skeptical Anita Gregory (Franka Potente) to see whether it would be a hoax. They witness weird events but they do not conclude it is true. What is happening in the Hodgson house?"The Conjuring 2" is another great supernatural film directed by James Wan. The film keeps the creepy atmosphere with great performances, highlighting the girl Madison Wolfe. The explanation that the spirit of Bill Wilkins is a pawn of the evil Demon Nun is confused and hard to be understood. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Invocaç?o do Mal 2" ("Conjuring of the Evil 2")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the first one, Conjuring 2 is a good jumpy horror movie, it ticks all the boxes that anyone who likes this type of movie is looking for, sometimes this almost seems too formulaic as it goes through every cliché and you'll find yourself knowing whats about to happen next because you've seen similar movies, but then at times it uses this to misdirect you and the 'jump' comes from unexpected places. One thing I do find a little strange is how this and the first movie, Wan portray the Warrens as some sort of heros, in what was a blatant real life hoax and the warrens were either too stupid to see or were in on it.But in todays horror movie world where most movies are terrible and / or rely on gore to attract viewers, this is good back to basics stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top Notch Supernatural Horror - Brilliant!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something terrifying in Enfield, and it's not bleach-blond tarts tottering around in heels and short skirts. First class spookiness that almost had me crying for my mummy. Jumps and scares a-plenty. A well written script and some fine acting lubricated the swallowing of the "true story". Thankfully, the film provided a satisfying ending that will enable you to sleep after watching, albeit with the lights on. Real life events were less conclusive. The only disappointments were the squalid living conditions of the family and the casting of an American girl as Janet. Come on Yanks, we Brits know how to clean. I feel a little offended....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughed a crooked laugh......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the advent of the first Paranormal Activity film, Hollywood, and in particular James Wan, have had an obsession with the Quiet.........Quiet...........Quiet.............Bang!!! Element of horror cinema.And the cinemas have been infected with these films since 2009. The are seldom rarely scary, but they do have that irritating knack of making you jump, just because they turn up the scare shriek volume up to eleven and let the dark corners of rooms do the work.Now, whilst The Conjuring 2 pretty much follows the 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' laws of horror, it really reigns in the loud noises to make you jump, hence making it one of the more interesting horror movies to be released in cinemas for a very long time.But there is still a lot of work to do, especially when you consider the Mini-Series 'The Enfield Haunting', which starred Timothy Spall.In 1977, paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren travel to London, England, where single mother Peggy Hodgson believes that something evil is in her home. When Peggy's youngest daughter starts showing signs of demonic possession, Ed and Lorraine attempt to help the besieged girl, and her family. But they only vex the demon, and find themselves targeted by the malicious spirits.....It's a pretty audacious move by the makers to have the opening ten minutes set in one of the most famous horror houses of all, Amityville, because they are potentially setting themselves up to fail, or setting themselves up for a third movie, to give us a taste of things to come, ala Insidious.But once we are re-directed to London (which is pointed out to us by having The Clash's London Calling playing over the scene), the film becomes more intense, thanks to the performances of the children, particularly Janet.The film has all your regular clichés which are found in these films, silly long corridors with a tent at one end, faces in mirrors, and best of all, a painting of a nun, that is so genuinely terrifying, it's garnered its own spin-off (again).If you can get over the ri-Dick Van Dyke-ulous accents, and the fact that if you listen to the Radio 5 Film Programme, the demon sounds like Simon Mayos real voice, this is a pretty decent, if slightly overlong horror.But pleas check out The Enfield Haunting too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unoriginal, yet scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this was a surprisingly strong sequel. As a fan of the first movie, I've been looking forward to this for quite some time. I watch a lot of horror movies and it always really bugs me how the setting is similar in all of them: family moves into house, house is haunted, paranormal researchers arrive and save the day. This film was no different and didn't stick out as very creative either but it was still pretty enjoyable. You can usually expect a solid horror movie when you watch something by James Wan. The film has a few good, however predictable scares. It's not subtle horror either, but the jumping-in-your-face kind. I don't really get why this has been rated 10/10 so many times as it is definitely not flawless. Another thing about this movie was its duration. Horror films are usually around 1h 30m, except this one was over 2 hours which I found a bit too long. For example, was that scene of Ed singing "Can't help falling in love" really necessary? In my opinion, you kind of start to lose interest after an hour because there is just that about 20 minutes long part where nothing really happens. To summarize this, I was pleasantly surprised by how well the sequel held up to the first one, however I think that it is still just an average horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Horror. False Truth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no denying the fact this is a slick, well-polished horror film. The director is good. But that is what this is, a horror flick.Going into this knowing the truth about Ed and Lorraine Warren and the actual Enfield case made it difficult for me to watch the movie at first. I honestly had to tell myself to just watch it for what it is, a horror movie.I'm not sure if this is a spoiler or not, but I checked the box anyway just in case, but Ed and Lorraine Warren were exposed years and years ago and frauds. They faked the Amityville case, as well as many others.Fact of the matter is, this movie is very LOOSELY based on a true story. It really bothers me when movies claim to be based on a true story when the movie itself is nothing like the actual truth.Ed and Lorraine Warren barely had anything to do with this case. The Conjuring 2 makes it out like they were the knights in shining armor for the family when in reality they were laughed away from them.The real Enfield case was heavily investigated by others, who on film disproved the claims and exposed the children as staging all of it. The real paranormal investigators on the case videotaped the children throwing things and setting up things and even the one child using a deep voice to sound like a "demon." The case was dismissed.Ed and Lorraine Warren showed up and Ed, in his usual fashion said it was demonic even after the case was disproved as a hoax by the children.With that being said, the Conjuring 2 is based on a hoax children orchestrated and passed off as truth involving two known frauds who in reality had very little to even do with it.You can even do research on the first Conjuring and discover much of the same. The actual people that happened to called out the Warrens and eventually the film as fabricating information.But again, as far as a horror movie goes it is great. Watch it for that. Do not believe for a second any of this actually happened. The direction is phenomenal. The acting, sound, and imagery is superb. This is definitely one of the better horror movies I have seen since honestly the first Conjuring.There is nothing new here. No new ground-breaking material. But the director takes an old formula and makes it work well.I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing in The Conjuring 2 can match the terrific hide-and-clap sequence from the earlier film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing in The Conjuring 2 can match the terrific hide-and-clap sequence from the earlier film ? let's face it, that was always going to be hard to top ? but that's not to say this sequel doesn't pack its share of solid scares. With 2013's The Conjuring, director James Wan, creator of both the Saw and Insidious franchises, managed to pump fresh blood into a genre as creaky as the haunted house thriller. This time he gives us a slow-building pressure-cooker of a film that's a respectable follow-up.Set in 1977, not long after their success in the now famous Amityville case, the film sees hotshot paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) dispatched to London to look into the complaints of a family who claim they're being terrorized by a spirit.Cash-strapped single mom Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) and her four kids are dealing with a lot in their home ? toys go on by themselves in the night, furniture starts flying across the room, and there are frequent rumblings and rattlings from behind the walls that can't be explained. But things really come to a boil when youngest daughter Janet (Madison Wolfe) begins to growl in an old man's voice, and their lives become seriously endangered.The film's period setting and England's gloomy weather contribute a lot by way of atmospherics, and the Hodgson home in a working-class London suburb is all kinds of creepy with unsettling dark corners and rotting damp walls. Wan sets up the mood for some effective scares, giving us the kind of jump-in-your-seat moments we've come to expect from him now. Creepiest of all is a scene involving a framed painting on a wall, and the appearance of long white fingers from behind it.But like the earlier film, what really separates this one from your standard issue horror movie is the level of performance that Wilson and Farmiga bring to the table. They're such good actors they sell the audience on even the cheesier aspects of the story, and of course on the romantic bond between the couple.Although it feels way too long at roughly 133 minutes, and takes many liberties with the truth while still insisting it's based on true events, The Conjuring 2 ultimately succeeds in delivering slow-mounting dread punctuated by powerful moments of absolute terror. I don't know if I can see a nun dressed in a habit without a chill going down my spine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another haunting story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2 is similar to The Conjuring. Another story about a haunting which the Warren's investigate basically a remix of the first installment. The different characters create a rapport which connects with the audience. James Wan (the director) creates a slow build up where the viewer always feels on edge for what is next to happen. Similar to other ghost stories! The usual over dramatic, over the top scares, which makes one wonder about fraud. I roll my eyes with skepticism with haunting stories. I still do not understand why they would store the cursed objects in their own house. I do not care that they lock the door, it is still too close for comfort. Creepy sets, and ghosts, but the ending is just too much to take. The Conjuring 2 is 7 out of ten stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good horror sequel to a mediocre film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always say that I am going to write a short review but I end up rambling on anyway. I really do not care if a horror movie is scary or not. I know that does not make a whole lot sense, since we know that horror movies main objective is to scare you. As long as it is entertaining and interesting, that is all that matters to me. With that being said, "The Conjuring 2" is one of the better mainstream horror sequels in recent years and it really did keep me engaged. James Wan's direction is very good. He successfully makes this a supernatural moody horror flick. Even though there are cheap jump scares that you can see from a mile away, the malevolent forces were way more interesting and threatening, than in the first film. The screenplay by Chad &amp; Carey Hayes, James Wan and David Johnson wisely puts more focus on the family this time, instead of Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga's characters. They play more of a supporting role and it works, following a different path than most horror flicks these days. The cast does an adequate job with what they are given. The supporting cast includes Madison Wolfe, Frances O'Connor, Lauren Esposito, Benjamin Haigh and Patrick McAuley. I remember not being too impressed by the first "Conjuring" film. Matter of fact, it was my last date movie. As for this one, this makes a pretty good date flick. The cinematography by Don Burgess is the best thing about this movie. It is probably the best cinematography that I have seen in mainstream horror film since 2014's "The Purge: Anarchy." This is a well shot film and he totally plays up the "boogeyman lurking around the corner" fear. Go see "The Conjuring 2." It is probably going to be one of the best mainstream horror movies I will see this year. I kind of hate I liked this movie so much because that means I might not like part 3. Part 3 is coming. Box office receipts will prove that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."The Conjuring 2" (2016) for me was probably the best horror movie i've seen since, well... "The Conjuring". Try to skip all trailers and watch this movie in a movie theater - it's a truly one scary and superbly crafted ride. James Wan is definitely a horror movie pro - he knows the genre very well and delivers everything you would expect from this kind of flick and more, much more. Just take the ending scene - you won't expect this kind of closing (no spoilers) scene after all the horror we witnessed during the whole 2 h 15 min. superbly paced ride - a scene which will definitely generate some applauding from audience (at least in my local theater it did). Or take the one were Patrick Wilson character "interogates / talks" with the possessed girl with everyone including him turned away from here - it is a long, one shoot - killer scene.Overall, "The Conjuring 2" was better then i expected it to be. I loved the first movie, witch wasn't perfect, but was a great horror movie. Before attending the screening i had doubts that they probably won't achieve the success of the first movie. I was wrong. It is as good as the original. It is superb sequel in all directions. "The Conjuring" franchise THIS quality is very welcomed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It overcomes its poor plot with new, effective scares.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I walked out of my showing of 'The Conjuring 2' I overheard a family talking amongst themselves. The youngest boy said that the film itself wasn't what scarred him but the noises did. This made me think a lot about what many people deem as horror. It's strange that, to many people, fear is not measured by how it makes them feel but by how far their butts left their seat. For me this is not effective horror. When I see a horror film I want to be affected by it. I want to feel that sense of dread that churns deep in your stomach and makes you sweat through your clothes. Unlike many people that saw this film with me, I thought this film did just that.It's sad that people are writing off this films effectiveness based on the fact that there weren't many jump scares. I mean, there were obviously some in there but the majority of the film is atmosphere. The atmosphere that this film builds really gives off a sinister vibe. As I watched, an eerie feeling washed over me. The sense that this is not something we are suppose to be watching.And this feeling continued for the films two hour run time. The more sinister the plot gets the more you just feel a sense of helplessness. This sense of dread helped the film be more than just any other horror movie. With this feeling surrounding the film the scares hit hard. It knows that jump scares are far better than false scares and it uses it's atmosphere to really make you lose it.If anything jumps you in the film it is the ghost or something the ghost does. It's never like a bird flying around or a person grabbing someones shoulder. Instead the film actually uses the ghost to scare you. What I loved about this movie is how many new, different scares where in it. It's clear that James Wan was having a blast making this movie and he experimented with a lot of new things.Some fall flat but most are extremely cool and effective. Not only was he experimenting with new scares but new camera movements as well. Which all turned out super impressive. There's a great birds eye view shot of people running down a alley that made my jaw drop. That's what separates this film from so many others. The cast and crew seemed like they were having way to much fun with it. It gave the film energy that many don't have. This helped 'The Conjuring 2' elevate itself over a relatively bland story. A story that we have all seen a million times over. Where someone gets haunted, the family gets involved, than things get really bad so they call experts in to cleanse the house.The fact that this isn't anything new or different really does hurt the film. It makes a lot of the scares predictable and the plot points less sharp. Not only that but when your movie runs for more than two hours with a story like this it can get a bit dry near the end. Especially when the previous hour and a half was a none stop scare fest.It's at that point where I began to realize that not a single character had any personality what so ever. All anyone was, was a plot device for the script. A means of forwarding the story to the next scene. They would do something that a normal human probably wouldn't do, get freaked out and than it was on to the next scene.While 'The Conjuring 2' may not be as good as the first film it is still a solid horror flick. It knows what it is and doesn't bother with the extraneous "character building" that many others do during the opening half hour. While it certainly would've made the film better to have characters we cared about, not pretending like they were doing this helped get to what we paid for. Getting the pants scared off of us. And this film does that in a fresh, new, and very effective way. If you're a horror fan this one should not be missed. Just make sure to manage your expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CONJURING 2 REVIEW - Yeah Finally watched it in theater and got a feel of watching a scary horror film in theater after a long time. Couldn't watch The Conjuring in theater but loved it when i watched it in Mobile so i was eagerly waiting to watch The Conjuring 2 in theater at any cost. Expectations were little bit higher and movie pretty much matched that level. Follow my Details - Acting - Good but not upto the mark. Reason- Director didn't give much attention to this field as this is a horror flick not Cult Classic cinema. Still i feel Acting could have been better by all actors. Writing - Very Good ! Story has been written very well, twists and realisticness deserves appreciation. Screenplay - Fantastic ! Screenplay is very tight from the beginning till the end except starting 10 mins which takes time to set a plot, then movie takes pace and keep you hooked till the end. Dialogues - Average ! Nothing impressive, ordinary dialogues and really can't expect much from a True Story. Cinematography - CLASS ! Wow, great work by cameraman. Most scenes have been shot in Dark, Each and every angle looked scary and eye pleasing. Direction - Good but not Great. It is a sequel so obviously everyone will compare it to its prequel and that's why i think Direction wasn't as great as previous one. But still a praise worthy work by a Director, its not easy to complete people's high expectations (Because its Prequel). Film looks tight from its beginning but loose Climax i mean The Conjuring had longer and more interesting climax than this. Here Director failed badly, he could have easily make Climax little bit more scary and interesting but i don't know why he didn't do it. Final Words - Not better than The Conjuring and Despite having bit of loose climax this one is a Must Watch for all. Film will definitely leave you with an scary impact and jitters. Go for it, and enjoy another Breathtaking, Scary and Dangerous experience from Hollywood. 7/10 * Stars by Me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A better and scarier film than the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1977 British haunting known as the Enfield Poltergeist has sparked controversy and has been accused of being complete hogwash. The famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) have now got their work cut out for them with this one. But director/co-writer James Wan is not concerned about busting myths. The guy wants us to be scared silly and have a ball. He has succeeded. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. That's the modus operandi of Wan's latest scare-a-thon, the sequel to the 2013 summer blockbuster. This is better than the first ? bigger, scarier and much more intense. The first film was fun, but it relied too heavily on nostalgic and retro traits, having aped/paid homage to 1979's "The Amityville Horror". This new one is no different ? it acts as a "greatest hits" album of classic horror movie moments ? specifically, those of "Poltergeist" and "The Exorcist". Wan's passion for the genre shines through in every scene. His unnerving atmosphere soaks the film in a shroud of doom and gloom, relentlessly unleashing his old- school house of horrors until the curtain call. It creaks, it moans, it shrieks when need be, never short-changing the character development and audience in the process.This is not the horror film of the year so far (that honour belongs to the haunting indie film "The Witch"), but as far as popcorn horror films go, this one's really good - and a good stepping stone to introduce newcomers to "Exorcist"-style classics, a trait which I suspect was Wan's true intention all along, having already establishing himself as today's go-to filmmaker for spooky films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a great horror movie, but a great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great horror movies are still and have always been possible, but classics within this genre feels like a thing of the past, until now.In this day and age of sequels, prequels, remakes and book based movies, it seems like there is very little room for classics, the conjuring 1 was exactly that. It did what most horror movies does not, it managed to build suspense without compromising story or character establishment and development.This is one of those rare cases where the sequel outshines the original. It manages to bring with it everything that made the first great while still establishing a new story that is different enough so that it doesn't feel like a 'and now the conclusion' to the first, it is its own story. At the same time, it also brings with it some of the characters from the first movie, and since we can now skip a good part of the character establishment, it frees up a whole lot more room for building of suspense.Most horror movies rely on the 'jump scare', so does this one. But where you normally see a cut or jump to scenes where said 'jump scare' is, the conjuring 2 never stops the camera. A great example of this 'VERY SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING' is when the kid is looking under his bed, normally we'd see the kid get into position on the bed and sticking his head down under, and in the moment he look under the bed we'd cut to to the same view he has. In the conjuring the camera never look away, in an elevator fashion it is brought down under the bed and for 0.2 seconds the bed obscures our view as it would the kids, and the we see under the bed, the camera is then brought back up the same way it was brought down, and they manage to make the ascent so much worse then the descent, at no point doing the 30 seconds does the camera jump, cut or look away, we are forced to watch it like we would with our own eyes, and it works great. The conjuring 2 does something i have not seen in a very long time, it changed the recipe. I would be surprised if this is not ripped of a lot in the next few years, and to be honest i hope it does, because that would mean we're back in an era of not only modest or mediocre horrors but an era of phenomenal ones, like we saw in the 70's and then again in the 90's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to say WOW, but someone beat me to it.I watch a lot of horror movies and most of them are just plain crap. I saw "Darling" and it was stupid; "Holidays" were a bunch of idiotic gory stories that made no sense, but this movie had it all.It had real characters and they were developed well enough to care about what happened to them. It was even touching in parts.But the main thing is that it delivered on all levels.Here's my spoiler: there seems to be a common thread in all true haunting stories. It seems that when someone dies and doesn't go to the light for whatever reason, it leaves a door open and demons seem to get in. They then try to use that ghost to attack others. I've seen it in dozens of true accounts of hauntings.Hope this doesn't distract you from seeing it because it's very well done. Lots of scares and when you have characters you really care for it makes it all matter even more.Not like those horrors where you hate all the idiots running from the killer and you can't wait for them to be killed off one by one.Anyway, I liked this movie a lot. I hope they do more like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wan back to doing what he does best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the better horror movies to emerge from the last decade finally gets a follow up with The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case. Director James Wan is back to doing what he does best after indulging himself hopelessly in the Furious franchise - something I've not entirely forgiven him for. Now that he has that out of his system, he fleets back to the one franchise still very much appreciated, that is if we quietly disregard Annabelle (2014) - something I have most definitely not forgiven him for. The Enfield Case has everything you want in a sequel; the setting, London, England 1977 and we see the return of the ever palpable Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as our favourite ghost-hunters, Ed and Lorraine Warren. Although, those of you who managed to catch the, quite brilliant, three part series on Sky 1, The Enfield Haunting, will have been subjected to some unfortunate spoilers. But worry not, there's more to this story than a great way to tell it and, after a small time-out, Wan doesn't hold back on the big-budget- scares.Enfield, North London is the birthplace of one of the most documented hauntings in British history where the Hodgeson family were subjected to a series of ghastly shenanigans. In particular, the youngest daughter of the family, Janet, played here by a precocious Madison Wolfe, who is tormented and sometimes embodied by the spirit of a previous resident, Bill Wilkins. When the incidents become more frequent the family turn to the church for sanctuary who, in turn, contacts Ed and Lorraine Warren to investigate. Meanwhile, Lorraine is facing her own demons and is haunted by the spirit of the Amityville case who gives her a terrifying premonition of Ed's death.One thing that makes this movie a cut above most horror that has been recently released is that it is very well made. Wan captures the bleak and impoverished conditions of the late 1970's working class. For those who lived and were raised through the late 70's, early 80's, there is a strong sense of familiarity. The patterned curtains, mismatched bedspreads and garish wallpaper, Wan taps into a familiar fear of helplessness that comes with those childhood memories; or even that uneasy feeling you get when you enter a musty, old house of the recently deceased. Though most of the suspense stems from Wan's ability to make your skin crawl, he isn't afraid to parade the obvious scare. His excessive use of quick camera shifts make it easy predict when a big jump is coming, with the old, 'it's behind you!' trick, but it makes you feel rather ashamed when he still manages to get you; especially when you're too old to hide your eyes behind your fingers so you revert to muttering expletives under your breath. The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case is a popcorn horror for the nonchalant. It's a testament to Wan's style of film-making. The haunted house / possession genre has exhausted all of its resources but, regardless of his critics, Wan does not pretend that he has reinvented the wheel. Instead, he throws everything into the boiling pot for it to ultimately reach its over-produced, climactic ending; gratuitous entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crooked Man always did seem like a creepy nursery rhyme...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Wan, perhaps the premiere modern horror director ("Saw," "Insidious"), makes graphically regal films that often exceed the genre's visual conventions. His popular "Conjuring" films give him the opportunity to show that skill. With gorgeous period-piece settings, the general warmness to the coloring works as a nice counterpoint to the scares. While this newest entry doesn't quite sidestep all of the clichés in modern horror (giggling children, creepy toys, red herring scares), it does askew some. The just-brainy-enough storytelling mixed with the super strong direction make it a distinctly solid studio horror trip. Based on "true events," we find paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren traveling to the UK to study a peculiar and sinister haunting of a young, single-parent family. Along the way, some plot conveniences and illogical creature rules haunt the proceedings. Luckily, these are overshadowed by some fantastically creepy monster designs, including a boldly sadistic nun-figure and a terrifying rendition of the "Crooked Man" nursery rhyme, all underscored by effectively cool music and sound design. By now, Wan has proved he knows what he's doing in the scare department. However, some surprisingly adept humor cuts through the horrific drama, allowing the themes of family and dangerous commitment to shine through. But what really makes the whole thing work are the people. In spite of the few plotting flaws, in the center of the story are characters you wanna root for. They are funny, loving, sympathetic and real; they are human-feeling people who make human-feeling decisions. With this beautiful control over tone and character, Wan feels only a step away from making a true masterpiece. Until then, this will more than do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised to see the great reviews for this movie, in my opinion it was just another tired James Wan film. it wasn't horrible or anything, and if you liked The Conjuring 1 then you will definitely like this one. It just seemed to me that it relied too heavily on jump-scares. There were some parts in the the movie that were unintentionally hilarious. It was very hard for me to take this movie seriously and, the aforementioned unintentionally funny bits they are very few and far between. VERDICT: I would not recommend it personally, it wasn't ironically good but it wasn't unironically good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Warrens are back with a new case to solve and a new demon to cast out. The Conjuring 2 reunites us with Ed and Lorraine Warren 6 years after the events of The Conjuring, This time the Ghostbusting dynamic duo are called to Enfield England to help a family of 5 in what would become the longest recorded paranormal case in history. Following the previous films three stages of possession the film escalates perfectly and unfortunately for Ed and Lorraine, they have become targeted by this demon as well.The return of the Conjuring also sees the return of Director James Wan, back to the series and the horror genre after directing 2015's Fast and Furous 7. Wan knocks it out the park yet again with this horror movie sequel. The tension is unbearable, the imagery is horrifying and the film is scary as f*ck. This film puts Wan's tension building ability to the test and Wan rises to the occasion, making several scenes borderline unbearable to watch. The Conjuring 2 wouldn't be as good as it is if James Wan didn't direct. The film proves once again why James Wan is the best horror director working today.The acting in this film is great. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprises their roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren, this time adding a more personal touch (and awesome Elvis impression) to their respected characters. The chemistry the two have is believable and brings a human touch to this paranormal horror film. Like the first film the child actors are good (great by child actor standards), especially Madision Wolfe who is great as the tormented and occasionally possessed Janet Hodgson.I couldn't help but feel there was a wasted opportunity when the Amityville case was glossed over at the films start. Although the opening is wonderfully shot (similarly to NBC's Hannibal) I still think it could have been its own conjuring sequel. The films foreshadowing of events was rather obvious except such as the focus on the dog bell and he crooked man toy etc. Speaking of the crooked man, the scene where the dog transforms into the crooked man didn't really fit in and was almost laughable due to how bizarre and wtf the moment was.Overall the Conjuring 2 is a well acted, well directed horror film that is overflowing with tension and that also has heart. This film marks a successful start to the Conjuring sequel series and hopefully there are more to come, and more importantly that James Wan acts as director for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; - powerful but predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Wan is back in the director's chair for the sequel to the surprisingly deep, personal and scary 2013 movie. This time the Warrens head to England, ridden with bad teeth and wobbly accents.The beauty of the first movie was the bond between Ed and Lorraine. Thankfully they're back with the depth, warmth and likability from before. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are fantastic in the core roles, and their strength and integrity pull the movie through. The Hodgson family aren't quite so strong, the child performances are a little temperamental (though Madison Wolfe plays the possessed very well). Still, despite its shakiness, they're all characters you can sympathise with and root for.The writing, on the other hand, isn't quite so impressive. The story has some interesting twists, but mostly falls into the same old haunted house routine. The set-up exposition is a little too unsubtle, and the final act is downright stupid (the lightning/tree incident particularly). A lot of the dialogue flickers from clunky to believable, but all the typical clichés are there.The real question is, is it scary? There's a lot of tension in places (hiding under the sheets), but often the payoff never quite pays off. The demonic nun is a fairly menacing presence, and the use of light and shade is standard but well executed, yet it never quite gels. The pacing is also a little off, there's not quite enough to fill the 2 hours 12 minutes (compared to most horrors which clock in around the 90 minute mark).As before, strong characters and acting, but there's nothing to make The Conjuring 2 stand out from the rest. Worth a watch, but doesn't have the same charm as the first.3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The enfield case is a famous supernatural case that happened in real life in 1977 and made news headlines around the world, for the conjuring film to take this case on was brave. I admit i was cautious about this film as the first outing was brilliant and we know that sequels don't live up to the first one, well ill admit im wrong! The conjuring 2 is absolutely brilliant its a great take on another real life case and with plenty of other real stories this film franchise could continue to be a success. The story of the investigators Lorraine and ed warren who are sent to England by the church to help a single mom of 4 with a demonic presence in their house, the story and script is so well written and you can tell a lot of thoughts went into it. The jump scares are not as good as the first film but still a great film and if there is a sequel you must watch then this is it!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember being pretty disappointed when The Conjuring first came out. The Internet was building it up to be one of the scariest films ever made and I was getting really excited to be properly scared. I don't usually get scared in films, but James Wan's very own Insidious did manage to conjure up (pardon the pun) some genuinely terrifying imagery so I had every right to expect the same from The Conjuring but the film didn't scare me at all. It wasn't until I re-watched it recently that I realised that whilst it isn't a scary film to me, I can appreciate it for being a very well-made horror film.So when The Conjuring 2 reviews came out and were citing similar hype, I tried to put aside the claims of it being even better than the first film and went in with an open mind, almost expecting it to be a disappointment, but it wasn't. The Conjuring 2 is one of those very rare sequels (even rarer in the horror genre) which manages to better the first. It still has its problems and I still don't think it's scary or that it outdoes Insidious, but it is a fine example of haunted house horror which can stand proudly on its own.You'd be forgiven for thinking that it's simply more of the same when the film starts as it's almost identical to the first film. A seemingly unrelated case opens the film and the title flashes up on the screen along with some jargon about the film being true and this case is yet again the scariest The Warrens' have ever encountered blah blah blah. It's basic scare tactics that might work for horror virgins but us aficionados will just be rolling our eyes. To be fair, the opening scene is actually very well directed and gives you some idea of the film's overall quality. We're soon plunged into 1970's England and we're given constant reminders of this which is something that irritated me. Maybe it's because I'm English myself but the stereotypes were often quite overwhelming, although amusing. Every car in the driveway is a Mini Cooper, The Queen often pops up on the telly and everyone has a seriously strong cockney accent. I know that it's set in London but even so it sounds like most of the actors have moulded their accents on Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. I also found Frances O Connor a little wooden and unconvincing at times as well as a few of the kids.Overall the acting is terrific though. I was particularly impressed with Madison Wolfe as Margaret, the main girl, who gave off Linda Blair vibes at times. The role asks a lot of such a young actress but she tackles it head on and it's pretty extraordinary to watch. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are also as excellent as ever as our favourite paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren. I really liked how the film focused so much on their relationship so that it became the emotional core of the film. Similarly, Wan takes his time to carefully build the characters in England so that we become invested in them and actually care about what's going to happen to them. It's such a rarity these days to find a horror film with characters you feel involved with and this is the main aspect which makes The Conjuring 2 so strong and compelling.The other great thing about the film is its atmosphere. James Wan clearly has a deep love for the horror genre and The Conjuring 2 is a labour of this love. The whole film is deliciously Gothic and over-the-top, it's a horror fan's dream come true. There are a lot of spooky scenes crammed into the film and whilst they didn't particularly scare me, you can't help but appreciate the stylishness and effectiveness of them. James Wan really is a master behind the camera and knows how to create genuine tension. Like the first film, a lot of scenes are filmed skilfully in one fluid take and it often becomes very intense, especially combined with the striking loud score and sound design.Even the typical horror clichés like possession and creaky doors are done in such an effective way that you don't care that you've seen it a hundred times before. With a running time of over two hours, I was still left feeling eager for more. The Conjuring 2 creates a gorgeous world of horror and allows you to sink within it. It will leave horror fans consistently grinning from ear to ear. The demon/ghost designs in this one are also much more creative than the first film. The nun character (played by the same lady who acted as the iconic bum in Mulholland Dr) was memorably creepy and a bizarre character known as the crooked man is weirdly delightful, although some might find him a jarringly out of place.If you're a fan of the horror genre then I can't really see any reason for disliking The Conjuring 2, and if you're not a horror fan then what are you bloody doing watching a horror film? Recent films like The Witch, It Follows and The Babadook may be better but that doesn't make The Conjuring 2 obsolete. It's a beautifully crafted piece of supernatural horror which delivers atmosphere and suspense in spades. Some of it does feel a little contrived towards the end but the finale's so excitingly pulse-pounding and intense that you're unlikely to care. It makes sure that the audience actually care about the people on screen so it's never dull for one moment. A third film will definitely be on the cards and if it carries on being as solid as this one then we might be looking at the best supernatural horror franchise since... Well, ever.Read more reviews at www.moviesplusmadness.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Generally i'm not a fan of 'horror' but I watched (and enjoyed) The Conjuring and then felt compelled to go and see the sequel The Conjuring 2.The Conjuring 2 has a decent plot, telling a good 'ghost story'.The Warrens have been investigating spooky things in the US. They decide to take a break from this, as Mrs Warren (a clairvoyant) is getting premonitions of her husbands death, via a very nasty demonic thing dressed up like a nun. (which was genuinely spooky) However, on hearing the plight of a single parent family of young children in Enfield, London, being haunted by a nasty old man. The Warrens feel have to help, particularly as they are asked by 'the church' (unofficially) to go investigate. The haunting has already attracted a lot of media attention. They arrive at the house and begin to find things are much worse than imagined. What initially seems to be a rather nasty ghost of an old man is actually a spirit being held and controlled by a demonic being (the scary nun thing) It is a fairly predictable demon/ghost story in that it has a happy ending. But how it tells the story is very good and keeps you guessing and enthralled. What's too like: - The films set in the 1970's but has a sort of almost 1940's dismal atmosphere at times. (this is also detrimental too a degree see further down)Acting and characters are all generally good.Plot is believable and logical, it builds a story with suspense rather than just making the audience jump. I found the nun demon thing satisfyingly scary/ghoulish as was the old man. The child actors and 'mum' are very convincing in their terrors. All in all a satisfying scary tale, where good does eventually vanquish evil nasty things. Niggly things that irritated: It's the 1970's, electricity has been invented for some time, kids in particular, will turn on the lights instead of walking around in the dark in the wee hours.Maurice Grosse ! Looked ludicrous and I kept expecting him to be a comedy character (but wasn't)Running time of 2hrs 14mins perhaps a bit long winded at times. Mixed up era.! A council house that so flooded in the cellar it has a lake ? So much flooding and rickety structure, the whole house should be condemned!!!! It's a 1970s council house i.e. at that time, a relatively new property. Council's also maintain their properties so would not allow such decay/damage. It's not a 1930's ghetto. At times the English 'cockney' accents did sound similar to 'Dick Van Dyke' in Mary Poppins. These are relatively minor complaints. Well worth a watch 8/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lorraine wanting to retire from the spiritual field and Ed Warren tired of justifying what they do travel to north London to help a family plagued by a malicious spirit.Opening with a chilling medium session at the notorious Amityville home, where Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) has an encounter with the dead Lutz family and a demon nun, director James Wan hits the horror road running. The creepy nun from Ed's (Patrick Wilson) painting an omen of death later turns up at Ed and Lorraine's home and we're introduced to their teenage daughter. Meanwhile, a single mother raising four children are harassed by the previous deceased occupant. With a fistful of writers and the sharp editor, Wan creates a good build up, fleeting between the US and UK and although it takes its time getting Ed and Lorraine to the English house, it works giving the film scope.The cast particularly the child actors are great and Farmiga shines. Wilson delivers another great performance as the matter of fact Ed. Incidentally as well as being a handy man, he also does a good acoustic rendition of Elvis' "Can't Help Falling in Love". The notable German actress Franka Potente also appears as a sceptic but gets very little screen time. Simon McBurney is solid and almost equals Timothy Spall's performance as Maurice Grosse. Like its predecessor it shares much with other haunting films but it stands on its own due to Wan's execution, he knows horror, the eeriness, atmosphere, timing of visuals and sound to get hairs standing on end effortlessly. Something which the rushed Annabelle (2014) arguably lacked in his absence as director.With a pause for thought, like true crime murders, it gets under your skin and you can't help feel that someone is profiting from someone else's misery. Conscious aside, true or not, Wan stays close to the Enfield Haunting's beats with plenty of artistic licence to inject enough practical and CGI effects without it losing its grounded feel too much in the first three quarters.From wall posters to wallpapers, clothes and cars the 1977 is recreated almost perfectly. There is a set up with a remote control, although I don't recall there being remotes like that in Great Britain, or at least the family surely wouldn't have been able to afford that TV, in any case, the set up is still effectively creepy with a great jump scare when the young girl encounters an old man in both a reflection and face to face. As well as a scary zoetrope toy and fire engine, there's a horrific moment where the girls young brother is tricked into thinking a ghoul is a dog wanting to go out by ringing a bell next to the door.The UK terraced neighbour setting sets it apart, but naturally its reminiscent of the three part The Enfield Haunting (2015) and When the Lights Went Out (2012) which told the 1974 Black Monk of Pontefract story. Nevertheless, Wan to his credit recreates the Brit 70s injecting some nostalgia for the viewer, with the location, The Jam, TV clips of the day and so on. Wan packs the Conjuring 2 with energy, jumps scares and handles the emotional scenes delicately. In the closing act there's a twist as it tries to hone The Exorcist. While it may not have the grit and weight of the aforementioned, it has an entertaining mix of drama and horror to set it apart from many others. As Ed and Lorraine do battle at the end, Ed stops the young girl falling to her death as Lorraine word duels with the demon (akin to the design of 2005's The Nun/La Monja), yes there's an unnecessary wash of practical and computer imagery in the finale but it comes back to earth with an eerie text epilogue, then the couple add the zoetrope toy to their collection which is followed by the leads bursting with chesmisty dancing happily together.With Ouija boards, spooky nuns, spectres, toys, moving furniture, ghosts, demonic voices and so on you can't go wrong. Excellent mainstream horror entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people have said this sequel is better and scarier than the original. Personally, I think it's just as equally creepy. I think James Wan is a great horror director. He knows how to get the job done and actually scare me. (Dead Silence actually scared me when I saw it at the theater) The Conjuring movies are period films and take place in the 1970's. I love that it naturally looks like the 70's and not fake like Tim Burton's Dark Shadows. This film features the Amityville Horror house in the beginning, then the majority of it is about the Enfield Poltergeist in London, England. In 1977, the Hodgson family begin to experience demonic and supernatural occurrences in their house, mostly at night time. The spirit haunting them seems to be Bill Wilkins, the previous owner who died in the living room. The youngest daughter, Janet becomes possessed and keeps telling the family to get out. Ed and Lorraine Warren are called to the scene to observe and report only. Will they find that the house is truly haunted, or is it actually all a hoax? If you love ghosts, and demonic possession, I highly recommend THE CONJURING 2!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Followup and Frightening All Its Own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The inherent value of a good horror film is its ability to evoke primordial emotions out of its audience. In today's ever commercially consumed society, there seems to be less variety when it comes to comedy, drama, action etc. It's as if big Hollywood studios have found the perfect algorithms to keep viewers laughing, sobbing or on the edge of their seats. That said, there's still a diversity of ways movies can disturb, unsettle and frighten. One need only look at the two most acclaimed horror movies thus far this year; The Witch (2015) and The Conjuring 2 (2016) to see there's still variety. Yet while The Witch was quietly subversive, The Conjuring 2 is a happy celebration of classic horror movie tropes.The Conjuring 2 revisits husband and wife team the Warrens (Wilson &amp; Farmiga) as they investigate the paranormal occurrences of the Endfield House in 1970's London. The Hodgson family seems to have disturbed a former resident of the house whose spirit has taken a liking to youngest daughter Janet (Wolfe). With nowhere to turn to and the case becoming a bit of a media circus, the Warrens are resistant to help partially due to Lorraine Warren's premonition of Ed Warren's death.The Conjuring 2 stands as a textbook example of effective horror house chills and thrills using every technique at its disposal. Everything from high-minded and meticulously created atmosphere and looming dread to low-brow jump scares are administered smartly; stabilizing some of its clichés with brilliant cinematography. Director James Wan recycles a few of the visual motifs of Insidious (2010) and the first Conjuring (2013) but let's not assume every horror movie should be groundbreaking.Of course at twice the budget as the original, It'd almost feel a waste if The Conjuring 2 decided not to up the ante. Thus instead of two ghostly spirits, the film conjures three, one of which represents the manifestation of youngest son Billy's (Haigh) nightmares. It is the inclusion of this third sprite that the movie starts to lose much of the scrappy competency that made the first so memorable. That and the lack of a showstopping possession. Don't get me wrong the young Madison Wolfe does a tremendous job but Lili Taylor's performance in The Conjuring single-handedly saved the original from third act folly.Unfortunately, The Conjuring 2 fidgets uncomfortably under such folly, submitting a third act that is at once climactic yet technically disappointing. There are other disappointments as well; many of which stem from constantly hearkening to other, better films. There are references and visual cues to The Omen (1976), The Haunting (1963) and of course The Amityville Horror (1979) which serves less as an integral part of the story and more of a blatant case of horror movie fandom.Yet for all it's faults, The Conjuring 2 still remains a decent followup to the original and a refreshingly frightening film all it's own. While it doesn't break the mold by any means, the continuation of the Warrens investigations into the paranormal feeds into a certain cultural zeitgeist that popular culture is all to willing to consume. Perhaps horror films serve another function other than to disturb, unsettle and frighten. Perhaps that also exist as an exercise in formalist filmmaking that's unfettered by irony and cynicism. In other words, perhaps some people just need something to believe in.www.theyservepopcorninhell.blospot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2 (2016): Dir: James Wan / Cast: Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Frances O'Connor, Madison Wolfe, Lauren Esposito: It is rare and refreshing to see horror films that contain a strong sense of good over evil but The Conjuring did it and its sequel, although not as strong, still pulls it off. It opens with an interesting reference to The Amityville Horror before Ed and Lorraine Warren are off to help a single mother and her three children deal with supernatural occurrences in their home. Vera Farmiga as Lorraine fears images of her husband's death and prefers to distance herself from her craft. Patrick Wilson as Ed supports his wife's decision but feels that their abilities are needed, and when they are summoned to assist this family he is well aware of his wife's premonition. Frances O'Connor plays the frustrated mother who learns quickly that strange horrific things are happening. Her youngest daughter is often sleepwalking and ending up in a chair that holds a dire history. The oldest daughter awakens to the bed shaking as with The Exorcist. Her son is troubled with the tent he has set up at the end of the hall that homes a demonic presence. Director James Wan surpasses his Saw franchise as well as Insidious with this effective franchise that presents Christianity in a positive meaningful manner that doesn't push the boundaries. It also presents a heart felt relationship between Ed and Lorraine that is highlighted with an Elvis Presley hit. With special effects that equal the original in its ghostly effects this becomes an entertaining horror film that promises a light at the end of a dark gloomy tunnel. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't scare easy but the Conjuring series manages to do that :D.This movie is way better than the first one (Conjuring 1 was good too).I was watching this movie at home all alone, I always turn down lights when watching movies. The nun demon scared me to such an extent that I had to get up and turn on the lights of my room and the adjacent room as well lol.Actors are good, well I love Vera Farmiga in all sort of characters.I feel very uneasy around nuns and clowns normally and when they showed the Demon Nun I was like OMG!!! Believe me that's super scary.The set, direction and the storyline is good. However I felt that the closing of the movie i.e the way Warren's fight and contains the demon could have been longer and more elaborate. Vera Farmiga as Lorraine Warren reveals the name of the nun demon and condemns her to hell and that's it.So my verdict is go watch the movie, I bet it will not disappoint you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive sequel, Not all paranormal cases are from the USA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the original movie the Conjuring I was extremely impressed.I have studied many cases dealing with the paranormal and I'm very familiar with Ed and Lorraine Warren, also the cases they were involved in, or so I thought.When I heard that there was going to be a sequel, I had a pretty good idea what the second one would be about, as a clue was left in the first movie when Lorraine said that a priest needed help for a case in Long Island, New York. That case turned out to be Amityville.When I found out that this movie would be about the Enfield Poltergeist case in London, England. I spent a great deal of time scratching my head thinking The Warrens never investigated or were involved in that case.It turned out that they were involved in the Enfield case, but not to the extent that you would see in Conjuring 2. They did visit the house, but were only there briefly. One of the original investigators (who strangely enough wasn't even in this movie) said that Warrens showed up uninvited.Because I know about the Enfield case, I noticed there was some bits in the movie which is not correct.1) One of the investigators who wrote the book which talks about the Enfield Poltergeist case isn't even in the movie Guy Lyon Playfair. He should've been. (If your interested, the name of the book is called "This house is haunted" and it's worth reading, believe me)2) In the movie, Ed Warren filled Janet Hodgson mouth with water to see if the voice could still speak. That did happen, but it was Maurice Grosse that did that and put tape on Janet's mouth so she couldn't spit out the water, but the voice still spoke.3) There is a scene where Janet was floating about in midair, Now this did happen. However what wasn't shown in the movie is that two independent witnesses also saw this happen outside the house. It's a shame this wasn't added because it would have added more credibility to the movie sticking to the facts of what actually happened during that incident.To give you a more accurate idea of what was happening during this case is to watch The Enfield Haunting or some of the YouTube videos of what was going on around the 1970s and even some of the documentaries about it,because it would give you a better idea of what actually happened.Apart from the errors, it was a brilliant sequel which had a lot more jump moments than in the original and also a lot longer than the original. I personally have a lot of respect for the witnesses and the investigators which include Ed and Loraine in the actual case.If your looking for a great horror sequel this year, look no further. But if your interested in watching a movie adaption of the actual Enfield Poltergeist case. This isn't it, but still makes for great viewing anyway.James Wan and the cast did a fantastic job to bring one of the most well documented cases which happened in the UK and not the USA to the big screen. As I said in my Summary, Not all paranormal cases are from the US. This one came from the UK and there are a few more others as well also from the UK.Happy viewing folks, try not to get scared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better, scarier and more engaging than the original. The best horror movie of the decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a huge fan of James Wan ever since Dead silence. I didn't like saw franchise though. I am not a huge fan of Insidious series either because Insidious 2 and 3 disappointed me big time.I have liked The Conjuring it was like a breath of a fresh air for Horror genre. So i had decided to watch the Conjuring 2 not just because of its name but for the director James Wan.As we all know that form is temporary but class is permanent and James Wan has proved yet again that he is a class.To create a masterpiece horror movie like The Conjuring 2 that too after making a action movie like fast and furious 7 shows your class.The story revolves around Lorraine and Ed Warren who travel to north London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by malicious spirit of Bill Willkins who died in a chair due to brain haemorrhage. Lorraine has her own fear and premonition of a demonic nun who threatened to kill her husband Ed in real life.Can she stop her from killing Ed? this is what The conjuring 2 is all about. Truly speaking The Conjuring 2 is scary as hell. There is hardly any movie that made me jump over the seats. The Conjuring 2 has succeeded in doing this.Now a days when we see any trailer of a horror movie 90 percent of the scary scenes of the movie are being revealed in it but James wan is a very clever customer he kept 90% of the scary scenes in the shelves which has not been revealed in any of its trailer you can only see it in the movie.Two scenes that made me jump over the seats were when Lorraine decides to check in the painting room and a demonic nun comes out from nowhere from the painting and a scene when Janet watches TV and figure out a person sitting on a chair behind her and the remote control falls by itself.Those two scenes are the scariest scenes Hollywood has ever witnessed.The conjuring 2 is a sequel that is better and scarier than the original.The Conjuring 2 is engaging and scary from start to finish,The movie and demonic nun creature will be remembered for a long long time.I loved everything about this movie. Being a horror buff you can't afford to miss this flick at any cost.Now I am eagerly waiting for The Conjuring 3.Kudos to James wan for making The Conjuring 2 and creating a creature like demonic Nun. A cinematic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conjuring 2 builds up and up and gets you in its grip, which is what the best horror can hope to do.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Wan is a big fan of horror. It's not always a surefire thing when a creator is someone who is so connected with a form of entertainment (see also from this opening weekend Jones's Warcraft), but if a filmmaker is in tune with the material he's in love with and it works on all cylinders, there's few pleasures to match it in mainstream cinema. This is a major release (done on a "medium" budget of 40 million) and it's done by someone who's clearly a geek for 70's horror, but in a way that is... classy. And scary as all hell; it's not often to use the almost DVD-cover level critic line but, really, The Conjuring 2, if you're open to it, will scare the s*** out of you.Wan's become so saavy with how to deal out suspense, and it comes down to how he paces things. This isn't a short movie, and it's longer than a lot of other movies of its genre at 134 minutes. This is to the film's benefit, as it gives a lot of time to build up the characterizations; Wan gives us the two narratives of this family in England, on poverty row basically, and how the 11 year old girl is traumatized repeatedly by this undead entity named Bill and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga's) own visions of a demon in a nun's outfit going after her and killing Ed (!) (this in part attached to that little known case in Amityville, NY). We get so much time with the both sides that by the time the Warren's come to England the movie's halfway in, and it's time to get to the meat of the story.A lot of what impresses me with The Conjuring 2 isn't so much the elements that we're familiar with by now when it comes to demonic-Christian-drenched horror: we know that the people will come in to the house with the crosses out to get the ghosts or demons or whatever-you-remember-from-The-Exorcist out, and that there will be characters flailing about in the air and objects flying across rooms and terrified characters. What matters is execution, and Wan and his cinematographer and production designer (this IS the 70's!) makes everything palpable and pop. When a little girl is hiding under the covers and Wan switches to a POV of the demonic entity coming in to the bedroom and towards her bed, it feels terrifying because of how all of the shots are paced and cut together and how much we believe this young actress (Madison Wolfe as Janet Hodgson, outstanding especially in the quieter moments like on the swing with Lorraine when they meet).It's a terrifying trip into the darker recesses of the human soul, and it also comes down to how Wan makes sure to depict the people and places with a degree of honesty in the drama that is outside of the junk/baby food modern horror audiences are used to. It might be a lot sometimes to ask for quality acting, or a budget higher than 5 million, but it does make a difference, and here Wan takes his time with them and it's clear they had preparation before they stepped into a story that involves family and love at the core. I liked that part of it too, that it emphasizes the bond of a family, or a married couple, in the face of evil and demons and the afterlife. So while it deals in tropes of the genre - the audio recordings that reveal more than we first heard, the "trick" video footage, the otherworldly inner "voice" taking over a character (in a real, deeply troubling psychological sense than just the surface one too) - it doesn't cheapen what's happening to them.I felt invested in this family, which also features a compelling performance by Frances O'Connor as the mother of the family, and it pays off in set piece after set piece, paced out with wonderful bits for character development (including an acoustic Elvis performance by Patrick Wilson!), so that by the time the gigantic, thunderstorm climax comes we can still rock with the over-the-top punches that, of course, didn't happen in the "based on a true story". And yes, the climax is a little too long and features a CGI character that goes too far. But I can forgive these flaws because of the other 2 hours that came before it, which comes close to the likes of The Babadook and It Follows and even The Witch as far as digging deep into what makes people tic and drawing out the atmosphere of things like a room or a hallway or a flooded basement, and getting terror by simply holding on a shot sometimes for long enough for it to take on another meaning (i.e. Ed talking to "Bill", back turned, in close-up with the ghost out of focus but still in sight).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still creepy and scary, and remarkably, a decent follow-up to the first one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching the first "Conjuring" movie on DVD was driven by the motivation to scare a friend, who is known to be entertainingly frightened. I am not a fun of horror movies because of their usual shallow story-lines and cheap tricks. Plus, the hype that surrounds them annoys me since a lot of them are just plain cash-making machines, e.g. "The Blair Witch Project". So I was surprised that "The Conjuring" movie has this interesting story-line and lingering creepiness, which was achieved without relying much on visual effects. Indeed, "old-school" darkness and shadows are scarier than trying-hard CGI monsters. And after the movie, we ended up scaring each other with that brilliant "clap scene". So I think this time, it's not bad after all to watch the sequel, "The Conjuring 2", in a movie theater (given that we have the same director, and of course, the same people who portrayed the Warrens).The second movie started with the controversial Amityville Horror case, in which the Warrens were also involved (their most widely known case). In these kind of supernatural cases, people are divided between those who considered the case a hoax and those who believed it to be true, aside from being don't care or neutral. In this case, the film takes the side of the Warrens who considered that something demonic was behind the killings. In our case, as an audience, we are more on the neutral side, just plain listeners to one side of the investigation while seeking entertainment value; somewhat akin to watching a cultural film and being immersed with the cultural point of view in question.For the Warrens, it seems that the Amityville Horror case has greatly affected them, especially Lorraine, who saw premonitions of her husband's death. Then, after that, the film moved to the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, where something paranormal is happening in a public housing unit in London. This is where the film developed the Hodgson family (and it did well enough to make us care about their struggles). This is set in the late 1970's, and remarkably the production values are high because the setting really looked like we are really in the 1970's (and they showed photographs when the end credits rolled) and the camera work is successful most of the time to create tension and suspense. However, what's missing in this film when compared to the first one is an iconic scare scene, e.g. the "clap scene". We practically saw nothing new except a more stylish camera work, more masterful suspense, and a different story-line. The good thing was that most of the scares are effective enough to elicit reaction from the audience (in many occasions, I laughed at the reaction in many false alarms and unexpected scare moments, and that was fun), and the high point of the film was particularly intense (but quite short for our taste). Moreover, we get to see a good attempt at combining horror and comedy, e.g. when the Hodgsons ran away from their house after a disturbing poltergeist activity. James Wan, indeed, improved in his skills as a director, although not much in mixing sentimentality (but I think that Elvis Presley tribute as a way of cheering up the Hodgsons is OK).Another good stuff is the performance of the whole cast, with the special mention of Madison Wolfe, as Janet - the main target of the poltergeist(s) for possession - and Frances O'Connor, as Peggy Hodgson - the struggling mother of four, who was at her wits end to provide for her children. Then, as usual, we got good performances from Vera Farmiga, as Lorraine Warren, and Patrick Wilson, as Ed Warren. Even though we more or less saw related scare scenes before from other movies, e.g. The Exorcist, many of the scares are still effective. However, it is during the time when it attempts to use more CGI that the film loses its effectivity, e.g. the Crooked Man scene. In contrast, we experienced more chills when a shadow was employed, e.g. the nun scene where the demonic, in a form of a nun's shadow, slowly reaches for an eerie nun portrait, and places itself behind it. It is in the "old-school" style where Wan's technique is most effective, and in this manner, I find the first "Conjuring" film to be more creepy than this one. And also, the big difference is that in the first one we don't have much idea about the villain until the climax, but in this one, we more or less have a good idea about the villain's identity and how it looked like given Lorraine's premonitions and an image from one of Ed's dreams. And finally, we find a haunted farmhouse, with centuries-old tale and more ominous villain, to be more creepy than a suburban tale with a less compelling villain background story. However, given the suburban setting, the feat is remarkable, and we had fun watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first but way better than a lot of horror films out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can literally count on the fingers on one hand the great horror films that are intelligent and yet not derivative. James Wan has honed his arsenal of horror aesthetics through the years and he reached his most potent level with The Conjuring in 2013. One of the reasons Wan succeeds so well in this genre is that he knows the audience - when to tighten the piano wire noose and when to let you take in a breath. The scares are simple yet elegant, and damn well effective. It is a tough act to follow. A little personal story first...I am an avid reader, a habit that began when my mom gave me a few Enid Blyton books when I was in P3. But the moment I hit Sec 1 I told myself I need to start reading adult fiction. I remember going to Times at Lucky Plaza, a short walk from my school, and picking out a book to start on my next reading journey. I picked up Jay Anson's The Amityville Horror; I figured by reading this genre it meant I am all grownup. It scared the living daylights out of me. To think that all the stuff actually happened really put the fear of God in me. The Conjuring ended with Ed and Lorraine being called to the Amityville haunting and that is where The Conjuring 2 begins. There is no need for any synopsis because the sequel adheres to its predecessor in form and structure. It is yet another haunted house, this time from across the pond in London. A nice family is being tormented; nightly shenanigans ensue; all levels of hell break loose. An air of familiarity breeds - a little girl possessed, speaking in a husky menacing voice, uncanny levitation - all too familiar. If you have seen the demon possession film The Exorcist, you have seen them all. That isn't a slight against it; merely an observation. As much as Wan can scare us, it is the quiet passages that he also excels in. We understand the pains of the tortured family and the relationship between demonologist and clairvoyant, Ed and Lorraine Warren respectively. Vera Farmiga's Lorraine's tender exterior holds a steadfast sense of justice at bay. Her warm performance counter-balances a Patrick Wilson's Ed who is headstrong in his fight with the demonic monstrosity. Their screen chemistry feels natural and lived-in. It is precisely because Wan makes us fall in love with the characters first that the horror of what happens to them become emotionally unbearable. IMHO where it fumbles for me is the familiarity of the narrative. I see the usual scares coming and none of them resembles the original in terms of elegance and simplicity. I am also of the opinion that great horror movies do not rely a lot on CGI (take a good look at the good ones in the past few years - It Follows, The Babadook and The Witch). The moment I see CGI-ed ghosts my mind starts to tune off (here's looking at you, Crimson Peak). I am also of the opinion that great horror movies don't have a runtime of over 2 hours. My wife would say "chop chop curry pok" and get it done fast and furious. The Conjuring 2 could have used a faster pace to get to the meat. Still, this is a solid piece of horror filmmaking culminating in a full-blown final act of symphonic terror in which so much is at stake. I would definitely welcome a third part but James Wan needs to choose the next case from the Warrens' files wisely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best horror sequel ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Knock Knock' 'Well, hmmm, who's there???' 'Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, (giggles)'The audio tape suddenly played on the recording, well ACTUAL RECORDING when the movie closed the curtains. Hearing the voice made me thought, 'So everything that I went through for 134 minutes a while ago was based on a true story???' (It is told after the Amityville Horror)James Wan did it again, except that this time is even much much better. I was surprised by the sequel as usually the latter being the let-down, as people claimed it to profuse more money for a producer.He commences the movie with Amityville Horror which is very tricky to bring the difference as a lot of horror movies has brought that up as the theme to their stories, and Wan potentially lets the audience gets inside Lorraine's world to find the horrendous truth behind the father's cruelty.But there is a file from the Warrens that shocked the world and it became one of the unprecedented cases in history, and this file is specifically called the Enfield Poltergeist.I don't want to break the eggs for you so in subtlety, the story line is excellent, most of the audience will be left haunting for more at the end. Maybe the structure got stuck with the first Conjuring, but this one tells a more complex plot as Ed and Lorraine struggle with the new era. The twists make the audience gasps for air, why??? Wait until you watch the movie. The pacing is impeccable for a horror movie especially the part when Ed has a pair of burning eyes caused by the pipeline gas. We can see the camera is viewing from Ed's ambiguous eyes like a first-person shooter except that this is not a war movie. Every second the cameras pans to vast angles, the more we induce ourselves to look at the periphery visions despite the scares that are about to reveal.It is unexpected when the shouting and screaming this time isn't annoying. The voices bring beautiful melodies. I know it's bizarre to say this but sometimes the truth is the truth.The horror is a full-time menacing. Even when the Sun filtrates the window, the demons tend to harass the humans. The creepiness is there, it crawls through every corner of your body and makes you shudder.If I was to describe this in one word, it'd be: MASTERPIECERate: 84/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Improved Sequel To A Very Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE CONJURING 2 - I would like to start my review by stating the fact that , this is not at all a usual horror movie we watch every 2nd month of the year full of cliché , usual scares and where every story seems to be same as other. Rather its a HORROR - DRAMA. I mean the horror part of the movie is as much as important as the drama part is. Its not always about the ghost , sometimes its about the love , trust and friendship of a couple , sometimes its about sticking together with your family in hard times and sometimes its about your faith , to believe more than you see. First of all its a really good improvement on a very good movie THE CONJURING. But i would like to say about a couple of things i don't like - Obviously its about spirits and ghosts , so we cant always find logic in the activities of those spirits and ghosts , i mean who knows whatever ghost do why exactly they do. There is not always a reasoning to it. Still i am not exactly convinced with the objective of the ghost in this movie. Let just leave this point here as to elaborate it i have to discuss the story which i don't want to do. The 2nd thing is that - Why exactly a ghost tell his name to a person if he knows that by the name that human can control him. Again to understand what m trying to say , you have to watch the film . Apart from these two thing there are mostly good things in the movie which i m gonna discuss now. James Wan is currently the best horror movie director working in Hollywood. He is also directing the upcoming AQUAMAN in the DC UNIVERSE. And i was a little bit scared about this fact , but after watching conjuring 2 i am totally convinced that he can make a great superhero movie too. I have seen all of his movies , SAW was nice for the genre , DEAD SILENCE was his worst , DEATH sentence was pretty nice , Insidious was better then just good , CONJURING was very good , INSIDIOUS 2 was better then the first Part and then FURIOUS 7 which i guess the whole world liked. Its great to watch how he developed as a director. And m so glade that he decided to give importance to the drama as much as the horror part. Its a long movie , about 2hrs and 15mins , which is way higher then the usual horror movie of one and a half hour. Because as i said its not about the ghost always. Yes it ask for a little patience , but it gets paid off , at least for a movie lover like me who don't need everything in hurry and can give time and chance to the movie to get you dissolve in it. A question can be were there enough horror scenes. I would say yes there are. A lot of . Yes it depends on the amount of horror you consume within yourself , i mean how much a ghost can make you scare. I personally got one JUMP OF ON YOUR SEAT SCENE as well as my friend. But two girls sitting just next to my seat had seen the whole movie with holding each other out of fear. You can judge a lot from that. Another thing what the movie did different that , it is set up in ENGLAND and not America. Which made it a different experience. Let me warn you , if you are watching this in English pleas watch it in a theater which provides subtitle , otherwise it would be difficult to understand the British Accent.The people of England behave in a very different way as compared to Americans. They have more humor and are gentle in behaving. There is a very good comic scene in the movie where two police officers see the chair moving by itself and came out of the house saying they cant help as this thing is beyond them. That particular scene couldn't have been possible if the movie has been set in America because in America the police officers are much more serious in their behavior. And that scene was not the only light moment in the movie. The movie was full of such scenes.Vera Fermiga and Patrick Wilson as Warren HUSBAND - WIFE are great again. They trust each other and work great as a team. They also care very much for each other as they know what they do is a life threatening task. There was a scene where Patrick Wilson sing a song for the Haunted Family to make the situation light for the time being , and at that moment the way Vera looked at her singing husband , her expression shows that how much lucky she feels herself to find ED as his husband. That particular scene is a proof that JAMES WAN can even direct a romantic film.The British Cast was great too. The Girl who played JANET (the possessed girl) and the boy who played his sweet brother BILLY were the best. Cinematography was really good , and the period setting was great. Also the music director has done a nice job. Its a great horror movie about a ghost , but also a sweet movie about a sweet family and also a soothing movie about a lovely couple who like to help others by using the extraordinary power they have. M very selective when it comes to a horror film. But now Conjuring series is among my favorite ones , along with Ring series , Insidious series , Oculus , Exorcist and It FOLLOWS. 8.2/10 by ANuP APu KuMaR..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as the original, and maybe better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty good, but awfully familiar, not to mention long, hybrid of The Exorcist, and The Amityville Horror, about paranormal investigators trying to unravel the mystery of a Marilyn Manson- lookalike haunting in London at Christmas 1977, which gave the film a wonderful and unique setting, possibly its strongest asset. The film has an effectively creepy atmosphere, good visuals, and works best when creating a sense of dread and fear, but too often it will sink to relying on cheap jump scares (most of which are shown in the trailer)The acting is top notch all around, especially the young kids, which makes it as good as, if not better than, the original, which is no small feat, especially in the horror genre. An interesting and unusual twist occurs three quarters of the way in, when "proof" is found of the young girl faking the entire ordeal, for the publicity and fame it could bring her family. But for all those things working in its favour, it can't distract me from noticing an overwhelming feeling of deja vu.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you liked the first one, this one does a good job at hitting the scare meter heights as its predecessor did. Some scenes are pretty full on. James Wann has once again done a great job at creating a lot of tense scenes, specially through the use of some pretty good camera work. Although it's a bit long for a horror film, which is my main criticism...it still manages to keep the audience on edge right till the end. As we left the cinema, judging by the audience's reaction, it will be a movie that will be received by horror fans. Might not be for everyone, but if you're a fan of the horror genre, and considering the it is a genre that is slowly dying unfortunately...The Conjuring 2 definitely stands up high (with the original) above the rest. 4/5 stars.</fullReview>

Well, none of those here. SPOILER ALERT!!! That Transformers scene at the Hodgson's neighbour's house!! I was telling my wife: "Naaah, It's just a dream" but it isn't! Wait, there are two dream sequences, but they are more like visions than insignificant fake scares.This is a winner! Get yourself scared $#!+less. Oh, it's 2 hours' long. But, you won't feel it.Enjoy The Conjuring 2 as I have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like the first one better because: * less CGI effects * the scenes on this movie is predictable * another girl in distraught, it seems to me that this "epidemic" was all copied from the exorcist movieWhat i like about this movie: * the romance between Ed and Lorraine was highlightedThe first part of the movie was really exciting but then it gets boring on the latter part. The static TV thingy is not new. In my opinion this is a case of "creating a sequel just for the heck of it." I find the first one much appealing that its predecessor. I gave it 5/10 because of its lack of originality and its overrated CGI effects. The scary monsters such as VALAK and slender man's brother was also overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary and Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of 'The Conjuring' and I think it's the best horror movie of this decade so far. The expectations were high for the sequel with James Wan returning, but I also knew that the track record for horror sequels in general is not very good. As a horror movie, I think 'The Conjuring 2' succeeded at being entertaining and scary. The camera-work from James Wan is as good as it was in the first entry. The build up to the scary scenes is well-made and I love his establishing shots of the house. Something as banal as a chair can become scary in this movie. To me the best part of this movie was clearly James Wan's direction.In fact, there's a lot of good in this movie, but I was not a fan of the script. I know it's not necessarily fair to compare it to the first one, but we didn't get the big 'Annabelle' or the basement scares that we had in the first one. I also felt like the demon was not very threatening.To me the first 30-45 minutes were really scary and entertaining, at some point I was telling myself "Well, this is almost on par with the first one', but things got a little bit out of hands in the last act. Without giving up spoilers, at some point in the film there's a new ghost entity that reveal itself. When you'll see the movie you will understand what I'm talking about. It took me a little bit out of the story, especially since they kept telling us it's based on a true story. But it was a cool ghost nevertheless.All things together, there are some great performances (I liked the little girl playing Janet) and spooky filmmaking by James Wan. It's not very fair to compare this with the first Conjuring, but if we compare it with other horror movies coming out these days, "The Conjuring 2" prove itself to be a worthy sequel.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great horror sequel, not as good as the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2 is a period piece horror film that continues the story of Ed and Lorraine Warren, two demonologists who are most well known for their investigations into the Amityville haunting. The first film was set before Amityville and concerned one of their lesser known cases. This film is set after Amityville, and mainly concerns the Enfield Poltergeist.The films obviously take a lot of liberties to what *actually* happened. Let's just say that this film is set in an alternate reality where every investigation the Warren family looks into is entirely true. If anyone looks into the actual footage and evidence in the case, it seems to be a pretty elaborate hoax, but in this film, it isn't.That being said, this is an incredibly effective horror film, and some moments definitely caused me to feel incredibly anxious, and I frequently felt the need to push against the seat to get as far away from the screen as possible. The family is incredibly charming and likable, and the acting, especially the main girl character, I found to be quite impressive. There is also a carryover story from the first film concerning the Warren family, as they question the reason why they do what they do.There were some cheesy moments throughout the film that distracted me a little. Some weird and out of place editing choices and other minor stuff. There is an over reliance of CGI in a few scenes that I found distracting. CGI, especially when it's CGI characters, are incredibly hard to make scary, and this film is no exception. However, for the most part this issue is avoided in favour of more traditional methods of scaring the audience.Overall a quality film that is definitely worth watching if you liked the first film. It's not a better film than the first, but there isn't a massive drop in quality that occasionally occurs in sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies of all times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the worst movies made, it's 2h 14min of my life I will never get back. I bet that 50% of the movies budget has gone to paying off reviewers here.It's supposed to be a horror movie but it's not scary at all. The movie relies on cheap jump scares accompanied with music to accelerate the effect, it has no eerie atmosphere, no kind of mystery and no creepiness going on at all. The ghosts/demons are rendered with terrible CGI effects, making it laughable instead of scary.Lets talk about the obvious and stupid plot holes: * The amityville scene has no right being there, it has no logical place in the movie at all. Probably the director just wants to set up an opportunity to milk the franchise more. * We learn that the Marilyn Manson look-alike nun demon behind the massacre at amityville has flown to England to scare some girls there using a dead resident there named Bill because reasons. * The umbrella demon with terrible CGI shows up two times and then vanish because reasons (with no other explanations) * Nun demon, valak, can be banished by saying it's name which it told Lorraine.... WTF? This is beyond stupid! It told it's name even though this is the way to banish it? So incredibly stupid.. If I was Lucifer, Valak would have to clean out his desk because his/it's stupidity is beyond reasons * Ed's crucifix affects the ghost but not the trizillion crucifix in the bedroom * The demons masterplan to kill Ed is to impale him on a a tree... Come on! * The demon wants to possess the annoying girl in the family but in the end scene tries to impale her too because reasonsThe only real horrifying thing in this movie is that the movie tries to shove it down our throats that this is a true story and the Warrens are heroes using the power of god. It's a known fact that the Warrens are hoaxers, manipulating broken families with mental illnesses to convince them they are haunted. It's both revolting and disgusting</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm impressed! 'The Conjuring 2' is a great movie! Although I had read good reviews beforehand, I was still a bit anxious if it could keep up the high standard that was set by the first part back in 2013. After the relatively weak 'Insidious 2' that was James Wan's most disappointing directorial effort to date in my opinion?which is quite surprising as it came out the same year as the 'The Conjuring'?I must admit I did have some doubts. Still, 'Furious 7' was a good movie and it directly precedes 'The Conjuring 2' in Wan's filmography as director, so I was looking forward to seeing it. In fact, most of Wan's directing is quite impressive and there is hardly a movie he directed that I would call a true failure. Before seeing 'The Conjuring 2,' the two Wan movies that I rated highest were 'Saw' (2004) and 'Death Sentence' (2007). That has changed now. I think 'The Conjuring 2' is his most impressive directorial effort to date.It is better than the first part?which was already good?and one of only a few horror movies I have seen in recent years that I would call genuinely creepy. It's quite an achievement to make a horror movie that runs for a whopping 134 minutes that doesn't have any lengths in it and never gets boring. James Wan did that and much more. 'The Conjuring 2' harks back to a number of classics in the horror genre like 'Poltergeist' (1982), 'The Amityville Horror' (1979), 'The Exorcist' (1973), and 'The Sixth Sense' (1999), but does not actually copy them. Wan merely uses a number of the most effective scare tactics that were introduced in those movies but adapts them in his own unique way so that they appeal to a modern audience that has already seen everything. Because of the established settings and well-known scary elements you'd expect to see in this kind of horror movie, 'The Conjuring 2' feels very familiar and I had a sense of déj? vu at certain points in the movie. Nevertheless, the movie does never feel clichéd because Wan is a very creative director who takes inspiration from classic horror movies but never dully imitates them like so many modern-day horror movies do. It's obvious that James Wan knows the horror genre very well and he knows how to effectively re-imagine its conventions and play with established tactics. The first half of the movie is especially eerie with its very effective use of shadows and sounds. I found the sound design done by Eliot Connors and Peter Staubli to be exceptional: Creaking doors, squeaky floors, pattering rain, low ringing bells in the night and all that make for a really spine-chilling atmosphere. Moreover, James Wan's direction is pretty much flawless and Don Burgess' cinematography is impressive. There are a couple of tracking shots in the movie that simply look amazing. The whole cast led by the delightful Vera Farmiga is great, too.What I really love is when directors have an eye for small details in their movies and truly care about seemingly unimportant scenes that don't contribute to the plot but are still crucial as to how an audience perceives a movie. James Wan is such a director. In 'The Conjuring 2,' there is one scene in which Patrick Wilson's character Ed Warren brings a copy of Elvis' 'Blue Hawaii' soundtrack album to the Hodgson house because it was mentioned earlier that the kids' father took his Elvis collection with him when he left the family and the kids loved to listen to it. He puts the record on the turntable and everyone who knows Elvis' music will expect to get to hear the classic song 'Can't Help Falling in Love' now... but the turntable is broken! "What a bummer," I think, but then Patrick Wilson grabs an acoustic guitar that just stands there in the corner, sits down on the edge of an armchair, and delivers a pretty good impromptu take on the song with the kids chiming in at the end. "Great," I think, "but it would have been nice to hear at least a bit of Elvis' original version when they show the record and its cover so prominently in the movie. Oh well." Because of all the creepy stuff that is then going on in the movie, I completely forget about the song, and when Ed stores the Crooked Man music box away after the finale, and I hear those familiar, haunting lines "like a river flows, surely to the sea" from afar, I'm just as surprised as Ed. Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) put a copy of 'Blue Hawaii' on the turntable and the movie ends with her and Ed dancing to "Can't Help Falling in Love." I have heard this fantastic song hundreds of times but it's like hearing a familiar song in a completely new way when it's used so skillfully in a movie. A great way to end a great movie. Actually, I would have expected the movie to end differently with some kind of creepy shot suggesting that evil still lurks around the corner, but James Wan is not a director who bothers with those clichés.So, to put it in a nutshell, this is a very well-made movie that no horror fan should miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. After watching the first Conjuring movie, I was left amazingly satisfied. When I heard that a sequel was coming, I couldn't miss it for the world! I was interested in quenching the thirst I had from the first movie. I watched the movie at the cinema with my friend and we had a blast. The movie exceeded my expectations. It left me so scared I had trouble shoving the images out of my head at night. I probably had a few nightmares about it too. I can't remember, but I know I was scared beyond the shadow of a doubt. I know this because before we watched I told my friend how I hate it when girls scream in a theater, and I became exactly that. I was so humiliated and it was fun. I had to stop watching horror movies for a while. Yep, it's that awesome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is how you make a sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A thoroughly enjoyable night out at the flicks. I saw the first film and loved it and I think I might have enjoyed this sequel even more and whats-more, the screening I went to of this was absolutely still and silent - James Wan had the audience in the palm of his hand which is exactly the way it should be.Wan takes everything you loved about the first film and turns the volume up a couple of more notches. The set design, script, acting and scare scenes are all uniformly masterful. My only criticism would be that it was a tad long and the middle section of the film could have been trimmed down a bit; we reach a point as an audience where we feel that the setup has been established for the final act and we want to move into the final movement of the film but Wan lingers a bit too long and shows us one too many possession scenes I think. This is a minor criticism though.Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson deliver solid performances again and Madison Wolfe and Frances O'Connor (whom I enjoyed immensely in the excellent TV series The Missing) are also excellent. The scare set pieces are fantastic with the early scene of the demon visiting Lorraine at home being one of the best horror scenes in years. Great music and atmosphere and I was pleased to see that Wan even kept the creepy ascending yellow title scroll from the first film.9/10. Loses one point for being slightly too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Demonstrates the true essence of horror movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest horror movies I have ever watched. Still cannot decide which part is better, first or this one. If you are true horror fan, you will enjoy every minute of 2 hours! Excellent and convincing story in the background (not something often seen in the horror movies), perfect acting followed by nicely developed characters and lots, but really lots of scary scenes. I have a feeling that scary scenes are brought to the new, higher level. While watching the movie, there is almost no space where you can relax a bit and feel no tension at all. Even during the daylight scenes you don't feel safe in your seat! Something rarely seen in the horror movies. I just like the way how shoots are made and how camera moves. Everything seems so natural, almost like you are participating in the movie. Don't be fooled that you will feel more safe and not so frighten if you go to cinema in company, it doesn't help at all..Really, absolute horror classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best horror I've seen in awhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't remember what the first "The Conjuring" was like to be honest; I think it involved a family that had one of their children possessed by a demon and they chased it into an underground parking lot - this movie I remember being utterly boring. Then along came "Annabelle" which was meant to be a precursor to the original movie, and I must say it was quite good - I saw that one sometime last year. Then along comes "The Conjuring 2" and I was simply blown away by it.The movie starts out with something out of classic horror - those creepy, but very familiar windows from the original "Amytiville Horror", when in fact it is simply touching into horror legend due to the fact it is based on an actual story. Anyway, it goes into the roots of that legend and movie with the original building's inhabitants running out of the house in the middle of the night, never to return. A husband and wife duo appear with others in a group attempting to contact the dead. Things go awry with the wife and she must be pulled from the other side - but not too soon as she tries to figure out just what is going on. They later appear in a television show to be mocked and ridiculed for their spirit hunting.The movie fast forwards to a house over in England where the main haunting of the movie takes place. A divorced woman and her four children (especially one of the daughters) is the subject of a poltergeist of sorts that wants to terrorize the family and feed off of their fear. It starts out pretty slowly, with what I can only call character development and combined with the Amytiville reference, it was looking to be a slow buildup, and a boring letdown. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie quickly escalates into lots of good camera angles, a surreal atmosphere, as well as art style and scenery that looks like something straight out of "The Babaduke". In fact, for a very long time the movie feels like just that - only with more surprising, suspenseful and action filled sequences. This movie has so much going on with it, it is easy to feel lost or to ask yourself when some of the horror sequences are going to end. Much like "The Babaduke", the movie doesn't have any actual deaths - save for one premonition of one. The movie doesn't do anything really in the way of blood, but tends to play more on the psychological, horror and thriller element in a supernatural setting. To be blunt, the movie feels like a new age horror movie and gives throwbacks to many other horror genres - there is a hallway scene with a scary looking monk who can only be described as "Darth Sidious" along with the young daughter actually having yellow eyes at one point ala "The Exorcist" and even needing to contact the church for help.The movie does go into the finer elements of horror - namely it isn't just the family that it terrorized. It falls into the realm of recovered footage films, 70's style sensationalism, along with characters that are skeptical, but must ultimately put up with some of the strange happenings that seem to be plague this house. Speaking of 70's, this movie takes place in the 70's and goes back to a time when there are no smartphones - so no 'there's no signal' moments here. The retro feel makes it that much more of a horror film because the only linkup with the rest of the world is their (the main family) friends, the people helping them out, the church and then the media.This movie, is quit frankly one of the best horror films I have every seen; I highly recommend this film, especially if you have seen "The Babaduke".Originally posted to Orion Age (http://www.orionphysics.com/? p=11761)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>typical James Wan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starting off with a compilation of what happened at the Amityville house it all looked fine. If you want to know what happened go watch the original one (1979). Once told we do move over to Enfiled Great Britain to see what is happening over there. Based on the real events late seventies at Enfield.And again i was tricked or possessed by the trailers shown were people are really scared and are screaming. Been in the genre almost 35 years I thought, could it be as scary as The Exorcist (1973). Sadly it wasn't.What it does is again having a lot of jump scene's and creepy voices but even as I did like part 1 this one couldn't satisfy my hunger.Some parts I did enjoy and of course children being possessed do offer something weird but it's so typical James Wan so you know what to expect and you do know what is going to happen like a ghost passes by in a slow and creepy way. For example the painting coming alive, mmm, didn't work for me. Or the crosses being turned upside down...What The Exorcist did I haven't seen yet. I can understand that youth will be frightened to go watch this but for me the hype has killed the spirit.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2,5/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle but filled me criteria</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another movie I saw at the theaters, at first I didn't expect anything from this movies even though the first one was very good, but, as every other sequence it had only two ways to go, kind of good or really bad. As the movie started with a very subtle psychological horror flick it caught my complete attention to the screen, the art and camera direction where completely stunning I can't find a single reason to not watch it, at least, for the art itself. The usage of a not really known character like the crooked man was a good shot, the personification was a bit iffy but I can't complain about it since it wasn't the real "monster" in question, but you wouldn't know that until the middle of the movie, I though it was weird that they only revealed the real monster at the almost end of the movie and yet left a bunch of little clues from start to end (for example the dreams with the nun and Valak's name in a bunch of earlier scenes), in my vision the usage of a nun didn't make much sense and wanting it or not, they didn't truly explain why Valak took the figure of a nun. But at the end I did enjoy the movie for it's art in a whole, I would totally recommend it for those of you who like good art directions (like me) and horror movie scripts in general.</fullReview>

I'm never one to jump at everything 'scary' I see in movies as usually you've seen it all before &amp; let's be honest, nothing really scares you much when your not a teenager anymore. However The Conjuring had me jumping all over the place. At one point I even yelped, much to my embarrassment, but that's why we go to horror movies! To be scared &amp; the conjuring didn't disappoint. All actors gave amazing performances &amp; the story had you never in a state of boredom. Walking out of the cinema I couldn't wait to see what The Conjuring 3 would bring! (Assuming we're lucky enough for another). Definitely a movie to see in the cinema. I give it 10/10!! Great movie!!</fullReview>

If you love the supernatural aspect of horror films, this one will be one of your top favorites! I love movies that leave you waiting for the next one and this one does exactly that. I didn't think they could do it again, but they did! I have been a fan of the true Ed and Lorraine Warren my entire life. Following their cases can keep the Conjuring movies going strong for years to come and every one of them would be as good as the first one. They have had their share of horror and to put it on the big screen makes you feel as if you were a part of their world. These movies are truly inspired. Edge of the seat scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case is a superb horror flick that we have been waiting for so long.THE CONJURING 2 DIRECTION James Wan's affair with scare continues to give you eerie chills. He seems to have mastered the art of going "Boo!" at people. Five minutes glimpse into the life of Ed and Lorraine and it doesn't feel like it's been three years since the first one showed up. Your wounds find another gash and lo you are living a nightmare again.The director uses spine-tingling motion to follow every still act, unlike conventional movies and ends up acing "every moment". You feel as if you are living it. Rambling up and down the house, it feels like you are walking in the shoes of the protagonist of the frame. It creeps you out beyond limit to feel unpredictable terror. The fact that formidable moments aren't placed at junctures where you might expect them, makes his horror stories one of a kind.INCESSANT HORROR So, the unexpected happens, in every frame. So beautiful is its editing that you don't really feel at any point the movie losing its winsome charm. One moment you are scampering to come out from a short heart-attack then boom! comes another. That's how the terror is bestrewn all across The Enfield case.The Conjuring 2 walks in with an extraordinary séance to drop off scare bombs one by one in a gorgeous fashion. The fact that its plot finds the light from a true story makes you question the veracity of it all. But hey! It's a horror movie, and it succeeds in what it set out to achieve in the first place.Patrick Wilson still stays as one of the most powerful actors with his thoughtful mien as he bides by his consumed acting prowess. He goes full-blown enchanting, well supported at all times by the ever so brilliant actress Vera Farmiga. They both complete each other in every sense.To say The Conjuring 2 only had thrills would be an understatement. It is a perfect blend of everything, from thoughtful melodrama to unpredictable story twists, and an enthralling climax that will have you bite your nails spotless.SPOILER OUIJA BOARD AHEAD: The part where Lorraine begs Ed to not venture without her is the most dramatic bit. Her constant apprehension to save him from harm's way will have you feeling sorry for her. Also, you cannot overlook Janet Hodgson, played stunningly by Madison Wolfe. She is simply mind-blowing with her acting. There is so much drama lodged in her that she will rivet you from the moment you set eyes on her. One of the best parts is when Peggy opens up to Lorraine about how her life has drastically changed.Ed and Lorraine's appeasement in The Conjuring 2 will throw you in stark majestic awe. Both stay as the most noteworthy characters ever created. They have a chemistry that is outright unrivalled. Their immense love for each other, the way they try to console the afflicted, their staying over acts to see to it that others are comfortable around, and their intense care for affected families will leave you wondering how beautiful their souls must be in reality.The Conjuring 2 is a definite go-go if you need something thrilling?er supernatural to topple you down from your seats.Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've avoided new horror films for a few years now, considering they all seem to cater to young audiences with no ability to concentrate or follow a plot. Recently however I've been baffled by a few new comers, such as the Conjuring and its sequel.Not only is this film scary, it's beautifully shot, and the set dressing is quite simply astonishing. Some of the gags come a bit out of nowhere, but overall the atmosphere is great. The film has an attention to detail you just don't see very often.The con artists whose adventures this series is based on have a long list of other exploits, and I really hope there will be a whole slew of films like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A ghostbusting couple decides to give it a rest after a demon comes too close, but are drawn irresistibly across the Atlantic by the cries for help from an English family haunted by the spirit of an old man, where things get even closer.Hectic story that rolls out all the tricks to reasonable effect. While Wan does put bums on seats, he's considered a bit safe and does the expected here. But there is some edge to this standard story of puberty possession, with violent entities piercing through the shadows with demonic intent. Early on the scares come through sound jumps, but the visual weirdness takes over and delivers some good stuff.The acting is good, particularly the wife. There is one afterthought scene before the third act, which starts with a false line about taking the music away and develops into a decent tribute to Elvis while failing to deliver any horror effect. That's probably the biggest blip in the pacing of a story that doesn't have enough psychological strength or coherent demon myth to outrun 100 mins.The Christian angle would be nauseating, except there's no sincerity and it fizzles out with maudlin reassurance for the teen audience.The English accents are from drama school, although there is a fair attempt at setting the contemporary scene from 1977 - not sure Maggie called herself the Iron Lady until two years later.Sound design early on was interesting, but after that it's mostly Scorsese-style dropping in of popular old tunes that sets the tone.Overall, more robust from Wan but still safe as houses. Bwahahaha!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visionary director James Wan instills fear of all types in this superior sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I must say I was reluctant to see this movie, because I obviously get scared by horror movies (dur) and the only sessions were at 9:40pm every night... But, I knew my audience would want it, and so I gritted my teeth, and stepped into the movie theater. I hope you guys know the sacrifices I make for you!But I walked out of the theater very impressed. I don't have LOADS of horror movie experience, but what I do know is that most of them have one priority only- to scare the audience. While this was definitely present in this movie, I was pleasantly surprised at how layered and intricate the plot and characters were. Australia's own James Wan directed this movie and I must give a standing ovation for the job he did here. Bravo. I don't think I trust many other horror directors aside from him. The cinematography of this film was genius and flawlessly executed, and was probably the scariest part of the movie! The use of wide shots and a slowly panning camera back and forth from a source of horror was brilliant! And this was fantastically complimented by the set design, extensive use of props, and the eerie and enigmatic lighting. Roughly half the time something would emerge from the darkness or from behind the props, while the other half of the time, nothing would happen, but the anticipation was what scared viewers. I would not be surprised if Wan or the cinematography team were nominated for an Oscar. Look out for the scene where Janet is being interviewed by Ed Warren- the camera-work really shines there, you'll know what I mean.And that wasn't the only source of fright for viewers. It just didn't stop throughout almost the entire movie. By the end, however, it kind of lost its initial effect. Maybe I just became more acclimatized to it. And of course I have to address the biggest cliché plot convenience in all horror films- walking TOWARDS the source of the horror. Why? Just why? There was one scene however when an entire family, after being scared enough, sprinted out of their house to the neighbors next door. I thought 'that was the most sensible thing anyone has done in a horror movie'. Anyway, to the plot! I did like the spin they put on that the whole thing could be a hoax concocted by a bored girl (which was an element present in the true story of this case), and exploring that from different perspectives. It's something that the world deals with all the time- skepticism. And that element was used deftly in a plot twist that invigorated the story line when it needed it most. For those wondering, the actual events of this case are dramatized significantly to make the finished product. I've seen the real evidence, and I'm still not convinced that any of it was real. The poignant tone at the end of the Conjuring movies is something that I both hate and like at the same time. Yes, it gives the franchise some originality, brings some themes to the table, and makes the plot more intricate, but at the end of the day, this is a HORROR MOVIE. I want to walk out of the cinema shaking, but the 'and they lived happily ever after' takes some of that away. That's where I feel a franchise like Paranormal Activity trumps The Conjuring.The cast has familiar faces Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, with new guys Madison Wolfe, Frances O'Connor, Lauren Esposito, Benjamin Haigh, Patrick McAuley, Simon McBurney, Maria Doyle Kennedy, and Simon Delaney among others. Not many horror films have names you might recognize. Farmiga's and Wolfe's performances were the stand-outs in this movie, with the ensemble cast performing valiantly as well. Wilson and his character were a bit too fearless for me. I loved Wilson and Farmiga's cute chemistry. It was a nice, light element to bring to the table. Speaking of, genres included action, horror, thriller, mystery, and romance, while themes were family, unity, incredulity, and the media. The costuming and production value was done well, and special effects were fine except for the 'Crooked man' sequence (contained animation)- not sure I liked that very much...The running time was pretty long, but it felt like a journey because of the character development and how I was engaged. The soundtrack and sound editing was effective in the way it was intelligently used, and a sequel is definitely possible- the Warrens have a fair amount of source material to draw from. You don't need to have seen the original or Annabelle to enjoy this one, but you will have a greater appreciation of it if you have.To conclude, it could be improved through less of a happy ending- even if its just one shot at the end or the possibility of a reawakening force, and more thriller elements- in terms of the villains credibility- to really solidify the fear in the audience. But, I judge a good movie on how it stimulates emotions, and there were definitely some emotions brewing inside me!For more reviews like this; see chrisbreviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conjuring 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first film was a big hit scary movie, the spin-off prequel Annabelle was a bit disappointing, and I was looking forward to this critically higher rated sequel, directed by James Wan (Saw, Dead Silence, Insidious). Basically set in 1977, Peggy Hodgson (Bedazzled's Frances O'Connor) lives with her children Janet (Madison Wolfe), Margaret (Lauren Esposito), Johnny (Patrick McAuley) and Billy (Benjamin Haigh) live in Enfield, London, England.

The Hodgsons' create a media storm with their claims that their house is haunted, paranormal investigators Maurice Grosse (Simon McBurney) and Anita Gregory (Creep's Franka Potente) are brought in to help, Janet is possessed by the spirit of Bill Wilkins, an elderly man who previously lived and died in the house, he wants his house back. The story of the haunting eventually reaches noted demonologists Ed (Insidious's Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Orphan's Vera Farmiga), who a year ago were investigating the Lutz family and the murders and demonic occurrences in Amityville, New York, who come to London to help the case. Lorraine fears for Ed's life, as she had a premonition of his death, he promises they will only document, they consult Maurice and Anita on the legitimacy of the case, they also attempt to talk to Wilkins spirit in attempt to stop him harassing the family.

The end of the film tells that Peggy lives in the house until her death, where she was found sitting in the same chair Wilkins died in, Ed adds the "The Crooked Man" zoetrope toy from the house to his collection, alongside the music box and Annabelle the doll in the case. Also starring Maria Doyle Kennedy as Peggy Nottingham, Simon Delaney as Vic Nottingham, Sterling Jerins as Judy Warren. Bob Adrian as Bill Wilkins, Robin Atkin Downes as Demon Voice, Bonnie Aarons as Demon Nun, Javier Botet as Crooked Man and Steve Coulter as Father Gordon. The cast all do well, especially Wilson and Farmiga as the real-life ghostbusters, Wilson's highlight is an Elvis Presley impression singing "Can't Help Falling in Love", this works even better than the original film, the jump scares with loud noises and things suddenly appearing are much more effective,, and a tense score by Joseph Bishara, a really scary and splendid supernatural horror. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely fantastic horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely excellent, I enjoyed every minute of it. Seen it 2 times in the cinemas.I don't know what it is exactly that James Wan manage to do to keep the scare factor at max all the time, maybe he simply knows what's truly scary and not?The sound design is extremely good and I do think it plays a huge role in terms of the scare factor. I also love how the movie delivers truly aggressive horror where the main characters either have to chose fight or flight. I'd say this is one of the best horror movies I've seen ever. I also think this movie is even better than the first one. I would absolutely recommend this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Sequel To The Celebrated Horror Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Conjuring' released back in 2013 managed to achieve a cult status among the followers of the horror genre and the sequel with director James Wan himself wielding the megaphone was long-awaited by the movie buffs across the world.I was a bit late to try this movie due to varied reasons,but must say that the sequel was worth the wait and succeeded in keeping me thrilled till the end with its bounty of jump scares and old-school horror stuff.Its a herculean task to produce a sequel that matches the quality of the original in which most of the film-makers fail,but not a crafted auteur like James Wan who has struck it big in pushing the series forward with an equally thrilling sequel that has its share of excitement even-though the film is made in a platform that's blatantly similar to the first except being shifted from US to the British setting.The movie set in 1977 London is based on the series of events following the poltergeist activity reported by the Hogson family that's popularly known as 'Enfield Haunting' and the screenplay by Chad Hayes,Carey Hayes,David Leslie Johnson and Wan himself has developed the characters well and managed to narrate the events convincingly on screen.The characters of old Bill,Crooked Man and the inhuman spirit Valak were scary and shook up with their sudden appearances .Joseph Bishara is a maverick when it comes to sound design and here too amazes with an enthralling background score as in movies like Insidous and ones in the Conjuring franchise,namely 'The Conjuring' and 'Anabelle'.The soundtrack holds a major key in creating an air of dread that evolves into sudden scares.The technical soundness is notable with catchy frames,neat cuts and excellent art direction.Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson reprises their role from Conjuring and did their part well.The surprise package was 13 year old Madison Wolfe reprising the role of haunted Janet Hogson who caught attention with her brilliant act and control in handling emotional sequences.The climax which ended all of a sudden was a weak link in an otherwise intriguing narrative and it felt as if Wan didn't take much interest in going into the detail of inhuman spirit Valak which is expected to be dealt in detail in the future.A Spin-off film named 'The Nun' showcasing the inhuman demon 'Valak' is on the cards and is anticipated to carry the Conjuring franchise forward,detailing the character that's introduced in this movie.Overall,'The Conjuring 2' is a neatly crafted sequel to 'The Conjuring' that's worth every penny paid for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2 was a pretty decent horror movie. As far as horror movies about paranormal activity goes, this is probably the best one. Having said this, its debatable that the first Conjuring was just as good. In my eyes, it wasn't any better than the first one, but not any worse either. Some scenes were really good and scary, such as the first scene, and some were quite predictable. There were more good scenes than bad ones though. WARNING: Do not watch this if it is your first horror movie. I also think if you are going to watch this movie you should be either a 16+ or an experienced horror movie watcher, as you should be for most horror movies.Like in the first movie of The Conjuring, it says it is based on a true story. They only say this to scare you. It is true that there were people who heard strange noises in there homes, but so do we all. Plus, they never found out where the noises were coming from and in this movie there is a lot more than just noises.Considering it is a a movie about paranormal activity , and those movies don't normally scare me because they are unrealistic, this one is fairly scary. It was a good quality movie with good graphics and an obvious amount of effort put in to the making. The only disappointing thing, for me, was the bad story line and especially the ending, which I thought was quite poor and rushed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Movie to Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit ,the Conjuring 2 is one of the best movies I've ever watched.I wasn't so impressed by The Conjuring 1,even though it was pretty interesting. But the Conjuring 2 has been very well directed and has a good case for a movie. The movie is so real,it's like we are watching the case from a first hand. I like the fact that the movie actually defines "Paranormal" in the movie and actions, for example,when The Hodgson family is at their neighbor's house,and the dog touches the small bell,and the dog transforms into The Old Crooked Man,from the Spirit,Called Balak. I like how the movie directs scary scenes,and makes them scary without making them fake,for example when Lorain is in the room with Balak the spirit,and Balak is hiding behind her own portrait and using it to cover her face. Lastly,I like how the movie isn't only about horror and spirits,and it's also about different theories that could exist in real life,For Example when there was a theory that Janet was faking all this.Or when ,Billy the Grandpa was just used by Balak to cover herself,so they couldn't recognize what was happening straight away was by her. The Movie is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I went to this movie on a whim and we are glad we did. It was the scariest movie I have seen since that classic movie the haunting. As fan of British movies, I also liked the scenes in the classic neighborhood in London. The acting is first rate I have been a fan of Vera been watching Bates Motel. The Part of her husband was played by the same actor in Fargo the TV Series on FX this past season. The girl Janet I could have sworn was British was actually American. The Mother is a veteran actress as well playing the mother in Selfriges in the first season on PBS. He did and awesome Job as well. Anyway one will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wan Brings The Warren's Back Along With All The Scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Huge props need to go to Aussie horror king James Wan. He had his big break with the mysteriously creepy gorefest Saw, which spawned a multitude of sequels that he also produced. He then went on to direct the films Insidious and The Conjuring ? two films that breathed new life into the stale genre. After directing Insidious: Chapter 2 and producing the spin-off Annabelle, he is back at the helm of the next sequel The Conjuring 2.In this instalment the focus lies on the Hodgson family, comprised of a single mum of four children who live in the suburb of North London called Enfield. What adds to the fear in this film is the fact that once again, it is based on true events as these hauntings became infamous all over England (and eventually worldwide) in the 70s. Ed and Lorraine Warren (reprised by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are summoned to investigate what appears to be a combination of a haunted house and the demon possession of a little girl.Without revealing too much, certain scenes that used CGI immediately take you out of the film and therefore might dull the scare factor however this film is full of traditional scares and suspenseful moments that have you jumping out of your seat (I literally did jump out of my seat at one point!).The cherry on this ghoulish cake is the fact that real imagery and audio is used throughout the end credits, almost as a friendly reminder that this stuff REALLY WENT DOWN.If you're a fan of the franchise, and of James Wan's work (as I am), then you're in for a deliciously scary treat.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel as sinister as its predecessor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sinister Synopsis: Six years following the infernal investigation of the Perron household haunting, Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga, "Bates Motel") are back to take on a case more sinister than ever before. With evil making its way to the serene London community of Enfield, Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor), a single mother of four, calls upon the Warrens' expertise in helping her youngest daughter, Janet (Madison Wolfe), overcome the perilous possession that's all too familiar for Ed and Lorraine. The only thing the Warrens don't realize is that they're dealing with an unprecedented power so cynical, that even their own vulnerability may get the very best of them. The Diabolical Desire: Much like director James Wan's initial installment of "The Conjuring" (2013), there are plenty of positive qualities throughout. From the credibility of each and every character (especially Wilson and Farmiga, who never lost a single beat from their initial portrayal of our beloved demon experts), to the cinematography that sends a spine-tingling sensation all in its own artistic way. Having the supernatural sub-genre infamous for its heavy use of CGI, "Conjuring 2" wholeheartedly relies mainly on practical effects, most notably The Crooked Man, portrayed by Javier Botet, that seemingly looks computer generated, but is all the more natural with his creepy, spontaneous movements. Even the soundtrack carries an effective vibe from The Hollies' "Bus Stop" to Elvis Presley's "Can't Help Falling In Love" that's necessary for the film's time period (even Wilson's own cover of the song is quite plausible). The Rancid Reaction: When it comes to the negative notations of the film, there's really not too much to indite into this department. Even for the film's 134-minute duration, the pace is just enough to keep you attentive on the horror that awaits. Also, like said before, even the film's lesser use of CGI and "jumpy" scare tactics actually works to its advantage, unlike the majority of attempts in its class. The Axed Addendum: Another interesting point about the film is its homage to the notorious Amityville haunting. The intro recaps Wan's reincarnation of the malicious murders of Ronald DeFeo, and the subsequent haunting of the Lutz family where the Warrens dipped their toes into a nightmare deemed the most menacing of their encounters, until...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If there ever was a horror movie deserving an Award....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love all the modern horror movies that are written like Conjuring, Annabelle, Sinister, and Insidious.When I saw Conjuring 2 getting 7.9 stars on IMDb, I knew it would be a HUGE mistake for me to wait for it to come out on bluray. You usually only get one chance to see movies like this on the big screen.It's almost unheard of for horror films to get rated that high. Now I know why so many people are loving this film. For me, this surpassed the original. And while it wasn't as scary for me as Insidious 1 or Sinister 1, the story itself is probably the strongest out of them. And there are plenty of great scares, special effects, and a totally original villain.I'm not a big fan of slow burner horror. In fact, I generally try to avoid them because they are not exciting enough for me. At times during the first 30-40 minutes of this film, I got the feeling it was a slow burner. But as the story progressed, I reflected some more, and it's really not a slow burner. It's just such a well written story, that it creates a perfect balance between hardcore horror and slow burner character and plot development.As the IMDb rating confirms, this is one horror film that satisfies most horror movie fans.And If you are the type of person who gets teary eyed at emotionally moving scenes, fortunately for you, you might get a little waterworks going during this film.This movie, as far as horror genre goes, is just perfect. It really deserves a 10/10. I wish people would stop reserving a 10/10 for some Holy Grail of a movie that will never be made. This folks, is what a 10/10 looks like. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After checking the reviews of this movie on this site I couldn't wait to watch it. I really enjoyed the first one so I though, hey, this should be great. Was I wrong.... Let me just say, I absolutely love horror movies but for me it must be so scary that I am tempted to actually stop watching the movie. With this movie, I was tempted to stop watching it for a whole other reason. I found it to be extremely predictable and quite boring. One big horror movie cliché - and not actually scary at all.. The first one was 100 times better. So, if you like "horror" movies that don't make you think before you walk down the passage to the toilet - this one is for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I very much enjoyed the first conjuring movie and expected a even better movie, which conjuring 2 isn't. But only cause of some little things, although it's like the first one one of the best horror- movies since 20 years. But there are a couple of things, which the first movie made better. First of all, it's not very nice to see the creepiest daemon in the first sequence, James Wan did everything right in the first movie, to not show the evil daemon til the end, this time, you know him almost since minute 1. Second thing not going right is the end. It's very constructed and not very logical. Why the hell is it the same daemon as in the amityville house, something you never get explained. Third thing not so right is the way the movie shoots with effects and jump-scares. I mean, nothing wrong with some nice effects and jump-scares, but less is more, a rule the first conjuring movie kept in mind. Although, the movie is also very scary cause of it's perfect dark atmosphere and the beautiful sets. I know, I criticized a lot of things, but don't get me wrong, its a very very good horror-movie and a lot better than most of the last horror-movies. It's sadly just not as good as the first one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remember The Exorcist?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is true in the true story on which this film is based? People levitating, which violates the elementary law of gravity? I do not believe. That the furniture can move around the house all alone? That a dead man or a spirit can speak through the mouth of a living person? That people can go from one room into another through the floor, ceiling or walls? Or that a dead man can strangle a living person ? Chance makes that I've seen only with a few days interval in between, the Italian film "Libido"(1965)(check my review) and this "The conjuring 2". I wrote about the Italian film (and many other films of the same genre) that ghosts make their presence felt only in the big houses of rich people. This "The conjuring 2" contradicts the theory, ghosts of the past come here to disturb the existence of a poor family from Enfield, London. Well, you got to see it yourself. But, I warn you, it's very disturbing. It's almost as good as "The Exorcist"(1973), maybe even better, in terms of degree of fright. Arguably from other viewpoints, artistic achievement, subject, the difference between fiction and "after a real case."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an unbelievably good movie, and not just a horror movie. It really is a story about the power of love and faith under the most dire and frightening circumstances. In fact, twice the movie was so intensely scary but also emotional that I actually teared up, and I'm usually pretty stoic in movies. The story structure is really well done. You have two plots in the beginning, the English Hodgson family and the American demonologists, the Warrens. As the haunting is beginning to wreak havoc on the Hodgson family, the Warrens have become spiritually exhausted due to the evil they're constantly forced to confront. What was different and brilliant about this movie was the use of doubt and skepticism. Most demon horror movies use the lame fallback of everyone disbelieving the besieged victim, and you're just irritated that no one is on the victim's side because it's so obvious they're not delusional or whatever. With this movie, they go to great lengths to demonstrate how meticulously the Warrens obtain proof and aren't just there on some crusade. This added a great deal of plausibility for me, which made it so much more frightening. I haven't been this scared since I saw the first Conjuring movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conjuring 2 - Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a crooked man, and he walked a crooked mile. He found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile. He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse, And they all lived together in a little crooked house.The Conjuring 2 is one of those rare squeals that wasn't terrible, but rather good. The squeal did a lot of things better than first film in terms of character's, the twist and the unpleasant atmosphere. But it's kinda rare that we get a squeal that's just as solid as it's predecessor with plenty of surprises under it's sleeve.I have no idea how James Wan dose it. I seriously don't know how he manages to take the things that I usually can't stand in today's horror and somehow turn it into gold. That's why The Conjuring movies always stand out from the rest of the paranormal demonic movies, because movies like 'The Conjuring' actually have an atmosphere and characters with depth. Even the jump scars are effective and used at appropriate times. James Wan is the only director I can think of that I trust when it comes to directing horror movies, as he understands the genre well. Wan does it again here with tension that builds and the good old sense of death. The acting from everyone was pretty damn solid. Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga and Frances O'Connor were all great in the movie. Even the littler girl (Madison Wolfe) was really good, as she actually looked terrified and it was a very convincing performance, even for a child actor in a horror movie. What really surprised me about "The Conjuring 2" is that I actually did care for the character's. I mean, compared to some horror flicks that are somewhat similar to this, but with the character's that are forgettable and so boring to watch on screen. Luckily this movie had character's with emotional weight to them. The camera work, the score and the cinematography are the highlights of this film. It also takes it's time and uses different ways to scare or spook you. It may not impress a lot of people, but I do admire the film markers for taking a risk like that. Enfield haunting case has been a hot topic for years now with people debating if it's a hoax or not. And while the "based on a true story" may be bullsh*t (or just any movie that uses that headline for attention), I'm just so use to it now that it's getting numb. A lot people complained that this was too Hollywood or it was not accurate to the original story. I have seen plenty of documentary's and stories about the Enfield haunting case, and it's so BORING. I literally found nothing interesting about it and all the evidence for the paranormal haunting seemed a bit fake. I'm so glad this movie wasn't accurate to the original case that may or may not be real. The film markers took something with it and told a different story with events that's very loosely based on an actual case. The problems that I had with this movie (which is not a lot) is the use of CG for scenes involving the Crooked Man. It took me out of the movie and it kinda took away the terror from the Crooked Man character that Wan beautifully created. And yes, Javier Botet (who is about 6' 6?) plays the Crooked Man, but the CG is so noticeable when he starts jumping around or growing tall to scare the little girl that he's haunting. I think practical effect's would have been so much better and scarier.Overall rating: The Conjuring 2 is a solid squeal that's way better then the avenge horror squeal. It takes your expectations and turns it completely around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who you gonna call?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Conjuring 2 a family of a single mother and four children, living in London, find themselves being haunted by an evil spirit. Because of their increasingly dire situation they decide to contact Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren who answer their aid call. So, James Wan! More like James Win, know what I'm saying? Because he directed this awesome movie? No? OK, sorry. In all seriousness I may have found my favorite horror movie with The Conjuring 2. That's not saying much, as I am not that educated in horror movies but this film showed me that in order to create horror there must be no shortage in creativity and practicality. I've heard people saying that crafting a horror movie must be easier than other genres but this movie proves the opposite. Director James Wan injects his film with horror through some of the most elaborate visual techniques I have witnessed in a movie from this genre. From the simple use of shadows to the use of decoys in the shot that only want to trick our focus, Wan plays with our senses in almost every sequence. You are always left examining every aspect of the environment where the characters are in order to guess where the next horrifying thing will jump from next; and at times it is so obvious that you are left squinting your eyes and cringing waiting for the jump scare to take the color out of your skin. From POV shots to elaborate tracking shots, the variety of filming techniques is also astonishing. Wan's excellent directing also tackles the sound category. Every knock and every squeak serves a purpose and enhances the atmosphere. In the following I am going to do a very spoilery commentary about to sequences which raised all of my body hair and turned me into a chicken-skinned porcupine, but at the same time made me admire James Wan as a horror director. The first sequence I want to mention is the one where Ed Warren contacts the spirit of Bill Wilkins (Bob Adrian) through Janet (Madison Wolfe). Ed is facing the camera and his back is facing Janet, who is sitting on a couch. The camera very cleverly maintains focus on Ed and through the use of depth of field distorts the image of Janet. As Ed begins to interview the spirit and this entity starts to answer in a very crooked voice, Janet begins to shift very subtly into an old man. This isn't implemented as a jump scare but as a "Holy crap! Look look look!" moment. As you maintain your focus in Ed Warren and Patrick Wilsons great performance the oddity slowly and almost unnoticeably starts to manifest. What's incredible is that the scene lasts about 4 minutes. Wan's complete trust in Wilson's performance and in our attention as an audience is baffling. He has no need of hammering in the fear factor; he trusts that our attention and perception will do the job for him. The other sequence I will delve in switches subtlety for the most horrifying character that will haunt my dreams until I drown it with many sessions of watching colorful cartoons and sitcoms that will dry my tears and keep me from reluctantly waiting for that face to pop out of a window at night. Trust me it really is that scary. And if you've watched it you know what I am talking about. Yes, that nun (Bonnie Aarons) is the stuff of nightmares. The makeup and character design is one of the best I have seen in a horror film, probably on par with The Exorcist. It is much simpler but damn that crap brings the crap. But back to the sequence, man was it bone-chilling. Lorraine following the nun into that room and then the way in which the film plays with us through shadows and the shape of the nun's face, damn damn damn. I really wanted to look away as the nun's face just sat there in the dark, and I think I used all of my cringe faces in that single sequence alone. That is true mastery in film design. The film also included some amazing musical choices. All of those Christmas carols that played as the nun's background music were chilly but also pretty epic. But music wasn't always used to enhance the chills but also to bring some heart into the film. "Can't help falling in love" was used to gather our characters in moments of tranquility which made the pace much more tolerable. The characters were also quite tolerable for a horror movie. They obviously included the kid who wandered out into the darkness alone in spite of all the spookiness that had happened and made us question why he didn't have at least 7 people accompanying him with all the lights on. But all of the characters in general where entertaining to watch and the family and the Warrens had enough character development for us to care about their survival. The awesome performances, especially from Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga and Madison Wolfe also helped the movie become very digestible. Although I truly admire this film I do have a few negatives to point out. Firstly, there is a tall and silly monster called the Crooked Man that makes sudden appearances and it just feels very out of place given his very over the top and colorful design. All things considered, The Conjuring 2 is a true masterwork in horror. It is very uncommon for a sequel to be as good as the original, but in my case this movie surpassed the first one because of some extremely clever filming and storytelling techniques. I am thrilled to experience all of James Wan's upcoming projects and I am confident that he has the ability inflict some very intelligent thrills into us audience members. I am rating The Conjuring 2 with a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is fantastic. I went with my boyfriend too see the Conjuring 2 and both of us were so nervous that we thought the beginning of Marvel trailer was a horror movie. Everything about this movie is fantastic. It is definitely the scariest movie I have ever seen, I had chills the whole time and the whole experience was so nerve wrecking. This movie had so many scary moments, the possessed nun, the crooked man, Bill and man I did not like that chair or that tent. Despite the many scary and crazy moments in this movie, my favorite scene was when Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) was singing Can't help falling in love. It was a nice change from all of the craziness. And when the movie was over my boyfriend and I we're so ready to get out of there. We were the only ones left in there and when we were walking out my boyfriend said, ''I'm not looking back.'' We were walking out when an even scarier music starting playing in the credits and we just ran out like we were running for our lives. But I definitely recommend this movie, it's fantastic, it's scary and James Wan really knows how to make a scary movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone was going on about this one being better than the first so tonight I went. The first one wasn't even the least bit scary to me. This one does have quite a few more scares, but they are all jump scares. My biggest dislike was the movie ended quite abruptly when it shouldn't have because it drug on for two hours and then when the actual climax occurs it lasts a good 10 seconds and boom the end. Since that was the entire point of the movie it made no sense whatsoever for the scene to only last 10 seconds. So I'll totally give it credit for jump scares and for the cast including awesome Franka Potente (she's in awesome German films), but it is one of those films that could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic horror film that stands out from the modern day crowd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, many horror films today lack depth and meaning in their films. This is why the Conjuring is good; it stands out as a truly scary horror film that uses more than just jump scares to entice the audience. The film's excellent cinematography creates a brilliant atmosphere that truly engrosses the audience in the film, the performances are great with the children in the film not being incredibly cringe-worthy, the lighting and special effects are superb (bar one specific part that I will talk about later) and the story is rather well written.As well as this, I believe it's safe to say that The Conjuring 2 could be viewed without seeing the first film. That being said, having watched the first film and other films set in that universe (such as Anabelle) can help to create a better understanding for the audience.While the film is technically excellent, there are a few things that let the film down(Bear in mind that the events in the film are based upon the Enfield haunting in Enfield, London). For example, there are some plot lines that can seem quite confusing for the audience; there are 2 different plot lines at the beginning that eventually merge and become one (the Warrens in the US and the Hodgson family in London) Sometimes the transition can seem confusing; it often feels like two different films with the Warrens having completely different experiences to the Hodgsons. This is eventually tied together, albeit quite loosely. There is no real explanation as to why (Spoilers form here)......Valak, the main demon in the film, "possesses"/uses the old man as a pawn to haunt the Hodgsons, they just seem to be used together, despite the fact that they are situated in completely different places. As well as this, there is a second demon with the Hodgsons in the form of The Crooked Man. There seems to be so much more that can be done with this character that isn't explored, it seems as if it's there and then suddenly isn't (this may be a way of hinting at a separate film with the crooked man. Another issue with the crooked man is the fact that he is neither CGI or Mocapped, but rather an animated clay figure. While this does look incredibly creepy, it seems to break some immersion a bit. It is easy to tell it's clay animation which doesn't really fit the theme of the rest of the film. The clay animation isn't used very often, however, which is worth noting Overall, The Conjuring 2 is an excellent sequel and a fantastic horror film. I would definitely recommend watching the film, whether you're aware of The Conjuring or any story relating to the Warrens, this film is an enjoyable experience and gives the audience a few good scares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>beating expectation and breakthrough elements!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw conjuring 1 back in 2013. Up until that point, I had yet to see any good American horror films (Asian ones are the best for you ghost movie fans). The conjuring 1 was a difference maker and completely changed my attitude towards American horror films.Fast forward 3 years, I was extremely excited when the Conjuring 2 was about to release, and I had very high expectations. The movie smashed my expectation in every way, which is amazing in itself. There were many good things about the film, however, one thing stood out:This is the only ghost movie I remember, and I have seen many as a big fan of the genre since I was before 10, which featured a male ghost that is not a 10 year old boy, and he was scary. Up until now I thought only little boys and women can be ghosts.Other than that, the plot featured a very good twist at the end, which I will not spoil. Great movie! If you are a horror movie film fan, this is a must see. If you are curious about the genre, this is still a must-see. There are many bad movies in this genre (Just look at the average rating of most movies), and this one is one-of-a-kind. I hope there will be a Conjuring 3 sometime in the near future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2 is absolutely the best horror film of this year! Believe it or not, I went to the theaters 3 times in just 1 week to see it again &amp; again because I enjoyed the hell out of it! If you or someone you know enjoys horror movies, you're going to love this one for sure. The movie starts out in Enfield London where an 11 year old girl (played by Madison Wolfe) is being targeted by a certain spirit within her home...this movie is filled with jump scars &amp; heartfelt moments that make you feel for this girl &amp; her family which really makes you as a viewer care for these characters. The cast in this movie is fantastic &amp; they all did a fabulous job especially (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga &amp; Madison Wolfe) The ending is very touching &amp; this movie actually gives a great message in real life. All &amp; all this movie is absolutely fantastic &amp; I recommend anyone to go see it, you will not be let down! This movie will definitely be added to my Blu-ray collection when it is released on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray! Hat's off to you James Wan for created a masterpiece of a film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Movie I've Seen in a Long Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I enjoyed the original "Conjuring," I was left a little wanting. I thought if the first 60 minutes of the film had been as intense as the last 30, it would have been a great horror tale. Well, Director James Wan has created its sequel and, let me tell you, it is one intense ride. Ed and Lorraine Warren (played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are back as the paranormal couple who go where few dare to tread. They are asked to investigate a supposed haunting/possession of a 12-year old girl in England named Janet Hodgson. It seems she has been tormented by the ghost of a 71 year old man who died in the house her family now inhabits. Oh, but leave it to Wan to make it so much more than that!As in the original "Conjuring," this story opens with a reference to another case of alleged possession--the Amityville mass murders. While investigating there, Lorraine keeps having premonitions of her husband's impending death. She also discovers a very dark and evil presence, which decides to take the form of a demented nun.James Wan shows he is a master of this genre. He also shows that an audience can be scared to death simply by using camera tricks, shadows, and effective make-ups. His actors deliver top-notch performances, especially Madison Wolfe who plays the tormented child. To me, this film (as the original) should have been rated PG-13. There is no blood, gore, nudity, or sexual situations. In fact, I have racked my brain trying to remember if I even heard a cuss word and, for the life of me, I don't. However, don't let the lack of those hackneyed and worn out situations stop you from seeing this movie. It is the best horror movie I have seen in a long time, and I will even admit, I had trouble sleeping the night after I saw the movie. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Diabolically Suspenseful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Conjuring 2 goes back to the roots of horror movies. Yes you have classic horror movie clichés and plot twists. But this movie does these clichés at the peak of their level. Based of a real life event (Enfield case), the story follows a family in London which is being tormented by a ghost. Essentially they seek out help in getting rid of the ghost; which brings back Ed and Lorraine from the first conjuring.I cant credit this movie enough for its cinematography, consistently from scene to scene you are put straight in the movie with the rest of the characters. Top that with ingenious scene transitions and long shots which reveal things in the corner of your eye. Plus the jump scares don't feel cheap but earned from the way this movie creates suspense, which is rare these days as most jump scares are just thrown at the audience for no real reason.Surprisingly I was also very invested in the characters, the family was very close and caring during such a tough time. Plus Ed and Lorraine had the cutest relationship IN A HORROR MOVIE. Which just makes you want to root for them throughout the movie.This is a MUST see horror, it does everything right from story its characters to how its presented if only other horror movies to come learned from this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually not a fan of sequels, but this one really surprised me! It was nice and long (just over 2 hours) which is rare for a horror film. This allowed for much better character development than the first one IMO. There were also some really well done scares and beautifully shot scenes in general. One of my favorite scenes involved a creepy painting (without giving too much away) that had me on edge the whole time. Acting was top notch - especially the girl who played Janet. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson have great chemistry as well. If you liked the first one I highly recommend checking this one out as you won't be disappointed. I think I may have even liked it better than the first - which is something I never thought I'd hear myself say!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sequel of amazing horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched a lot of horror movies and time and time again not many can be considered 'good', 'amazing'. When I said a lot, I mean I've scoured the internet for any horror movie that is practically watchable and not cheaply made ranging from American ones to Korean, Singaporean, Indonesian, Thai, Japanese, Malay, French, Australian and Chinese. Indie horrors would be my best choice until James Wan smartly came up with The Conjuring. For a sequel, I still couldn't believe how it blew my mind. The moment the movie started, I was already assaulted by various well played scares and darkly eerie scenes. The way Wan framed his shots were great. Not only giving the audience POVs but extreme close ups that brings us into their world as if we were there, watching it unfold. There were lots of build ups throughout the movie but... the ending was rather rushed. Would have loved to see a little longer and more climatic end. Kudos to the portrayal on Ed &amp; Lorraine's romance which Patrick and Vera played wonderfully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ed and Lorraine Are Back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and his clairvoyant wife, Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) are back ghost-busting in this frightening sequel to "The Conjuring." Ed and Lorraine find helping out families with their ghostly problems is too much for them and both want to retire after the Amityville haunting. Lorraine rein-acts what happened in the house in her mind and it is frightening to her! She also sees this demonic nun (Bonnie Aarons) in her visions. All the retirement plans change when a priest brings a tape recording to them to listen to. It is a man speaking in a British accent and Ed thinks the man is possibly senile. The priest tells him no. The owner of the voice is an 11-year-old girl named Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe) who lives in the burg of Enfield, England in a 2 story house with her mom and siblings in 1977. Her father ran off with a neighbor lady who bore him twins. The Hodgson family consists of Peggy (Frances O'Connor), older sister Margaret (Lauren Esposito), and two little brothers Billy (Benjamin Haigh) and Johnny (Patrick McAuley). It has not been an easy time for the family after the man of the house left. Johnny is teased mercilessly by the kids at school because he stutters and Peggy worries how she will support herself and 4 kids. Into all of this Janet and Margaret are hearing noises late at night and the furniture starts to move on its own. Peggy doesn't know what to do about these disturbances and the police who visit her suggest she call the TV station and go on air telling the world what is happening to them. Maurice Grosse (Simon McBurney) who challenges the Warrens at every turn, shows Margaret and Janet on his show. Janet starts talking in the deep voice and the lights flash on an off. There are more hauntings with Janet being levitated off the ground and Johnny's zoetrope with the Crooked Man coming alive. The Crooked Man is played by Javier Botet and I think with his body structure and the fact he can move his arms and legs in strange ways due to Marfan Disease makes him a creepy addition to the movie! It is revealed Janet is possessed by a man who died in her house and he reveals his name to be Bill Wilkins. Bill doesn't want to go to heaven or hell and the creepy nun is stopping his spirit from moving on. Another reveal that came as a surprise: Janet caused some of the furniture to move and it was caught on video by Anita Gregory (Franka Potente). Janet has no choice but to confess what she did and the Warrens leave. In the train, Lorraine has a vision of Bill Wilkins and he tells her he can't move on. He is held by a demon and the Warrens have to reveal the entity's name. When they go back to the Hodgson house, the haunting is in full force with no help from Janet and Lorraine realizes she knows the demon's name because during a vision she wrote it in her Bible. She reveals the name just as demon is throwing Janet and Ed out of the window to their deaths. This is great, creepy movie with wonderful performances from Patrick, Vera, and the rest of the cast! Madison Wolfe is also effective as the traumatized Janet who doesn't understand why the haunting is happening and she just wants to be a normal young girl who has a father and who isn't teased at school. This is a worthy sequel to "The Conjuring"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic is how i d call this movie. And that is not meant in a negative way. Story and progression is highly predictable if you a casual horror movie person - but it is the quality and pacing that makes this movie stand out.The acting is very good, not just for a horror movie - but all in all. The chemistry between the protagonists is interesting and never really stereotypical (much). - Or lets say - it is of course clichéd but in a good way. (hard to explain, cause i d usually consider a clichéd character a bad thing) The characters do act as expected in a horror movie - but do not come across like morons (like so many horror movie character come across) - What i liked very much was that the characters actually communicate with each other. - A feature that is used in just so many horror movies (that is the non-communication-factor) to actually make the story possible in the first place.Special effects and scares were well done.All in all - the movie is not really too scary (nothing you loose your sleep about) - but it is enjoyable and suspenseful. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pretty good horror movie! The story is fairly interesting and held me and my date's attention. The actors do a pretty good job at their roles, could be better, but they're never so bad that it ruins the movie.Throughout the movie there are moments when the scenery feels unrealistic. For example there's a scene where one character is being dragged into a window and it is obvious the character is a dummy. Other instances include props like trees and broken wood looking cheap and plasticy, but overall the environment is believable as long as you don't focus too much on it like I did.I saw this movie in a drive in for $8, and I can say it was worth it. So if you find yourself able to see the movie for cheap, go for it. And bring a hot date!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really like watching horror movie. To me that's a waste of time because most horror movies are just a series of scenes that scare you. My first horror movie was "Drag Me to Hell". It was an okay movie, I quite like the plot, and the twist at the end. But it didn't change my mind about horror movies.Then my second horror movie, which is "Conjuring 2", actually changed my mind! From the plot, to the twist, to the overall execution, it is just as good as drama movies! Yes, I am not kidding. If there is an Oscar for horror movie, "Conjuring 2" will surely top the list! It's that good. And I can't imagine how a horror movie can get better, so a 10/10 here. (Let's hope James Wan proves me wrong with his prequel that has been rumored);)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been waiting for this movie since the first and i must say i really enjoyed it. It's a classic James Wan film, great direction, acting, and of course, its damn scary.But The Conjuring 2 isn't as scary as the first film, but its almost there. The first film had a little more classic scares(can't forget that hide and clap scene). But its still terrifying and intense. The point is it is very difficult to make sequels of horror movies. But James Wan nails it. The performances too are solid. The character Janet is the star of the movie and Madison Wolfe portrays it beautifully. Incredible acting and you actually feel sympathy for her. Vera Fermiga and Patrick Wilson continue their epicness over here and more heart is given to their story.The Conjuring is definitely worth watching. James Wan puts his horror tricks to a good use yet again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A sincere thank you to James Wan for reviving the franchise after the debacle called "Annabelle". James Wan is probably the only director currently in Hollywood who is capable of making a believable horror film. The genre which is just full of either horror-comedy or horror gore was really becoming boring before Conjuring. It was becoming boring but then comes Conjuring 2. James Wan is a messiah of the horror genre.Not going to talk about the plot but I am going to say this that a good horror movie doesn't need loud noises to build up a scene and James Wan knows that. Every build up scene in this movie just has the breathing of the characters or the noises on the wooden floors or a creepy chime music. That's all and BOOM!. The acting is very believable. Especially the little girl. Patrick and Vera are exceptional. The main crux of a horror movie is that you are not scared of the ghost or demon but you are scared for the characters and the imminent threat looming on them. If you don't care for the characters then a horror movie is a lost cause. You care about the Warrens and that keeps you hooked to every dark room, every whisper around them. I had a little problem with some jokes in the movie which I think could have been avoided but it's fine.It is refreshing to watch a good horror movie and I would urge you to go alone if you want the full thrill of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightfully frightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely watch horror movies, but at the insistence of a friend, I agreed to go to this one. And believe me, at the end of the movie, I was really surprised and intrigued how this movie amazingly captured my breath. This movie sends your central nervous system to a spin with its innumerable terrorizing moments. The movie follows a common plot that most horror films do: a haunted house that is like 100 years old, demonical possession of a kid followed by oppression, havoc, destruction integrated with creaky staircases, darkness, flooded basements, and swirling furnitures. Just when you thought that you can anticipate the next sequence in the movie, you're proved terribly wrong. Because the direction team have done such a admirable job in the pacing of the plot that not in one moment the audience find themselves disengaged from the movie. They create the build-up, create inexhaustible anxiousness about it, then kill it and then give you a frightful shock when you are least expecting it. That is the real beauty of this movie: the nerve frizzling surprises. The story is set in England where a single disillusioned mother with 4 kids live in a house haunted by a previous owner who is now a ghost refusing to leave the house. The demon creates mayhem in the house diabolically torturing the family and creating ruckus at the most inopportune moments. The ghost takes on little daughter, Janet, 11, and uses her as his controller to channelize his wrath over the family. Real life ghost hunters are called upon to help the family and detect the root cause of this evil. But they are at their wit's end, and are unable to improve the family's situation. Finding themselves going under personal risk, they begin to ponder if it's all a hoax and nothing but a dramatical performance by the little girl, in order to seek attention from the society. The atmosphere gets creepier and creepier and just when you thought the number of shocks is just done, you are attacked with an another ghastly attack. You will literally hear your hearts beating out of your ears. However, given all the good points, the story is bit of a letdown. There will be no answers for your "why is this happening" or what is the reason. There is no explanation, the direction has relied on the no of jump-outs it gives to the audience. It is also not clear the motive of the ghost which is vaguely depicted. The director knows how to manipulate the pulse and breath of the audience and his successful tactics in making the audience jump has helped the disguise an otherwise pretty imprecise and hazy story. Overall, for a delightful frightening experience, you might try your money on this movie. Worth a watch. People who get frightened easily are asked not to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into the cinema with low expectations because i saw so many things about how good the conjuring 2 is. I thought that I would be disappointed but I was very wrong. The conjuring 2 is fast paced and well written. The story doesn't just focus on the horror but it also focuses a lot on the characters. There are some character building scenes but none of them waste time. They are all very meaningful. I felt much more connected to this family than the last one. You sympathize a lot with these characters. Everyone is trying to fight their own battles and overcome their obstacles. The horror is very scary. James Wan managed to make a very terrifying atmosphere. He knows how to build up suspense and he knows how to use jump scares. There were quite a few jump scares in this film but none of them were false.Some were very predictable but most of them caught me off guard. What made this really scary is the fact that it was in a normal house . It wasn't in some big American house with eight bedrooms and three floors.It was in an average British council house.The acting was very good and everyone did a great job. I felt glued to the screen and felt engaged with the story. The cinematography and lightning was very good. The camera work was absolutely amazing. The only reason why I'm giving it 9/10 is because I felt that the last 10 minutes was way too much. It was very extreme and messy. I didn't really feel engaged. However, many people felt that the ending was good and well written so I'm not going to say that the ending was a bad thing. It was just a bit too much for me. But overall this was a very good movie and if you're looking for something to creep you out and make you feel scared then watch the Conjuring 2.</fullReview>

Maybe one of the jump scares here and there could be omitted. And James Wan could have also leave off some horror cliché moments, but all in all The Conjuring 2 is very high above average with some moments and scares you can expect and some pictures and scenes you have seen before but probably not that that well done. Especially the evil and demonic side is very well done and manifested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fiercer, Scarier, and Smarter 'Conjuring'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by: James Wan Most horror sequels have a tendency to be predictable and follow the same template as the first installment. You know where the evil is and when it will pop out and make you jump in your seat. Jason leaps at you with the machete, Freddy sneaks up on you in your dreams, and so on, tale as old as time. Being a fan of the first film, I expected this one to have the same tropes and construct with the characters and themes. I was wrong, dead wrong. This is one of the rare breed of horror sequel that is scarier than this original and raises the stakes for everyone including the audience.Based on another one of Ed and Lorraine Warren's paranormal investigation cases (more specifically The Enfield Poltergeist), The film opens post-Amityville and we see our heroic duo famous but weary doing talk shows debating with skeptics about the incidents. Lorraine also worries that Ed might die in a future investigation after seeing a vision. They are then persuaded to visit a family in England who are being terrorized and discover something more sinister than they've ever faced before. When I say the stakes have been raised, that is just the tip of the iceberg. If the first installment was the first circle of hell, this one cranks it to the tenth, maybe even eleventh. Not since I rented the original "Evil Dead" when I was in high school have I been this scared. But the scares are just the beginning as the film also deals and balances weighty themes of faith, skepticism and facing our own fears. We care and fear for everyone as there is not one character that is disposable or purpose-less unlike in other horror franchises which have a habit of swapping out leads and side-characters like batteries in a remote. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga give fantastic and award-worthy performances as Ed and Lorraine Warren.The Conjuring 2 is scarier than the original and also more thought-provoking that leaves you not only breathless but also raises some interesting questions and discussions in the process. If you weren't frightened by true evil before, this one might just change your mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONJURING 2 is a full fledged supernatural thriller. Director James Wan directs and shares writing of story and screenplay; leaving no way for the viewer to sit still too long. Based on another factual happening that sent acclaimed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren to north London. Lorraine (Vera Farminga) and husband Ed (Patrick Wilson) are summoned to aid a single mother of four, Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor), who is having trouble having anyone believe her family is living in a house plagued by a dangerous spirit...if not more. Peggy's daughter Janet (Madison Wolfe) is showing all the signs of demonic possession. The Warren's think heavily about their predetermined amount of involvement.Tremendous scary special effects. The horror violence is harsh and terrifying...just the way we like it! Seriously white-knuckled sequences that will make you squirm and jump. The rainy London atmosphere is perfect. A real nice soundtrack includes music by the likes of: The Clash, The Hollies, Bee Gees and Elvis Presley.The cast is rounded out with Lauren Esposito, Simon Delaney, Marie Doyle Kennedy, Bob Adrian, Bonnie Aarons, Javier Botel and Robin Atkin Downes provides the Demon voice.</fullReview>

The movie is slow and boring in the beginning.. But definitely keeps your seat belts still buckled up cos you know, at the back of your mind- it's based on a real story and the inhuman demon's horror lingers within seconds of its appearance. The movie slowly takes over you and the boring haunted house horror makes you a part of those characters in the movie. Once you are in it, the yellow eyes, the unkempt hair, the redness of scare on the white faces ... All begin to horrify you... Mrs/ms.Valak will definitely crumple your face to frighten..but, Mr. Ed and Lorrainze , with the help of Lord Jesus and the holy bible and the holy crucifix and of course their exorcist talent to communicate with the spirits, win the game against the super strong spirits... Just like any horror Hollywood movie. Last 20 minutes of the movie is the real horror. The initial boring parts of the movie is the leap into the characters to make you feel the horror. No cheap horrifying makeup. Subtle makeup, sensible movie. THE CONJURING 2.</fullReview>

The beginning itself is the scary part to make audience waiting to see what would happen next. James Wan has the ability to frighten the audience with each shots. justice done to the characters played by everyone. The footage taken from the original incidence were well used and shown. This sequel well deserved to be made. This movie is worth watching if you really want to scare yourself. If you really love scary movies than don't miss this one. I have to admit that James Wan is the most skilled director for the horror movies. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmigo have done fabulous acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, horrific, and intense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ed and Lorraine Warren are back this time in England to investigate a family's claim of unexplained supernatural events occurring right in their very own home. From the opening sequence of the film, the scares start rolling and is carefully paced by returning director James Wan. The scary scenes are intense and unexpected which makes it one fun ride. And the acting was believable. From the leads to the supporting cast, it was top-notch acting. All in all, The Conjuring 2 is a great sequel and overall film. Definitely ranks up there with one of the scariest movies all-time. I recommend watching this one in the theater for the sound, imagery, and experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie reviews The Conjuring 2 Rating 8/10 The story is Horror. The concept is based on real life paranormal activities.. The portrayal of horror story by re creating it on screen is brilliantly taken care of.. The camera &#x1f3a5; work is good.. Selection of houses &#x1f3e1; for shooting is itself beauty as they naturally look like haunted places.. Placement of horror scenes and characters used to make evil &#x1f608; appearance is appreciative.. The lead pair who hunt for the ghosts &#x1f47b; have acted well as usual and the little girl who is disturbed by devil influence &#x1f47f; in the movie &#x1f3a5; acted &#x1f3ad; exceptionally.. Making of movie &#x1f3a5; is superb and use of locations for shooting is wonderful.. The first half &#x1f313; of the cinema &#x1f3a6; rather looks like a comedy show.. The second half &#x1f313; of the cinema &#x1f3a6; is horror and 3 to 4 scenes were very beautiful and haunted... The movie &#x1f3a5; can be seen once without fear &#x1f631;... Personal Touch I really enjoyed the movie &#x1f3a5;.. Was laughing &#x1f602; to the core at some horror scenes and was shocked at few scenes too.. The old &#x1f475; man, crooked man and the demon looks great on screen... The story connection between both the sequential movies is good.. Horror movie is always a great entertainer and this movie &#x1f3a5; gave me peaceful sleep &#x1f634; later... &#x202a;#&#x200e;TheConjuring2&#x202c; &#x202a;#&#x200e;EnglishMovie&#x202c; &#x202a;#&#x200e;AnuReviews&#x202c;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film that suffers from running time and going too big</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2 manages to up everything that was in the first one. Doing what most horror sequels tend to do by upping there production budget and effects even more. Sadly this is also what hurts the Conjuring 2 as it feels very bloated and very lengthy. A good horror movie should be 90 to 105 minutes in length no longer. This film instead is 134 minutes long making for a long over done film with waaay to much going on. The film just doesn't feel very concise has a good story . And the movie suffers from not enough being cut out and making it keep going on and on. The characters are still great as I love the relationship between the warrens and the love story that is also being told within this film as well. The cinematography is also amazing along with the sound design. Everything in this film has a purpose and adds to the film's beauty and all the fear that is being built up with it. This is a film I recommend to any horror fan as I think there is a lot to like here if your in that field</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Conjuring 2... brilliantly marketed, but not scary... the problem is that we already know all the cliché of a horror movie. James wan took these over-used clichés and gave them a new level, but its highly predictable. overall at the end it was fill good movie with bit of a comedy. The movement we see CGI in such movies, the horror turns to comedy... absolutely hate when I can predict each and every scene which suppose to give me a scare. Also it's frustrating to see, horror movies ending with happy faces. Come on, no one dies in whole movie, it's frustrating.... BTW the theater had set their air conditioning to maximum, may be they wanted to give chilling effect to audiences, but that failed too.I m still probably gonna watch conjuring 3, if it comes...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror sequel that actually delivers the horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a reason we get so many horror films released every year; they are relatively cheap to make and guaranteed to make the studio money. No matter how bad the horror could end up being, people love the thrill and rush the experience of watching a horror film at the cinema gives you.Sequels have become one of the most sinister things in film today, some seeing them as nothing but quick ways of making more money however, if done well, sequels can be one of the more interesting things in film. In the case of The Conjuring 2, it's definitely the latter.Six years after the events in Rhode Island, paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren are called to Enfield, England, to investigate the paranormal events that the Hodgson family have been experiencing in their home, in particular Janet (Madison Wolfe).Having investigated the Amityville murders of 1974, Lorraine has since had visions that feature a powerful entity, forcing her to believe that the choice to carry on their line of work could lead to tragedy.What I really have to commend The Conjuring 2 for is the fact that it doesn't just feel like a carbon copy of its predecessor. Don't get me wrong, the two films certainly have similarities but this didn't feel like watching the first film over again.The film does this by telling two stories; one of the Hodgson family in Enfield and another about the visions that Lorraine has been haunted by after their investigation of the Amityville murders. These two stories connect much better than the stories of the family being haunted and the Annabelle doll in the first film.I have to praise James Wan for the job he does directing The Conjuring 2, expertly building suspense through the use of sound, camera movements and editing. John R. Leonetti returns as cinematographer and there really are some fabulous shots in this film, some leading to false predictions of when and where something would jump out on the screen. The film uses jump scares but it doesn't solely rely on them to scare the audience, one particular scene with Lorraine coming face to face with the demon haunting her slowly building to almost nerve-shredding levels of suspense.The performances in The Conjuring 2 are also worth mentioning, with both Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga returning to good effect, Farmiga once again being the film's biggest asset. I was really impressed with Madison Wolfe as Janet, the member of the Hodgson family targeted by the demon and also Frances O'Connor who played her mother.The Conjuring 2 will no doubt have audiences worldwide jumping out of their seats and give Warner Bros. a tidy profit when it finishes its run at the box-office. James Wan is the man they should be thanking and I'd like to thank him also for producing another horror that looks for more than one way to scare its audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the true story but a OK one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of this story is really the true story, the second half when the warrens come to London is the fantasy part of the story. Its OK but feels like two different films put together both don't get a great ending, the warrens have so many cases they could have picked but they choose to add them to a true story they were never part off. The warrens should have been left out the film the conjuring series does not have to be about them, and it also takes the light away from the real ghost investigators from the case giving them bit parts in the movie. On the other hand this filming catches 70s London great and the atmosphere is of a high level 7/10 just don't believe its a true story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Horrific Movie with subtle Classic Jokes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's my 1st ever review ever,in fact i chose to write a review in IMDb for the very first time cos I absolutely loved the movie. Is story-line of 'The Conjuring 2' gripping enough?, we'll it's based on a true story &amp; one of the well noted Cases the Warren couples encountered in their lifetime &amp; thanks to director James Wan I got to see this fantastically Horrific Story on screen &amp; as usual loved Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren played by Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson. I consider it as The all time best movie to be ever made in this Genre (2nd one is obviously 'The Conjuring'). --contains crucial plot ahead, return if you don't want to hear the story &amp; just watch the movie instead.The story itself takes place at the tail end of the 1970s, The film begins with paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren documenting the Amityville murders at the Amityville house in 1976, to determine if a demonic presence was truly responsible for Ronald DeFeo Jr. mass murdering his family on November 13, 1974. During a seance, Lorraine is drawn into a vision where she relives the murders and discovers a demonic nun figure, before seeing Ed being fatally impaled. After a struggle, Ed is able to break her out of the vision.In 1977, the Hodgson family begins to discover strange occurrences within their home in London, England. Janet, the second oldest of four children, is seen sleepwalking and conversing in her dreams with an entity who insists that the house is his. Eventually, all siblings of the house and their mother Peggy witness paranormal events occurring right before their eyes, forcing them to seek refuge with their neighbors. When the media attempts to interview the Hodgsons, Janet is possessed by the spirit of Bill Wilkins, an older man who previously lived and died in the house, and who wants to claim his territory. As Janet begins to show more signs of demonic possession, the story eventually reaches the Warrens, who are requested to assist the local Church in the investigation. Lorraine, in fear of her vision of Ed's death becoming reality, warns him not to get too involved in the case, and reluctantly agrees to travel to London.&amp; rest is History (literally) &amp; not at all supposed to happen in the normal/conventional paranormal investigation movies, too many twist &amp; turns, unpredictability, Jump scares, demon, haunting, etc. it really scared me which doesn't happen anymore these days. It's ground breaking altogether. I'm looking forward for the sequel (The Conjuring 3) of the successful horror franchise...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a massive fan of James Wan, but even his previous films have had their flaws in relying too heavily on jump scares. This uses an excellent amount of tension mixed in with the jumpiness and can create serious uneasiness while delivering complete satisfaction. This is truly a horror film to be remembered and treasured away for the ages. Even though I went in with high expectations, this seriously blew them out of the water and really ascended to new heights. Believe the hype, it is more than well deserved, kudos to James Wan and the cast with some outstanding displays of acting from everyone involved. Absolute masterclass. Musical direction is seriously on point too, I can't stress enough how good this film is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Tension With Plenty of Action...A New Genre Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been no movie to stand with The Exorcist for over 35 years in that movies unique horror set. There is now, finally, one that can. The Conjuring 2 picks up the the same unique dark fear and runs with it. It does run too because almost immediately the viewer is plunged into a revisiting, by Loraine Warren, of the how the events played out in the Amityville N.Y. case. It's a good segue-way not just in tone, but as a personal vision Loraine senses regarding Ed. It pushes her, along with the guffaws of the press, to push Ed into agreeing they'd not take on any new cases. Of course this doesn't last when the Catholic Church asks them to vet a particularly high-profile situation a family is London is experiencing.Now, here's whee I have no touchstone personally if this is played out like the actual case or not. It is probably better this way. Already the viewer is invested in The Warrens as doing what they do very genuinely. Putting them in a case they did actually attempt to vet just seems like the two best people doing what they have a rare talent for. And what a case it is. Without any head spinning we get many of the same chills, maybe played out with a bit less shock, but none the less just as malevolent. It's this keeping it more in your face and simple that seems to be right here. There is a constant fear and oppression which unfolds in an escalating way. When the viewer feels the most fear the whole thing falls apart as it appears to be a hoax. Even the Warrens are shut down. That's when the clincher of a fine ending begins. For the horror genre this is pure gold.While I'm sure those whose dissect these things have made a long list of faux pas the average viewer won't bat an eye regarding. So much has been steadily crafted the brought to a climax by the great ending one feels a sense of relief in which a harrowing journey seems to be, finally, over. I give the entire movie many pluses. From the period spot-on latter 70;s London with gloom and doom portrayed in the excellent cinematography combined with the played straight screenplay and excellent acting this is a horror film that truly works. Like I said earlier, I feel it stands with the gold standard that for so long had few peers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film could have been done much better than this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Patrick Wilson &amp; Vera Framiga were fine in terms of their acting in this movie. The home of the family who were the subject of this movie was depicted as a pigsty, complete with dirty telephones and disintegrating walls &amp; badly worn furniture. Such a depiction greatly reduced the scripts effectiveness as tale about 'ordinary people in trouble.' People generally didn't live in unclean homes like this in the late 1970's unless they were in the drug trade. This historical issue ruins this movie and it becomes a sort of parody-a parody of a horror movie and a parody of the late 1970's, which is probably not what it was intended to be. All in all it was a bleak movie but it was bleak due to its depiction of an era that had a lot of things going on in it. Little of which was present in the movie. I don't recommend seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The crooked man and demons make The Conjuring 2 a rare horror sequel that's better then the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The case of whether ghosts exist or not has been a fittingly eternal debate. Some say that it's simply a trick on the mind whenever we feel a cool chill. Others say that the presence of these spirits is the key to finding proof on the afterlife. Because of this debate, ghosts and the search for them have never been more popular. Their a constant subject of stories and movies. They even have their own reality show on the Travel Channel titled Ghost Adventures and Ghost Hunters on Syfy. Some cases, like the one portrayed in the movie, are examples of haunted houses that are covered by real news agencies, yet are still questioned by scientists for their academic basis.What were also looking at is a sequel for 2013 hit The Conjuring. Like many people, I was surprised by how much I liked it, having phrased it for a likable pair of ghost hunters, diving into the personalities of those being haunted, and some genuine good scares. Sequels to horror movies are tough as they tend to repeat stories, loosing much of the unpredictability the original story had. With James Wan returning to his franchise, let's see if The Conjuring 2 can bring us some new scares. We first open with our same husband wife ghost hunting team Ed (played by Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (played by Vera Farmiga) who are examining the Amityville murders (yes, the same one from The Amityville Horror). Loraine attempts to contact the spirits during a seance, but a vision of a demonic nun and of Ed getting killed scares her into convincing she and her husband to retire. We then head across the pond to London where a single mom is raising her four children. Like any horror movie, small things start to happen such as the television set reacting oddly and chairs moving by themselves. Even when they leave an stay at a friends house, the poltergeist follows them there. Various news outlets take in the constant photos and even interview the youngest daughter Janet whose often possessed by that poltergeist. The spirit reveals himself as an old man who had died in the house before the family moved in. The local church hires Lorraine and Ed to investigate. They originally decline, not sure if the events are true or just a hoax. But when they uncover more facts about the house and other demons, this just may prove to be their most dangerous case. The Conjuring 2 is a rare example of not being just as good as the original, but it might even be better. Like before, the story places most of the focus on getting to know the family that's being haunted and of the new tension between our ghost hunters. You feel bad that the family is going through these spooky events, and yet you understand why most academics would consider the hauntings a total fake. There's even a clever moment that makes you question everything that young daughter Janet was doing. Of course I won't spoil that here.Director James Wan is a horror maker who understands how important it is to not just scare people, but to help earn those scares. Anyone can pick up a camera and flicker a few lights to make a scary movie, but he's too smart to fall into that easy trope. He can lead his stories into a spooky symphony that plays so elegantly that you wish he's take charge of all horror movies. The only issue that can be bothersome is that the film's formula is very similar to the first movie. I defend this by saying that James Wan was able to improve on some of the story elements, but some of the suspense is taken away when you realize where things are going. I'll give this nine zoetropes out of ten. The Conjuring 2 is an entertaining sequel that took the best elements from the original and took it another step in storytelling and scares. Fans of the original will defiantly like this movie and maybe even some that didn't watch the first. The good news is that you don't need to see it to enjoy this movie. If your looking for hot summer bump in the night, then The Conjuring 2 is a pretty good choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, we can't get inside the theater without not knowing that we're gonna get stapled to our seat watching same old brainless protagonist going to provoke some ominous spirit with occasional jump scare, same old classic horror story plot yadda yadda yadda. Unfortunately, when a horror movie became so predicted, it became boring. How can you get scared if whenever they show this kind of scene: the protagonist takes something from the mirror- cabinet at the bathroom then closes it, BAM! you're gonna see some stuff on the reflection, right?But James Wan, he actually SUCCEEDED in breaking some of those stereotypes of horror movies' tricks in The Conjuring (2013) ?? instead of showing just mere flashing figures of Bathsheeba the camera just literally closing in on that thing crawling above the kids' wardrobe during that one scene in the bedroom, with equally decent sound mixing&amp; editing as a supporting element, It instantly became the sole reason why I fell in love with his works.This sequel though, doesn't feel like it's his. I don't feel his touch a.k.a some element of surprises in this film, like at all. It was just all too..predictable. I mean there was this one scene during Annabelle (2014) , which shows a harmless ghost of a girl running towards the main character with the door closing up, then proceeds to slam that door open but not as a small girl anymore but instead an evil entity with a true intention to kill THAT IS an element of surprise I was looking for in this sequel. The use of a close up of certain housewares stuff , which could potentially become harmful for people and felt some sort of life- threatening like this sewing machine in Annabelle (2014), didn't make any appearances at all as well. This is unfortunate because it may be able to add up something to help to create that eerie ambiance they were trying so hard to achieve.I heard that he turned to direct Fast series in hope of finding fresh new ideas for his horror movies but JAMES... this feels like an apple being left out to rot under a hot sun....isn't FRESH at allI lost it during the crooked man's first appearance, which felt so damn cheesy and give out this Babadook (2014) kind of vibe (which is not a good sign for me?), and fine, I get it, turned out it was totally practical (not CG) with a real actor posing as the crooked man then why the hell it felt so out of place?Valak, being the main attraction in this movie clearly is good at nothing but growl (and Jesus, in need of a dentist appointment with those bleeding gums). They could've dug deeper about his origin, M O T I V E S, (she clearly wanted to kill Janet but is that all?), and probably some P O T E N T I A L (to scare the audiences?haha)Too many questions left unanswered in my head the moment I stepped out of the cinema, including : "Has James Wan ran out of brilliant horror movies' ideas already or was he just trying to be?.experimental? hmmm"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes finally a good horror movie which have it all. Through the years most of the horror movies has been really bad or dumb. But with a few exceptions like: "The Cabin in the woods" and "Sinister". This one have it all. It have good and scary sequences. I didn't know that a movie could scare me that much. To start with, I wanna talk about the screenplay. The story is not a new story, so that wasn't really special. Still you were not boring any second of the movie. It have a great story telling and the directing was masterly. The acting in the movie was amazing. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are just perfect to the roles as Lorraine and Ed Warren. They have a interplay with each other. They never drooped out of their roles and acted so deeply. They do a well job with that. And for all the children and other cast members they do a performance in world class. One thing that stand out from other horror movies are the cinematography in this movie. It felt really like you were in the house where everything takes place and that just makes the jump scares more scary. The special effects were also very good. The scene set-up was really dark, but not too dark. You could still see what was going on. The effects makes a hair-raising feeling in the body. By the way, the background score helped the movie making a pretty creepy atmosphere. Through the years James Wan have made a lot of really good movies. The first movie I saw by him was "Saw". A masterpiece of cinema. You can't compare this movie with "Saw", but it is a lot more scary than "Saw". I'm not the guy who find jump scares scary, and for the first time, I really got scared by a jump scare in this movie. Not only one time, but twice. I think this movie is really creepy. It's better than the first one, and more scary. If you really enjoy horror movies. I'm sure you will like this one. "The Conjuring 2" is a very dark and scary horror movie. I really enjoy watching a movie like this. It makes the adrenaline rolls in your veins. It is definitely a movie i wanna buy on DVD/Blu-ray. To all the horror fans in the world, I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I do."The Conjuring 2" gets 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy sequel with some flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked the first movie you will not be disappointed. The Conjuring 2 keeps most of the strengths of the first movie to create a tense atmosphere while telling a story with enough depth to keep you interested until the end. The camera work is worth mentioning since it is remarkably effective at creating fear and tension through forced perspective and blurry images.However, in this sequel the characters are not as well-defined as in the previous one. Most of the characters in the family have little personality and are defined by a single trait: the little brother stutters, the mom has money problems, the other brother does nothing. This might seem like minor detail in a horror movie but it hinders the creation of a connection with the characters and, therefore, worrying about what happens to them.The movie could have had more engaging characters but this won't prevent anyone from enjoying the film. It is a very good horror movie and a worthy sequel. I highly recommend it. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can A Movie Be Too Scary?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting and other technical elements of The Conjuring 2 make it a well made film but most movie-goers just want to know if it really is that scary. I say it most definitely is. There is no edge of your seat excitement and there is nothing fun about it, it's just really scary. Some scenes were similar to the first movie but most of the time I forgot I was watching a sequel. All the characters seemed equally important and Vera Farmiga is very pretty but all of that gets overlooked due to how scary it is. It was a bit uncomfortable to watch and I wanted it to be over but I mean that as a compliment.Some of my favorite horror movies are An American Werewolf In London, Phantasm, the original Halloween, the original Fright Night, and some films in the A Nightmare On Elm Street series. Those are classic scary movies that play each year on certain networks during the month of October and fall into that category of a worst case scenario. Imagine how scary it would be if your nightmares could get you in real life or if a vampire moved into the house next door to you. Those are movies you can watch at home with the lights out while snacking on popcorn and chugging a soda and having fun while being scared. The Conjuring 2 however is a seriously terrifying two hour commitment that I do not want to watch at home alone. What if that hideous demon in the movie comes to get me? There's no fun in that!I remember seeing commercials for Paranormal Activity that showed the audience scared and looking away from the screen for a moment before peeking back and enjoying the experience like a sort of amusement ride. I like the films in that series. The Conjuring 2 had a different effect on the audience. The theater was silent throughout the entire film and after it ended people left the theater quickly and in silence. I got the feeling they were scared out of their wits.Rather than repeating myself by saying it was really scary, I'll sum it up. This is not a horror movie you mix in with teen-screams, slashers, or monster movies. It goes with The Exorcist or The Shining, especially when they were first released. One that will have even the most seasoned horror fan checking their closets and under their beds before going to sleep. See it in the theater if you can and good luck!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conjuring 2 Director James Wan is the Master Magician of Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director James Wan is a magician. He has all the tricks... Sleight of hand... Misdirection... Creating illusions that will terrify you to the core, without having to resort to gore or cheap thrills. Granted he is a master of making you jump out your seat, of making your heart skip a beat, but it's his ability to force you to hold your breath that makes his Conjuring movies so appealing and so much fun to watch. The camera pans and tilts at weird angles. The foreground and background focus and blur interchangeably as if to visually bend reality. A voice whispers in the dark. And through all this, somewhere in the back of your mind, the nagging horror that horrified you when you watched the Exorcist for the very first time, five words: Based on a true story.Like the first Conjuring (brilliant movie) the sequel is a dramatization of a case investigated by real life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The first Conjuring described the events of a house haunted by a witch called Bathsheba. The Warrens were often tackling multiple cases at once, and to emphasize the emotional stress that came with it, the first Conjuring also detailed the Warrens' experiences with a doll named Anabelle that reportedly came to life, possessed by an evil spirit, that is to this day locked away in a glass case in the back of the Warren household.In Part 2 we are re-introduced to the Warrens by reminding us of the case that catapulted the couple into the public eye, the murders in Amityville. The majority of this film, however, actually takes place across the pond in London, where a strange entity disturbed the peace of a poor, struggling single-mom and her four children. This became the most documented paranormal case in history, an entity known as the Enfield Poltergeist.The Conjuring 2 has a great cast. Frances 'O Connor plays Peggy Hodgson, the single mom who has to hold the house together in the midst of all the horror, including all the ridicule from non-believers. She's a mother trying and failing to maintain sanity. She wants to be brave for her kids, yet can't help but to be visibly agitated. Her youngest son Billy, a little boy with a stutter, is adorable, constantly bullied by his peers but is overwhelmed with boundless joy at the sight of a biscuit! The one who stole the show, however, was Madison Wolfe as Janet Hodgson, who in the real-life haunting was the entity's favorite target. Definitely see shades of Linda Blair in her performance.Other players like Simon McBurney as Maurice Gross, the British paranormal investigator who was primarily involved with the Enfield Poltergeist, even the constables who corroborated that some freaky stuff went down in the house, look and act just like those involved in the real case (did some investigating of my own on YouTube). Of course the real heroes of the film are Ed and Lorraine Warren played by Patrick Wilson (Insidious) and Vera Fermiga (Bates Motel) - as you can see both actors have a tendency towards dark material. They are an attractive couple, extremely likable, and as in the first Conjuring, there's a sense of adoration and compassion for the work the Warrens do. Both Patrick and Vera have this uncanny ability to make you feel comforted one minute, but with a slight contortion of the face, you know something is wrong. "I've got a bad feeling about this." Regardless whether you believe in this stuff or not, there's admiration for a couple who have dedicated their lives to helping others, freeing the tormented from inexplicable horrors when no one else can. Ed and Lorraine Warrens were the only ones outside of the clergy who were authorized by the Catholic Church to perform exorcisms."Based on a true story" should always be taken with a grain of salt. There are definitely some fantastical terrors that are there for show, inspired by nightmares as seen in Insidious or the Babadook. Like the first Conjuring, they don't turn a blind eye to alternative explanations for the events that take place, and allow you to view the subject from the skeptic's standpoint before diving headfirst into the dark realm of the beyond. One thing for sure is that the filmmakers have respect for the original material, pulling from old photographs to recreate the real settings, down to the details of the posters on their bedroom walls. What better example is there of respect for the material than this: prior to filming Conjuring Part 2, the filmmakers had a Catholic priest come in to bless the set. Apparently eerie occurrences took place when they filmed the first Conjuring movie. I ain't afraid of no ghosts. No poltergeist is going to stop Director James Wan and Writers Chad and Carey Hayes from telling the amazing story of Ed and Lorraine Warren, and with many more cases yet to be explored, I really hope they can conjure up another one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hodgson Haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Wan returned to direct this superb sequel that sees Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga resuming their roles of real life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, who are first seen(in a most effective prologue) investigating the notorious Amityville haunting in 1976, before moving forward a year to being asked by the Church to look into the veracity of the reports of a haunting in Enfield, England, where the Hodgson family(a single mother and her four children) are being terrorized by a seemingly evil old man who had died in the house, but as the Warrens discover, the situation is far more complicated and sinister than that...A match for the original, this intelligent, chilling, frightening sequel is even better, with a well crafted plot that pays off emotionally and spiritually by the heart-stopping climax. A model of its kind, and further installments done like this would be most welcome, as there are still more cases to tell...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Done Wan, Well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The horror genre, a movie category that tries to be good, but often ends up a joke during most movies. Occasionally though, we get a film that provides a good thrilling scare and is actually worth the admission price. For me, The Conjuring was one of those movies able to provide the chills I was looking for with a story to match. When I heard a sequel was coming, I feared that its good name would be diluted by the Hollywood haste to make money (remember Annabelle?). Hi Robbie K here, and today I review the Conjuring 2 and share my thoughts on the latest film. Let's get started. THE GOOD ? Story ? Integrated scares ? Acting/Recurring CastSeldom do we get a horror movie with an actual story, instead focusing on how to make people jump. This is not the case with this film my friends. Director James Wan and his team have managed to craft a tale that is both entertaining and interesting to watch. Conjuring 2's story takes place a few years after the first with the Warren's continuing their investigations of the paranormal. Meanwhile, across the ocean, the Hodgson family begins to experience their own paranormal activity that will eventually warrant inspection by our detectives. Sounds simple I know, and in truth it is, but Wan's delivery is fantastic. He manages to build suspense in his tale, using a gradual series of scares to build the tension and slowly reveal the truth in the haunting. And to throw in the few twists they did, only added more depth to the story. But Wan goes one step further and decides to bring some character development into mix, helping to add depth to all involved to help us connect with the film. The Warren's story was great to expand on, discussing the origins of our detectives, while also dropping in a little bit of love to sweeten the deal. And if that weren't enough, he even manages to keep all of the scares pertinent to the story, integrating them into the plot rather than dropping a random scare moment that Hollywood is famous for. By having the scares have a purpose, they removed the corny aspects and added an edge that made the only that much better. Of course, having a great cast to act out this story is the final piece of the puzzle. The repeat performance by Wilson and Farmiga was just as strong, the chemistry between them solid that I believed they were a couple. Newcomers to the series Madison Wolfe and Frances O'Connor played their roles as a terrified family to the letter, while also having another side to them that made you feel sorry for them. Finally Simon McBurney as Maurice Gross added some finesse to the cast, with a little comedic relief when the going got tough. But while fantastic alone, the chemistry between everyone was on point and only made things that much better.THE BAD: ? Still another horror movie ? Dropped some plot points/unexplained ? Predictable scare tacticsIt was difficult to find weaknesses in this movie for me, but there are a few things that took away from the movie for me. First is that this is still another horror movie that fits in well with other films of the same genre. We've had some unique horror films in the past, but this one is just a good old fashioned haunted house story. Again this is a picky weakness, but the originality could have used a bit more tweaking in my opinion. A bigger weakness is some of the plot points and presentation in the film. Wait a minute, I just said the plot was good didn't I? Yes it is, but it's not perfect and the Conjuring 2 has a few moments that I was still wanting closure on. I have to be sparing to not spoil anything, but one major detail lacking is why one particular thing has a vendetta against the family. A second limiting plot point is how two of the characters sort of drop out of the story without so much as a blink when they had played a key role in the film. But even with these limitations, the story itself was mostly complete and had a good closure, again I'm grasping at straws here. In addition there were some melodramatic moments that were a bit drawn out and somewhat cheesy to me. Oh well can't be perfect right.Finally the scare tactics are still predictable as ever and didn't really get me with the exception of one time. Camera angles giving away something, music eerily going silent and the occasional getting out of bed to walk in a dark hallway give away the horror from a mile away. But while I'm used to it, other members of the audience were still howling in fear, so again this may be a moot point. THE VERDICT:Overall, The Conjuring 2 is a sequel quite worthy of being called just as good as the original. Wan and his group has shown that a horror movie can have a story and still be scary despite the beliefs of Hollywood. The engaging characters, the well timed suspense, and the integrated scares are surely the best selling points. With few weakness to point out, this reviewer can't help but recommend this one for a theater visit for you horror fans out there. My scores for this movie are:Horror: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0-8.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As entertaining as first one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has a very strong story, stronger than the first one. I found it very fascinating that it was very easy to feel connected to the characters, to feel bad for them. It was a strong point for the first one also. The thing about conjuring is, and I am talking about both of them, is that it may not be scary enough for you, but it has all the element that a good girl movie should have, which is lacking now a days.They had to show what was happening with the affected family as well as they had to show the connection between Ed and Lorraine. They succeeded in doing that effectively. There was no problem in the acting department. Even the kids did there part very well. I've always been a fan of James Wan. He did miracles here too. There was this feel of constant tension on screen which holds well with the story. So, my verdict is that you should check it out, like seriously make sure you watch this one. Can't decide which of the two films I liked better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen the part 1 yet, but the part 2 is very good! I recommend you guy to see it on a big screen. Don't wait for the DVD! Since it was based on a true story, watching it on a big screen is more realistic, and imaginable. Trust me, $10 will definitely be worth to spend! I always have questions when I watch horror movies. I will post all the questions below. If you think you can answer my questions, please do it in a comment below. I will be very grateful. Also, some questions might sound a little dumb, so don't mind me.(Spoiler Alert!) 1 Why did the Demon Nun want to kill Janet? 2 If she did want to kill her, why didn't she just kill her from the beginning instead of just trying to haunt the family? 3 Why was Janet the only one that could be possessed by the demon? 3 If Lorraine could use the bible to defeat the Demon by knowing her name, why was the Demon the one telling her name to her? (It's not like, "Hey, this is my name, you can use it to kill me." MEH -_-) 4 How did the Demon possess Bill? (I mean it makes sense if she possesses human, but possesses the same spirit? Like WTF?) 5 Also, wasn't the Demon in the United States at first? How dafuq did she possess Will in England? 6 Near the ending, why did the Demon wait until the couple's gone in order to start killing Janet?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This time believe all the hype! This is genuinely an amazing and scary movie! It's the first time I ever cried tears of joy in a horror film along with being so scared and on the edge of my seat in the last 15-20 minutes. James Wan is an amazing director! The drama, tension, atmosphere, character development, even down to the music is utter perfection! Chad Hayes along with the other writers wrote a script so perfect and was beautiful executed by amazing actors! Seriously if horror movies could win an academy award it would win in all categories. I am going to see this again and again and buy it when it comes on bluray! It is hard to make a movie as good as the first but they did and it's a lot scarier! *Slight spoiler.* My friend who saw it with me was dissatisfied with all the love and feel good aspects of the movie. And I thought it's what made the movie and made me root for the characters even more!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally signed up on IMDb because this movie was so good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2 was the best horror movie I've seen in YEARS. The plot was good and scares were well-paced throughout the whole movie. The movie was long...over 2 hours...and I never got bored. Usually, when I got to the movies, I start to get restless after about 90 minutes, but not with The Conjuring.There was no nudity, swearing or gratuitous gore. Not that I'm a prude - I don't mind that stuff - but I know that bothers some people. So if a family with teen-aged kids want to see a really good horror flick, you don't have to be worried about anyone being mortified over nude scenes and/or sex.Also,it doesn't matter if you haven't seen the first "Conjuring" movie, so don't let that hold you back.A bunch of people clapped after the movie. That always cracks me up...who are they clapping to? But I brought that up just to let you know that The Conjuring 2 seemed to be enjoyed by - at least - the majority of the audience. Highly recommend. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second film from the Warren experiences.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-The Conjuring 2 (alternatively known as The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Poltergeist) is a 2016 American supernatural horror film directed by James Wan. The film was written by Carey Hayes, Chad Hayes, Wan and David Leslie Johnson. It is the sequel to the film The Conjuring, which was released on July 19, 2013. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise their roles as paranormal investigators and authors Ed and Lorraine Warren. The Warrens travel to the United Kingdom to assist the Hodgson family, who are experiencing poltergeist activity at their Enfield council house in 1977.-The film was released in the United States on June 10, 2016, by Warner Bros. Pictures.--Filming: -Principal photography for The Conjuring 2 began on September 21, 2015, in Los Angeles, California. Due to inexplicable eerie events during production of the first film, a priest from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Fe was brought in to bless the set of the sequel by the film's producers. Production moved to London on November 18, 2015, with filming taking place in and around The Warrington, a pub in the residential district of Maida Vale. On November 22, filming took place at Marylebone station. Filming concluded on December 1, 2015. Production lasted for 50 days, with 40 days filming on sets and locations in Los Angeles, and 10 days on location in London.-In early July 2015, lead actors Farmiga and Wilson visited Lorraine Warren at the New England Paranormal Research Center in Connecticut in preparation for their roles.--Critical response: -The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 73%, based on 92 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "The Conjuring 2 can't help but lose a bit of its predecessor's chilly sting through familiarity, but what remains is still a superior ghost story told with spine-tingling skill." Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average of 64 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".-In her review for The Hollywood Reporter, Sheri Linden praised the film, saying: "Three years after The Conjuring rattled the multiplex with old-school horror, director James Wan ups the ante with an excellent sequel." Owen Gleiberman of Variety gave the film a mixed review, writing: "On one level, The Conjuring 2 is just a not-bad megaplex funhouse movie, no more and no less, but on another level it offers its potential fans a helping of reassurance to go along with the fear. If there are ghost demons out there, then God must be out there as well. Audiences, it was long ago proved, will pay to see both." TheWrap's Alonso Duralde gave the film a positive review, stating: "Frightening rarely strikes twice in the same place, despite the efforts of so many horror sequels, but even if The Conjuring 2 doesn't deliver the delightful jolts of its predecessor, it maintains a consistent chill throughout, with a slow and steady dread that creeps up on you over time." -In a mixed review, Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B-, writing: "There are some solid scares (Wan is too gifted in the dark art of gotcha manipulation to not make you leap a few times), but there's nothing on par with the first film's brilliant hide-and-clap scene with Lili Taylor." Pete Hammond of Deadline.com wrote that he was "pleasantly surprised" by the sequel and what Wan has accomplished with the film, stating: "Wan knows the tricks of this trade (heightened sound effects, moving furniture, dark corners) but somehow miraculously he really puts a fresh spin on it all here. It's riveting stuff, even if in a familiar cinematic environment." He added: "It is one hell of a movie."--Possible sequel: -Director James Wan has said that a third Conjuring film is possible if response to The Conjuring 2 warranted it. He said: "There could be many more (Conjuring) movies because the Warrens have so many stories." Screenwriters Chad and Carey Hayes have also expressed interest in working on a story for another sequel. However, Wan stated that he may not have time to direct a third film because of his commitment to other projects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conjuring 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another "true" case from the Warren spouses (respected investigators of supernatural affairs), freely manipulated by Hollywood in order to fit into the "haunted house" formula and offer us a better dramatic experience. And the trick works pretty well, even though it repeats the well known routine of exaggerated drama and dry realism cultivated by director James Wan and his disciples. I have seen so many films with a similar visual and narrative style in recent years that their identities get a bit mixed into my memory. Or that might be a consequence of my advanced age. Anyway, Wan's solid direction and the solid screenplay from Chad and Carey Hayes make The Conjuring 2 a very competent sequel which limits the use of special effects and focuses on the confusion and anguish of the characters, making the experience feel more... "real", independently from its historical veracity. Speaking of which, I liked the fact that the screenplay incorporates the multiple questionings made by the skeptics on the validity of the famous "Enfield Poltergeist". Sure, we are watching a horror movie after all, but it was a good decision to throw shades of doubt regarding the testimony of the Hodgson family: Might it be an elaborate lie to obtain a new home with government support? Or are there really spirits (or whatever they are) threatening the family, already fractured by the abandonment of the father? I found the first hour of The Conjuring 2 excellent, thanks to the previously mentioned direction and the perfect work from the actors, highlighting Madison Wolfe and Lauren Esposito; both share difficult scenes of horror and psychological violence, but their authentic virtue is revealed during the passive moments, in which they convince us of their belonging to a family more united than ever, despite the domestic and economic difficulties. On the negative side of The Conjuring 2, I have to mention the running time and the dramatic function of the Warren spouses. The Conjuring 2 runs for 133 minutes, and it feels long. Come on, more than one hour goes by before the Warrens finally arrive at Enfield, and their investigation is developed between useless detours, redundant characters (Who exactly is "Eric"?) and a significant change in the texture itself of the film. That's where my complaint on their dramatic function comes from; the big suspense at the Hodgson's home is partially diluted when the personal drama from Ed and Lorraine Warren is incorporated. The two sub- plots eventually merge pretty well, but I felt the sudden switch from subtle psychological horror to the stridency of the last act slightly irritating. Fortunately, the Hayes brothers recover the control and unify criteria on time in order to reach a good conclusion, which offers the exact degree of restlessness and paranoia in order to avoid the happy ending cliché. So, in conclusion, The Conjuring 2 should have had a more judicious edition, but I still found it a solid and very satisfactory film which is definitely above the average of "studio" horror movies.</fullReview>

The theater was a full house and i all i could hear is screams the whole time, way better than the first part. This movie deserves a 10, i think this is is the scariest movie i have seen after a long long time after the exorcist. People who think this movie isn't great needs to get their eyes checked or they do not know what they are talking about. From the beginning the movie started to the end people were actually jumping from out of their seats. If u have not watched this movie till now i recommend watching it right away and u will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terrifying Sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sequel to the solid The Conjuring, James Wan's 'The Conjuring 2' is A Terrifying Sequel, that almost scores as much as its legendary predecessor in terms of scares &amp; atmosphere. The Sequel is unsettling, spooky &amp; absolutely engaging, turning out to be a much satisfying follow-up.'The Conjuring 2' Synopsis: Lorraine and Ed Warren travel to north London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by malicious spirits.'The Conjuring 2' is a compelling horror ride, that arrests your attention &amp; scares the daylights out of you. I found myself terrified at my seat, almost shutting my eyes &amp; ears whenever a sound or visual offered something ghostly. I was particularly terrified in a superbly done sequence, involving a painting &amp; a nun. Believe me, I'm never looking at a nun in the same manner! Wan, Chad Hayes, Carey Hayes &amp; David Leslie Johnson's Screenplay (supposedly based on a true-story) is hauntingly scary. 'The Conjuring 2' is almost at par with its predecessor, as the scares here, are truly well-done. The Writing superbly warms up in its first-hour &amp; turns into a ride in the second-hour, only to culminate into a feast of a climax. Wan's Direction is brilliant. He creates an unsettling, eerie atmosphere, with his superior storytelling. Don Burgess's Cinematography captures the misty filled London, as well as all the scares &amp; the human-drama, with flourish. Kirk M. Morri's Editing is crisp. Art &amp; Costume Design are Fantastic. Joseph Bishara's is perfect. Performance-Wise: Patrick Wilson &amp; Vera Farmiga return as paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren &amp; they deliver remarkably. Its the strength of their performances that push 'The Conjuring 2' to further success. Frances O'Connor as the mother under torment, is fabulous. Madison Wolfe as the child under possession, is excellent. The kid blends sympathy with pure terror, without ever breaking out of character. Simon McBurney is first-rate. On the whole, 'The Conjuring 2' is A Winner. Go, Get Spooked!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conjuring 2: More Than Just A Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2* * * * *By Stephanie CieplinskiEvery now again we come across films that are considered horror movies, yet are so much more than that. Silence of the Lambs (1991), The Exorcist (1973), and Psycho (1960) all come to mind. All of these films are horrific in nature, but have messages that blur the lines between genres. James Wan has done it again with this thrilling and chilling sequel to his 2013 film The Conjuring. Returning are Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren, and written for the screen by Wan (Insidious, Saw), Carey Hayes and Chad Hayes (The Conjuring, House of Wax) and David Johnson (Orphan). This film isn't merely blood, gore and jump scares; it's a heart-wrenching love story, loosely based on the real-life marriage between the Warrens. This is the most connected we've ever been to characters in Wan's films that doesn't rely on horror, but on a lesson about life and morality. We're invested more than before with the Warren family and even more so with the single mother-run household of Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) and her four children Janet (Madison Wolfe), Margaret (Lauren Esposito), Billy (Benjamin Haigh) and Johnny (Patrick McAuley). The same disturbing images and visions that are haunting Lorraine and Ed, are connected to the haunting happening at the Hodgson residence. We're dealt with more scares and eerie spirits putting the characters we care so much about in immediate danger. After all, Lorraine can predict the future--she has a premonition of Ed's death. The film picks up during the Warrens' visit to Amityville, Long Island, where they manage to help the Defeo family even amongst rumors that the "haunting" was a hoax to garner media attention. We follow Ed and Lorraine as well as Peggy, Janet and their family in Enfield, England. Once Peggy Hodgson sees that the Warrens were able to help the Defeo's, Peggy solicits the church and by extension, the Warrens. Not only have the children and Peggy seen unusual happenings in their home, but so have their neighbors and the local police. They are desperate to drive away the spirit of a man named Bill Wilkins, who used to live and then subsequently died, in their home years prior. C2 stirs up not only of what we fear, but how it can be utilized against us. The camera movement is one step ahead of you and these consistent movements draw tension from the audience all the while building up a scare that may or may not come. Sometimes we believe that there will be a pay off. We are anxious and ready for something scary and then, it never comes, which only makes us more on edge for the next scene. Wan also makes nods to his previous films. He successfully develops a unique world where we are familiar with the rules. What many of his previous films and C2 consistently question is: Is what we see really just a trick of the light? Are we imagining some things or is it something evil lurking, preparing to prey on us during our most vulnerable moments? It's also important to note that Wilson has quite a fantastic singing voice! I had "Can't Help Falling In Love" by Elvis Presley stuck in my head the entire rest of the night. There are fantastic supporting roles as well played by Simon McBurney as Maurice Grosse, an expert on paranormal activity and Franka Potente, who we haven't seen on the big screen in a long time as Anita Gregory, who only wants to catch the supposed hoax of the Hodgson family. This is a film that can make you tear up for the moral (stand up for the ones that you love, stick together and you can conquer anything--you are not alone) and bawl like a baby at the horrific imagery. Even the storyline in and of itself makes us doubt what we've been seeing the entire time. This is a film that will continue to scare you long after you've walked out of the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Satisfying and more Emotional Engaging Horror Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequels of horror genre have always been cursed to turn out poor yet director James Wan manages to set his bar as compelling as the first one; though not critically-acclaimed but overall a satisfying scare without blood and gore. Slightly longer than its predecessor, the 134 minutes running time enhances smooth pacing of the plot, allows further debate over the controversy of supernatural phenomenons and scientific psychology, human tricks and role play of the religion organisations; even if parts of its horror elements may feel routine, it is still able to trigger chills and unsettling moods. Characters development and emotional engagement especially the love life of Warren have made this follow up more to like a family crisis drama interrupted by a demonic figure, thanks to the strong performance of the young casts, eerie but not over loud thematic scores as well as the confident cinematography and visual effects. Overall, the efforts of remaining the styles from the first one, the decision to twist the final act and the addition of dramatic aspects are mixing so well which eventually it just feels so real that leaves the desire to follow up with the next documented case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Conjuring Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this one. The first description that came to mind after watching it (on opening day), was "that was intense". I felt the story wasn't as strong as the first Conjuring but the scare scenes were definitely more right in your face type of scenes.The relationship between Ed and Lorraine also continued to develop in this movie, which was pleasant to see. The daughter was played by the same actor, though she is obviously older. I just have to say that yes some areas are probably weaker with this movie from the first one but other areas are stronger and overall I'd say it's just as good as the first one. I will definitely be buying this movie when it comes out on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this last night. Absolute masterpiece in horror genre.It is better and different than the first Conjuring. The story is so detailed and nicely done. The character development for the characters in the movie is well done. The cinematography by James Wan and his team is so beautifully. The shots and the camera movement stood out for me and I loved it. The acting done by everyone is fantastic. They are all really talented, no doubt. The scares are awesome, some are predictable, some are not. So many new things and creativity in this movie. The soundtrack is creepy and kinda Insidious-y which I loved a lot. The twist in the end and the climax was so well -edited, it was pure satisfaction. Overall, a fantastic horror movie. I can't find any flaws in this film. James Wan didn't disappoint. He is the star of the film.I hope there is a Conjuring 3.Eagerly waiting for it. 10/10 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2 clearly demonstrates the directing capabilities of James Wan. Set to helm 2018's Aquaman, Wan chills the audience with fright, and warms them with romantic and comedic aspects. Considered one of the scariest films of all time, "The Conjuring" scared audiences half to death in 2013. Movie goers will return for the next fright of their life! With Vera Fermiga and Patrick Wilson reprising their roles, The Conjuring 2 bases it's true plot on Ed and Lorraine Warren working in London to help a mother raising her four children and battling demonic forces.The acting, once again, is superb. Farmiga and Wilson have perfect chemistry, more specifically in the more sentimental and character driven moments of this film. The performances by the young child actors are surprisingly good, and are not annoying like most child acting. Frances O'Connor also gives a convincing performance in the film.Written by Chad Hayes, Carey Hayes, James Wan and David Johnson, The Conjuring 2 is definitely well written, but suffers from being twenty minutes too long. Ultimately, the film is tense and thrilling, but you can definitely feel the two hours and fifteen minute running time. The film has sensible dialogue and interesting conversations between characters.All in all, The Conjuring 2 is the best film I have seen so far this year. It truly is a masterpiece for the Horror genre. It is as enjoyable, if not, even more enjoyable than the first. It is well directed, superbly written and realistically acted. Everyone involved is to be commended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror sequels can be another horrible film following from it's predecessor's success that most filmmakers just want some money without any effort and interesting stuff to show,they are just blatantly lazy.Conjuring 2 didn't follow that but instead brought us new interesting things to this franchise with a captivating story and a hunting and creepy atmosphere,it is a well directed horror sequel.The performances were amazing,the chemistry of the Warrens was just marvelous and so thus the children in the film they were also excellent.As the film progress the tension gets higher and also thus the apprehension.This Horror film is far from the worst and near from the best it's on par with it's predecessor,Conjuring 2 is an example of a good horror sequel</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a big movie fan I like all kind of good cinema and horror movies are one of them. (let's talk about the conjuring)I don't have to tell you how good was the first part of the conjuring that's why I was expecting more and exited about the the second outing of conjuring (the Enfield case) and after watching it I was satisfied with the treatment this movie got (from James Wan and writers)this movie is definitely more scarier then the first part it's a period horror movie and the feel of that is amazing because of great camera work and sets. Patrick Wilson as Ed Warren and Vera Farmiga as Lorraine Warren was as good as they were in first part but surprised by Madison Wolfe who played a character of Janet Hodgson rest of supporting cast did what is required to make this film more interesting.while watching horror movies I always expect better drama and if that drama is based on a period background it makes it more interesting where first part was more dramatic then horror(in a good way) second one is surely more scarier drama I hope you will enjoy this movie as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The captivating magic of horror, intensely terrifying and equally inviting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the new cooler scenery and entirely likable victims, The Warrens take on another haunting case in the retro England. This setting serves more than cosmetic, it differentiates itself from previous movie's warmer tone, while also providing a good vehicle to usher the horror. Along with the pristine visual, "Conjuring 2" brings back the veteran demonologists and introduces an oddly charming family, especially the little girl in peril.James Wan already had a knack for showing eerie camera angles, this time he adds more movement and less cut to the mix. He knows how to attract or distract the audience's attention in a clever way, the more flowing camera offers more focus and in turns allowing the audience to follow these characters closely as they stumble and frantically run.The family consists of a single mother and her children. From the first five minutes they will appeal to viewers, and it's a significant boon for a horror movie. Madison Wolfe as Janet, the little girl is impressive, she has a good on screen chemistry both with the family and the Warrens. The way she's putting a brave front even though she's exhausted from the abuse, but also creates a bit of skepticism is simply excellent.Her siblings are easily identifiable and equally sympathetic. They have a casual tone, almost crude yet alarmingly funny as well. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine are visiting a known territory. They just fit in the picture, in rather creepy homecoming kind of way. There are residues from the familiar ambiance yet it's presented in more rainy gloomy tone."Conjuring 2" is a pleasant gift for horror. It's frightening, yet it never fails to engage, drawing us to stay in the darkly atmosphere and cleverly crafted spectacle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sequel Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After experiencing the Conjuring, I had no doubt that the sequel would be up to par. However, I wasn't prepared for the riveting film and the chills that were sent down my spine. Giving genuine scares, and moments that made me cover my eyes because I knew the jump was coming, the film offers a steady pace that neither rushes or seems too lagging. James Wan does an excellent job as always, providing a thrilling and terrifying film that will leave you troubled to sleep at night and vowing to never touch another Ouija Board in your life! As an experienced movie-goer you may find yourself, as I did, trying to anticipate the next scare or where it would come from. Although you may be correct in guessing what will happen, it doesn't prepare you for the jump that scares the living hell out of you even though you know it's coming. This film will be remembered as one of the better horror films that we have seen come and go over the past few years. I recommend it to all who appreciate a good sequel, and a good horror film. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was way better than it's previous part. Towards the end of the movie, it was on a whole new level.If you are someone who wishes to watch some quality horror films - not the cheap ones where they use gore deaths to trick you into feeling the horror. Instead James Wan really knows how to scare you and send chills down your spine.The movie was thoroughly entertaining. THe lead characters Ed Warren (by Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (by Vera Farmiga) have given a very beautiful performance. The young girl, Janet Hodgson (by Madison Wolfe) needs special mention - her's is yet another extraordinary performance.Lorraine does not receive anything or is not able to sense any abnormal presence in the place they have been asked to investigate. Not until they find out the real real why she couldn't sense anything - everyone knows the magnitude of the problem ahead of them. Then comes the final showdown. I guarantee you it's gonna a thrilling ride from here on.If you are thinking whether to watch this movie or not, spend not another moment thinking, just go right ahead and watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lightning strikes twice with the "Conjuring sequel" (and quite literally too)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, alright. I will get straight to the point. "The Conjuring 2" is scary. So scary it is actually scarier than the first. So scary that if James Wan, the director of this movie, made me jump one more time, I would have fallen out of my seat."The Conjuring 2" is also more interesting than the first "Conjuring". The Wan-directed sequel revolves around the Hodgson family, who believe their house is haunted. Because of this, they contact the Warrens, the same ghostbusters from "The Conjuring". Okay, not so original. However, when the Warrens investigate the Hodgsons' house, they suspect if the Hodgsons' house is really haunted. Are the Hodgsons making up this up? Are Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren not looking deep enough into the Hodgsons' case? The idea of ghostbusters being skeptical about paranormal activity is greatly ironic, and a nice change of pace from the first movie. In the first movie, Ed and Lorraine accepted that the Perrons' house was haunted; there was no doubt that the Perrons were telling the truth. In "The Conjuring 2", all bets are off.What is also great about the "Conjuring" sequel is how likable its characters are. For one, Ed Warren is one of the most likable protagonists I have seen in a film. He wants the Hodgson family to stick together during their time of distress, and even bonds with them when he is not trying to conjure up nasty demons. He plays the Hodgsons guitar, he listens to music with them, and he even has a few heart-to-heart moments with the youngest daughter Janet (Madison Wolfe). Lorraine Warren is also charming. She sticks up for her husband, she makes sacrifices for the Hodgson family, and she has a heart of gold. I really liked the Warrens, and I especially liked their relationship together.What "The Conjuring 2" does masterfully, as one could have guessed, is making audiences wet their pants. Yes, there are conventional jump scares. Yes, they happen because the sound mixer cranked up the volume to 100. But, Wan is great at tricking his audiences as to where his scary ghouls are going to pop out of. He is also great at making you think something scary is going to happen when nothing does. Basically, if you do not get scared by this movie, you are fearless.Yet, "The Conjuring 2" is not without its problems. For one, the movie is way too long. Wan wants to make his audience believe that he will end on a conventional, unsatisfying note that horror directors overuse. Then, he makes something more evil happen. Then, it turns out that "evil" thing was just a joke and the audience gets the ending they hoped for. While it was fun for Wan to trick his audience, it would have been more effective if he had one, solid ending. Moreover, the beginning is not scary enough. Wan uses tropes such as "creepy-kids-are-scary" and "ooh-let's-re-create-an-old-horror-story-like-the-Amityville-murder", and none of these conventions work. While they are entertaining, you almost doubt if the film will get scarier (which is does- BELIEVE me).Criticisms aside, "The Conjuring 2" is a fantastic sequel. It is scary, it tells a great story, and it stars some truly likable people. Yes, it is overlong and the film could start off with a bang, but I am happy how "The Conjuring 2" turned out.. Oh, and the film looks great. Please do not see this movie on your 13 inch computer when it comes to iTunes. Treat yourself to the cineplex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most frightening supernatural horror films I've seen in the longest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't remember the last time one of these movies had me jumping out of the seat like I did for this.James Wan proves that hes's a master at this when he's behind the director's seat. I've seen plenty of these movies where he produced them or whatever, but he needed to have his director's hat on for them to be this scary. The experience is so much better. Everything was timed so perfectly. The Ghost were right behind the victims at the right time blended into the shadows to make you scared of what your looking at. A lot of camera tricks that make you think nothing is going on until you look long enough. The sounds echoed just at the perfect time to get your heart pumping. It was slow for just the right amount of time and you don't see the Ghost for just the right amount of time.This film will having you clinging to your seat form the opening frame to the very end. The most suspenseful supernatural horror film I've seen in a long time.And frankly it's makes for an amazing sequel. You got to see this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more gradual tension build up and unexpected scenes than conjuring I</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will say from the very first beginning until the last 30% of the movie, you will be seeing typical James Wan style jump scares (only light ones) and classic scenes while getting involved in the story line. That being said, it gets your attention and traps you in to the story, but no major experience of terrors yet (for typical horror fans).Once getting into the last 25minutes or so, I felt like walking into a haunted house in the amusement park as a kid (terrifying as moving each step forward). It was so exciting to enter, but once I am there, I don't want to move forward and am scared as hell that something will pop out in the dark, but there is no way back. That's how I felt.I would also say the conjuring II is less predictable than the conjuring I. You can't quite guess how things will end in the conjuring II (happy ending or sad ending? I had no idea). But for the conjuring I, we kind of knew what was going to happen once the demon was fully possessing the women. Typical exorcist scenes from there. But for this sequel, there were many surprising elements.I'm an extremely picky horror movie watcher, but I will have to say, go ahead and enjoy this movie (It's little over 2hrs but it goes quick). You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror done right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not understand why so many have trouble making a horror movie now a day. All you have to do is just use James Wan's creative genius as a guideline and you should, in Theory, have horror gold. Let me start off by stating that I thought the first conjuring was one of the scariest movies I have seen In a loooooong time, and put together so brilliantly, that when I heard James Wan was going to be putting out a sequel I knew we would be getting another horror masterpiece. The Conjuring 2 much like the first one has Ed and Lorraine Warren trying to help out a family who have encountered a demonic spirit. Although the concept of the story, similar to the first, it is all the little things and over all plot that made this sequel really stand out. The way James Wan builds up the story and does not kill you with cheesy jump scares, but instead pure suspense is something that a lot of writers and directors releasing horror films seem to miss. Wan builds a story taking events from the real Enfield haunting, stretching things at times for sure, but at the end puts together a movie that will leave you with chills. I am a horror fanatic, and I appreciate how cold the scenes feel at times, how bone chilling the darkness can be, and how simple sound effects can make ones skin crawl. Aside from the horror aspect there are scenes that get you attached to the Warrens all over again. This is not your typical horror film where the story is replaced with scares, and gore. We have a story, we have suspense, we have a connection with the characters, and even some comic relief in places. The only warning I have coming into this movie is that if you really want to sit there and enjoy it, wait for the crowds to die down. So many people come into these horror films the first week in groups it seems like, and laugh / talk after every scare. I myself will be seeing this a second time in a couple weeks once the hype dies down, that way I can really take everything in that this movie had to offer. Overall a must see as James Wan has done it once again. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Einfield Case is a Killer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2013 film The Conjuring, directed by James Wan is a masterpiece to the horror genre, and became the highest grossing horror movie of all time. The film revolved the case about Batseeba Sherman, a woman who sacrificed her child to Satan and hung herself from the tree right in front of her farm in Rhode Island, New England, United States. In 1971 the Perron family experienced some disturbing events which was solved by The Warren couple.The Conjuring 2, which is about the Einfield case, takes place six years later after the Rhode Island Case. First of all, the screenwriters and James Wan need to be praised, because it's not easy to make a sequel stand in the same level as the original. It rarely happens in Hollywood. A few examples in the horror genre could be Ridley Scott Alien (1979) and James Cameron's Aliens (1986), and John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981).Every single actor should be praised for their performances, especially Patrick Wilson as Ed Warren, Vera Farmiga as Lorraine Warren, Madison Wolfe as Janet Hodgson and Frances O'Connor as Peggy Hodgson. I think why many horror movies don't succeed is because we don't feel pity or remorse for the characters in the story, but when it comes to this film it doesn't fail at all (which is proof that the script and the characters are believable and powerful). Joseph Bishara's music is definitely a reason for why the movie is a killer. The background score just makes every single frame more and more intense and spooky and the cinematography by Don Burgess and editing by Kirk M. Morri was excellent.To people who don't know anything about the Einfield case or the cases which were solved by the Warren couples: Don't expect another exorcism scene like the first one... you might get disappointed if you are a hardcore horror fan. The film has some scenes that will give us ''deja vu'' as it has been repeated over and over again.Other than that, the story-line is really engaging and it will keep the audience to sit in the edge of their seats throughout the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a scary one, but no surprise because it has a nun doing the heavy lifting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This is as close to hell as I ever want to get." Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) When a thriller-horror story is also a love story, I know I'm in the land of the Catholic Church, nuns, Christ, sin, and redemption. As for the love part of Conjuring 2, well, Lorraine and Ed Warren (Farmiga and Patrick Wilson) are famous paranormal investigators/demonologists (in real life, too) who happen to be married with a love that helps them through another demonic possession story.After the real Amityville Horror and after The Conjuring, they are drawn again to similar shenanigans in North London. Now, even after the long break, they are back helping an Enfield family in demonic distress. The scene is not your usual rickety old Victorian mansion but rather a rickety old council flat. Together with director James Wan's expert tracking shots, this film knows just how to scare the hell out of the audience.This case is about holding on to the one you love?the single-mom Peggy Hogson (Francis O'Connor) family hangs on to each other after dad has abandoned them while they are disturbed by the ghost of a "crooked" old man who wants them to leave his home. When all else fails the family, love brings them through, and in a sense so too does the old man's love of his family keep him in this world, even though he died years ago.As for the Catholic/Christian overlay, the demon is dressed like a Goth nun, and a priest is consulted because the Church is renowned for its ability to exorcise (see The Exorcist from 43 years ago). As a former fallen-down Catholic boy, I can attest to the power of the nuns to direct our consciences, indeed our very inner spirits, away from sin, especially of the flesh. The downside is that we can fiercely fear the devil wearing a habit. In the end, God or his son on a little crucifix around Ed's neck will save the faithful.You'd think in the Thatcher era, a demon in her outfit would be enough to scare a poor British family, but the Catholic Church works a better scare in habits because of its ambivalent role in many lives, savior and Satan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling and thrilling! A worthy sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Wan seems to be the only consistent horror director working today, cranking out hit after hit, with his explosive start helming the first Saw film. His follow up to The Conjuring, The Conjuring 2 is a worthy sequel, and while the first installment of the haunted adventures of the Warrens' shines brighter than this follow up, The Conjuring 2 still thrills and chills with the help of well placed jump scares, a tone of absolute dread, and beautiful camera work.It's been seven years since Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) and her husband, Ed (Patrick Wilson), helped The Perron family with their haunted Rhode Island house. When Lorraine has a premonition of a terrifying demonic force threatening to kill Ed, she decides they cannot investigate anymore to keep him safe. Across the pond in Enfield, England, the Hodgson family is being terrorized by the angry spirit of an old man named Bill (Bob Adrian). The eleven-year-old Janet (Madison Wolfe) seems to be the focus of all the hubbub and the primary victim of Bill's rage. When the police come by one night, after a particularly scary attack, and witness supernatural activity themselves, the Hodgon's soon find themselves in the middle of a media firestorm about their haunted home. The church sends Ed and Lorraine to England to confirm the authenticity of the case despite Lorraine's hesitance and worries about Ed's safety.Wilson and Farmiga are still as charming as ever playing the real-life Warrens, who spent decades investigating the supernatural. They are a perfect pair of love, faith, and empathy. Their capacity for goodwill is rooted in their unwavering Christian faith- something that is not popular or looked upon as a legitimate motivation for character actions these days. The pair are written so likable that their faith cannot simply be laughed away. They use it as their foundation in all that they do, in their unwavering sense of charity in helping this family in need, and also as a fierce weapon against evil. Even the most hardened atheist will find it difficult to deny how bad ass Lorraine is as she holds up her Bible or the potent power of Ed's crucifix around his neck when they wield them in defense against the nasty spirit tormenting the Hodgsons. Madison Wolfe, who plays Janet, the poor girl being hit with the most abuse, is a wonderful actress. You feel her exhaustion and her utter loss of hope as the movie continues on. Wolfe exhibits the talent of someone much older than herself. You empathize with her highs and her lows- something usually difficult for such a young actor to achieve.The camera work is almost another character in The Conjuring 2. Simple zooms, upside down shots, and pans induce the fear in the audience, who witness some horrors that the characters do not. In one sequence the youngest Hodgson boy, Billy (Benjamin Haigh), has a blanket tent set up at the end of a dark hallway. When one of his toys rolls by itself out from the darkness, he jumps into bed in fear while the camera focuses on the tent, giving the audience a good forty-five seconds of fear of what is inside the dark tent and waiting for whatever it may be to jump out. With this tactic, Wan includes the audience in the narrative, giving each person their own personal journey with this haunting.While it is indeed a well made and effective film in it's own right, The Conjuring 2 is more scattered plot-wise than the tightly scripted The Conjuring. It spreads itself a little too thin as it tries to include slight subplots of some of the real life people who were present during the Enfield Hauntings, including Maurice Grosse (Simon McBurney), who was an investigator and the most constant and dedicated supporter for the Hodgson's during their plight. He is an important figure in the actual real-life story, but this movie is about the Warrens and the Hodgens, and any departure from them feels like an overkill of information.James Wan is not only a great director of horror but also in general. Hopefully he is just getting started with The Conjuring series. Based on the quality thus far of the first two films, you can potentially expect to be treated and frightened by a whole franchise based on the hundreds of the Warrens real-life haunted adventures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER-FREE James Wan has returned with the sequel to my favourite horror movie,The Conjuring.This movie is familiar.It is extremely familiar to its predecessor,but why not to love that? I didn't want original.I wanted scary.And I got a lot of scares.Ed and Lorraine travel to London to help a single mom who is trying to raise her 4 children in a house with an evil presence.This movie is familiar but not a remake.Thank God for that,because rehashing the original would have definitely ruined the film.The acting is nice once again,and the 2 lead "Ghostbusters" are fun to watch with their ghost-busting tricks.This is a superior horror story which keeps you at the edge of the seat and constantly making you scream.Just like the first movie,the final act is the best thing in the entire film.I am grateful that I got to attend a pre-screening of this movie so that I could tell you first-hand that go for it,this movie is very well worth your time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way better than Annabelle, but nowhere near Conjuring 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Conjuring 1 had left me trembling but Annabelle left me disappointed. So when conjuring 2 was announced I was eagerly waiting for its release. The movie started off well but left me disappointment. The story-line was good and Patrick Wilson and Vera Fermiga were once again brilliant. A James Wan Horror flick is seldom without scary scenes and "jump off the seat" stuff and conjuring 2 is no exception. The disappointing factor was the end which I feel was a little too stretched and easy. The movie could had ended 15 minutes earlier and in the end I was waiting for the dramatics to end. Overall the movie is worth a watch with some great scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than any other horror film so far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its not only a movie that scares us, it also didn't fail to gave us a good story, an excellent plot to demonstrate what really happened to the most documented supernatural case, which was the haunting of the Hodgson family back in 1977. Nothing in this film bored me, and the ambiancé was really scary. The jump-scares were new and a lot of scenes were really unusual to happen in a horror film. The actors did a very great job, they really fit in to their roles. Im glad that the sequel of the conjuring exceeded the quality of its predecessor, and it also exceeded my expectation though my expectation was already high. The trailers released were excellent for not showing the entire story, they just shown enough to promote the film. It is my first time actually to have a ghost-movie to my favorite list, I am really a fan of horror movies, and I usually liked a killer/zombie-movie, but this film really killed it, IT IS THE SCARIEST MOVIE SO FAR! looking forward to the conjuring 3 already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How James Wan is Rewriting the Book of Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lorraine and Ed Warren travel to North London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by a malicious spirit. The brilliantly terrifying The Conjuring is the second highest grossing horror movie of all time. The first being: The Exorcist. This film was genuinely the best horror film I had ever seen in a long time and James Wan is in my point of view, the best director working in horror today; so I was really excited to see this second instalment. This movie makes a perfect follow-up to the original Conjuring's lesser known case. Plus, the movie starts with a certain Amityville House. Yes, THAT Amityville. Here, the Enfield Case is probably one of the best documented, most studied and most contested hauntings in existence and in British history. The real recordings of paranormal investigator Ed Warren interviewing the entity through Janet live at the end of The Conjuring 2 and it's difficult not to let chills run down your spine. Nonetheless, director James Wan offers its potential fans a helping of reinsurance to go along with the fear. If there are ghosts and demons out there, then God must be out there as well. James Wan, who directed Saw and Insidious, is a horror filmmaker of such skills that even when he makes a by-the-book haunted-house story, it's easy to feel a hint of admiration for his talent beneath your tingling spine. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson couple really ground the film in realism as their backstory and relationship are really touching and heartfelt. Being more than a horror movie, it's about marriage and being with somebody that understands you. The realistic family story grounds the film and makes it better than your average horror film. Horror lives in the unknown. It hides in abandoned asylums, in catacombs, in cabins and haunted manors. These are safe places to die. You don't want to die? Maybe don't do an Ouija Board, stay home and watch Netflix instead. Nothing can find you there. Except James Wan. Wan is a modern horror maestro who brings the fear home to you. All these events take place in the very real world, occupied by everyday people trying to get on with their life. We've all been children hiding under the duvet from whatever hid under our bed in the dark. Even now, home alone on a rainy day, we've sat on our couch and wondered what creaked the floorboards in the seemingly empty room next to us. Wan's fear construction is effortless, his best moments lie in the silence between scares. He also has a sense of the audience: of their rhythm and pulse, of how to manipulate a moment so that he's practically controlling your breathing. He became a master of THE face. He must have a card in his office reading:"All you need to make a hit horror film is one truly awful face!". THAT face. The face that's staring through the window. Staring through the dark. The face that's coming to get you eventually. James Wan again proves with this film that he knows how to use a jump scare. Those are meant to get you. This man knows how to built tension until it feels insurmountable. He's also a wizard of timing, i-e he toys with us by throwing so routinely unsettling images at us, like, let's say a toy firetruck that starts to move ion its own. Then, letting that omen menace pass at which point the movie will simply pause, stopping dead in its tracks. It's right there, in the middle of that storm of quiet, that our anxiety starts to rush in. Finally, it's truly the craft, performances and the writing that make this film a billion years ahead of all films of its kind, out right now. This film is really good. It's scary, suspenseful, the tension is real and a lot of that is due to a brilliant cinematography. Overall, James Wan knows his craft. And all he has to do to bring you true horror is take you home, where you think you're safe from harm. Sweet, sweet dreams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Genuinely Scary Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2 is one of those extremely rare horror sequels that doesn't fall victim to copying it's predecessor. While The Conjuring 2 isn't free of clichés and isn't better than it's predecessor, it's a really solid horror film separate from the original. The Conjuring 2 is chilling without relying on jump scares, features really good character development, despite being a tad familiar. This film may prove that James Wan is the modern king of horror, because every horror film he does is solid.One thing to learn from this film is that while jump scares are a cheap way to get scares, they can be very effective when used sparingly. Many modern horror films rely solely on jump scares to scare the audience, but this film has a truly chilling tone, and many scenes are terrifying without jumping the audience. That being said there are jump scares littered throughout this film, but Wan is clever when he uses them, and is often effective when he uses them. I'm proud that most horror films don't jump me, that being said multiple times watching this film I found myself jumped.One major reason this film succeeds is because of the character development, which really helps the audience care about the characters. Every single character in the film is well fleshed out, and given a moment of relatability. Even the ghosts in the film are generally scary and have a really good design. However, the film's characters represent one of the film's major problems, the fact that it's based on true events. After seeing this film it would seem to say that the phrase "based on true events" was only included for dramatic effect.The story of the film is based on the actual events of the Enfield Poltergeist in England in the late 70's but the problem is that half the film uses moments from that investigation and the other half feels like an exorcist rip off. It's unfortunate because there's a terrifying story, despite the evidence that it was a hoax, in the Enfield Poltergeist that gets lost in the shuffle. Simply put if the filmmakers hadn't felt the need to match The Exorcist, the film's ending may not have felt so different from the rest of the film.In the end for horror buffs, this may be the best horror film of the year, if nothing better comes along. For those who want to see a great horror film regardless of its faithfulness to the actual events this is a great film, but for those who want a faithful adaptation of the Enfield Poltergeist this film definitely takes some liberties. That being said this film is genuinely scary which is rare today, and above that is just a good film in general, so it's most definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First rate horror sequel with genuine scares and suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Conjuring 2" is the latest film directed by James Wan and a followup to his 2013 film, again based on real life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren.I really enjoyed "The Conjuring", feeling that it was well made and provided a lot of scares and atmosphere, unlike most horror movies today which rely too much on extreme violence, shaky cam and jump scares to shock the audience. The two leads, played by Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, also had great chemistry. After hearing bad press for the spin-off "Annabelle" - which featured the demonic doll from the opening of the original movie - I was hesitant to see this sequel. It doesn't help that most horror sequels are quick cash grabs that do little to improve on the original, and usually end up being a poor rehash of the original.Well it turns out I was wrong. "The Conjuring 2" is an excellent movie, the scares are genuine and the story (based on a real incident in England) is compelling.The film starts off with Ed and Lorraine just off the case of the infamous 'Amityiville' haunting in Long Island in the mid 70's. The case leads to mass attention in the media, but Lorraine wants to stop working because of an evil omen she feels coming from an unknown source.Meanwhile, in England in the town of Enfield, the Hodgson family starts to experience strange occurrences in their flat, especially young Janet (Madison Wolfe - who turns in an excellent performance) who has a strong connection with the spirits that haunt them.Instead of being a simple retread, the film takes care to make you connect with the Hodgson's - single mother Peggy, and her four children are all developed well; and the new conflict with the Warren's ties both stories together skillfully in the script. The ghosts and monsters (especially the "Crooked Man") are genuinely creepy, and while there are jump scares, they are done effectively, and always sparsely.The only minor gripe I have is that the minor character development of Ed Warren handling his anger issues could have been explored more. It seemed interesting, but there were only a few throw-away lines about it, and then it was never brought up again.James Wan is one of the most skilled directors working in horror today, and while the sequels to his work vary in quality (after Saw II, the series becomes redundant), under his guidance, "The Conjuring" has had the makings of a first rate franchise, in spite of any inaccuracies when adapting from actual events.</fullReview>

I was really impressed with Wan's portrayal of 1970s London too. Wilson and Farmiga reprise their roles of Ed and Lorraine Warren brilliantly and Madison Wolfe portrays Janet Hodgson disturbingly well. Wan is a true horror genius. If you like jumps - there are plenty! If you like creepy eerie music full of darkness and suspense - there are plenty! Well done Mr Wan.

		<shortDescription>Take a breath... count to ten... see the true shadows which the academics clarifies as fiction demonization and say... MY HOUSE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.This is one more of Hollywoods productions where it is clear that they learn more and more about how to entertain the audience. The way that more and more movies only uses the sounds of the surroundings and the natural sound effects and keeps it quiet around, that brings a more authentic touch and a deeper presence throughout. The haunting is taking place whenever, wherever and with whomever. The police is coming at night and as in other horror movie and motions pictures overall, the events and incidents suddenly stops. Here... oh no... it keeps on. The family of the Warrens is haunted at the same time as the new case comes in place; the first spiritual experience in the Warrens residence is of a nun. The police says minutes before to Peggy that the priest of the church is a friend and that the priest will call the Hodgsons. The religion and church blends together and is used as a line of argument. Wonderful! The production team has made an excellent research and at the same time a nod to the horror movies of the 70's. Where the then modern design were natural, the production team takes the same thing and push it a notch in modern daylight to give this movie a splendid design. They uses for example a girl with the 70's haircut and clothing (as is natural, of course) and puts some of the classical camera production in place just as it was in the 70's. There is some small camera movement representing the movement of the human body that is just... oh, it is so legislative and enhancing! This and a knowingly and consciously work to make the camera slidings and movements accommodative! All through this named topics; genius!We may have one of the few sequels that beats the original one here. Yes.... actually, we may have that.To come bock to the beginning of this review; oh, yes... there is some hefty signs and traces from Poltergeist. The TV starts to go crazy and.... MY HOUSE! There is also some nods to the production behind Poltergeist; in one scene in Poltergeist the chairs around the kitchen table is behind the scenes put up in a very fast way from one moment to another, all in one take. In Conjuring 2... also...all in one take; a chair is set in one place... the camera is rolling and the girl is acting...zooming out, the chair has been moved. A whole room is shut down because it was there the activity were more than demonic.... and there is the line of argument from Poltergeist. "The Babadook" has taken its toll on the crew here... suddenly a presence is coming alive from a toy and children's song; as taken straight out of The Babadook. The classical of Warlock has maybe been been seen; what is the name of the demon....? It even rains and has an relationship to a book, just as in Warlock. I really appreciate the way the whole team behind this movie has gone through and in depth of "old horror movies" and taken some small things, some small bits and pieces here and there and made them their own. Clap, clap! (yes, pun intended to the Conjuring)There is so many little story lines, incidents and events throughout that I could write for hours. An enormous twist that is within the spiritual world; Bill is himself haunted by an evil presence, making "him" do the things "he" do to the family. Later on, suddenly there is proof that the girl is faking it all; an hoax. Enjoy the Elvis impersonation, the crew taking documentations and the love between the Warrens, as Mrs. Warren is scared to death (pun intended) of losing her husband.......Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Art direction, set decoration, cinematography and production design is top notch. I was enjoying... nay, I was feasting on the astonishment of this motion picture. "Somebody get an ambulance!!!" is a excellent way of going from let us say chapter 1 to chapter 2. The frozen picture, the terror in the mothers scream and the echoing is accentuating this whole process, just as in a saga. Chapter 1 is finished. Off to Chapter 2. And then chapter 3 goes off with the lyrics of "I started a joke"; spot on! - The actors : Solid, good and realistic. Vera Farmigas scream in the beginning of the film is horror chilling and icing to the bone. The little girl (Madison Wolfe) is shaking and stirring things up here; I could feel her horror! Academy Award in the future! - The story : A house that is haunted. A well known and used story. And.... they make is work...oh, they make it work. - Entertainment : Chilled. Horrified. Scared. - Age : 15... or even 18 due to the depth of religious and spiritual level in which the evil is presented.8,2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to a actual good horror movie for quite some time now and here comes "The Conjuring 2". Which is actually an effective horror movie. It isn't one of the most horrifying movie I have seen but it's is executed quite well. James Wan who has been directing horror movie after horror movie has got his formula down now. Plus for a horror movie the budget this time around is quite high for a horror movies. Thanks the success of the previous "The Conjuring" movie. Three things that make this movie work is the imagery and how they utilize the set pieces and environments to build tension. It really brings out the horror mainly because of the creepy imagery. The second, is how it goes in a quite clever direction and execution when it comes to the twist and turns. It actually makes the audiences try to think and guess certain scenarios. And the revelations was done in a quite smart manner. The third is the acting, even the child actors managed to pull it off. Which is a key factor when it comes to a movie such as this. I am a bit numb to horror movies as this stage, but there were few parts where I was actually a bit tense. Some of the audiences reactions were just priceless. The guy next to me had his whole face covered and was sliding down on his chair while saying "this is too scary". Usually when it comes to horror sequels it's usually not as good as the original...But good job James Wan. The evil entity I couldn't help but think of Marilyn Manson. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marginally better than the predecessor but really good and presents some real good quality horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequels often carry a burden of expectations/benchmark set by their earlier movies. The Conjuring was executed amazingly well even with the standard scary stuff and The Conjuring 2 stuck to the story flow approach of its predecessor but yet bringing in the novelty in terms of brand new location and a sub-plot. This franchisee is definitely beating Insidious hands down. Story (8/10): Based on a real life incident in late 70s - a family of single- mother and four kids in North London is terrorized to hell by a supposed ghost, often possessing one of the daughters. Warrens are called all the way from US to take a look at that and report back to the church. Their search encounters series of events that eventually discover the genesis of the Hodgson family's nightmare. The climax is particularly well written with enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seats. Horror (6/10): I found the horror element comparatively less in this one compared to The Conjuring. Partly also because some of the scenes were too predictive as we not just seen them in the first movie but other horror movies as well. However, it doesn't seem to be a mistake as much as it seems a deliberate attempt to stick to what worked in the first part and focus more on the story telling. It is the same dilemma that super hero movies face - whether they want to focus on out-of-the-world action sequences or focus on a compelling story. Acting (9/10): Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga have given stellar performances here. Particularly, Patrick has made himself more noticeable in this one. Frances O'Connor (as the single mother) and Madison Wolfe (her daughter) had the most challenging roles which they executed very well. The expressions of agony, fear, anger, disgust have been nailed to perfection and is particularly remarkable. Direction (8/10): James Wan has stuck pretty much to what worked in the first movie. The direction is good overall. The scenes have been conceptualized well. Especially, the climax has been directed extremely well with some unpredictable sequences. The movie could have been a bit shorter as the first half of the movie is a bit of a drag. Overall (8/10): The Conjuring 2 did just marginally well compared to its predecessor. However, it would be a bit unfair to keep comparing it with the first part. Independently, the movie is really good and presents some real good quality horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding horror film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director James Wan has once again provided audiences with a brilliant work of the macabre and supernatural. From the writing to the directing to the acting and cinematography, Conjuring 2 is on par with, if not better than the first. Sometimes the best stories are true ones. And, although elements of the story have to be fictionalized in order to construct a cinematic narrative, grounding the Conjuring movies in the real work of Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga) infuses a dynamic emotional response that directly impacts the increased frightening nature of these films. One of the observations that I appreciate most about, not only this but the predecessor, is not relying upon the jump-scare to curdle the blood. Are jump scares part of the movie? Well, of course! What fun would a horror film be without the entire theatre gasping for breath, jumping, or screaming together??? But Wan goes beyond the jump scare and channels his inner Hitchcock to build suspense and intrigue. The horror film is best appreciated in a group setting. It is a genre that specifically engages the audience on a visceral level. Wan is truly a master at his craft; and I love witnessing how he continues to prove his ability to develop creative horror films.Following the increasing trend for a film, including but not limited to horror, to begin with an elaborate prologue, Conjuring 2 starts with a fantastic moving shot of the famous eyelet windows of the 112 Ocean Avenue house in Amityville. Often filmed from the outside, this shot sequence takes place inside the attic. A much more intimate feel, this was an excellent choice for establishing the case that launched Ed and Lorraine Warren into the public eye. There have been numerous movies and documentaries based on the arguably most infamous haunting in the United States, so it was not necessary for Wan to spend too much time on it. It is, however, a very important scene because the plot/case of Conjuring 2 is directly related to the experience that the Warrens went through during the Lutz investigation. Beyond the establishing a connection between the Amityville and Enfield cases, beginning with the Warrens in the middle of the 112 Ocean Avenue investigation allows for Wan to visually show how and why the Warrens would seek a self-imposed sabbatical from supernatural and demonic investigations. Moreover, this sequence of events that provides copious amounts of plot development material are also instrumental in significant contributions to character development. Although this prologue lasts less than ten minutes, it contains prolific information vital to the plot of Conjuring 2.It should not be of surprise that Wan uses the camera very strategically to tell this visually driven story. From the rule of thirds to lighting to creative use of angles and movement, the camera is instrumental in setting the macabre mood of the film. One of the visual storytelling elements that Hitchcock was most known for, especially in Psycho, is using the camera's placement and angle to foreshadow something or someone. Wan takes a page from the Hitchcock handbook and utilizes the camera movement in such a way that you are predisposed to feeling certain that something or someone is about to appear or emerge from the shadows but your game is thrown off when that doesn't happen?but then totally happens when you least expect it! Throughout the diegesis, you will encounter moment when the characters are faced with inner demons that parallel or symbolize the actual evil entities in the film. Having this subplot concurrent to the foreground aids in creating and maintaining an emotional connection to the characters. Shocking the audience both emotionally and physically. By eliciting dynamic and comprehensive responses to the horror on screen, the film becomes an immersive experience?that is the brilliance behind this dark and sinister tale.Beyond the exceptional direction by Wan, part of what makes the Conjuring franchise so successful is the exquisite casting. Patrick Wilson (Insidious) and Vera Farmiga (Bates Motel) are perfectly cast in these films. From what I have read about the real Ed and Lorraine Warren, Wilson and Farmiga respectively stay true to the real-life people they are portraying while adding in the necessary acting skills necessary to increase the impact and believability of the film. The quality of the acting that Wilson and Farmiga bring to the film is outstanding. Sometimes, a horror film can have an compelling plot but the actors are so uninteresting that it prohibits the story from making the impression that it should. Wilson and Farming make the characters of Ed and Lorraine Warren interesting to watch and add a performance quality to the film that keeps your attention the whole time. The degree to which they add a sincere care for the victims of hauntings to their respective characters is refreshing and will stay with yowling after the movie closes. As the Warrens are reoccurring characters in the Conjuring franchise, it is vitally important that they are as interesting to watch as the plot itself since their cases are the inspiration for the whole franchise, at least put to this point.If there is one negative element in the film, it is the weak showdown. Not weak in that it was anticlimactic or uninteresting, but that it felt a little rushed. At 2hrs and 15mins, the film is longer than the average horror film, so it was not necessary to rush the climax of the film. It certainly does not mitigate the experience of the movie, but I feel that it could have been a little more intense. That being said, if you are looking for an excellent movie to kickoff your weekend, then this one is it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerhouse of a Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Powerhouse of a filmThe Conjuring 2 definitely outdid its predecessor in all categories - storytelling, character development, and scare factor.James Wan's "The Conjuring 2", a follow up to his own "The Conjuring" (2013) is one hell of a movie. I'm posting this review an entire day after I saw it, and it has been in the back of my mind ever since. The story of the film grows in the back of your mind and gives a haunting presence. Although immediately after you will know you just witnessed a feat in filmmaking, and you will be biting your nails with a pounding heart during the film, it is not until hours later after it has had time to grow in your mind that you will realize the true horror and master of this film. James Wan succeeded here where he failed in "Insidious: Chapter 2" (2013), and that's is in telling a story. The film opens with a short but terrifying re-telling of The Amityville Horror. It's an important prequel to the Enfield Poltergeist, the center of this second film. I'm not sure exactly how long it was, but it seemed like a good chunk of the film passed before the Warrens even came onto the scene of North London. We are privy to the creepy happenings in the Hogdson home. It is very scary. We see more haunted toys, knocking on doors and Exorcist-esque bed shaking. Each terrifying scene is separated by a scene or two that allow the dust to settle but never allow for peace. There are a few lighthearted moments but it never distracts you from the fact that this is a horror movie. In fact, they enhance the fact by adding an element of irony and reality. This is a true story; that fact becomes ever scarier each hour after you exit the theater. Never have I seen a horror movie that so excellently tells a true story, scares the audience, and mixes atmospheric fear and horror genre clichés without bogging it down in annoying jump scares (Insidious: Chapter 2). This is a great horror film; this is a great film. Too often we have to separate the two, horror and film. It's either a scary movie and terrible movie or a good story and not scary at all. This is the rare exception, it scares us and intrigues us. The fear of the unknown glues us to the screen and the suspense never lets go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holy shi't, James Wan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Are you trying to give me a heart attack?You want to talk scary? THIS is scary. 2013, Wan came out with another horror movie, called The Conjuring. It didn't take long before it got hailed as one of the best new horror movies. And I couldn't help but agree. I hadn't found a movie so scary in a long time.Then I today went to the theaters to see the sequel. I was hopeful, despite the common once-is-enough rule when it comes to horror movies. But I gotta say, this movie was fantastic. I loved it even more than the first one! First off, if there's anything Wan knows how to do, it's an opening scene. If you're not invested from the start, it's a little harder to get into a movie meant to be frightening. But he succeeds with exactly that, and I feel exhausted before the title scroll even has shown up. The story when you think about it, is pretty similar to the first, but with the big difference that not only the family with the haunted house in the danger. Ed and Lorraine themselves are too! And I have to give credit for how their characters were developed in this movie. The movie delves very deep into the personalities of them, with Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga doing an extraordinary job making them likable. They are well-written not only as two people really passionate about their unusual profession, but as a loving and caring couple as well. The scenes where they show their affection for each other are superb.But of course, I'm mainly here to talk about whether or not it was effective as a horror movie. And it sure as hell was. Jumpscares or not, when you think about it... Doesn't Crooked Man just scare the s'hit out of you? And doesn't it feel disturbingly surreal when a girl suddenly gets the palest face and starts smiling evilly, all while speaking with a rusty old man's voice? And doesn't it make you uneasy when something simply supposed to be a painting comes to life?The Conjuring 2 is more than just the half-creepy/half-amusing horror movie you watch and then forget about. It's an experience. One that makes you speechless with wonder.9.5, the rating is only knocked down by a few cheesy moments and (very intermittent) parts of off pacing. I recommend it to anyone desperate for a revival in the genre. Because real horror... is finally back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of horror movies, but kinda sceptic about how good another movie about "paranormal activities" would be, I was also afraid that it would be disappointing. James Wan made sure, that it was not.Will this movie scare you?: yes, it will. But not every minute. There is lots of build up to those "really" scary moments.Is there anything to hate about this movie?: yes, there is. As many times before, the term "based on an real event", is simply not true. The background story has been generously altered in order to make a loop from Amityvlle to Enfield. Should this bother you? Not if you are looking for a great movie, instead of an honest documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie, I enjoyed this, and director James Wan (Insidious, Saw, Dead Silence) is becoming one of my favorite directors, not just in mainstream horror movies, but mainstream directors in general. I love how this film isn't just cheap jump scares, like many of today horror films. It actually builds up the tension. I thought the first Conjuring was great, and this is a good example of how to do a horror movie, and how a sequel can actually be better than the 1st in my opinion. I actually saw this movie with my dad, and he fell asleep. But, I thought it was more than entertaining, and worth staying awake. Even though I thought the crooked man ( a.k.a. James Wan auditioning for slender man) didn't need to be in the film, and this film could have been trimmed down 20 minutes. Also, the acting by Vera Farmiga (Orphan) and Patrick Wilson (Watchmen), works well, and the two work well together. Patrick Wilson's acting, wardrobe, character development, and 70's sideburns almost had me thinking it really was 1977 lol. In addition, great movie, future horror filmmakers take some notes, great film. This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you for reading, and i hope you have an amazing day as always. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. This movie is a great scare movie! You hardly get to witness a second horror movie that is as good as the first movie if not better. I gave it a ten because of the scare factor and that the characters in the movie set the atmosphere that guided us down a road less followed. It's one thing to sit and conjure up strange noises and knocks and pings throughout the night and then account them as being paranormal but as soon as you get serious about what you are doing knowing all too well that what comes through could without a doubt kill you, it's then the word paranormal becomes a welcome mat compared to the actual being that is in the room with you. With that said, don't be too critical because you will come out of this experience in the movie as just a movie and nothing else. Sit back, relax while you can and savor that moment because as soon as you dive into the movie, you will be scared and you will have images burned into your mind. Don't be surprised if you get home and begin to leave the lights on because this movie is that frightful!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whoever says that this sequel is not as good as the first film is LYING. It is so common for the sequels to be far worse than the originals that it has become a habit to the viewers to judge them without even noticing them. NOT this time! Conjuring 2 is not just "not worse than the first". It is precisely as good as the first.Great story, great acting, smart dialogues, smart jump scares, dark atmosphere. Everything you need in a horror film. I liked the fact that the movie makes you care for the protagonists. Also, I loved the way it keeps you interested all the way throughout it. Never bored, never relaxed, always on guard. The quality of the movie is A+. James Wan's magic wand has done its miracle once more. The trap of relying on the first movie's success has been avoided and that is because of Wan's love and dedication to his work. It's about time that we become less harsh on good horror films and stop judging them for being what they are. They are horror films and we should judge them as that exactly. If i wanted to watch "The Godfather" or "Citizen Cane" I wouldn't be watching a horror film. STOP COMPARING HORROR FILMS WITH DRAMAS. On the other hand, even with this type of judgment, this movie deserves a 9/10 BECAUSE IT'S A DAMN GOOD MOVIE. Congratulations James Wan! You've done it again!</fullReview>

Coming towards the main subject matter, the movie is completely different from the first installment. Reason: It is filled with excessive terror. You just cant relax a single moment while watching it. It makes you anticipate for the future.The actors did an incredible job, Hats Off to you both, Patrick and Vera for portraying the Warrens so flawlessly. As mentioned earlier the movie is really frightening. You can just feel it happening under your skin. What i liked the most was the background effects and music composition. They did render pretty descent Computer Generated Images.Not for a single moment did I get bored or found the story lagging.Watch it guys, its really great.P.S- Movies such as The Shining, The Exorcist etc. are not to be compared while watching " The Conjuring 2"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Team, That was the most horror film of the year 2016 till date.The film was more a strong chemistry between Loraine and Ed Warren. I must say that Patrick Wilson once again wins over the show with his splendid performance. Besides, Peggy was also good in body language. I just could not get the point how Ed at the seeing the cross of reels in the bus got the sense that the spirit in that house was inhuman ?? And what was the reason of listening to the two audio reels ? The adventurous thing was the performance of small kid Janet that really shocked in some scenes. The film, however, was not more horror than its prequel but it was a treat to watch due to excellent performances of all cast most especially Ed and Loraine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror genre lived up to its name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am pleasantly surprised by the current rating of the movie. I honestly believe it is worth it. Personally, I gave it a 10, because I want to encourage other studios to scrutinize and study this film, in order to prevent themselves from making unworthy movies.The plot itself is not the most original piece out there, but it features great atmosphere, a couple of laughs here and there, an unexpected exorcism and a haunting (literally) presence.I am a fan of the horror genre. It has been quite disappointing to see studios being utterly insensitive to change and to always toy around with the same concept: a remote house with a dark past and a family tortured by an entity.What I like in Conjuring is that seemingly third-person actors become the protagonists. It is not only about the family's suffering anymore. They are represented as the saviors, spreading their glimmer of hope. The second installment did not fail my expectations. Several jump scares and a fey presence which you can carry with you in your memory. A few movies have managed to accomplish that, especially to a fan of the genre, like myself. To date, it was the Grudge, the Ring, Drag me to Hell's gypsy woman and Dead Silence's Mary Shaw. I do admit, however, that the resemblance of the ghost to Marilyn Manson was uncanny. That is not to say that the ghost does not remain scary. Its portrayal is complemented with an assertive look, symmetrically outlined from the nun's outfit. For those who have watched the movie, they will know that I am currently misusing the "ghost" word, but I do not wish to spoil anything.Additionally, I really liked the addition of a twist; it did not ruin the pace of the plot nor did it bring any confusion. Rather, it was a twist that motivated certain actions. I will use one word to explain this, again, primarily directed to the ones who have watched it: pawn.One thing I disliked was two scenes with CGI, the exorcism and the Crooked Man. The crooked man was an unnecessary addition - it would have been better if the actual entity was used instead. Plus, the artistic look was quite poor and I could occasionally discern motion capture exaggerations - this might probably come from the fact that I develop video games and have thus been exposed to lots of CGI, animations, and special effects.Overall, an enjoyable horror film and with a worthy placement in my list of recommendations. I do wish the same entity is reused somehow in upcoming installments - it appeared too powerful to be cast away like that. Plus, it was very well made, so it would be a waste if it does not get recycled at some point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There was a crooked man and he walked a crooked mile...."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Wan is the best horror director working today. The man knows the genre so well that he can easily manipulate the atmosphere to terrorize the viewer. Such a masterful sense of control that he can easily control your fear. With this sequel, Wan has created 3 very successful and engaging horror series. Paranormal Investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren are called to England to investigate whether or not the Enfield family are plagued by deadly spirits or if the family is lying and the whole thing is a hoax. We as the viewer know the truth, we are with this family when the strange occurrences start happening. Yet Wan cleverly depicts such things in a shroud of mystery when the Warren's arrive to make them question if what is happening is real or not. Should they leave thinking it's fake, the terror we feel for the family will be even greater. I believe The Conjuring to be one of the best horror films of the last decade and it's a hard act to follow. Wan tries to up the ante here with the sequel, the scares are more frequent, the demons/ghosts more creepy and the tension is tighter. I still believe the original to be slightly better because it was fresh and the atmosphere was simply brilliant, but Wan does marvellous things with the sequel. Look to any other horror film and the artistic merit fails by comparison. Wan doesn't need blood and guts or even cheap jump scares to make the viewer scared. He simply builds tension, plays with our expectations and uses creative camera techniques to make the film memorable. One particular scene that stands out in my mind is when Ed first interviews Janet, the little girl who is the focus of the terror. The demon/ghost will not communicate unless they look away, so Ed turns his back to Janet. Wan focuses the camera on Ed, while Janet is out of focus in the background. It's one static shot where the out of focus character slowly and eerily changes into the demon/ghost. We never get a good luck at the thing, but we can see enough to know something is eerily off. Effectively creepy with the simplest camera technique. What other horror director would do something like that today? Highly recommended for the horror fan and people who really adore the original. Wan has stepped out of the horror genre and has had success (Fast Seven), but he loves the genre too much to abandon it. The man knows how to direct a horror film and he directs this one extremely well. My one complaint is that the film is long. Clocking in well over 2 hours, it feels like it at times. I'd say to maybe take out one of the scares, but I love each one. Add to the fact that most of the effects are practical and it makes me appreciate the film even more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2 was a really good sequel to the first film. All the way throughout the film there were a lot of jump scares which made me on the edge of my seat for the entire film. The characters were very interesting and it was good that they had chosen a different case location for the film so that it wasn't just more happening to the family that was in the first film. The only thing that I thought wasn't good with the second film was that I thought one of the monsters used was quite childish and made them parts of the film not scary as much. I didn't think that they needed to add the character to the film as the plot already had enough going on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I'm a huge fan of the first film, reading about it in Empire and seeing the trailers, I felt the need to see it. I saw it at my local cinema last night and my first word for it is "Wow!!"The story was powerful with plenty of investment in the characters. It literally kept me hooked through out start to finish. The structure worked brilliantly for the scares and dramatic moments. There was plenty of focus on both. (Spoiler alert) I did notice that Wan has used an idea or two from Insidious, with Lorraine entering the void to communicate with the dead in her visions. But yet, it still worksAt some points, it literally made my spine shiver. The scares were very effective. Although (a spoiler coming, be warned) the image of The Crooked Man, I thought, looked a bit silly. But it doesn't ruin the film.The acting was fantastic, especially from Madison Wolfe who played Janet. I really hope her career progresses. And of course, the acting was brilliant from everyone else.Now for the cinematography and lighting, they were just amazing. They were an added bonus on making the film work even more. My favourite angle in particular was in the scene involving Ed, talking to the spirit of Bill Wilkins. The camera does not leave them and it focuses on Ed with the spirit in the background, which is blurred, with very little detail. I'de have to say, that was one of the best camera techniques I've seen on film.So overall, the film was absolutely incredible. James Wan, Carey and Chad Hayes, I give the devil/rock on horns to you guys. Horror fans, you're in for an incredible treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE CONJURING 2': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2013 blockbuster supernatural 'fright flick', once again directed by James Wan (who also helmed the original 'SAW', 'INSIDIOUS' 1 &amp; 2 and 'FURIOUS 7'). It was written by Carey and Chad Hayes (who also wrote the original film), as well as Wan and David Leslie Johnson. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson reprise the leading roles, as paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren. This time they're investigating an aggressive poltergeist, that's haunting a London family (in 1977). The script is once again (said to be) based on a true story. The film also costars Frances O'Connor, Madison Wolfe, Franka Potente and Simon McBurney. It's received good reviews from critics (once again), and it's also another hit at the Box Office (the first movie made over $300 million, on a $20 million budget). I found it to be a more than decent follow-up.The movie begins with Ed and Lorraine Warren (Wilson and Farmiga) investigating the Amityville murders (in 1974), to see if a demonic presence was really responsible for the horrendous slayings. While experiencing a vision of the crimes, Lorraine foresees Ed's murder (by a tragic impaling). The story then flashes forward 3 years, to London; where a single mother (O'Connor), and her four children, are being terrorized by a supernatural presence. Ed and Lorraine are called to investigate the haunting, but Lorraine is extremely concerned about Ed's safety.The movie is once again outstandingly crafted, by Wan. It's got great atmosphere, it's disturbingly creepy, and the 'jump scares' are really well done. The story is (once again) intriguing, scary and filled with good character development. It's a little slow-paced, at first, but the film makes up for it in the second half. There's not really much to complain about, but (still) I didn't find it quite as memorable as the original movie.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/cnnfZjVyQIc</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few better horror movies out there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequels usually breaks down a movie franchise. It's easy to see examples of terrible sequels especially in the years of previous films. And horror movies are no exception, making an impressive horror movie is hard enough. But making a sequel to it is almost committing movie suicide. The Conjuring was good and a lot of people really seemed they enjoyed it. However The Conjuring 2 was spectacular, not only did it had impressive cinematography that captures the absolute tone of a dark and an evil atmosphere. But also it had great camera works and angles that shows both disturbing background and close up images and visuals. The plot in this horror movie is nearly as the same as its predecessor. Haunted house that haunts a family, Warrens comes in to save the day. The movie does have its fair share of clichés here and there however the way that this movie was executed really gave its terror. We get to see a lot of character development in this film, adding in more layers of characterization to both previous and new characters. You get to see the relationship between Ed and Loraine Warren grow as people get doubts about their profession. The family that's being oppressed (The Hodgsons) gets a good backstory and the film does a good job of showing that backstory to the audience. This film also focuses on the public eye and skepticism as well. There were claims that the actual haunting of Enfield was just a hoax in order to have a public attention and director James Wan decided to use this element to drive his movie forward. Showing the realistic reactions how the public would react. The build up and the tension pacing was just right for the film as some scenes had unpredictable jump scares. The movie does another great job of cutting off Loraine's ability of clairvoyance as it was quite helpful in the previous movie. In this movie, she is much more vulnerable to the demonic presence in the house. Exposition and the history of the haunted house really gives you the chills and it adds on to the already high staked tone of the movie. The acting was quite phenomenal, the Hodgson does an amazing job being terrified and scared. The main child actress really steals the show as she delivers an amazing performance of being both possessed and un-possessed. It's truly incredible to see her deal with this possession while being a kid. Since you'd probably get more emotion of a kid being possessed rather than an adult. The soundtrack in this film is the same as the first movie, no soundtrack seems out of place and is given at necessary points in the film, while also using it sparingly throughout the film. Final Verdict: I will give this movie an 8.0/10 This movie was an upgraded version of The Conjuring. With such skill in the horror genre James Wan delivers one of the chilling horror film of all time. I recommend this movie to anyone. A definitely a "must see film".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Amityville to Enfield we shall go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not a huge fan of the first film, I thought it was an okay haunted house type story, but I was glad it had the success it did as it garnered an R rating and went on to have a lot of success pulling in over 100 million on a rather small by today's standards budget. My hope was that this would kind of give Hollywood executives the hint that we like our horror to be R and not the PG-13 horror light that fills the theaters these days. This one too is R, and it had a rather sizable opening weekend so I am hoping this one will do a lot of money and show it to them again, because sometimes you got to beat something into a person's head before they get it. I actually liked this one more than the first film too, as I thought it was a bit more graphic than the first film which I thought honestly could have been a PG-13 rated horror film like so many others. This one was well acted and I liked the setting to it more than the last film as it was something different. Sure, most of us know the real story is not as dark and creepy as the movie, but I really do not go into these 'based on a true story' movies thinking I am going to get an accurate retelling of the actual events. If it did that, films that were based on true events would probably put most of us to sleep.The story starts out in Amityville and details some work the Warrens did in the old house that we have seen in its own series of films. From there we are introduced to a family in England. A mother, whose father has ditched them live in a very run down looking house. There are four children, two girls and two boys. Things begin to happen within the house with the youngest girl seemingly sleep walking and strange noises occurring. Soon, things begin moving around and an old man appears within the house wanting the family to leave. Lorraine Warren, meanwhile, keeps having visions of a demonic nun who seems to be foretelling the death of her husband. She wants to take a break from their investigations, but they are soon pulled into the Enfield haunting and must find out what is behind the girl's strange behavior and the secret of the old man in the house before it is too late! So this film, to me, was an improvement over the first Conjuring film. From what I have read, this one was written with an R rating in mind while the first they were trying for PG-13, so this one did have more of an edge to it. I also enjoyed the opening scene in the Amityville house as I was not expecting it to be featured. Granted, I am sure most people already knew, but I kind of do not watch television or read anything about films I am going to see to be as surprised as possible. The acting was good, the atmosphere was good and it had some creepy moments. My only problem was that it did run a bit long for a horror film. I thought ten or fifteen minutes could have easily been taken out of this one and not taken away from the story.So, yes, this film to me was pretty good. I had to see this one in theaters so that it could make as much money as possible so that maybe Hollywood would wake up and realize horror films should be rated R and that the 13 to 16 year old demographic unable to attend a horror film is not going to doom it to failure as many of them will just go with their parents anyways. Unfortunately, they probably still will not get it as another horror film coming up this year called Lights Out is rated PG-13. Looks promising, but it will most likely not have the edge this film did. This film did not kill numerous people and had no sex, it just had a creepy edge to it that made the film R. It also is a throwback to the days when they had decent actors and actresses in horror films and not just super models and buff dudes being stupid. So, I say give this one a go as not only are you end for a creepy good time, you will also be helping this film do well which will hopefully lead to more R rated horror films!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>4.8/5. James Wan has crafted the greatest horror film I've ever seen and solidified himself as the new age master of horror. I've never screamed out loud in sheer surprise/fear before but I did watching today. Imagine the best elements of The Exorcist, Poltergeist, The Amityville Horror, Insidious, and The conjuring, and you have this new age classic. The camera work in this is absolutely astonishing and evokes pure tension throughout. The atmosphere and lighting is executed perfectly. The plot has several different aspects intertwining into a fantastic story overall. The soundtrack is stunningly terrifying. The demonic entities are the most frightening I've ever seen. Seriously if you are a fan of horror or just film in general you must see this. I truly hope this franchise has several more movies because both films are amazing.

		<shortDescription>Spectacular Horror Movie for All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The performances in this movie, especially from Madison Wolfe who plays Janet, are some of the best I've seen from a horror movie in a while. James Wan returns with his signature style to produce a movie that will please both film lovers and modern horror audiences that judge merit by how many times they jumped. While it does follow many of the tropes of the horror genre, it manages to arrange them in such a way that doesn't feel boring and it manages to keep you on your toes. I was discouraged at first when I saw the run time at more than 2 hours, but I left the theater extremely pleased. If you haven't already seen this movie, then I strongly recommend going as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The horror movie of 2016 to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all honesty, I do not know where to begin with 'The Conjuring 2'. For people within the audience that has been following my reviews. You may be aware of myself not being a major fan of present-day horror movies, although I am desperately seeing most horror flicks that come out because I genuinely love the genre. I have been waiting patiently for a horror movie to truly frighten me and make me uncomfortable. With this title, I have finally found that. 'The Conjuring 2' was terrifying and near perfection at the same time. I even was brought to a point where a horror sequence almost made me want to walk out of the theater because I was so uncomfortable and uneasy with the events occurring on screen, Now do not forget, with that being said, it simply means that this was a horror film done right. There were multiple moments, still shots, and sequences that I feel will go down as iconic parts of horror movie history. James Wan will equally become a household name among horror movie fans as he is only continuing to push out impressive horror flicks time after time. 'The Conjuring 2' blew away the original to me and I am confident in saying that this could be THE horror movie of 2016, competitors being 'Don't Breathe' (Evil Dead remake team) and 'Lights Out' (Also directed by James Wan). If you want true terror and fast-paced horror, this is the movie to see. Again, in my opinion, this is the horror movie of 2016.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding horror movie that is unrelentingly terrifying with some very clever surprises, but it also had a lot of heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2 benefited greatly from strong supporting characters to outline an outstanding paranormal story. James Wan has delivered very effective shock scares and surprises that typically do not show up as heavily in other horror movies. The family, including Ed and Lorraine, are put into an eerie environment while not letting clichés take hold of their decisions. They supported one another, cared for each other, and didn't make dumb decisions that would put themselves in unnecessary harm's way. This element made the movie very enjoyable and absorbing.Now, with that said, the scares were much more effective. The tension of likable characters being in danger helped make the jump-shock moments feel more "well-earned" rather than "cheap". Most of these moments came as a surprise, which I thought was almost impossible at this point, but James Wan continues to surprise me with his genius camera tricks and clever twists on where the typical jump scare would be. In addition, the atmosphere set up was very realistic, making the effect on you even more intense.If you like horror movies even a little bit, you will LOVE this movie. The intense scares are so worth it given the superior acting and themes represented among them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conjuring 2 - Cinema Buffs Review by Nathan Fischer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I went to go see this film, I watched the first Conjuring for the second time since 2013. I remember enjoying it, but upon viewing it a second time it came across as one of the most effective horror movies of recent memory. Now we have the sequel with James Wan returning to direct. This movie takes place after the events of the first film and also after Lorraine and Ed Warrens case in Amityville. The movie takes the same structure as the first. It dives directly in to the horror with an unrelated (or is it?) paranormal case. Then we meet the main family, their struggles with some sort of demonic entity, and Ed and Lorraine come in to help the situation. Although it is the same structure as the last movie, this is a completely different family, story, and location. And it is truly terrifying. The setting is New England. We meet a family of a single mother with four children. Very soon, eerie things begin to happen in the house. It starts at night but quickly starts to happening all the time. The entity has taken a liking to the middle child, a little girl played fantastically by actress Madison Wolfe. It is to be said that all the acting is top notch. There is even a little boy that has a speech impediment, which I thought could go south pretty quickly, but sure enough it is handled with respect and realism. It also focus' on the undeniable love and connection between Lorraine and Ed Warren which we didn't get too much of in the first. Like the first movie, this film is relentless with its terror. There are very few down times and when there are, they are short lived. I find James Won to be the horror master of a new generation. He is smart with his directing. He takes old tropes and gags and blatantly avoids them on screen until he finally gets you with genuine scares. He takes his time and uses the camera like an extension of his mind. I think a lot of this is because of how few cuts there are. The camera follows along, looking in one room then turning down a hallway to look in another. He often leaves his characters small in frame so the audience can look around the screen to catch any subtleties. In one scene, Ed Warren turns his back on the little girl so he can talk to the demon inside her. We see Ed in the foreground, completely in focus, and the little girl behind him, so blurry she is almost indistinguishable. But as the demon begins to speak, the little girl's blurry figure seems to be transforming as the conversation continues. It is horrifying but subtle. She is still very out of focus, so its makes it seem like our eyes are doing it, not the movie. I know I'm gushing, but the movie is not perfect. There are some odd moments of special effects that took me out of the moment. They were cool, but didn't seem to fit. It seemed like James Won was trying to have fun with something different and it just didn't match the overall tone of the film. Also, this movie seemed less grounded in reality then the first. I know sequels are prone to go bigger, and although it worked for this, it just didn't strike to the core of me like the first one did. Regardless, The Conjuring 2 is very scary and has heart to boot. I love seeing great horror in the theater. When it's well done and truly effective, you hear an audience worth of screams followed by and audience worth of laughter. It's just a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly and uncommonly solid sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I rate movies, I consider 3 main points. The plot, the acting, and the direction.I went to the movie theater without any big expectations because let's face it, horror movies these days tend to be very predictable and dull, let alone a sequel. But to be honest, the conjuring surprised me in many aspects. Let's break it down to the following :1- The plot. The plot was okay, it wasn't very good or very bad. I mean the story was based on a true events, so there is nothing much to add. I give the plot 5/10.2- The acting. Oh boy! the acting was absolutely amazing. Patrick Wilson &amp; Vera Farmiga were excellent as usual, you can feel the harmony between them. The children in this movie were awesome, especially the girl that is possessed, I am pretty sure that this movie will open a lot of doors and opportunities for the young girl (Madison Wolfe). I give the acting 8/10.3- The direction. The Conjuring is directed by James Wan who directed many popular horror movies such as Saw, Insidious: Chapter 3 and many more. He absolutely killed it, James wan really kept me on the edge of my seat, and he took this movie to a whole different level. Excellent. I give the Direction 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of thrillers and horror movies. It's been quite some time since I last saw a horror movie like this one. It was a delight to watch this one! I am a sucker for true stories and seeing that this one originated from parts of a real story, was all I needed! The movie had all the necessary elements and classical standards of horror movies. Jump scares, visual effects, sudden noises, atmosphere, the works! The cast was amazing and the acting in all levels was amazing. I really like the children that were all up to the task. The depiction of the era and the costumes and everything were really high quality. I watched this in a cinema and despite all those stupid teenagers that laugh for no reason, it managed to captivate me and have me at the edge of my seat. I can recall more than ten times when I was really scared which was the first time after so many lousy movies that try to scare you with stupid effects. This movie has atmosphere, it is nicely crafted and it's really worth your time! If your girlfriend is kind of scared easily, don't take her with, better go with some friends instead. And choose times when the movie theater will be a bit empty, so that you really have the silence to get into the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conjuring 2 (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three years after he blew the doors off cinemas across the country with one of the biggest modern horror movies, The Conjuring, James Wan comes back with a true sequel to The Conjuring, aptly titled The Conjuring 2. Often, horror sequels try to get too big or too flashy and end up being far inferior to their predecessors. The Conjuring 2 is certainly bigger and flashier, but James Wan has some gift for taking a generic storyline and making it scary as hell. The Conjuring 2 takes place six years after the original film in Enfield, London. It's based on the Enfield Haunting, one of the most well-documented paranormal cases of all time and was labeled "England's Amityville." In this haunting the Hodgson family, a single mother and her four children, are being tormented by a spirit and call on several paranormal investigators to help them, including Ed and Lorraine Warren. The case quickly turns into a media circus with allegations that the haunting may be a hoax, and the Warrens have to decide if the kids are playing an elaborate prank or if the Hodgsons are living in a very real nightmare. Being a horror sequel, or really just a movie sequel in general, it's expected that this movie is going to up the stakes and flashy imagery compared to the original film. The Conjuring 2 is no different. There really isn't a scene that's as brilliant as the hide-and-clap game with Lili Taylor from the first Conjuring. However, at a staggering 134 minutes, James Wan packs in a ton of surprisingly durable scares. After a great opening sequence, Wan gives us about 5 minutes to get acquainted with the Hodgsons before already scaring us silly with the first night at the Enfield house. There's tons of agonizingly long tracking shots that ratchet up the tension for an incredibly long time. What's great is that not all of these shots end with a jump scare. Be warned though because if there is a jump scare, it's perfect. There's not a single cheap jump in this movie. The "scare scenes" themselves are very long; once one of those great tracking shots is done, you'll go to another person for an equally scary scene. Because there's so much suspense and so many scares in the movie, the 134 minute running time never feels too long. It feels just right, although the scares might be exhausting by the end of the movie. Wan also has a knack for making an old scare new again. He can somehow make a tired jump scare scary again, but at the same time, it's not quite as fresh as it was the first time. That's what holds back The Conjuring 2 from surpassing the original film. The Conjuring 2 does have some heart though. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are great as the married ghostbusters, and the Hodgson family is a likable group of people to hang out with for two and half hours. Madison Wolfe steals the show as Janet, who gets put through the wringer throughout the whole movie. Even if it doesn't reach the heights of its predecessor, The Conjuring 2 is an incredibly scary thrill ride that'll be hard to top this summer. I do have to admit that I did scream very loudly once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as scary as its predecessor. Still, it's much better than most horror sequels.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2 is based on another true story from the case files of paranormal investigators, Ed Warren(Patrick Wilson) &amp; Lorraine Warren(Vera Farmiga). This time around, Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren travel to London for their new case. Once there, the Hodgson family tells them, that their house is being terrorized by malevolent spirits. Now, it is up to Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren to stop this haunting, at any cost. The Conjuring 2 is a good film. However, when you compare this movie to The Conjuring(2013), it just doesn't match up to it. The first film, had some brilliantly executed jump scares &amp; genuinely unnerving scenes. This movie, has some great jump scares too but, they are few &amp; far between. One thing that this movie has going for it that The Conjuring(2013) didn't, is an element of suspense. Director James Wan introduces certain subplots, that he ties together very well with the main story, in the climax of the film. A note on the performances. Patrick Wilson is outstanding as Ed Warren. Vera Farmiga is spectacular as Lorraine Warren. Madison Wolfe is mind blowing as Janet Hodgson. Wolfe at such a young age, portrays a variety of emotions, effortlessly. Frances O'Conner is brilliant as Peggy Hodgson. Lauren Esposito is great as Margaret Hodgson. Benjamin Haigh is superb as Billy Hodgson. Patrick McAuley is awesome as Johnny Hodgson. Simon McBurney is impressive as Maurice Grosse. Maria Doyle Kennedy, Simon Delaney &amp; Franka Potente are effective as, Peggy Nottingham, Vic Nottingham &amp; Anita Gregory, respectively. Bob Adrian &amp; Bonnie Aarons are fantastic as, Bill Wilkins &amp; Demon Nun, respectively. Sterling Jerins is good as Judy Warren. All in all, The Conjuring 2 is a well made film. I just wish it scared me more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense and frightening experience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unbelievably scary movie! At the cinema, it had the entire audience jump and scream the entire duration of the movie! It was scarier and more intense than the first movie. The Conjuring 2 had a wonderful and talented cast. The acting was very convincing and it was superb. If you enjoy horror films, I guarantee you will enjoy this movie. You will not regret it! To think this was based on a true story disturbs me and terrifies me. It's one of the scariest movies I have seen in such a long time. In all honesty, if I could rate this flick more than 10 stars, I would without a doubt. Every time there was s scary scene, it gave me chills. Confession: On the night I went to see this movie, I ended up sleeping with the lights on, because I'm such a big baby. If you ever want to see a great horror flick, I recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something you should look out for and must watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movies on its own justifies itself to be made by one and only James Wan. If you are a casual watcher, it starts a little slow in first half making you think otherwise but as soon as second half begins, you will realize that all the efforts in first half were necessary and makes sense more.That being said, once story unfolds of &#x202a;#&#x200e;Amityville_of_London&#x202c; you can not stop but bite your nails off and hope for the best for the Ed and Lorraine Warren.So I would conclude my review for &#x202a;#&#x200e;TheConjuring2&#x202c; by saying that you should watch it for its story and direction as the horror part is not that horror as you would expect. Meaning you can sleep later in night peacefully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly dislike profanity ... but OMFG! WOW! Now that is how you make a horror movie. James Wan is a master of modern horror, tapping into truly nightmarish scares that only exist in the old classics. This movie it a horror masterpiece, with 2 simultaneous stories attempting to link up, with terrifying visuals, great acting and a very good script, C2 easily surpass the original which was in itself a great film. I won't lie, i had my doubts because horror now a days is technically dead, good horror anyways, especially if its a a sequel. But man was i surprised. The last time i felt truly scared watching a film ... and i mean true fear was with the Exorcist. The Conjuring 1 was excellent and had scenes that scared me, but TC2 in its enterity is terrifying. Do not watch it alone, and be prepared to look at nuns in a whole new way ... Horror at its best. A true movie going cinematic fun experience. Final Grade,A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even better than the first. Fantastic sequel that has Lorraine and Ed's storyline a lot more interconnected throughout the film. They consistently show a very tight knit couple that is heavily engaged in their work against evil. Same main cast is back but in a new scary story in a new country!!! The film also delves more deeply into very interesting lessons about understanding Good and Evil. Characters deliver excellent performances that are balanced between skepticism and belief about the supernatural. Lorraine and Ed play great emotional scenes that run the gamut. The movie feels very authentic for its time period so that you really feel like it is occurring during the 1970s. Well-paced scares that supply consistent twinges of fear along with moments of utter shock. It is a dark world that keeps you thoroughly enthralled, wanting to see what happens to these characters, and how in the world they will be able to resolve the demonic problem at hand. Filmmakers pay particular attention to inserting small but important cues that neatly tie the entire movie together. Would totally recommend and cannot wait for Conjuring 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, James Wan left this die-hard horror movie fan smiling and satisfied. Everything from the interactions between the characters to the sweeping, long takes has been improved since the first film's release in 2013.This is a film that does not rely on predictable jump-scares to get and keep your attention. However, the dark atmosphere of the haunted home, set in the beautiful (and period correct) 1970's England, will keep you on the edge of your seat as your eyes dart around the screen, searching every dark corner of the decrepit waste of a home for some kind of potential evil. This is where the camera work of this film shines. The long takes are beautifully done. They are slow enough to build tension and paranoia but not too fast that you will miss a monster standing in a dark corner as the camera is focused on an actor.I took two stars away from a perfect 10/10 score for two reasons: number one... the first hour of the movie provides quite a bit of foreshadowing for the second half, which, once you finish the film, can be excused. I feel like it dragged on for a bit, and could have been done in a more timely manner. Not a big deal. Number two... the CGI of a particular monster (which shall not be named) was sub-par at best, even if it only got a couple of minutes of screen time. It detracted from the atmosphere that James Wan had built, though not enough to break the feeling of dread.Taking everything into account, this is an excellent film that any fan of the horror genre should see. It will leave you with chills throughout multiple scenes and the overall atmosphere will make you feel uneasy and paranoid. There were several scenes in particular that made me push myself into the chair, trying to subconsciously get away from the screen as much possible.8/10 Cooper L.W.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific and terrifying horror sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was greatly impressed with this horror sequel, nothing entertained and frightened me this much in a long time. As far as sequels go, especially horror sequels, this movie is beyond comparison. There are some very minor flaws of special effects but these take nothing away from the terror and the great story of the Warrens' next adventure.Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga return as Ed and Lorraine Warren and are more comfortable in their roles as the paranormal investigators. The story begins with a short recounting of their most famous case, the Amityville house. This sets up the spooky demonic nun that has graced the trailers for the last few weeks. This nun is freaky and will haunt my nightmares for the next few nights. The Warrens have garnered some respect for their work but also have to face more skeptics. Lorraine as has to deal with premonitions of her husband's death. It takes a while but eventually the couple is summoned to London for a new mission. James Wan does a terrific job with the camera work showing just enough to have viewers squirming in their seats before the boom and jump scares. He ratchets up the tension and tells a story that does justice to the original and true story this event was based on. The dark hallways and the flooded basement are a perfect setting for the hauntings. I hope that Wan returns to the horror genre after Aquaman because he has the formula down and has developed a great talent for this type of filmmaking.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eerie, and still strong with the utter intensity!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The long awaited sequel ( At least for me ) has finally come as we're presented with a sequel for one of the bigger, more effect modern horrors over the years, The Conjuring 2. This movie is an overall headstrong sequel I'd say, unlike other sequels this one keeps its intensity, and overall chills cranked up through the roof, just like the first one. The atmosphere in this movie is eerie, and overly bone chilling. You get shots of which are so dark, along with the soundtrack being so quiet to where us, the audience are sitting in complete and utter unsettlement as we are set within such a white-knuckle tension zone over most of the movie. The film sets an amazing tone for creepiness, keeping the movie mostly dark-like, and eerie, of which deeply succeeds when it comes to the breakdown of the demon / ghost appearances. The overall soundtrack of the film, as well when it comes down to such actions also adds onto the overall film effect that it has going for it. Overall the film is like the first one when it comes to succeeding complete, and utter creepiness, and overall eye candy tension. Something some horror films try, but miss the mark on, leading to this factor being as the first film, a pleasant surprise. For the acting in this film, again, of which you'll hear be said a lot in this review; Like the first film, the acting was well played out. The kids in this film did a quite believable with portraying their emotions, mostly for this film either serious, scared, or upset. This movie also does a flawless job for making the audience feel for this family. The audience overall watches as this family goes through the struggle of getting people to overall believe they're truly being haunted, and overall provoked. At the same time they're battling a war between them, the truth, and the media. So overall the film does an amazing job for having us, the audience truly feel emotion for this family, and only want the absolute best for them in the end. Ed, and Lorraine from the first film, as well have some new, and unique character unleashes in this sequel as well. They both have a somewhat deeper side to them shown in this film, their true care for what they do, and their overall emphasis, and even love for each other are perfectly shown, and executed without being TOO much in depth to it. We also see some new, pretty exciting - like characters enter the sequel as well, overall great actors, and amazing twist of deep, inner-character ties along with it all as well, coming out as flawless, and another outstanding surprise! Now for the good stuff. The demons / demon in this film is absolutely creepy. This film did an amazing job with it I would say all the way. The film throws the demon in hidden places throughout camera shots, making it insanely creepy for those who spot it. And when blatantly seen, even then this demon comes off as truly frightening, and just flat out creepy. And yet another succeeding, and outstanding tie-in this film brought to the table was the fact that demon actually came within different forms. Something to understand, along with everything else here, you'd have to see the movie to figure out. Overall. This sequel was one hell of a watch. You have great story, well executed actors, creepy, unsettling, and flat out eerie tone, and atmosphere, whether it be the soundtrack, happenings in the film itself, or the demon appearances itself, the film overall comes off in the sense of it all being nightmarish. This was an outstanding sequel, and definitely didn't miss the mark. If you enjoyed the first film, your expectations shall not be disappointed in the Conjuring 2. See it all to believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Conjuring 2" review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Wan is back to direct a second tale depicting paranormal researchers/ghost hunters Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren. But is it as scary as "The Conjuring"? Synopsis: In the 1970's Ed and Lorraine travel to England to investigate a haunting which locals refer to as London's Amityville. The Good: For the first hour, "The Conjuring 2" does almost everything right. Even though director James Wan essentially uses the same horror buildup's, which lead to the same jump-scares and thus the same cranked up to 11 horror musical cues, that he always does; he does it all so well many may argue that Wan has created his own official horror style; a style which holds the highest rate of effectiveness in the genre. It's as though with every movie he's teaching a master-class in cookie-cutter horror direction, but does it better and more effectively than anyone working today. The Bad: Little by little, there emerges this love story aspect between Ed and Lorraine. This love story is pushed along by some of the worst dialogue I've heard outside of a Harlequin romance. As this aspect moves to the forefront of the story, it becomes more cringe-inducing, reaching the point where every time Ed and Lorraine pause, turn and tell each other something unbearably lovey dovey, I couldn't help but imagine that the latter half of "The Conjuring 2" would essentially be the movie Nicholas Sparks would make if he tried his hand at the horror film genre. Along with said love story, there also emerged another questionable aspect which stops this film dead in its tracks time and time again. "The Conjuring 2" becomes a religious film; or at least contains a very religious undertone. I understand that movies dealing with hauntings and exorcisms go hand in hand with priest and bible verses, but this is different. I would almost liken the religious undertones this film takes on to movies like "Do You Believe?", "Fireproof" or "Courageous"; films which seem like dramatic genre pieces, but end up morphing into Sunday School lessons. This aspect isn't a bad thing, on face value. But much like the love story aspect, wholesome religious rhetoric seems way out of place in a film of this nature. That said, there will be many who will be able to look past the sappiness and the Sunday School level preaching. But even if that's the case, screenwriter Carey Hayes has one more surprise in store for those who reach the 2 hour mark; an ending which in its own right is idiotically simplistic, but whose explanation is so convoluted that as it begins, I looked down at the time and recoiled in horror at how long I'd been sitting there. Final Thought: Do you remember "Insidious: Chapter 2"? I don't and (looking back on my article) I gave it a positive review. That's what "The Conjuring 2" is. Even if you enjoy this overlong British version of its predecessor (just with more religious asides and a painfully sappy Hallmark inspired love story crowbarred in) at the end of the day it'll still be a forgettable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful love story within a horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We loved it! Rarely is a sequel better than the original and The Conjuring 2 definitely delivers. We were on the edge of our seats for most of the film. I liked that the film wasn't one sided. It gave room for skepticism. The Warrens weren't there to convince anyone of the paranormal but to help the family. This is definitely the first horror film I ever cried at, not from fear (though there was plenty of that), but from the undeniable love between the Warrens. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson have great chemistry.Another first was after that breathe-taking climax of an ending the audience in my theater gave a round of applause. I've never seen that happen during a horror film.I can see The Conjuring franchise continuing for years to come when they're this well directed, produced and acted. I know I'd love to see more about the Warren's cases. Especially the Amityville case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review here;) I am a frequent cinema goer and have to admit that I always hunt for genuine horror movies. I've seen it all. Let me put it this way,I don't get scared easily. This is the first movie that made me scream out loud in a cinema, and the person next to me had the same reaction. I guess you have to go and see it for yourself ! Editing is amazing, acting is at its finest and story-line is genuine. There is no dull moment in the whole movie and the scares and jumps are not cheesy and predictable. Some of them you would expect from a ghost movie, but this tops it. Some elements can be found in other movies, but the way this was edited makes a difference. Not to mention the fact that this story is based on actual events, that's the most exciting part. Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I did!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must have dozed off a couple of times while the movie was on, I remember waking up with every jump scare. And then going back to sleep.What a terrible movie this is. It's not scary, at all. I can't believe people actually pay money to watch this in theaters.This is a perfect example of what I call "scary movie for kids"It is a movie for kids no more than 8 years old. After that age, kids have already figured out which are the real scary movies. Old and new.Wanna know how an 8 year old kid knows this is a kids movie ? Because the basic characters in the movie are 6 year old kids. Hahaha.Furthermore on this rather boring and uninspiring 2 hours of my life, I have very little to add, except the fact that someone out there is pouring water into the horror movie glass of red wine. All the time.Watching this film felt exactly like watching Bambi or any other kid's cartoons. It felt like I was watching a movie for kids. Boring, adds absolutely nothing to the genre, a Disneyland ride on fake horror films.Yes this is a fake horror film. Empty inside, terrible story and a see through ending. ("creepy" is the moon to the creators)Great Spoilers coming your way :The Conjuring 3 will feature 2 year old kids having a go in their diapers and the nanny will save them from the evil that makes them go in their diapers. Conjuring 4 will be the same but this time the 2 year old kids will be pissing in the diapers and the mother of the nanny will save them from the haunted house.Maybe then we will start doing hand paintings and get a gold star from the movie theater owner.Retitled : MAMA &amp; PAPA SCARY MOVIE 2 (The Great Beyawn)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is nothing even resembling a horror movie here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all let me start with this simple premise: Nothing ever written or said by the Warren is true. They are one of the most famous scam artists in the whole paranormal investigating field. It is been widely known that their involvement in the Amytiville case was prefabricated with the help of the Lutz family in order to cash in from the original DeFeo murders. Once you take that out of the equation the claims of this movie being "a true story" leaves us with a regular movie without anything specialOne good thing i can say is that it is beautifully done, the photography is great, the color palette, camera movements, editing, it is pretty well made. So the fault is not one of technical aspects but more of a lack of substance and extremely painful cheesy moments. Acting is regular, they do their best but no one stands out, Vera Farmiga is good but her character has nothing special nor it conveys anything that draws you in. The little girl does her best but you can tell at any moment she's acting and it doesn't convince you in any way. Finally beware of the Elvis Presley scene, it will make you cringe in horror of the awfulness of that part, it is like you're watching a Steven Spielberg kid horror movie. Stay away from this children "horror" movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is over-hyped and a lot of money is spent to get good business but this is not scary and provide jumps in 2-3 scenes only. Although if you want to get frightened, just recall the face of nun during sleep.Although many says it is scariest than first installment! here is void in this sentence. The conjuring was able to frighten me on home video. WhileI watched it in theater where the technology is far better.I recommend a Bollywood movie, which I watched in theater named as horror story. It was so good that they took only 5 minutes for story building and after that you feel serious trauma until it ends.It is the most scariest till date.</fullReview>

James wan has been making a new hope for horror movie and its fans around the globe. For me, his work of making horror movie is always worthy to be wait. But it will be hard to make the third part (sequel) for more higher expectations, lets see what a shock surprised it will be.The movie intense in Ed relationship and their work. and yes, the movie give me surprised every scene of it.

		<shortDescription>Conjuring double feature - opening night theater experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wanted to share the Conjuring's opening night theater experience...Conjuring 1 at 5PM was good even with plot holes big enough for a casket. I screamed once and did the dead frog electrode thing a number of times. I understand it was the highest grossing horror movie ever at well over $300M. Hard to figure when it was just me and one other guy at the theater. Fool 'em once, can't fool 'em twice I guess. They showed the double feature in one of their smaller theaters (#11). Conjuring 2 was to follow in #11 as well.Had some ginger snaps and small drink for part 1 (brought Ginger Snaps with me). Left at intermission to get something more to eat. Came back and was working my way back to #11 but an usher blocked my path and said the manager wanted to see me. (All this over Ginger Snaps???)Was told projector broke and part 2 was going to be in their "Premium Theater" where seats cost $19.95. Described it like an IMAX (they have one of those as well). Manager said to go back to #11 and pick up my stuff but I asked him if okay to get new. As they did not have Ginger Snaps, I settled for a small drink. Got to pick my seat off a selection screen. No charge for drink or upgrade to first class!Conjuring 2 was excellent. No one or nothing dies (including the dog which cannot be said for the dark "comedy" Lobster). Well written, good dialog, lots of slower parts for recovery then a scare again. Even lots of LOL humor. And the scary parts were well crafted. My back and knees are sore this morning. These were launch popcorn roof high scares. The audience loved it and applauded afterwards even staying for most of the credits. Great evening, especially with the never had happen before, first class upgrade! About time though, I've certainly accumulated the miles (and hours).Cheers to Good Movies Nights! Doug</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way too slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This takes place in 1978 and is based on a true story. Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga) fight a ghost in England that targets a family with a divorced mom and four children. It targets especially their 11 year old girl.The first movie was a good scary movie. It had its faults but it worked. This one doesn't. For starters it's too long. There's no reason for this film to run almost 2 and half hours. Plenty of sequences could have been trimmed or cut out completely. Secondly it has too many damn jump scares. They're annoying and force the audience to jump. Also it's VERY slow-moving. I got bored pretty quickly. Worst of all it just isn't scary. The attack scenes weren't even remotely scary. On the plus side it is well-acted and directed with accurate 1978 clothes and fads portrayed. Also the ending is great--violent and exciting but its too little too late. This has been getting raves from critics and viewers so I'm definitely in the minority here but I really didn't like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . Warner Bros. shows us in THE CONJURING 2, a "true story" from that era. Not a single unnatural death or serious injury results from "one of the most heavily documented cases of Paranormal Activity in Human History." Contrast that with Today's World. You go to a concert, and 88 people are shot dead with assault rifles. You go to a nightclub, and 49 people are shot dead with assault rifles. You send your kid off to elementary school, and 27 people are shot dead with assault rifles. You go to your office Christmas party, and 14 people are shot dead with assault rifles. You go to a movie, and 12 people are shot dead with assault rifles. You go to church, and 10 people are shot dead with assault guns. You watch the end of a marathon race, and 300 people are blown up with crock pots. Jets are being blasted out of the skies left and right, as trains and buses explode on the ground. Mosquitoes are out to kill your babies, and antibiotics no longer are able to kill deadly viruses. Warner is using THE CONJURING 2 as a means of urging Americans to elect a President who'll invest in Time Machine Infrastructure to let us all join the Warrens and Hodgsons in the serene and safe 1970s!</fullReview>

It's one of the few areas of "horror" movie lore that seems many customers go into the theater with the assumption that such things actually exist. I want to almost vomit every time I read the promo of such nonsense that says based on a true story.. a true story ??? Why, because some mentally disturbed person said it happened. No proof mind you. LOL Unbelievable!!!This entry was weaker than the first Conjuring. The old sudden loud music and sudden thump routine to get you to jump was needed as most of the scares were weaker. I'm sure though if it makes enough money there will be another sequel, and another after that. Until lazy Hollywood has sucked enough money out of it.Best horror movies these days are definitely not coming out of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie, but Insidious based</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Wan, as always, did an amazing job with this movie, but I feel like it was a little ripped off of Insidious. I am aware James Wan also directed Insidious, but I was a little disappointed that he didn't make this movie original. What I mean by this, is the fact that Lorraine goes into what looks like "the further" from Insidious. I understand having a style of directing, but taking the entire concept of another movie and putting it in a different one definitely bothered me. There were other things that reminded me of Insidious as well, such as the peripheral view of an entity sitting in a chair.I felt as though the Crooked man was random. I feel like he was only stuck in there so Ed had an item to put in his museum at the end of the movie, since Bill/The Nun wasn't ever connected to an item and was connected to Janet.There were parts that didn't lead anywhere in this movie as well. When Peggy was bitten in the basement, nothing happened to her. They also found Bill's missing teeth, but that was never brought up again either.These are the only negatives that I can find personally in this movie, but overall it was very well done. I have yet to give a negative review on something James Wan has done. I don't feel fair rating the scariness of it, because I am a person who is too into focusing on the plot to be scared of anything. So, coming from a thought-provoking standpoint, I enjoyed it very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Perfect but Quite Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll avoid dropping major spoilers and only specifically mention areas that I felt detracted from the film and that won't spoil anyone's experience by being mentioned.It's rare anymore that I find a well-made, enjoyable horror movie. Flicks like Paranormal Activity, It Follows, and anything directed by Rob Zombie have somehow become the acceptable standard for horror. Yawn. I didn't watch any trailers or read anything about the plot of The Conjuring 2 and I didn't expect much from it. I received free pre-screening passes so I went to see it.I found it to be quite entertaining and there is some creepy imagery. I won't elaborate so not to ruin anything for those not having seen it prior to reading this, but there are definitely some very interesting things visually and also a few that were quite unexpected. That's not to say there aren't moments of predictability and jump-scares, but for me the good far outweighed the bad, and there were even some humorous moments sprinkled throughout that worked quite well.After only one viewing I certainly can't give an extremely detailed report, but the few negative things that bugged me while watching this are: Throughout the film, everyone seems to sleep like the dead, and loud noises, voices, crashes, etc., mostly don't wake anyone, even while sleeping in the same room as the disturbance. This trend begins at the start of the movie and is continued throughout...and it repeatedly pulled me out of the whole experience. The basement in the Hodgson residence is partially flooded and no one seems to find it strange or problematic. At one point it's raining and water is rushing in down some sort of trough. The whole basement area seems very unnatural. I'm not familiar with British housing, especially of the 70s, so I kept wondering if this was for plot-convenience and to make it more creepy, or if it is historically accurate and normal. There are a few other areas I found to be problematic, but I'm avoiding major spoilers and it's rare that films don't have a few flaws anyway.Overall, I enjoyed it and I recommend checking it out. I'll be adding it to my horror collection once it arrives on blu-ray.</fullReview>

From creaking doors, possessed toys, demonic peekaboos, anti gravity shots to creepy 'grudge' kids running around, there was nothing new or interesting about it.And, knowing the name of a demon gives you control over it? C'mon! That was a retarded plot device and not to mention the demon being dressed as a nun for some unexplained reason.This genre needs some serious overhauling.

		<fullReview>If I were to rate this movie on the basis of its' scariness and watch ability, then I can happily give it around 7-8 as my vote. Unfortunately by the credits both at the beginning and end of the film the makers of it are trying to 'con' viewers into believing that the events in the movie are true:Not correct. The picture tries to suggest the story is based on true events occurring in London in the the 1970's know as the "Enfield Poltergeist". A child/children of a household claimed to be demonically possessed attracting widespread publicity. However in real life the evidence ultimately led to the conclusion that it was all a hoax. Any one can do a little research on the internet to discover the true events.If the film makers had produced a story exposing the lies of the hoaxers then they would have done a good job in film making and truth telling. But purely to sell tickets they have produced one big lie and totally fictionalized what really happened under the pretense that it is fact.Therefore I deduct 3 points from my vote and rate this movie:5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What james wan has done for horror films through his directions is that he has somewhat managed to bring the shock factor or rather the jump scares to good use,even though they have been played out since forever ,but that said ,however The conjuring was in absolute total contradiction of horror tactics altogether. The eerie setting and the background score and the fabulous performances made the move a glorious return of the horror genre with respect from both critics and viewers alike. That said,not only does the conjuring 2 looses it's phenomenal status as an anticipated squeal to the most celebrated horror film of the recent era but it brings clichéd horror tactics back to the screen once again leading to nothing but some very little scare.Mediocre jump scares,unnecessary CGI and okay performances brings the end to what could have been a glorified franchise.I am not disappointed on james wan direction,he does what he does best,the cinematography,the set design everything is apt but it just does not pan out as you want it to be.Another major disappointment for me was Joseph Bishara's rather dull background score. All in all,I had anticipated this movie for a real long time and the past week was the most difficult as I just knew this was going to be a bigger masterpiece unlike it's predecessor and I just could not wait to watch it but alas,it just was a dreadful experience. Absolutely disheartened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same Creepy Atmosphere but Ruined by another Derivative Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conjuring 2 is a mixed bag of a movie. It has some unquestionable scary scenes but it also has a ton of unnecessary jump scares where the volume goes from whisper quite to jet engine loud. I'm sure the average Joe or teenager will eat them up and proclaim the movie to be a horror classic, but to me it's not scares that makes a horror movie great. That being said, if you are someone that doesn't mind jump scares, you will most likely eat this movie up!A lot of the good ideas and moments from the first film are present here in the sequel, the likable Warrens, a standout scare scene (the painting scene), plenty of raising tension, and an eerie score. The problem, however, is that it's all dragged out over the course of two hours and ten minutes. That leaves plenty of time for boredom to set in and room for those less engaging moments (or should I say numerous, cheap jump scare scenes). It seems as though the executives or producers of the movie wanted Wan to through in as many scares as possible, ignoring pacing and runtime. Which leads to many scenes being unnecessarily long and plenty of throw away jump scares.Not only are some scare scenes tepid, but some are flat out cheesy. Anytime the girl is possessed and the evil, old man 'speaks' it's damn near laughable. Mostly because 'a man's voice coming out of a little girl' isn't anything new nor is it haunting. When all's said and done, The Conjuring 2 has the same eerie atmosphere from the first film that made it enjoyable, but also the generic storyline that plagued the first film. Amplify that story with an unbearable two hour plus runtime and you get, in my opinion, a failed sequel (even if it does have some scary scenes).</fullReview>

Too many nights that show scary Janet teleporting, and it gets boring. Again Ed and Lorraine not wanting to want to take cases, but they want to help a family. The crooked man mechanical toy is boring and is nothing like the one used in Conjuring. And, it is silly that the Nun demon tells Loraine her name, and the name power is already old and is used in many movies.All in all, skip this movie, wait for the DVD if you really want to watch it. People who have not watched Conjuring might like this movie.Why I did not like:1. Conjuring set the bar too high, I can still go back and enjoy the cupboard scene, someone behind the door scene, the game the ghost plays with the mother, and the final exorcism was brilliant. There was a story, a logic. This has nothing. Once out of the theater, everything can be easily forgotten.2. Too much hype created for the movie and most of the good scenes are already in the trailer. Why 3 stars?1. 2 scares (Old man near the TV and the bed sheet getting thrown off Janet did make me jump).2. Using the old man as a pawn was a good twist.3. This time, the ghost does everything is front of everyone. Thank god for that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't live up to the powerful original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually when you go to see a horror sequel it's the villain/monster that you're being treated to another viewing of. 'The Conjuring 2' is a rare exception where it is the protagonists who are the constant. Sadly, this equals less guarantee of quality, because it's unlikely that they are what made the first one great. 'The Conjuring' was a brilliant horror film. The intensity, story and thrills were all of the highest quality and the result was one of the finest horror films ever made. So the sequel had a lot to live up to. Could it do it? Not quite.The first thing you'll notice is an extended run time. 133 minutes is long for a horror movie. A lot of time is spent setting the mood, with a very patient build up taking place. For me this could have been cut back a bit, as it was a little slow at times and one or two scenes felt unnecessary. James Wan is a fantastic director who usually paces a film exquisitely, so I suspect this had more do with the script than anything else.The main thing it lacks that the original achieved so well though, is a genuine concern for the characters in the film. The spooky, middle of nowhere, atmosphere created in the original is nowhere to found here, and that takes away a lot of intensity from the film. The characters of 'Ed' and 'Lorraine' also feel too in charge this time around, and are portrayed more as heroes than regular people. This also goes a long way to destroying the level of discomfort the audience should be experiencing. There are some good frights here and there and some genuinely creepy visuals, but it all feels short of the high expectations the original created. And that sums it up in a lot of ways, it's not a bad film, it just can't live up to what we had all hoped for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Spoiler in Trailer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i think the best part (the shocking moment) on this movie is too much publication on Trailer. So, on the movie we not fell shocking again when the best part has show and not much part shocking and scary.Also this movie is not scary anymore for who believe God and believe Allah SWT. So, I'm Islam and i don't fell scary with this movie.i fell funny when someone on the story not believe about ghost and she make convince anyone from church to not believe Janet. and this is my reason why Conjuring 2 have just 1 Star from me.And next Conjuring have much homework to make scary everyone, don't who is he/she, what their religion, and where they come from.</fullReview>
