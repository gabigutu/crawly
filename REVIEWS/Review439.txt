		<shortDescription>Lady and the Tramp, before animation and at the start of talkies- one of the most wonderful films ever conceived and executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one Charlie Chaplin film to recommend, as others have pointed to in the past, City Lights is the one. Though Chaplin played his Tramp character superbly in other movies, like Modern Times and The Gold Rush, City Lights displays the Tramp at his funniest, his bravest, his most romantic, and his most sympathetic. It's tough for filmmakers in recent days to bring the audience so close emotionally with the characters, but it's pulled off. The film centers on three characters- the Tramp, the quintessential, funny homeless man who blends into the crowd, but gets caught in predicaments. He helps a drunken businessman (Myers, a fine performance in his own right) from suicide, and becomes his on and off again friend (that is, when it suits him and doesn't notice his 'friend's' state). The other person in the Tramp's life is the Blind Flower Girl (Virginia Cherrill, one of the most absorbing, beautiful, and key female performances in silent film), who are quite fond of each other despite the lack of total perception. The emotional centerpiece comes in obtaining rent and eye surgery money, which leads to a (how else can I put it) magical boxing match where it's basically a 180 from the brutality and viscerality of a match in say Raging Bull. Though there is no dialog, the film achieves a timelessness- it's essentially a tale of two loners who find each other, lose each other, and find each other again (the last scene, widely discussed by critics for decades, is moving if not tear-inducing). And it's never, ever boring- once you get along with the Tramp, you find the little things about him, the reaction shots, the little things he does after the usual big gag (look to the ballroom scene for examples of this, or when he gets a bottle of wine poured down his pants without the other guy noticing). Truth be told, if this film makes you indifferent, never watch Chaplin again. But if you give yourself to the film, you may find it's one of the most charming from the era, or perhaps any era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't go wrong with Charlie Chaplin, but City Lights is even better than Chaplin's films usually are.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chaplin takes himself a little more seriously in City Lights, and the results are spectacular. The musical score which Chaplin composed for the film was one of the many highlights, and even though Charlie's performance is much more dramatic than usual in some scenes, the hilarious comedy for which he is known and loved is still abundant. City Lights is so well made that it is one of the very few movies in which the obvious flaws can be gladly overlooked. Yes, you can clearly see the string holding Chaplin up in the sidesplittingly funny boxing scene, but who cares? That is such classic slapstick that little things like that really don't matter. Besides, let's keep in mind that this movie was made seventy years ago. Chaplin does a phenomenal job in his traditional role of the tramp, and develops a perfectly convincing romantic relationship with the blind flower girl on the sidewalk. His friendship with the drunken rich guy is hilarious, but it also makes a significant comment about the problems of alcohol. This is truly a great film, which should not be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing comedy sets up SPECTACULAR ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite Chaplin film, but I don't want that to diminish his other work, either. MODERN TIMES was an outstanding work of social satire, THE GOLD RUSH was great slapstick, and even the largely-neglected MONSIEUR VERDOUX strikes a certain unforgettable tone. Chaplin didn't make a bad movie, and I'm not even sure that CL is his best, exactly. But it IS my favorite, if only for the ending.That ending has been the subject of much comment here. I think it's a masterpiece in a single scene. Chaplin's little tramp has never seemed less like a character and more like a living, breathing human being. It's a monument to understated sentimentality.To me, the rest of the film exists largely to set the context for that one magnificent piece of celluloid. Yes, the boxing scene is great, and the scene where he rescues the millionaire is also wonderful, but it's that ending that makes us all love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin's Masterpiece...and Oh Those Last Five Minutes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me join the consensus and call Charlie Chaplin's "City Lights" a masterpiece. It's only 81 minutes long, but they are among the best 81 minutes you could spend at the movies, and the last five minutes are simply exquisite. Keep your Kleenex box at arm's length as I doubt if there has been a more honestly heartbreaking scene captured on film. When the formerly blind girl gives the Little Tramp a flower and ultimately says "Yes, I can see now", the scene takes on such emotional gravity as to defy explanation.Chaplin was at his zenith in 1928 when he started a journey of more than two years to develop and film this story, and the Little Tramp had already been a familiar character to audiences for over a decade. He had already made the classics "The Gold Rush" (1925) and "The Circus" (1928) starring his character, so it's obvious he felt a need to take a slightly different direction and deepen the character this time. The advent of talkies didn't stop Chaplin from making this "Comedy Romance in Pantomime" (as he subtitled it), as he knew giving the Little Tramp a voice would limit his appeal as a universal character. What I particularly enjoyed in this film is how the Little Tramp fancies himself as a well-mannered gentleman in spite of all the circumstances that bring him down, even going to prison for love. It is this self-delusion and his subsequent mistaken identity as a millionaire that leads him to the blind flower girl, played in an effectively plaintive manner by Virginia Cherrill. Her performance is a greatly underrated element in this film, as she displays the right amount of vacant innocence to make the last minutes so memorable. Simply compare her to the screen test shown of Georgia Hale, Chaplin's leading lady in "The Gold Rush" and an obviously more experienced actress than Cherrill, as Hale struggles to show the right balance between condescension and beatific revelation when she realizes the Little Tramp is the "wealthy" gentleman who paid for the restoration of her sight.Of course, this would not be a Chaplin film without the brilliance of his comedy routines and there is a treasure trove of classic scenes - the rising and lowering of the street elevator, the shifting musical chairs scene at the nightclub, the mock suicide at the canal and especially the boxing scene, which has been imitated by so many lesser filmmakers (and was according to the footage included as a DVD extra, inspired by an earlier Chaplin short "The Champion" from 1915). Even a simple moment, for example, when the Little Tramp mistakes a piece of thread from his vest for a ball of twine, is impressive for the sheer delicacy of the moment. And special mention needs to go to Chaplin's musical score, where he beautifully interweaves José Padilla's "La Violetta" as his love theme.The transfer to DVD is very good, and the 2-DVD set has plenty of extras though they vary in quality. The Serge Bromberg documentary provides an informative supplement to the film, and the footage of Chaplin from a Vienna press tour is fascinating since it captures the long-forgotten worldwide frenzy he created back then. The aforementioned Georgia Hale screen test is a worthwhile addition but runs on a bit too long. The 10-minute home movie of Chaplin's trip to Bali has a certain anthropological interest but seems rather pointless otherwise. Regardless, the movie itself is rewarding enough and an exquisite jewel that completely justifies Chaplin's reputation as one of the world's leading filmmakers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Blind Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CITY LIGHTS (United Artists, 1931), written, directed and starring Charlie Chaplin (1889- l977), is a silent comedy-drama released at the height of the sound era. Distributing a movie in the silent film tradition at the time when silents were considered a fad, Chaplin gambled with this production, and made it pay off. Although Chaplin hails THE GOLD RUSH (1925) as the one movie he would most want to be remembered, CITY LIGHTS nearly dims out his GOLD RUSH and at the same time, practically places his other silent masterpiece, THE CIRCUS (1928) to oblivion. CITY LIGHTS has stood the test of time, balancing perfectly a mixture of comedy and drama, but in Chaplin's case, pathos.Subtitled, "A comedy romance in pantomime," the story opens in the early morning where the mayor is dedicating a statue to the citizens of the city. After the unveiling, the crowd finds a little tramp (Charlie Chaplin) sleeping on the lap of one of the figures. As he tries to climb down, he encounters one problem after another. This opening scene alone is priceless. With such a great beginning, Chaplin adds in more comedic insertions blended into the plot. The theme to CITY LIGHTS is remembered mainly about a tramp's love for a blind girl. However, there is a subplot, involving the tramp's involvement with a millionaire drunk, which, by far, takes up more time than the sentimental love story. These two segments actually set the pattern. First segment, set in the afternoon, finds Charlie walking down the street, examining a nude statue in a shop, being annoyed by some newsboys making fun of his tattered clothing. He encounters a beautiful blonde girl (Virginia Cherrill) selling flowers. After she drops one of her flowers, Charlie notices her feeling about the sidewalk for it, thus, realizing she's blind. Smitten by her beauty, he picks it up and pays her for it. Minutes later, the slamming of a limousine door is heard, with the girl believing the kind gentleman, Charlie, to be a millionaire. Second segment, set at night, finds Charlie encountering a drunk (Harry Myers) trying to commit suicide by drowning himself. Just as Charlie is about to save him, he in turn falls into the river. The drunk, in gratitude for saving his life, takes Charlie under his wing to accompany him to various night clubs until dawn. By morning, the millionaire, now sober, fails to recognize or remember Charlie and orders orders his butler to escort this stranger out of his mansion. This running gag that's repeated in the story might play itself as repetitious, but Chaplin manages to breathe new life and funnier routines through his encounters with the drunk and their all night binges. By day, Charlie looks after the blind girl and worries when she's not at her usual corner selling flowers. Finding that she's ill and being cared by her grandmother (Florence Lee), whose behind with her rent and threatened with eviction, Charlie offers to help by obtaining and losing various jobs, ranging from street-cleaning to fighting in a boxing match. Reading in a newspaper of a European doctor who restores sight for the blind, Charlie gives the girl $1,000 for an operation, the money offered to him by the drunken millionaire, who, after sober, accuses Charlie of robbing him, has his arrested and serving jail time. The climatic finish is truly the best thing Chaplin has ever done and certainly one not to be missed.Featured in the supporting cast are Henry Bergman, Allan Garcia, Albert Austin, and Hank Mann. While much has been discussed about Chaplin's performance, his co-star, Virginia Cherrill, as the blind girl (no name given), should not go without mention. Even though her future film career consisted of forgettable programmers, and at one time being one of the future wives of film actor, Cary Grant, her performance is excellent by all means. Although it's been said that future film star Jean Harlow (1911-1937) appears as an unbilled extra in the night club sequence, she is visible in a surviving still photograph, but no such scene appears in the finished product. Unlike THE GOLD RUSH, CITY LIGHTS had limited showings in revival houses in later years, and was never allowed to be distributed to television. Being first introduced to CITY LIGHTS at New York City's revival movie house, The Regency Theater, formerly located on Broadway and 67th Street, in 1979, the memorable thing about this event are the roars of laughter from its theater packed audience. There was one man, probably a big fan reliving his childhood memories, whose laughter almost drowned out the underscoring of the film. No doubt he was having more fun watching this movie than anyone else. Watching CITY LIGHTS surrounded by an appreciative audience theater is one way to truly appreciate and experience the feel of silent film comedy, and to think back as to how the audience reacted in same back in 1931.After Chaplin's death in December of 1977, CITY LIGHTS, along with his other silent features, were not only resurrected for a new generation to endure, but became readily available on video cassette at the time of Chaplin's 100th birthday, 1989. In later years, CITY LIGHTS was frequently revived on various cable channels, ranging from Turner Network Television (TNT) in the early 1990s, American Movie Classics up to 2001, and finally Turner Classic Movies. The complete musical soundtrack that accompanies CITY LIGHTS happens to be the original score composed to perfection by Chaplin himself. Much has been written and said about CITY LIGHTS over the years. To learn more about the making, difficulties and long term preparations to CITY LIGHTS, either watch Kevin Blownlow's 1980 documentary, Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film, as narrated by James Mason, or Brownlow's other documentaries dedicated entirely to Chaplin's career, including outtakes to CITY LIGHTS as well as scenes involving Virginia Cherrill's temporary replacement, Georgia Hale, Chaplin's co-star in THE GOLD RUSH.

		<shortDescription>Classic Chaplin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City Lights is simply put one of the best movies out there. Every scene is classic and had a huge impact on the history of film-making. Chaplin's last 'silent' film tells the story of a poor little man the tramp played by Chaplin who falls in love with a blind flower girl. He becomes friends with a wealthy man who constantly tries to commit suicide. The man only recognizes the tramp character when he is drunk. To impress the flower girl the tramp uses the man's wealth to make her fall in love with him. The only problem is that when the man is sober he doesn't recognize the tramp anymore. On top of this the flower girl has to pay 22 dollars of rent or she will be thrown out of her apartment. Now the tramp desperately seeks for jobs in the city to help his love. Out of this simple plot great comedy and heart breaking moments come forth.The outcome of the movie is to almost all people known. It is regarded as one of the best endings ever taped on film. The movie itself still is masterpiece more than 70 years after it's release. I personally rate this as Chaplin's second best I have seen so far. My favorite remains The Gold Rush. Still this movie gets 5/5 stars from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin's Classic of Humor and Humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin's "City Lights" contains a blend of humor and humanity that make it memorable for everyone who watches it. Although made very much in the old-fashioned silent film tradition, much of it is timeless, too.After a few minutes of slapstick at the beginning, Charlie's "little tramp" character makes two acquaintances. He meets a blind girl selling flowers, who mistakes him for a rich man, and the two become very fond of each other. Then he meets a real millionaire, who is drunk, depressed, and about to commit suicide. In a comic scene, the tramp persuades the millionaire not to go through with it, making himself a devoted friend.The tramp soon learns that there is an operation that could give the girl her sight, and tries to think of some way he could help. His scenes with the girl and her grandmother are moving, while his determination to help lead him into some comic escapades - his attempt to win money in a boxing match being particularly funny, and one of Chaplin's best comic pieces. Meanwhile, when his millionaire friend is drunk, he dotes on the tramp, but when sober he forgets who the tramp is, leading to more amusing scenes and occasional trouble for Charlie.All of the comedy leads up to a finale that is one of the best-remembered scenes in any film. "City Lights" shows the power of the camera in the hands of a master, who without words can move his audience or make them laugh. Anyone who appreciates good cinema should see it at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic film made with love and precision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film has become a medium that is strongly influenced by nostalgia. Old films have become journeys to the past; ways to visit times and people that no longer are. Since film is an art that is based on the innovation of previous works, it has an element of nostalgia in its foundation. We look on the old to find what elements should make up the new. In City Lights, and other silent works of film, a passion emerges that is uniquely honest and sincere. While watching the film, I was impressed that Chaplin really did love the story, the sets, the crew; the whole project. While this may not have been the complete reality, it felt that way, and thus made the film more enjoyable. In silent films the audience is forced to be completely reliable on the visual elements of the film; there are no elaborate sound effects or dialogue to provoke an emotional response.Since film is at its very core a visual medium, I find silent films to be the basic form of the medium. I don't use the word basic here in a demeaning sense, but I compare the beauty of silent films to the beauty of early European art, before the concept of perspective was developed in the Renaissance. Many books and tomes featured people as tall as the castles they stood in; these works of art were not technologically advanced, but they were, and are, beautiful. The same example is found when comparing early darreographs of wild animals to contemporary photographs found in National Geographic. There is a warmth found in City Lights, and other Chaplin films (The Kid, Modern Times) that would be lost in the sea of cinematic technology that floods films today. Maybe it's just that with simplicity comes honesty, and honesty is perhaps the most powerful emotion that can cross through the screen and be felt by the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Chaplin''s Best &amp; Most Endearing Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always thought this was one of Charlie Chaplin's nicest, most under-appreciated silent movie gems. Then I discovered it really wasn't underrated; it's rated very high on most critics' lists. It may be that I usually hear about some of his other movies than I do this one.Part of the reason I think so highly of this is simply that I'm a sentimentalist and story in this film is a very touching one. It's a romance between Charlie's tramp character (no name) and a blind girl, who also had no name in this film. Virginia Cherill, who played the blind woman and had a wholesome, pretty face which I found very attractive.I'm not always a huge fan of pantomime except for some great comedians of the era like Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton, but Chaplin was so good at it and this is one of the last of dying breed as "talkies" were out in full force by 1931. Chaplin was at his best in silent movies, anyway, and his comedy routines are legendary. He gave me a lot of laughs in this film, as always, and I particularly laughed (I love slapstick) at the boxing scene. Kudos, too, to Harry Myers as the "eccentric millionaire."There's a lot of drama as well as humor in this 86-minute gem as the Tramp tries to aid a blind girl, raising money so she can get an operation to restore her sight.Comedy, romance, drama (with suffering) all combine to make this an extraordinary piece of entertainment. It's hard to believe this movie was not up for one, single Academy Award.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.For me, this film falls not into the category of favorite films (I'm a Marx brothers kind of guy) but earns instead a place on a very short list of most important movies.That's because it has two features that I truly appreciate.It is as pure a vision of its creator as is possible. Nearly all other films are engineered from prior work. Not so with a small list of projects from Welles, Kurosawa, Eisenstein, ... and this one project of Chaplin's. They are wholly original, springing from some nether world.But the other element is the one that impresses the most. This film is about itself, about the art of visual narrative. Chaplin was intelligent enough to know that what he was doing was new. The issues are centered on what the audience `sees,' so while he struggles with what and how the audience sees, he builds that into the fabric of the story.The primary framing is about the blind girl who falls in love with him by `seeing' him in her own way. Then `sees' him at the end in a different way. The rich man recognizes the tramp when drunk but does not when he is not. Nearly all the jokes, indeed every element of the film is about this same dynamic: the elevator which is not seen but then was, the burglars the same, the Tramp on the statue, on the barrel. Even seeing the cigar before the bum does. Even us seeing the soap and the foreman not.The `seeing' is carried over to `hearing' with the politician and whistle jokes. And then even further as Charlie turns his back on the new technology of giving us speech and instead `shows' us something else: he writes and conducts an amazing score instead. This is truly amazing (and one reason to take Mike Figgis seriously).No wonder Orson Welles considered this the most important film ever made. But as to the best to watch? Because film is so derivative, my own gold standard for the Tramp is Robert Downey's (and to some extent Depp's). Comic timing is something that evolves, and those men make a more effective Tramp for my modern ability to see.Trivia: Chaplin found the `blind' girl in a group of spectators at a fight and was struck with how her expressions reflected what she saw. She's pretty as well of course, but certainly not the prettiest Chaplin knew. See how Chaplin separately works in both the fight (a performance) and her reaction to his performance in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Zen-Like Little Tramp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Waddling along with his cane and derby hat, and that tiny mustache, the little tramp (Charles Chaplin) is visually unlike any character in film history. The tramp is kind-hearted, always dignified. He's a simple soul who in "City Lights" tries to help out a young blind woman (well played by Virginia Cherrill). This is a silent film, of course, but the tramp's body language is his speech.The really noticeable feature of the tramp character is how he blends into everyday life. He's more or less ignored by many, laughed at by others. The girl's grandmother never "sees" him at all. And only when the millionaire is drunk does he "see" the tramp as a friend. Curious ... and deep.The tramp gets into his fair share of trouble, but only through his bumbling efforts to help the girl. The boxing match is a hoot, and very well choreographed, as are all the skits. And what a beginning for a film, with city leaders spouting gibberish, probably as Chaplin's dig at the "talkies". Then the way Chaplin makes his grand entrance ... just terrific!Melancholy at times, the film's music really tugs at your heartstrings. Maybe it's sentimental and manipulative. But given the abiding and Zen-like qualities of the tramp, some sentimentality is quite appropriate. And the music is choreographed totally in sync with the plot action.Production design is sparse and at times drab. That the film was made during the Great Depression is beyond obvious.Comedy here is simple and effective. The main character expresses heart and humanity. The little tramp is an unforgettable character. And "City Lights" is a wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sublime Chaplin Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chaplin was a unique presence in the history of the early cinema. Coming up through the ranks, he gradually achieved a god-like stature, being awarded total control of every facet of the production.Not only was he often the sole person who knew what the end product was to be (as in "The Kid") but he was also allowed to elaborately improvise in the creative process. This often meant doing countless scores of retakes over days, weeks and even months; holding up the cast and crew for days while he brooded over just what to do next; and even (in the case of "The Gold Rush") cancelling expensive weeks of location shooting and returning to the studio to start all over again.He cleverly duped chief studio- and bank chiefs into somehow going along with his free-wheeling and gross inclinations, thus mesmerizing their conservative senses into supporting his hit-and-miss schemes and trial-and-error "madness."In other words, Chaplin used the entire productional company as merely as his paintbrush, with which he toyed at his pleasure to create his personal canvases. Fortunately, he was a genius, and at the right place in time to be allowed to get away with such unprecedented extravagence.It was a young and growing industry when Chaplin began emerging, and there were no set rules. People were still trying to figure out just what could be done with the medium -- and Chaplin helped to establish its early parameters.He was certainly and autocrat, yet that doesn't really matter when it comes to film works. It's the product that counts. In the case of "City Lights," all the blood-sweat-and-tears that it took to achieve the finished product was more than worth the effort. Now that all the frustration, anger, and outrage associated with the behind-the-scenes unfoldment of this highly troubled production are well in the past, what remains is a genuinely moving film classic.Sometimes great enterprises require considerable hardship to forge them into being. The greater the achievement, often the greater the challenge and period of endurance. Whatever the case, we are the appreciative recipients of this masterwork, which takes its place besides "Modern Times" and "The Gold Rush" as one of Chaplin's consummate expressions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... it's perhaps a test of a person's outlook to ask them what they see in the final scene. If they've never seen City Lights before and they instantly notice the major continuity issue (Chaplin holds a flower to his lapel from the rear shot, it's up to his mouth on his close up) then maybe they've placed film studies over romance.It took a few viewings before I spotted this, and once I did I can't help but notice it. Yet even despite this, I never fail to get choked up on the beauty of that final scene. If you want to impress the right kind of girl, put it on and show her what a sensitive soul you are during those final moments.As for the rest of the film, then while the final five minutes are classic and perhaps the best thing Chaplin ever did, the rest of it is episodic and patchy, necessitating my relatively low score. Still a fine film, but never a completely great one, what presages those beautiful final moments is merely fine entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The victory of the sound picture over the silent was a speedy and decisive one. The first full-length talkies were released in 1928. By 1929 theatres were being forced to convert to sound in order to stay in business. By 1930 silent film production by the major studios was completely discontinued and the medium became generally viewed as an anachronism. But in 1931 a new silent picture was released that, far from being an embarrassing failure, became the fourth-highest grossing picture of the year, being even more popular than such classics as the Bela Lugosi Dracula and The Public Enemy. The picture was City Lights and its producer, writer, director, editor, composer and star was Mr Charlie Chaplin.Chaplin was of course primarily a comedian, and his humour was of broad appeal, but audiences of the time were not exactly starved of easy comedy. The Marx Brothers were making great strides on the verbal quipping front, and the ever-popular Laurel and Hardy had made a successful transition to sound. What makes Charlie stand out, and what gave him a level of accessibility that allowed him to continue with his slapstick antics well into the sound era, is his equal devotion to story which allowed him a scope for social commentary, empathetic characterisation and deep poignancy. Of all Chaplin's silent pictures, City Lights is probably his least memorable in the funny stakes. The number of classic gags here is fairly small. Not since The Kid a decade earlier has Chaplin given story so much precedence. City Lights is riddled with coincidence and plot contrivance, but it's a tale of such beauty and sincerity that this does not matter. Within this story, the comedy becomes functional, often serving to puncture a schmaltzy moment before it becomes overdone. Ironically it is the occasional forays into slapstick that help keep City Lights real.As if to snub the talkie, City Lights is a remarkable achievement in complex visual narrative, even only occasionally relying upon title cards and then often only as an embellishment to the more comedy-driven moments. Most plot points and character traits are implied rather than stated, which gives the picture a continual smoothness ? another thing that would have gone down well with audiences glad to see the back of the intrusive title card. Out of necessity Chaplin's technical approach is more overt than his usual. He often cuts to a close-up to give us a necessary reaction, and there are even some whip-pans in the scene where he and the flower girl first meet, but all of this is in keeping with the rhythm and tone of the picture. Those whip pans after all reflect an abrupt emotional moment, and are in no way a blatant or showy manoeuvre.But what really makes City Lights work, what makes it connect, is the man himself on the screen. Those additional close-ups, once a rarity for a man who acted mainly with his body, now show off a capability for intense facial acting. An older, more meditative Chaplin may have been keeping the traditions of silent cinema alive, but his own career trajectory was entering new ground, where emotional expression was increasingly intimate and personal. The result is profoundly moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>City Lights Themes and Thoughtrs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City Lights is a different film from what I am used to seeing. I have not watched a Silent film or pantomime in a few years. I really enjoyed the story that Charles Chaplin helped to create and produce for our enjoyment. The plot seems to be commonly used now, with a boy falling in love and trying to win the girl's love in return. In City Lights, there are a few twists to the plot. The girl is blind and poor, the Tramp?Chaplin?is poor, in love, and wants to help the blind girl. The Millionaire can help the tramp out by giving him money, but he is an on-again, off-again friend depending on whether or not he is drunk.Being that this is a silent film, there is more importance on the use of props and the acting of the character. Since in a silent film they can't tell us how they are feeling, it is important that we can understand feelings through action. This may be through facial expressions, body language, dress, eye contact, kinds of touch, or the use of written statements, like title cards in a silent film. A prop that stood out to me was the use of flowers. From the flower girl selling her flowers, to how Chaplin was always holding or smelling one of the flowers from his special girl, the use of flowers helped show the emotions and feelings of the two characters. It symbolized the affection he had for her, because like the flowers she couldn't see, she couldn't see the true him or his true affections. Another prop that was used was money. From the millionaire's point of view, money was really of no matter. He threw a party just because he had been reunited with his friend, he went out to the dance club, and when Chaplin needed money in order to help the flower girl pay for rent and surgery he was willing to give him one thousand dollars. To the millionaire this money is nothing, but to Chaplin and the flower girl this is a showing forth of love and charity. When the movie was made in the 1930s, many people were poor and hopeless, but the portrayal of Chaplin as a poor but happy and hopeful man might have given hope to others who watched this movie during the Depression. In the film I noticed the use of a repetition, or rather a parallelism, as was read in the Film Art book dealing with The Wizard of Oz. They show shots one way in Kansas and then reverse the shot in Oz, as I saw in City Lights. In City Lights, parallelism is done with sight, not necessarily with eyes, but with the mind. We see the reverse where the poor blind girl "sees" Chaplin as a millionaire, and then at the end, she sees him as the tramp he is with her new eyesight. The true reverse is emphasized because she is now working in a shop and making money. The two characters are somehow always at perceived opposite ends of the social class spectrum, yet he still has a desire for her to be happy because of his love. Another reverse is the happy friendly drunk millionaire who sees Chaplin as his friend and hero for stopping him from committing suicide. However, when he is sober he wants nothing to do with him, throws him out and even has him arrested.In a way, this film is different then what our generation might be used to, but by watching these "classics" we can better learn where the movies we love today came from and gain a better appreciation for the art of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charlo at the top of his game.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin made some extremely funny shorts but of his longer films, this is one of the best, along with "The Gold Rush" and "Modern Times." Two stories are woven together. One is Charlie's on-again off-again friendship with a wealthy drunk. The guy has a case of multiple personality. When drunk he showers Charlie with friendship and gifts. When he's sober he doesn't recognize Charlie at all.The second story involves a pretty, blind flower girl who, given certain distances, angles, and lighting, resembles Uma Thurman. Charlie falls for her and accepts a thousand dollars from the drunken rich guy in order to pay for the operation that will refurbish her eyeballs.Charlie is accused of stealing the thousand bucks but when he appeals to the rich guy, he's sober and won't support Charlie's story. Charlie manages to get the money to the girl anyway but then is picked up by the police and spends some time in jail. When he emerges from the Crowbar Hotel, broke and bitter, he bumps into the now sighted girl and she recognizes him by his voice and the feel of his hands. The happy ending.There's sentimentality in the story of course. There often is in Chaplin's later films. But, as usual, it's somehow tempered. Here, it's undercut by irony.When Charlie meets the wealthy toff, the guy is about to kill himself because his wife left him. He ties a noose around his neck and a big rock to the other end of the rope. He's about to hurl himself and the rock into the river when Charlie intervenes, gives him a pep talk, and changes his mind. His spirit revived, the rich guy spread his arms to the sky, dropping the boulder that falls on Charlie's foot.And when Chaplin meets the blind flower girl, she's enthralled by his gentleness. Unseen by her, the smitten Charlie tip toes behind her to the nearby water fountain where she fills a pail. Her expression is dreamy and far away as the pail fills. Charlie is sitting on a bench next to the fountain, himself enraptured. Then she empties the pail by throwing the water in Charlie's face. Well, it's not the blind Mr. Muckle busting all the light bulbs in W. C. Fields' general store, but what is? A note. There have been some comic prize fights recorded on film, not counting the Dempsey-Tunney debacle, but I don't think any are as funny as the one Chaplin has choreographed here.It's hard to imagine the kind of talent that could pull off a story like this in a medium like this. Black and white, and silent. Applause, please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful set-pieces make the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As always the little tramp is fleeing the long arm of the law when he is mistaken for a wealthy man by a blind girl selling flowers by the roadside. While he longs to help her the tramp knows he cannot. However when he is at his lowest he stumbles upon a drunken man who he helps out who may be able to help him in turn ? if the two of them can sober up long enough.In response to seeing some modern trash posing as "comedies" recently (Little Man, Norbit, Pluto Nash ? I'm looking at you) I decided to check out some comedies that have stood the test of time ? a few Chaplin films being among them. City Lights is one of those film that you will think you have seen even when you have not. I knew I had never actually seen it but the wonderful opening scene on the statue and the scenario of the blind girl by the side of the road were very familiar to me and I was right into it from the start. As was often the case, this film has a thin narrative but one that allows for several scenarios for Chaplin to work his magic. And so he does with some classic sequences across the whole film.The statue scene is memorable for how he makes so much out of so little but the brilliant choreography of the boxing match had me rolling with laughter as it moved so beautifully and imaginatively around the ring. Chaplin is a master and this is just one of many films that shows it as he creates a great little clown that we care about but can also laugh at. His support do no more than that ? support him ? but yet they are also roundly good. Cherrill provides attractive heart despite her simple character, while Myers, Garcia, Mann and a few others do good physical work alongside Chaplin.City Lights is a really great film that is all the more impressive for still feeling fresh and funny more than seventy years after it was made. The simple narrative is the frame but it is the wonderful and frequent set-pieces that tickle and also stick in the mind. So tonight you might be looking at your film queue with lots of modern comedies but it is worth bumping this classic to the top of the list instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love's identities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released three years after talkies out-won the silent medium on a permanent basis, CITY LIGHTS was not only one of Chaplin's boldest productions but also probably the one of his that has gained him most acclaim. So much has been said about this touching 'comedy of pantomime' that I find it difficult to know where to begin; words almost seem irrelevant.As with virtually every single one of Chaplin's movies, the story of CITY LIGHTS is easy to summarize: the Tramp is in love with a blind flower girl who mistakes him for a millionaire. He is determined to get money for the poor girl's rent; he befriends an alcoholic millionaire, who is suicidal but friendly when drunk, cold and indifferent when sober. He is caught in a number of situations which, while difficult or even manipulating to him, appear side-splitting to us: he saves the millionaire from committing suicide; he is confronted with upper-class life; he tries his luck as a boxer.It is within these elements that the story evolves, making it possibly the most delicate, moving funny-film ever produced, period. I say "funny-film" because I believe that is the justifying word to describe this film as an entirety. Although sentiment is present in large parts throughout, the age-old criticism of Chaplin's "begging for pity" has never seemed more out of place. Noticed when the Tramp fell off a barrel while admiring the blind girl outside her window? The sentiment presented here is indeed overwhelming, and the gag that resulted from it is as old as the art of modern comedy itself. But when we combine these two situations together, one sentimental, one embarrassing --and imagine the embarrassment which was enlarged inside the Tramp precisely due to the sentimental situation the moment before-- we get a brilliant, hilarious gag. The comedy is a result of what moves us and what moves us is a result of what makes us laugh.The fact that each detail comes together so gallantly is even more impressive considering that the most dominant subject of the film is something of a task to handle. Yes, I said earlier that the story is simple to summarize, but one of Chaplin's most striking strengths was his ability to establish room for complexity and different interpretations through a very plain formula. The most obvious theme presented here is love. But this theme is, as I see it, really just the story in itself, a surface to cover the underneath: the different personalities we are introduced to --a Tramp, a blind girl, an alcoholic millionaire-- possess a constant tendency of somehow distorting the truth behind their real identities; and these personalities, puzzled and tricked as they are, do not say a single thing about love. If they even know what love is about, they surely do not know how to handle it. But love does, on the other hand, tell a great deal about these personalities; about identity.None of the major characters in this film are happy the way they are, and they escape from the reality by forgetting, imagining, or tricking. The millionaire drinks, the girl fantasizes in her blind world, and the Tramp, however well-meaning and perhaps even unintended, takes advantage of these sub-conscious fantasy worlds of the former persons, in his desire to get money out of the millionaire to help the girl. That is the only way for him to go, because while he may pretend to be a millionaire or a boxer, "he does not," as Walter Kerr put it, "belive it himself." At the very beginning of this film, there is the famous scene which has the Tramp lying asleep in the hands of a newly-founded statue representing 'Peace, Love and Prosperity.' The Tramp is hastily chased away by a furious crowd of aristocrats and intellectuals. It is then, after this embarrassing incident, that he meets the blind girl, the one person who, perhaps, can accept him as he is; but she mistakes him for a millionaire. After he has acquainted the millionaire, he gets his chance to live up to this pretended image for a time, when he is invited to fancy restaurants and parties, but the comfort he feels in these situations is as little as it was in the arms of the statue.We tend to think that the fascination of the blind girl in her "millionaire" was due to his money (and kindness!). There is no doubt that these factors are essential, as she expected him to be such. But we can still ask ourselves: would she have been less moved by the kindness of the Tramp if she had known his true identity? Or would she, as the gamine in MODERN TIMES, have decided to fight along with him? The disappointment she expresses at the end, when the Tramp finally reveals himself, is of course a result of her expectations; love may make blind, but not quite as blind as the shock that a reversed reality would provoke out of a person who imagined a situation as completely different. There was, in the end, perhaps no need for the Tramp to pretend to be anything he was not, as the blind girl was in his own shoes; but the inacceptance of him in the society around, the coldness expressed by everyone but the one who could not see, had made him blind.I got chatty here, as I often do. But even if you don't appreciate my words, don't let that turn you off. CITY LIGHTS is, with its great cast and haunting musical score, a wonderfully sweet film which you can watch if you want to laugh, to cry, or be inspired; Chaplin does his most refined performance throughout his career. It fills my eyes with tears and arise my spirit with laughs, every time, whatever hour. All independent on your age and from which country you happen to come from?and that's part of its genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Do you really need to post a spoiler warning for a movie that as of tonight is 77 years old?)I haven't read other reviews so forgive me if I repeat any previous postings. "City Lights" is, with nary a doubt, the greatest love story ever told. Forget "Casablanca". Forget "An Affair to Remember". Forget "Love Story". (For the love of Christ, forget "Love Story".) This is a movie about the purest love.We have the simple, ubiquitous Tramp. He is smitten with a blind flower girl, who has mistaken him for a wealthy man. There is a new operation that "cures" blindness, and the Tramp will do anything to help Flower Girl regain her sight. He tries to win a boxing match in which he is clearly outclassed. In an era that is forgotten in modern times (pun gleefully intended), he cleans the streets of dung. (One of the best sight gags in screen history happens when the Tramp has to clean up after an elephant.) Finally he steals from a wealthy man to get the money he needs to pay for Flower Girl's operation.And then, after he has spent many years in prison, the Tramp is reunited with Flower Girl.My fellow males, this is a wonderful "Chick Flick." If your lady friend isn't reduced to tears by the last 4 minutes of this movie, you need to find a new lady. I've seen it a dozen times and it always gets to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin at the Top of his Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four years into sound Charlie Chaplin wrote, performed, directed and scored one of film's finest masterpieces.The story is about the "Little Tramp" befriending a blind woman who mistakenly thinks he is rich. Along the way he manages to get into a series of unintentional fixes with a large cast of foils at his disposal as he struggles to finance an operation for the woman.In an incredible display of comic talent Chaplin bombards the audience with scene after scene of magnificently choreographed comedy. Drunk, dancing or boxing his graceful slapstick is a rare combination of comedy and beauty, a comic ballet. Chaplin's performing artistry as well as his ideas reach their apex with City Lights where only Chaplin would dare to challenge the naturally progressive trend and technological status quo by daring to make a silent. By pulling it off with aplomb he solidified his place atop the history of the profession. Some sound is used sparingly (brilliantly with a statue dedication and a piano keyboard) but no intelligible words are uttered. The track and Chaplin's score is lyrical, energized and integral. The film is perfectly constructed.In the masterful hands of Chaplin he avoids bathos in his scenes with the blind woman by severing the sentimentality and the scene with a comic moment, saving it all for the incredibly touching and moving finale. Up until then it is a display of comic genius that only a handful of others might lay claim to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City Lights is probably one of the most well loved, along with Modern Times, Chaplin movies. The iconic and everlasting character of The Tramp, one of the most lovable, truly human and sympathetic characters perhaps of all time. Sometimes there is some hate towards tramps, like they are labeled lazy and troublesome. It is very hard to hate The Tramp, because he gives so much when he has so little. He spends his time and money giving to people - whether it be saying a millionaires life or buying a flower from a blind girl. Undoubtedly, we all have a little bit of The Tramp in us.The plot is as follows: the Tramp meets and falls in love with a blind girl who sells flowers on the street. She is poor and by a mere coincidence, believes that The Tramp is rich. He also saves a drunken millionaire from suicide, and despite his gratefulness, doesn't remember the poor tramp unless he is drunk.City Lights is no doubt a magnificent feat in motion picture history. It's poignant view of the world and society leaves you laughing and crying at the same time. Some believe this should really be called a drama instead of a comedy. I believe it is a strong mixture of both, and a great balance of the two. Both comedic and touching, City Lights should not be missed by anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City Lights (1931) **** (out of 4) A tramp (Charles Chaplin), a rich drunk (Harry Myers) and a blind girl (Virginia Cherrill) make for one of the greatest films of all time. Most classic films have at least one terrific scene and many of the all time greats have three or four but this film here has at least one dozen great scenes but the most memorable is without a doubt the ending. The film gets off to a feverish pace with one great scene after another, of course starting with the revealing of the statue where we see The Tramp sleeping. The two little kids picking on The Tramp is another great comic moment and Chaplin looking at the window provides even more of his genius. The story with the drunk would make a great film on its own and Chaplin uses every moment of this friendship to get as many laughs as possible. Even though this is a terrific comedy I think the film has remained so strong due to the wonderful and touching love story between The Tramp and the blind girl. There's no denying the power and beauty of the ending of this film and each time I see it it makes me tear up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie, as powerful now as ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always loved Chaplin- "Modern Times" has long been one of my favorite films, and I enjoyed "The Circus," "The Gold Rush," "The Great Dictator," and "Monsieur Verdoux." I can easily see how many people consider "City Lights" his masterpiece. It's hard to even speak rationally about this movie. It's very layered, but also very simple, and that's what I think defines a great film.The plot is easy to describe: the Little Tramp befriends a blind flower girl who mistakes him for a millionaire. Then he saves a drunken millionaire from suicide and uses his money and car to make the flower girl think he's rich. However, the millionaire sobers up and forgets the Tramp; the flower girl desperately needs money to pay the rent; ultimately, after a series of comical attempts to earn money, the Tramp receives $1000 from the millionaire, which (after being mistakenly branded a thief) he gives to the flower girl, before being sent to prison. He gets out months later, the flower girl has had an operation to restore her sight, and as he stumbles about outside her new flower shop she gives him a flower, recognizes him, and the film ends.No complex subplots, no dialogue. Just a pure and simple story about a Tramp and his love. Chaplin possesses perhaps the greatest gift for changing the audience emotionally: the movie is never blunt or outrageous; I laughed out loud several times, but it wasn't explosive laughter. And I also very nearly cried at several points. When the Tramp finds he's falling in love with the flower girl he's trying to help- that made me cry. It's so touching, how the Tramp's weaknesses are his strengths. If Chaplin is a communist, then I'm a fellow traveler. The Tramp has nothing to give but his heart and his life. He goes through hell and comes out smiling. Sure, filmmakers today could learn a lot from "City Lights," but so could people today: if you are human, you can learn from this movie.The movie is called a "romance comedy," and that's what it is. The Tramp voluntarily undergoes several ordeals for the flower girl, but he's also subjected to a number of funny situations: the nightclub party that showcases the Roaring '20s (how he drunkenly struggles to find a girl to dance with), the millionaire's attempt to get back home ("Am I driving?"), and of course the classic boxing match. The Tramp is the ultimate underdog: he can never win, but there is beauty is his failure. He finds happiness in life without going along with society's standards. And he gives us happiness, too, and a little inspiration.Then, of course, there is the ending. I love Chaplin's endings. The last title card in "Modern Times" ("We'll get along") and the final shot of "The Circus" (makes me choke a little just to think about it) are both great examples. This ending is overflowing with tenderness. The flower girl loves her mysterious savior, and has said before that money isn't her greatest concern. But then the Tramp shows up: filthy, pathetic, and right out of jail. She laughs at him and teases him a little good-naturedly. He's a little reluctant to come to her- he stands back a little. Then she takes his hand and suddenly realizes the truth. She confirms it by feeling his arm and then says, "You?" and he asks if she can see now and she says, "Yes, I can see now." Their expressions convey just enough for the viewer to understand completely, without being entirely able to say what they understand. You can read the thoughts in her head, and then the camera turns to the Tramp, and his face is a heart-broken, heart-fixed, strange, sad smile. The screen goes black, it says THE END, and the music continues with a flourish, ending on a bittersweet note. I think the ending lets us know that these are real human beings in front of us, not just actors. They have real lives, and those lives can be changed, for better or for worse. It's absolute pathos. You can't be entirely the same after watching "City Lights."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, a Charles Chaplin film. I remember watching my fair share of the silent clowns back in film class and here I watched another. City Lights is about a tramp who falls for a blind girl and works to help her out. That's basically the story; here's the twist: she thinks he's a millionaire and he wants to help pay for an operation that will give her sight (which means that she finds out he's not a millionaire). Okay, the story is done.Honestly, I have to say that I like Chaplin, but I don't love him. This film does nothing to change my mind. There are many cute clowning sequences and they are strung together, although early on, they don't do a whole lot to help the story out and serve almost as distractions. However, taken as individual scenes, they are entertaining, although nothing that caused me to laugh out loud.The film is helped in that it doesn't resolve too neatly but leaves a little room for our own projection of how we think things happen after we see "The End". And it's a bittersweet plot twist which allows for some empathy, rather than just clowning for the sake of clowning. So, City Lights is enjoyable and human, but suffers from gag-stringing and being a little drawn out. Decent, but not a must-watch. 7/10.</fullReview>

This has to be one of the most beautiful movies i have seen! both visionary and story wise. It features some of the best acting I've seen from Chaplin ever, mixed with tons of giggles romance and a beautiful score also written by Chaplin! and just to add on to that it has in my opinion the best ending to a film period! City Lights should be seen by anyone, both by people who watch silent films frequently and by the general public alike. It is a film with so much charisma that you can't help falling in love with the tramp and the blind flower girl. This is truly a one of cinema greatest achievements and a stepping stone in film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie as part of a class project. I could have chosen any movie on the IMDb top 250. I chose this particular movie because I had never seen it. I was not expecting to like it or be able to get into it because it is a silent movie. I was completely wrong. This movie is basically a love story between a tramp and a blind flower girl. There is also the millionaire that the tramp saves and becomes friends with, sometimes. I believe that this movie would not have been as good with dialog as it is without. This is because Charlie Chaplin's acting and musical score were perfect. The music fits the action on screen perfectly and keeps you drawn in. Chaplin's character, a tramp, conveys his message through pantomime. The blind girl played by Virginia Cherrill was also done perfectly. The ending between these two characters is one of the best that I have ever seen. Harry Myers plays an eccentric millionaire, This part is also played very well. This character is a kind of Jeckyll and Hyde. When he has been drinking, he is the tramp's best buddy, when he is sober he wants nothing to do with him. The boxing scene is extremely funny. I won't give away any spoilers but the interaction between the two boxers and the referee is hilarious. Overall this is a masterpiece. The romance, humor, and drama were all very convincing and like I said before, this was all done with no words. This movie was so good that I will watch Charlie Chaplin's other work.</fullReview>

This was my first Charlie Chaplin film and i really enjoyed it. there were to many gags in this film to count but almost all of them were funny unlike some of today's comedies were all of the gags seem to either be unfunny or just fall flat! This comedy tells the heartwarming story of a tramp who tries to make money so that he can pay for a blind flower girls eye treatment so that she could see again. The tramp always seems to get himself into some kind of trouble where ever he goes! i highly recommend seeing this! It is not boring at all and it is very funny! Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City Lights, made back in 1930, is a love story featuring our favorite funny character, the Tramp. First time,I watched this movie two years back with my friends. That time we laughed very much. But as I was watching the movie, I felt that I have to watch this movie alone sometime to get the feel and the message of the movie. Unfortunately, I was very busy those days and couldn't watch it back then but I watched it again yesterday. And this time there was much more than just laughs I got. I loved this film. And I can challenge everyone who says A Walk to Remember or The Notebook are the best love stories! The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) is introduced to us sleeping in the lap of a large statue. People, who have come to watch the giant statue, shoo him away. He is just wandering when he sees a girl selling flowers. He stops and buys a flower. But the girl drops the flower by mistake. He sees that she is looking for the flower in the wrong place and he realises that she is blind. He feels bad for her. He is also very poor and he can well understand her situation. He wants to say something but instead he leaves.At night, he sees a guy trying to kill himself. He convinces him in giving up this idea. The guy takes the Tramp back to his home. He is a millionaire and the Tramp can't figure out why he was trying to kill himself when he is having every pleasure. They become very good friends and the Tramp asks him for some money. The next day, the Tramp buys all the flowers from the blind girl. She is happy, and he is happier than her. The blind girl reaches her home and tells her mother about the millionaire customer she has had today. She thinks him as a millionaire as well as a very big hearted person. She is also having many problems at her home. The rest of the film is pretty much about the Tramp trying to help the girl and sometimes asking the millionaire for some help. Will he be able to help the girl? How will things end up with the millionaire and the Tramp? All the answers are lying in the movie further with a heart-touching ending of the film. Along will all these, there will be many scenes where there will be tears in your eyes just because of laughing.Charlie Chaplin, as most of the times, is the director-writer-producer- composer-editor-actor of the film. And he wins, again as most of the times, in everything. First talking about Chaplin the director-writer, he is brilliant. Needless to say, the story of the film is amazing. Comedy scenes are superbly written and directed and also there are few fighting scenes but Chaplin knows very well how to make them funny. And when I say funny here, I mean hilarious. Though I loved every scene in the film, but still I would like to mention a couple here: Of course the last scene in the film, then the scene where the millionaire invites the tramp for dinner and the fight scene between the Tramp and the boxer who was changed when the original had to flee and with the original one, the Tramp had a pact of 50-50 if he lets the Tramp win. Both the scenes are insanely funny. And I think I won't be able to stop my laughter even if I'm watching them for 10th time. I don't have to say much about Chaplin the actor. I will definitely fall short even if I write a page in his praise. According to me, there have been only one actor who has delivered every performance with no more scope of improvisation: Charlie Chaplin. He has played the Tramp for about forty years. To tell you the truth, I can't imagine him otherwise. I have watched many of his movies and I have loved his performance in all of them. In this movie, he is excellent. In emotional scenes also, he is brilliant. He has had a great impact on the film industry and it won't be an oversaying that he actually revolutionized the genre and the industry.Chaplin the composer does a swell job. Music changes accordingly with the requirements of the film. This is a silent movie and so music becomes a very important part. It supports the funny scenes brilliantly. The movie is black and white so there is not a question of brilliant visuals. The cinematography is good overall. About the other actors in the film, the blind girl is played by Virginia Cherrill and she is very convincing in the role. Her later films didn't see much success and she dropped her film career. The millionaire Harry Myres and he is good. As required, he is very funny. He trusts our Tramp and helps him very much, with his money of course. All other actors are fine.City Lights is definitely one of the best Chaplin movies, if not the best. I loved this movie and while writing this review, going back to every point and remembering everything is making me watch this movie again. You know what? I will watch the movie again after I finish this review. There has been a lot of discussion about the movie title "City Lights". Many believe that "city lights" are allegorical for the types of shallow luxuries and excess that can be found under the lights of the city, e.g., the rich man's drinking, cars, and clothing, when compared to the life of the Tramp and the blind flowergirl. I am kinda satisfied with this theory. City Lights is a very special film for me and I will remember this film for a long long time. And I will definitely watch it many times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both Hilarious and Touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my biggest movie-related regrets that I hadn't seen a single Charlie Chaplin film. The director and actor has received massive acclaim, and is still considered today to be one of the world's greatest directors. And yet, I had not seen any of his films. In fact, I had seen relatively few silent films at all. However, if Chaplin's other work is even nearly as good as City Lights, I will not hesitate to see his many other films.Often considered one of Chaplin's best films, City Lights is the story of a young tramp (portrayed by Charlie Chaplin), who befriends a drunk millionaire. The tramp uses resources provided by the millionaire to give gifts to a young, blind girl, whom the tramp has fallen in love with. Things are a bit complicated, though, as when the millionaire is sober, he does not remember ever befriending the tramp.Due to my limited exposure to films of this era, this review may seem a bit more pointed towards the art of silent film in general, as opposed to this specific film. At times, City Lights plays like a big cartoon. Slap stick and quirky situations saturate this film, insuring that there is never a dull moment. This is not sophisticated comedy, and it does not take a sophisticated mind to enjoy. In fact, this is likely one of the reasons for City Light's success; it's accessibility.Chaplin arranges a large number of very elaborate humorous sketches. A masterpiece in comic timing, City Lights is an absolute delight to watch. There are dozens of memorable scenes. If you're not smiling at any given point during the film, you're probably laughing.Actually, I take back what I just said. For even though City Lights is a comedy, it's also a romance. Very touching, and even tear-jerking at times, City Lights proves that it's just as effective as pulling heart strings as it is at tickling funny bones.The romance succeeds for a number of reasons. For one, we feel invested in the characters and their story. The film is only 82 minutes, which doesn't leave much time for the characters to be developed, and because City Lights is a silent film, only important lines are shown as subtitles. Everything else is silent. And yet, the characters are defined and layered, some more subtly than others.The romance also works due to the excellent acting. Charlie Chaplin quite literally makes this movie. His both hilarious and touching performance as the tramp is sincere and humorous. Virginia Cherrill portraying the blind girl is another great performance, and Harry Myers effectively portrays the eccentric millionaire.I also believe the romance actually benefits from not having dialogue. I say this dialogue is the number one thing that kills a good romance in a film. You could have the best actors and actresses in the world, but with bad dialogue, comes bad romance. By eliminating dialogue, City Lights also eliminates this common issue in modern film that's not just limited to romantic flicks.The score (also composed by Charlie Chaplin, as well as Arthur Johnston) is delightful. Boasting a large number of catchy and clever tunes, the score is both diverse and entertaining. Music has a much more important role in silent films than in today's "talkies," but Chaplin and Johnston have no problem here.Not all the sketches work as well as others, and the heavy slapstick may not meet everyone's tastes, but City Lights is a brilliant film that succeeds on both an emotional level, and a comedic one. Funnier and touching than most of today's films, City Lights isn't perfection, nor is it without flaw, but the sincerity and simplicity in which the story is presented is simply beautiful. I look forward to watching more of Chaplin's films in the near future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love black and white films, it's amazing to see history before your eyes. It's always great to see the passion of these early actors/directors. Charlie Chaplin was both an actor and a director and did well in both roles. So many think that Chaplin was a simple jester, just making people laugh. But he was much more than that, and this movie attests to that. It can be seen in his movies that Chaplin carries meanings in his roles and this movie is about loving someone more than you love yourself. It's about how a kind man remains kind regardless of the mistreatment that come his way. It's about how love for someone can provide purpose and meaning in someone's life. It's about how miracles can come in the most strangest and unlikely forms. The movie is filled with laughs, joys and tears. For those who like the simplicity of first time cinema, I recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not His Best, but Redeemed by Many Great Moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may be the haze of all the intervening years, but I don't think Chaplin made anything but 'Classics' from 1916-1936. You can pretty much watch anything from these couple of decades and see, if not an entire classic, at least frequent moments of brilliance. Such was the man's genius.Of this oeuvre, some items stand out as especially worthy of praise: all the full length features in this period, for example, are worth seeing today. Most live on in the work of other directors, cinematographers and actors who were influenced by these films. In fact it could rightly be said that Chaplin lives on in innumerable moments on screen and in the attitude he brought to the project of making films - raising it from a novelty to it's status as art today. No filmmaker did more to advance the art of film.City Lights is certainly one of his masterpieces. It resembles his other features from the 30's (and throughout is career) in it's utterly distinctive look and feel. Due to the unique style of directing, his absolute control of all aspects of the production and the use of his collaborator/cinematographer, Rollie Totheroh, all Chaplin films have this 'look' that the film wears almost like a brand.The most striking thing, to me, about CL, is the pure symmetry of the story. Everything is pared down to the double story of love story/infatuation and friendship/exploitation. The love story is predicated on deception, while the friendship is predicated on alcoholism. The parallel stories take place almost independently of each other. It is this lack of cohesion that to me at least makes it less of a great film than, say, Modern Times.Nevertheless, there are many great moments in the film to admire. The two best scenes, IMO, are the boxing scene which is genuinely one of the most hilarious sequences ever filmed (if you want to know where Jackie Gleason, Lucille Ball and other masters of physical comedy got their chops, a good place to start is right here) and the final scene/fadeout.The ending is beyond genius, almost as if God had AD'd this scene for Chaplin, it is so profoundly moving. That said, a great ending, even one as great as graces City Lights, does still not resolve the issue of the un-meeting story lines which proceed along parallel tracks for the whole film.It is still worth your time to watch this supremely gifted physical comedian at the top of his game, and even more so, IMO, in repeat viewings. No silent actor rewards the repeat watcher more than Chaplin, as his constant, offhand improvisations often escape first or second notice and only become apparent upon repeat viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>beautiful movie, must see for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I fell in love, and it instantly became one of my favorites. I just watched it the other night again and it still had a similar effect. This masterpiece directed by the great Charlie Chaplin is his best I've seen so far. It tells the tale of a poor tramp who meets a beautiful women selling flowers, and quickly finds out she is blind. When she begins to believe he is a wealthy man, the poor man goes along with it and begins to try and impress her. This may sound like some kind of romantic comedy that no one would want to see, but trust me, its far from that.The tramp starts off with his antics right from the get go, and even though its all through the movie, they never get old. It is always something new, and it keeps it interesting. That's the thing about this movie, its not like The Kid or The Great Dictator where all or most of the gags revolve around a certain topic or event, this story was made where the lead character can go on many adventures during the film, but it still ends up coming full circle to the most important story of them all. That's why this isn't just a romantic comedy, its more than that.For people who have never seen a Chaplin movie, or at least a full length film of his, it may seem like this movie would be all slapstick. Yes, there is slapstick, and a lot of it. However, the comical time is perfect and I found myself laughing at a lot of these gags, and I normally don't find that type of humor funny, Also, if you look deeper, you will soon see there is much more depth then one would think. It tells the story of a kind poor man trying to help everyone he meets and especially the ones he cares about. The Tramp meets this young women and soon goes to great lengths to help her when she is in need, more then most people would ever do. This loving side of him brings him through hilarious and memorable journeys. Along with the amazing score, this movie is prefect.For anyone who even is CONSIDERING watching this, I strongly, strongly suggest you do. With gags that will leave you laughing for weeks, but also a heartwarming tale that will leave you satisfied, it is enough to make any movie lover happy, no matter what kind of person you are.The only person I could think that would not enjoy it would be someone who hates slapstick, but really, I was never a fan of it, but when I found Mr.Charlie Chaplin's work I realized how funny it could actually be when done right. 10/10, one of the greatest movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unparalleled Brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, this is one of the greatest films of all time. Chaplin, playing the familiar tramp, meets a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) and is touched by her. He also meets a millionaire (Harry Myers) who only seems to be able to tolerate the tramp when he is drunk. The tramp looks to raise money to cure the girl's blindness. The film is funny, poignant and heartwarming. Its full of Chaplin like pratfalls and sight gags, but it also has a tenderness that is both welcome and inspired. A "silent" film (Chaplin composed the music, also wonderful), it just doesn't have any dialog. Its so much better for that, it means more. The last scene is probably the greatest in movie history, but watch the whole film and just get immersed in the artistry and brilliance that was Chaplin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Tomorrow the birds will sing".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say that Charlie Chaplin was a perfectionist would be an understatement. The meeting of the flower girl in "City Lights" took over three hundred takes before it met Chaplin's approval; one of the many fascinating bits of history offered on the DVD extras I enjoyed today. Virginia Cherrill was a twenty year old, recently divorced socialite who didn't share Chaplin's work ethic and might have been replaced in the picture by Georgia Hale ("The Gold Rush") if so much of the picture hadn't already been filmed. Knowing that, and re-watching some of the more poignant scenes in "City Lights", makes it seem all the more incredible for knowing that Chaplin and Cherrill didn't really like each other.This is the story of love between two lost souls in the big city, a theme dear to Chaplin as the silent era in pictures was coming to an end. Movie fans, entranced by Al Jolson's "The Jazz Singer", were newly hooked on talking pictures, so Chaplin's decision to keep this film a silent was a controversial, if not an economically dangerous one. However the fans reacted wonderfully to the story, the final scene conveyed in a manner to bring tears to one's eyes and a melancholy lump to the throat. Few closing scenes in a movie can match it for impact, and it remains memorable even after eighty years of film making.For my part, I always get a kick out of the little things in a picture. This one had me hitting the rewind button to catch The Tramp's reaction to the newspaper boys near the beginning of the story. After that little dust up when one of the boys pulls the finger off Chaplin's glove, you can catch the quick flip of the bird he gives to the boy on the left. It's done very deftly and without hesitation, and you'll wonder to yourself - 'Did I just see that'?I haven't watched a lot of Chaplin's work up to this point, but with every film of importance I see, I'm led to others that will give me an even greater appreciation of the talent and hard work that went into the making of cinema's best. Chaplin's on the list now, and I'll be searching out his other noted pictures in short order.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blink once and you'll miss something funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The jokes and comical moments are all performed in such an incredible high pace and very well timed and choreographed. The comical moments follow each other very rapidly. Big over-the-top hilarious situations as well as small subtle ones. You have no time to think about the one joke, since the next one is already occurring at that very moment. The movie is that fast going. Blink once and you'll miss something funny. This is slapstick film-making at its very best.Charles Chaplin performs his role with great charisma and agility, It's a quite psychical movie for him. The movie features jumping, falling and climbing, as you would obviously expect from a '30's slapstick movie.I must admit that a few of the Chaplin movies don't live up to their reputations but this one on the other hand really does. It's certainly one of the best comedies of the '30's and of all time. A true timeless comedy classic!But as you would expect from a Chaplin movie, it also is a movie with lots of heart and humanity. No matter how crazy the movie gets in parts, the movie never loses any of its credibility when it comes down to its drama and pureness. The movie is also made in a more realistic style, rather than a comical one that clearly and also predictably builds up toward a comical situations. This makes the movie all the more hilarious and strengthens the comical moments.The movie just doesn't only rely on its jokes and Chaplin antics but also has a great and compelling story of its own. It's a quite well written story, that moves over to a lot of different places and locations throughout and is therefore also loaded with lots of characters and situations. It makes the movie also very original.An absolute delightful movie!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tingling spine and an unprecetended movie experience...that's what City Lights is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to choose which departed film-maker I would want to meet, I would choose Charlie Chaplin. I think he is the greatest and most determining artist in the entire cinema history. City Lights is my personal favourite. It is so innocent, so warmhearted masterpiece, that fills me with zest for life, kindness and gives meaning to carry on living! Chaplin, as usual, is the unbelievably altruist Little Tramp who falls in love with a beautiful blind flower-girl. I read some other comments which said it was the greatest last 5 minutes in the cinema history. It was indeed, but it also was one of the funniest 86 minutes for me. Almost all the jokes landed even after 76 years... I can only praise the highness of Charles Chaplin: the Great Director, Stunning Producer, Outstanding Composer, Marvellous Editor, Brilliant Actor. All in one fantastic person.My rating is 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the beginning you find our poor little tramp sleeping on a statue.Then he runs into a suicidal and drunken millionaire, whose life he saves.And what would our poor little tramp be without love? Even poorer and more miserable.The woman he falls for is a flower girl, and she's blind.And this blind flower girl thinks the tramp is a rich man.But he's only rich at heart.He wants to help the girl, he wants her to see.But if she does see, would she love him? Our poor little tramp? Nobody is better at combining tragedy and comedy better than Charles Chaplin was.This is a fact I have mentioned in previous Chaplin reviews and this is something all the movie lovers have probably noticed.City Lights (1931) is one great example of those movies where comedy meets tragedy.Take the scene with the Eccentric Millionaire for example.He is there ready to jump into the water when our little tramp wanders to the spot.Soon they're both in the water.Comedy meets tragedy, laughter meets tears.I could mention plenty of other examples but you can see it all by watching this movie.If you already have, watch it again.It's a true classic that will not age.And the acting performances...they're all superb.Besides Chaplin there is Virinia Cherrill as A Blind Girl.She is so beautiful...such a good actress.And then there's Florence Lee as her grandmother.Harry Myers is fantastic as the moody millionaire.And so is Al Ernest Garcia as his Butler.The Keystone Kop Hank Mann plays A Prizefighter.The big man Henry Bergman is known from other Chaplin films also.Here he plays the Mayor/Blind Girls downstairs neighbor.Jean Harlow can be seen as an Extra in restaurant scene.The original music made by Charlie himself is masterly.Chaplin didn't want to give up silent pictures.And why would he have? Things could very well be told without words.He did use some simple sound effects in this film and then Modern Times (1936).City Lights is filled with memorable scenes like when Charlie goes boxing.And when he goes dancing drunk is hilarious.And let's not forget the ending.The ending is beautiful.</fullReview>

Chaplin is not only the teacher to all that new comedians, no he is a teacher and an inspiration to all who loves films because Chaplin is not only a comedian he is much more than that and City Lights is a gift to all the people in all the world that loves films. I love this film because contains elements of a comedy but also of a drama film. I think that have already says what i think about Chaplin, but the rest of the cast is really awesome. My favorite character in City Lights is of course The tramp but i love the personality of the eccentric millionaire, this character is a really good one in this film.About the story of the film is really simple: the tramp fell in love with a blind beautiful woman who doesn't have money to pay the rent of her house and the tramp tries to do some money by working and with an eccentric millionaire that wanted to kill himself and that have to personalities:only when he is drunk the tramp is his friend.The best scene of this film is the one when the tramp comes to boxing,i think is just great just as the beautiful endIn conclusion: if you love films you need to love Chaplin and of course if you consider a films fan you need to see City Lights because for me this is a gift to all the people in the world and i think that in a 100 of years the people will going to still watching the Chaplin's films.CITY LIGHTS:10, just perfect</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CITY LIGHTS may be Chaplin's most perfect film. In no other does he so effectively blend comedy, tragedy, pathos, romance and social commentary to such poignant effect. CITY LIGHTS deserves to be rated among the ten best American films ever made. It is Chaplin's ultimate triumph as actor, writer, director- made even more remarkable by the fact that the film, a silent, was released into a market saturated with sound films.Chaplin's tramp is universal- he understood that speech would mar the tramp's simplicity and appeal so there is no dialog used in the film. Chaplin delivers one of his most emotive and effective performances as the Tramp. There are many classic Chaplin scenes to enjoy in CITY LIGHTS- the famous "spaghetti streamer" scene, the tramp saving the millionaire from suicide, the final moment with his sweet flower-girl love who can now truly "see" the man who has helped her regain her sight. It is a beautiful film. I'll take a leaf from Chaplin's book and leave my comment here- no mere words can describe the wonderful experience that CITY LIGHTS gives to the viewer.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lights, that blind (*may contain spoilers*)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****May contain spoilers***** City Lights is yet another great example of Chaplin's greatness. This film contains many of the Chaplin's usual comedy numbers. In fact, the boxing scene in this film is even better than those from Cinderella Man. However, I think that this film has a very serious message behind all of the comedy.Chaplin was never a man who feared making social commentary. This is more obvious in films like The Great Dictator and Modern Times. Even though City Lights messages are a little more subtle, I think they are still present. The film touches on everything from poverty to wealth and even race.I think the main social commentary in the film can be found in it's views on wealth. The film actually opens up with the city unveiling a large monument. To their surprise, when the pull the curtain the homeless Tramp (Chaplin) is sleeping on the lap of the statue. His presence is seen by the crowd as an unwelcome blemish on the face of their monument. Physical comedy aside, this scene sets the tone for the rest of the film. The whole concept is how the rich want to ignore the poor and pretend they do not exist. This is made completely clear in the relationship between Chaplin and the eccentric millionaire. In fact, when the first meet the millionaire is attempting to kill himself. He is actually saved by a homeless man telling him that "the birds will sing tomorrow." This total irony is the kind of tool that Chaplin uses to illustrate his point. Another aspect of the this relationship that illustrates the same point is the fact that when the rich man is drunk, Chaplin is his best friend. However, when he sobers up he wants nothing to do with him. He even pretends not to know him some times. This shows in no uncertain terms, that Chaplin saw the rich as being afraid to help the poor. In fact, one of the only people that will actually talk to Charlie is a blind girl who sells flowers. This seems like a typical screen romance. However, when you delve deeper I think that you can see it is not. Through out the film, I think you can confuse this relationship as puppy love. Then as the plot unfolds a couple of apparent thoughts surface. The blind girl actually thinks that Charlie's character is a millionaire. I think that in hind sight it is easy to see that the more Charlie pretends to be rich, the more she likes him. In fact, this can perhaps be seen in the ending sequence. The girl now able to see and the owner of a whole flower store thanks to the money that Charlie provides is always waiting on him to arrive. The catch is, that she has never seen Charlie before. At one point a rich man walks in, and the girl gets a look on her face that shows she thinks that her prince has arrived. When it isn't him, she says she hopes he comes soon. Then ironically, a totally beaten down Tramp walks by her store window. From inside the store, she actually laughs at him when local paper boys pick on him. Then we he sees her and is obviously madly in love, she taunts him even further. In fact, when she does realize that this tramp is her knight in shining armor comes the clincher. The girl's face shows not love or gratitude. There is no hug or kiss, for the man that saved her. Only a disappointed look and her saying that now she can see. I think that this more than any other point in the film is where the message is really hammered home. When Charlie's only friend now has some money, and sees him for the poor person that he is she is saddened. It is really quite a dark thought. I mean this is a man, who got beaten up in a boxing match and even shoveled fecal matter off the street just to try and help his love pay her rent. I think this sad thought is one that Chaplin hoped would open the audience's eyes to this problem.Besides the obvious economic views in the movie, we have other examples of social commentary. The boxing scene has a very interesting one to me. Not only does it show these boxing people turning the poor into punching bags, so they can fill their arena but there is a race issue as well. In this scene the black boxer is shown not only as superstitious, but he actually gets pummeled by a white boxer. Then there is also a major homosexual under current in this scene as well. Charlie is shown as seemingly gay in the locker room. He makes gay gestures as well as faces towards his opponent. If you think this is not true, then why does the man change his pants behind a curtain? I think the fact that Charlie and the black boxer are shown as outcast in the locker room is some kind of commentary on the thoughts of the time. In fact, the homosexual theme is also prevalent with the millionaire and Charlie. Always hugging and drinking. At one point Charlie actually wakes up in bed with the millionaire. I think the film at times shows the desperate Charlie as a male prostitute to the millionaire. I am not sure if this is what Charlie meant to do, but it is definitely something to look at when you view the film.In closing, this film is just as much a masterpiece as everything else that Chaplin has done. The comedy and commentary mix together to form one very striking and memorable film. I think that is why is is still held in such high regards, even to this day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In my honest opinion, this is Charlie Chaplin's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I loved The Kid, The Gold Rush, Modern Times and The Great Dictator, City Lights is the film I consider Charlie Chaplin's masterpiece. And there are several reasons why this is so for me.I love how City Lights is filmed, once again the cinematography is stunning as are the costumes and sets. The music is also a delight(though my favourite soundtrack in a Chaplin movie is the one for Modern Times) with plenty of themes that stuck in my head, while the sound effects are wonderfully incorporated and the subtitles easy to understand. The comedy is brilliantly done, the scene in the boxing ring is not only one of my favourite scenes in a Chaplin movie(along with the final sequence and the dance of the bread rolls of The Gold Rush, the final scene of The Kid and the speech from The Great Dictator) but ever in a comedy, while there is a very touching love story between the Tramp and the little blind girl(played touchingly by Virginia Cherrill) he falls in love with. And I also found the close-up climax achingly poignant because of its beauty and ambiguity. Chaplin is superb, his pantomime skills and physical humour are extremely well judged and he is acts beautifully with Cherrill.Overall, yet another Chaplin masterpiece, yet for me this is the best of them all. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Charlie Chaplin movie along with romance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie for the third time in this month and wow what a great movie is it. Charlie Chaplin was a great comedian and everybody knows that but in this movie along with some great comedy you get to watch some amazing story of romance with emotions and love. In those days there was no sound at all in the movies and the actors have to perform very well in order to convey their messages to the viewers and every single artist in this movie did it beautifully. Virginia Cherrill portrayed the character of blind girl beautifully. I have seen many movies that were made before 2nd world war but with all do respect those were nothing as compare to this movie. On the whole this movie is great and I recommend it to everyone especially who likes classics and comedy. I give it 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A truly marvellous film, one to watch over and over again (as I have) and not tire of. If I remember right Chaplin basically made it up as he went along, with only the bones of the story and the ending in mind, tens of thousands of scene retakes later. This put the lid on silent films for good, CL could not have been bettered if they'd tried - and Chaplin did of course but failed with Modern Times.There's so many gags in CL it's pointless to pick any one out - the boxing match hardly counts as a gag, more a work of art - overall it's a relentless 80 minutes, the usual Chaplin roller-coaster of emotion. The dedicated know all this, the ones who only like violent colour talkies will scoff after having wasted their time trying to understand why this movie is so highly regarded. I wonder if they switch off before the end?The original for the set for the outside the blind girl's home still exists in Lambeth today, along of course with many other surviving places of Chaplin interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rarified</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles once cited as his favorite movie Charlie Chaplin's tribute to the art of body language and pantomime, "City Lights.""I was determined to continue making silent films," Chaplin recalls in "My Life in Pictures" of his decision to make a silent four years into the talkie era, "for I believed there was room for all types of entertainment." "City Lights" features Chaplin's musical composition and various sound effects, but no dialogue. Chaplin opens the film with a lampoon of talkies: at the unveiling of a Greco-Roman stone statue, the dignitaries' speeches are heard only as unintelligible squawks.Smitten by a flower-selling Blind Girl (Virginia Sherrill) who has mistaken him for a dapper gentleman, the Little Tramp takes on odd jobs (including a prizefight, shown in a masterfully choreographed sequence) to raise money for an operation to restore her vision. After the Tramp intervenes to prevent the suicide of an alcoholic tycoon, the tycoon befriends him; but it is an on and off friendship, as when sober the tycoon doesn't even recognize the Tramp. Despite a series of mishaps, the Tramp pays for the operation. But in the process he lands in prison. On the Tramp's elease, the Blind Girl learns the true identity of her benefactor in one of the most rarified scenes in cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first Charlie Chaplin film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was my first Charlie Chaplin and first silent film. I wasn't sure what to expect and I was surprised that despite the lack of dialogue, it was easy to follow. The storyline wasn't particularly complicated or difficult to understand. The humour also worked well too. Charlie Chaplin is a great comedy performer and here his talents for physical comedy are showcased well.That being said I did feel like the comedy was overdone at times. There were occasions where the same joke was repeated again and again and I got a little bored. I also didn't find the film entirely engaging. My interest did wander a little at times.Read my full review here:http://goo.gl/V1YfzS</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming to the last</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City Lights is a film which is beloved and revered. And it is easy to see why. As comedies go, it may not be among the funniest films ever made. But if there is any shortfall of laughs the film more than compensates with an overabundance of charm. And it is not as if the film is totally lacking in laughs either, there is plenty of good humor here. But in this case it is the story, more than the jokes and gags, which really is the key to the film's success. That story draws you in, makes you root for Charlie Chaplin's famous Tramp. It's a beautifully unique love story which will definitely bring a smile to your face and ultimately maybe even a tear to your eye. City Lights is the brilliant result you get when you have a master of his art form at work.The simple, though thoroughly captivating story, follows The Tramp as he falls in love with a beautiful, blind flower girl. She can't see him for the lowly hobo he is, a misunderstanding upon her initial meeting leads her to believe he is a wealthy gentleman. The Tramp is more than happy to allow her to maintain that illusion. He gets some help in this endeavor from a drunken millionaire who befriends him. The Tramp gets money from the millionaire, stays in his house, drives his car. All very helpful in keeping up the ruse of wealthiness for the blind girl. Unfortunately the drunken millionaire is only friends with The Tramp whenever he is in fact drunk. When he sobers up he doesn't remember The Tramp at all. This of course causes awkward, and funny, complications. Meanwhile the flower girl has problems of her own. She's behind on the rent and, unknowingly since her grandmother hides the notice, about to be evicted. The Tramp is determined to save the day, pay the rent and also somehow pay for surgery to cure the girl's blindness. How will our shabby little hero pull this off? Chaplin is a master of his craft at the peak of his powers. When City Lights was released the era of silent films was at its end, the talkies had taken over. But Chaplin was determined to tell his story his way, really the only way a story of The Tramp could ever be told. Who would want to hear The Tramp speak? The brilliance of the character is in the pantomime, the expressions. Chaplin tugs on the heartstrings without ever saying a word. Other performers in the film, most notably Virginia Cherrill as the blind girl and Harry Myers as the millionaire, play their parts well. Cherrill in particular deserves much credit for the film's ultimate emotional wallop. But this film is Chaplin's through and through, his fingerprints are on every frame. A brilliant performer, a brilliant director. Every moment is so well thought out. Maybe the film is not outrageously funny but there is plenty of humor to appreciate. Even if you think a scene may drag on too long, like a boxing match late on in the film, you can't help but appreciate the effort that went into it. It may be a little long but the scene is undeniably worked out beautifully, Chaplin showing an absolute mastery of choreography. It is a comedy film in which ultimately the comedy is secondary. Yes, there are jokes and gags and no, not all of them work perfectly. But there are definitely enough good comedic moments to keep you entertained. But more importantly there is a story to keep you enthralled. The love story between The Tramp and the blind girl warms your heart and makes City Lights a true feel-good movie, one worthy of its status as one of the most beloved films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What kind of world would this be if people chose their mates based on character? Welcome to the setting of "City Lights," in which the Little Tramp (Charles Chaplin) risks everything to take care of a kindly blind woman whom he met selling flowers (Virginia Cherrill).Though the film has a lot of slapstick silliness -- i.e., Charlie swallows a whistle and speaks in "toots," and swaps someone's sandwich meat for soap (yup, the man talks in bubbles) -- it is equally loaded with heart.Charlie's love for the blind girl is unconditional. He'll do whatever it takes to help her -- be it step into a boxing ring or get hauled off to jail for years -- all the while keeping nothing for himself. Somehow, I guess, he trusts he'll get by.Along the way there are wonderful scenes with an alcoholic millionaire (Harry Myers) who can't do enough for Charlie when he's drunk, but, once sobered up, doesn't even recognize the Tramp.There are wonderful models for good behavior in this film, despite the obvious exaggerations. What a timeless wake-up call for humanity!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light City</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin may be praised for his work nowadays, and rightly so, he was a pioneer in the silent film era. However, do his films stand out in today's standards: no. I'm not saying I disliked the film, I very well respect it, but it just didn't captivate me as much as I would of hoped for. City Lights may be the older version of Mr. Bean; a slapstick comedy with very little use of intellect.City Lights unfortunately didn't sit well with me, nor did it really entice me to chase more of Charlie Chaplin films. It wasn't bad, nor was it boring, I just didn't find much joy in what is considered one of the 'best brads of comedy'. Whilst I don't speak for everyone, this film just won't be for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Jewel in the Crown of Silent Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The transition from silent film to sound is undoubtedly the most significant change to affect the cinematic medium. The commercial success of 1927's THE JAZZ SINGER, the first mainstream film to feature talking segments, prompted other studios to either add sound segments to already existing silent films, or create full-length "talkies." The public eagerly embraced this new form, but not all were so enthusiastic to abandon mute film. Perhaps the most ardent promoter of silent cinema at this time was Charlie Chaplin. Between 1928 and 1931, the number of silent features steadily dwindled until. In 1930 and 1931, Hollywood produced maybe 4 silent pictures, among the hundreds of sound features that came out in those years. One of them was CITY LIGHTS (1931). If CITY LIGHTS (as well as Chaplin's 1936 MODERN TIMES) serve as an epilogue or elegy for the silent era, it can also be said that Chaplin's film provides a passionate and effective argument for the aesthetic and emotional value of cinema without spoken dialogue.Once again, Chaplin uses his Little Tramp character in a tale that blends humor with pathos. The Tramp makes the acquaintance of two very different characters - a pretty, blind flower girl who lives in poverty (stunningly played by Virginia Cherrill) and an eccentric millionaire (Harry Myers) who only remembers the Tramp when he's drunk. Chaplin, who wrote and directed the film as usual, plays off of the contrast between rich and poor, and once again his Tramp character shows humor and resilience in the face of adversity. When he realizes that the flower girl is in dire financial straits, he does everything possible to help her, and an unexpected love blossoms between the two. There are many funny scenes here - the opening scene with the Tramp sleeping on the statue as it's unveiled, the Tramp and the millionaire attempting to dance in the restaurant, the comical boxing match - all displaying Chaplin's trademark command of visual humor. The flower girl is the emotional anchor of the movie - happy despite her blindness and poverty, she takes in the Tramp as well as the viewer with her incandescent charm. Neither she nor the Tramp have much materially, but their concern for each other illustrate how love can make every life better despite hardship.The acting is superb. Chaplin could seemingly do no wrong on screen, and he shows humor, flamboyance, tenderness and warmth in his portrayal. The biggest revelation is Virginia Cherrill, in her first major film role. Cherrill is wonderfully natural, understated and charming, beautiful and luminous, the center of all of her scenes. She convincingly portrays the blind girl and contributes a performance full of feeling. The interplay between Cherrill and Chaplin at the end of the movie is extraordinarily moving and memorable. Harry Myers is funny and memorable as the millionaire whom the Tramp befriends. Chaplin always employed a rather minimalistic style of cinematography as director. He didn't care to have the camera draw attention to itself, but used it to capture the story in a way that would emotionally involve the audience. Chaplin also composed the score, and it effectively draws out the right emotions from each character and situation. Overall, CITY LIGHTS is a definite classic. SCORE: 10/10</fullReview>

To be an actor as Chaplin, make laugh and make weep.Even today I feel same feeling and emotions about this masterpiece. A wonderful story, with beautiful values, and an amazing looks from Chaplin as a director. The scene of meeting between Chaplin and the sightless flower girl is THE scene of this movie. A genius idea for Chaplin to choose how his character will meet this girl and how this girl could be think that he was a rich man.The musical score which Chaplin composed for City Lights stay still today one a the most beautiful. I don't have enough words in English to say why you have to watch this movie ... but you have to. Enjoy!Wrote by a french guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If i have to choose which movie have the best ending, it is very easy to choose city lights, it is very very easy. Chaplin was genius, seriously genius. This is the movie that truly inspire me. After i watch city lights, i just know there is such a movie power that exist in this world that can move and touch me really deep. I never feel such a sharp sensation ever from any hundred movies i watch before. and this movie, pierce me through the heart within silent. only gesture, eye- contact, and camera-works with no dialogue.sometimes i try to analyze deeply, why this movie have such a magnificent power. i think the reason is the connection between scenes. if we ask ourself what makes a good ending ? maybe the answer is how good you make the scene before the ending. how good you correlate the prologue and epilogue and also between them. how you fill the mid-duration of a movie. if the director took a right decision, a movie will not have any wasted scenes. its only genius film-maker can do and chaplin is one of them.silent movie such as city light is a hard-kind of movie to made. it needs next level of acting skill from the actors and actresses because there are no dialogue in it. and most of the duration, this movie is flawless in casting. and the ending scene were unbelievable and unpredictable. maximum genuine art-beauty of silent movie.i recommend everybody to watch this movie at least once. this movie is special. it definitely will pierce you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City Lights (1931): Dir: Charlie Chaplin / Dir: Charlie Chaplin, Virginia Cherrill, Harry Myers, Florence Lee, Al Ernest Garcia: A masterpiece in silent film expression of love, passion and the desire to merge forward through everyday corruption. Charlie Chaplin plays his trademark tramp who is sneered at by anyone who isn't blind or intoxicated. Virginia Cherrill plays a blind woman who sells flowers on the corner. Smitten, Chaplin purchases a flower. Harry Myers plays a drunken millionaire on the verge of suicide until Chaplin prevents it in his usual hilarious slapstick fashion. Thankful, he invites Chaplin to his mansion for partying. Unfortunately when sober he doesn't recall his new friend. This frustrates Chaplin who attempts odd jobs in order to help the blind woman with her rent as well as an expensive eye surgery that would gain her sight. This leads to more hijinks particularly when he makes a failed attempt at boxing. Chaplin plays off a desire to please despite the fact that the blind woman believes him to be rich. Cherrill as the blind woman proves to have a heart of gold. Florence Lee plays her concern grandmother who help her with the flowers arrangements. Myers plays off the recklessness of alcohol. Al Ernest Garcia plays the stern and often confused butler. Chaplin's best work presents a theme of putting the needs of others first as well as give the words of a touching closing line, "I can see now." Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Chaplin classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Charlie Chaplin classic. But then, many of his movies are classics, and rightfully so. Has the usual Chaplin traits: fantastic, ingenious, ultra-creative visual comedy, plus a great emotional angle. The comedy is brilliant. Some of the scenes are iconic, and have been copied by many great movie makers.Where this differs from his previous movies is that the drama side gets more weight than before. After the almost-continuous comedy of The Circus, his previous movie, the lulls in comedy found in City Lights to advance the plot and develop the characters come as a bit of a shock. Even a let-down. But they are worth it, as the movie builds up to an incredibly emotional final scene. Plus the breaks from the comedy make the comedic scenes even more impactful.An absolute must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comically the most hilarious and dramatically the most moving film. How many times, one may see it we all shall fall in love with love, honesty. simplicity and sincerity again. A man's quest to keep a girl whom he just likes happy, to give her some light is just so delightful a journey. His interactions with a drunkard, a very funny boxing match, a flower girl's love are so well interlaced that never for a moment is a laugh lost or a smile broken. Yet it ends with the eyes left moist. A great movie and an emphatic achievement in films. The style is Slapstick, where each scene is just so comical. Each time he meets the flower girl, she welcomes him hilariously, each time he is away from her, he does something extremely funny. The romance is just filled with expression of eyes and it is so very subtle. I must say the whole movie is like a poem with sublime lyrical beauty. It's very fluid as the scenes just flow. I surrender myself to the genius as Charlie Chaplin and to a great movie as City Lights. Please please please see it as this movie would still stand the test time of time and I am pretty sure, it would still be loved a 100 years later. It's flawless and 5/5 from a little movie buff. I loved this greatest Romantic Comedy ever. I think who all have seen it, shall surely love it. Silence is a great language coz few things are beautiful when expressed silently</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The answer is yes, yes, and YES.City Lights (1931) may be the sweetest film ever made. A gentle romantic-comedy with a great ending, this movie is unforgettable. Unlike a modern comedy or rom-com, there is not a trace of mean-spiritedness here.I'm not sure if CL is Chaplin's funniest movie, but some of his most hilarious moments are all here. The comic highlight is the boxing match, which is great all in and of itself.Though Chaplin had a hard time with Virginia Cherrill on set, she is perfect as the flower girl the Tramp seeks to help. He considered casting Georgia Hale in the part, but I don't think anyone could have exuded innocence and tenderness in the same caliber as Cherrill.This is a fine movie, truly great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No one can fail to see just how inspiring and uplifting "City Lights" is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For centuries, we've been living in a world that mostly consists of people trying to fend for themselves and obtain whatever necessary resources they can in order to survive. This mindset of how the world works results in the rich being prosperous and entitled while the poor are miserable and shunned. In short, various developments (whether it's the invention of new technologies or events that make us question the unity of humanity) have made us more selfish and isolated from one another. I'm saying this since I believe the primary reason that silent film legend Charlie Chaplin had a lasting impact is because while he confirms that we live in this kind of world, he pulls off something in his films that's very difficult to do. He somehow reassures us that everything will be okay no matter how hard you fall and that there are still people out there who help out other people. And very few films of Chaplin's have proved this more effectively than his 1931 silent masterpiece, "City Lights". This silent romantic comedy follows Chaplin's famous Tramp character as he meets a pretty but blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) who mistakes him for a millionaire. That night, the Tramp also meets a drunken millionaire (Harry Myers) and saves him from suicide. As a way of thanking the Tramp for saving him from himself, this millionaire immediately considers him a friend and welcomes the Tramp to his mansion. After they go for a chaotic night on the town, the millionaire sobers up the next day unable to recognize the Tramp in the slightest and kicks him out. So, the Tramp runs into the blind flower girl again and starts initiating a special relationship with her. He also runs into the same millionaire a second time and in his drunken state invites him back to his mansion. From there, certain events eventually ensue in which the Tramp does whatever he can to help pay for the blind girl's eye operation by taking advantage of his unusual friendship with this millionaire. To write, direct or star in a film with or without sound is one thing. But to write, direct AND star in a film that is technically silent yet has a few bits of sound and a musical score is another thing. With "City Lights", Charlie Chaplin had successfully pulled off an intensely strenuous task. On top of the fact that he decided to make a silent picture in the midst of the "talking pictures" becoming the talk of the town, he had to write, direct AND act in this film. Anyone can tell you that it's a monumental responsibility to pull off all three of these tasks and still produce a high quality film. And the reason that Chaplin had rightfully become a major influence on the film industry isn't just because he's written, directed and starred in excellent pictures, but because these pictures are still being enjoyed by modern audiences today even if they are silent. That's the true sign of a timeless piece of filmmaking. What I particularly loved about "City Lights", as well as with "Modern Times" (1936), is that its direction is emotionally equivalent to an efficient and smooth roller coaster ride. In other words, Chaplin does a fantastic job at switching back and forth between comedic and dramatic moments seamlessly. One moment you're genuinely laughing at the trouble that the Tramp gets into, the other moment you're feeling pity for the troubles he's experiencing. One moment you feel like your hopes are crushed and nothing's going to be okay, the other you feel like all hope is restored and everything will turn out fine. The bottom line is that this is the kind of experience you can expect from "City Lights" throughout. An example of a scene that demonstrates this emotional experience in action is the boxing scene. The scenario is this. The Tramp has to fight in a "fake" boxing match to win money that will help with the blind girl's financial troubles. A fellow boxer agrees to split the prize 50- 50, so that they both technically would win. Unfortunately, this boxer has to bail out of the match since the police are on to him and the boxer that the Tramp has to contend with now says that the "winner takes all". And throughout the match, the Tramp uses a hilarious strategy to try and win the match by hiding behind the referee as much as he can. I won't reveal anything else at this point to those who haven't seen the film yet and want to. All I can say is that this entire scene is representative of the film as a whole: a film that walks steadily on a fine line between comedy and drama and pulls it off perfectly. What's even more admirable is that it's all done solely through visuals and background music. Seeing that this is a silent film, it makes sense to incorporate some over exaggerated actions namely Chaplin's clumsiness in the restaurant with the millionaire. Like animated films, silent pictures depend heavily on their visuals in able to help the film express itself more strongly since of course there's no sound to assist the visuals. And most of the time, the only way it can pull off such a thing is by over exaggerating certain actions. By doing so, we can get more of an idea visually of what our main character is experiencing and therefore be able to relate to him more. And Chaplin hits just the right note as far as that's concerned. Chaplin's silent pictures, especially "City Lights", have lasted more than any other films from the silent era and for good reason. Their stories about persevering to the best of your ability no matter what harsh circumstances you're under have been nothing short of inspiring and uplifting. And no one can fail at seeing that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>City Lights: Or How To Make Famous Actors Weep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Making Jack Lemmon cry is a delight reserved for demented people, but---when he was alive---there WAS a way to make the man weep. Just show him the last scene of City Lights. If you can get hold of the American Film Institute's Top 100 Laughs TV special, you can see for yourself. Lemmon cries while describing the end of this movie. Then I cried. My wife laughed. She's such a little trooper.I won't give away what that last scene is, but it's easy to see how it could make a person bust up just thinking about it. Charlie Chaplin was certainly not afraid to hit those maudlin notes. His Tramp character was lovable enough and Chaplin the artist was talented enough to get away with milking you for every emotion you've got. Funny how some people can mix tones in the same movie and make it work so well while others can't even get one tone right.The story: the Tramp makes friends with a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) and works various jobs to help support her. She doesn't know he's broke, instead thinking he's a rich benefactor. Along the way he tries his hand at a few different vocations, including a hilarious attempt at being a boxer. He also parties a lot with an actual rich man (Harry Myers) who spends most of the movie drunk as a monkey. Whenever he sobers up, out goes the Tramp. No one can ever see our hero for who he truly is.City Lights is a short and pithy movie, as were most of CC's works. He knew how to tell a compact story with oodles of hijinks, a little drama, a message and plenty of feeling. The AFI definitely had l'amour for this picture, ranking it 76th and then 11th on their 1998 and then 2007 Top 100 lists. That's a remarkable leap in the span of 10 years. Do you feel that strongly about City Lights too? I'm not quite as enamoured with it as the AFI, but it's a wonderful picture. Jack Lemmon's sloppy tears are proof.If you dug this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the "Podcasts" section for our 23-minute City Lights 'cast...and many others.

		<shortDescription>I was never aware that silent films could be masterpieces!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never before seen a full silent movie and obviously, never seen a Chaplin film. I didn't know, going into the film, what to really expect. I didn't think I would be able to stand a whole film without any dialogue. I honestly didn't think that slapstick humor, to the extent that I've seen in a few clips from Chaplin films would appeal to me. Thankfully, I was more than wrong. Charlie Chaplin is not only a funny film, but it is an extremely touching film. The performances are fanastic, especially by legend Charlie Chaplin who was perfect as the often clumsy Tramp. The story was so moving that the 90 minute duration was forgotten by me right throughout the film.The Tramp meets a blind flower girl and immediately falls in love with her. On eday, he rescues a millionaire as he was about to commit suicide and convinces him to not destroy his life. The drunk millionaire befriends The Tramp to the extent of allowing him to stay at the man's mansion, use his car and even borrow money. The Tramp, one day, spies on the blind girl's window and sees a doctor by the girl's bedside and realizes that she is sick. He also discovers that the girl and his grandmother may be forced to leave if they cannot pay their rent in time. 'City Lights' then follows The Tramp's hilarious adventure to try and get enough money to save the girl and her grandmother, whilst running into plenty of trouble.Charlie Chaplin perfectly portrays the Tramp as an extremely peculiar looking and clumsy man yet also brings extreme heart and love to the role. His fantastic performance is matched by Virginia Cherrill who portrays the blind flower girl extremely well. Inarguably, both were fantastic but their brilliance is more evident due to the fact that 'City Lights' is a silent film that has no dialogue. The ability to portray an entire film simply out of facial expressions is absolutely fantastic.My expectations for 'City Light' were to see a completely slap stick humored film. Whilst there is plenty of slapstick humor, the film is incredibly touching and powerful written and directed brilliantly by Sir Charles Chaplin. The humor is plenty throughout the 90 minute duration of the film and whilst the emotion is limited, when emotional scenes are shown in the film they work brilliantly. 'City Lights' is yet another one of those films that many people underestimate and jump to speculations which turn out wrong.'City Lights' is such a brilliant film that is pretty much flawless, making for the most entertaining 90 minutes without any words uttered out of mouths! The brilliance of this film is more evident for myself, as I now wish to see more Chaplin classics! Featuring fantastic performances and a great story, City Lights is definitely one of the classics that every movie lover must view sometime in their life. It is the Star Wars of its era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most satisfying cinematic experience I've ever had</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By 1930, the silent era was coming to a rapid end. All doubters thinking that the 'talkie' craze would not last were having a wake-up call, and silent geniuses such as Buster Keaton, Douglas Fairbanks, and Charlie Chaplin, were potentially seeing their highly successful careers melting away. Chaplin began work on City Lights back in 1928, yet a troubled and stressful shoot caused production to run until 1931, when Hollywood had all but given itself over to the new talkie era. Refusing to let go of his most famous creation, The Tramp, Chaplin endured with his vision and kept City Lights silent, seeing no hope for his beloved character in sound pictures. Chaplin shot sporadically, seemingly around one central, and very simple, idea, and managed to create his greatest work, and undoubtedly one of the greatest films of all time.After a chance encounter with a poor, blind and humble flower girl (Virginia Cherrill), The Tramp falls in love. Smitten, he sits down by the sea where a drunk and eccentric millionaire (Harry Myers) is trying to commit suicide. The Tramp opens the millionaire's eyes to life's simple wonders, so the millionaire treats him to life's luxuries, getting him extremely drunk in the process. After a memorable night, the millionaire sobers up and throws the Tramp out, where he spies the flower girl being visited by a doctor. Desperate to make money for her, he takes a job a street sweeper and gets involved in a winner-takes-all boxing match. Yet everywhere he goes, the drunk millionaire is there ready to whisk him off on another wild night.The juxtaposition of the two central stories in City Nights is relatively strange in terms of relevance to the narrative. The film is clearly a romantic one, which makes it peculiar when it repeatedly cuts to the Tramp's escapades with the millionaire. But Chaplin seems to have incorporated this for two reasons, and two aspects that Chaplin is remembered and adored for - comedy and social commentary. This is Chaplin's most laugh-out-loud film, with the standout being the scene in which the Tramp and millionaire, both highly intoxicated, arrive at a formal party. The Tramp walks across the dance floor, slipping in unfamiliar shoes, trying desperately to stay on his feet. It's a five- second gag, but for me it incorporated all of Chaplin's breathtaking physical ability and subtle energy. Every moment seems like an endless maze of possibilities for Chaplin, squeezing instants of virtuoso out of simple things like lighting a cigar or eating spaghetti.The Great Depression had recently struck the country, and Chaplin uses City Lights as a gloomy insight to the lives of the people hit by poverty. The blind flower girl seems to have nothing, yet is rich in soul and spirit that the Tramp is uncontrollably drawn to. The millionaire is emotionally vacated - miserable, angry and intolerable when sober, yet boisterous and care-free when drunk. By contrasting the poor girl with the empty millionaire in his lonely mansion, Chaplin is championing the human spirit over material wealth, a beautiful sentiment brought to life by some fine scenes of comedy, and a profound statement given the harsh, demoralising times. This no doubt was one of the key factors that led to the film's surprising commercial success, with a hungry and unemployed audience given a sense of hope through Chaplin's magic.It is the most satisfying cinematic experience I've ever had - frequently hilarious, awe-inspiring and exquisitely moving. Although Chaplin would carry on making movies and make another masterpiece in Modern Times (1936), this is the last great 'true' Chaplin, his farewell to the era that served him so well. The final scene is the work of a true craftsman, a moment of sheer beauty. Without ruining anything for those who haven't seen it, the close-up of the Tramp's face overcome with emotion is one of the finest displays of acting I've ever come across, and it is easy to see why this scene is now so widely celebrated. A simply magical experience.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 51City Lights- arguably Chaplin's greatest contribution to film. It completely could be, just not for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, but looking at my record with his films- The Great Dictator is one of the best of all time and Modern Times was hilarious, while The Kid was boring, I have to say this one is just below Modern Times.I watch a Charlie Chaplin movie to see slapstick primarily and watch a very high quality silent film. City Lights is more of a drama, due to the primary storyline of the blind flower girl. The story is incredibly touching. The actors involved put on the performances of a lifetime, especially considering their off-screen relationship. But it reduced the laughs, and not once did I laugh out loud like the food machine in Modern Times. The subplot about the millionaire was funny though.I think a second viewing in the future will be very rewarding, knowing what the film really is. That's my advice to you: recognize this as a dramedy. The film will be much more fulfilling. 8.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A true master of comedy of all eras.The only comedy movie that takes you to the verge of shedding a tear or two, a situation further exacerbated by the euphonious background music, towards the end of the movie.I am dumbfounded as to how he could think of such a script that forces people of all ages chortle. The scene before the boxing match and the entire boxing match sequence was the best part of the movie, i felt.He falls in love with a blind flower vendor and vows to help her financially. He befriends a man who is about to commit suicide and their friendship lasts as long as the man remains inebriated. He arranges the amount for the woman's surgery and serves a term in the prison.The tramp is out of the prison with tattered clothes and is ridiculed by children, snubbed by the one he loves the most and yet he stays there grinning at the woman until she realizes her benefactor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin is a tramp, blown hither and thither by the winds of fate in this film. The set pieces, including Charlie as a boxer and Charlie rescuing a man (George Myers as a rich drunk) from suicide are fantastic. The boxing scene in particular is the work of genius because it involves in the fight as Charlie tries to avoid being beaten to a pulp. The final scene is beautiful as the girl (Virginia Cherrill) who had been laughing at Charlie, not knowing he was the man who had extended a lot of kindness to her, realizes that he is the man who had been kind to her when she couldn't see.Chaplin's appreciation for the universality of physical comedy and his appropriation of an everyman persona as the tramp went a long way to solidifying his appeal. He created a character which was universally recognizable and many people could relate to. Making such a sympa character makes it possible for Chaplin to appeal to many people and he does. Chaplin's use of the mundane and the everyday in his movies made for scenes which were funny while also being everyday. Chaplin's placing of his tramp character in settings that many people were familiar with, and the fact that his Tramp character was an everyman, made his films attractive for many people. This film is certainly one of them.The acting from Myers and Cherrill is excellent and Chaplin also delivers a very good performance. Highly recommended and it's easy to see that Chaplin was a genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was first exposed to Chaplin as a kid, through his short films. And though I enjoyed them a lot, when I grew up I mostly put him in same league with Lauren and Hardy, Three Stooges etc that is really good at visual gags but not much else. Though I liked him I couldn't understand him being considered one of the greatest directors, I thought maybe that was due to nostalgia people have about their childhood.How wrong I was, when I finally did see a full length movie, I was amazed. Chaplin certainly deserves his reputation. And this is my favorite Chaplin movie. It is one of most poignant, touching love stories. It has its funny parts too but those were overshadowed for me by the touching parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic triumph ... a universal masterpiece ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin was the greatest film-maker of all-time ? and only two words are enough to measure up the greatness of his talent and its cultural significance in Cinema's history: "City Lights", a title that resonates in my heart as the most inspiring triumph of the human spirit. "City Lights" is not just a film; it's a cinematic gift from a genius, who sublimated the simplicity of the pantomime to create the greatest and most universal romantic comedy that ever enchanted the silver screen.The universality and emotionality of the film have remained intact, and continue to provoke the laughs and the tears of movie lovers all over the world even after 80 years. It's an incredible achievement because it stood the test of time and transcended the geographical barriers when other classics are more appreciated in a sort of sentimental and magnanimous way, as if we're trying to repress the feeling that some elements have obviously dated. But Chaplin's film hasn't dated because it chose to be dated from the start, at the time of its release. It was a silent movie in the talking era, when all the fans were enthusiastic of hearing shouts, screams, cars, declarations of loves, bad-ass dialogs and all that new stuff, Chaplin, in an admirable confidence, did what he did the best, the pantomime, the only language that could fit for the most fascinating cinematic character: the Little Tramp.And what could have been a timely weakness quickly became the film's ticket for immortality. 1931's audiences applauded the film as a celebration of humanism that could never be imitated again. And only a movie with no words could have touched the hearts of so many people in the world, precisely, during an era where laughs and cheers, trust and optimism were needed. It didn't take a political or a denunciative approach to inspire the hearts, only laughs, cheers and the depiction of the most beautiful and valuables virtues of humanity. No speeches needed, words were as meaningless as these hilarious squawks we heard at the beginning. This gibberish talk is Chaplin reminding us of the futility of words, and we trust him. Maybe, dialogs make you miss the essential in a film.Antoine De Saint Exupéry, who wrote "The Little Prince", said: "One sees well only with the heart. The essential is invisible to the eyes." I guess for Chaplin, who shared the same humanism of the French writer and pilot, you could translate his view on dialogs by this paraphrase : "One sees well only with the eyes and the heart. The essential is inaudible to the ears" No need for words but in "City Lights", our ears are enchanted by the beautiful "flower girl" melody, and sadness and happiness that inhabit the film has never been so graciously embodied. And while we float in this atmosphere, the action that follows is the tribute of Chaplin's comic genius, his body language and facial expressions are so rich, so fragile I can imagine my inner child being amused by this film, while I'm moved as an adult, by the purity of the character who wants to help this blind girl who sells flowers. "The Little Tramp" is the quintessential clown without a make-up and a true hero, a word often overused, but not in this case.The Tramp is a hero because of his altruistic nature. He's apolitical but indirectly highlights the social gaps in the modern cities, without letting the film fall into political denunciation. He saves a rich man who wants to commit a suicide and after having developed a fondness for him, the rich makes him discover the world, amusements, dance clubs, parties, all the decadence of the bourgeoisie where the Tramp obviously doesn't fit. But he stands, as a friend, and uses the friendship to help the blind girl who believes he's a rich man. It's the myth of the Charming Prince revisited by Chaplin, through a character driven by his heart. And despise this nobility of spirit, he's constantly bullied, hit, misunderstood. And this is where resides the sadness of the film, the struggle of the Tramp in this journey into the injustices of society. But he's a man, who gets hit but hits back, never remaining a victim, victims are helpless, the girl is helpless, if he becomes so, she has no salvation, the girl is his inspiration, and the only one who never harms him in the film.And boy, how many hits did he get ... of course, I'm referring to the hilarious legendary boxing scene ... probably one of the greatest Chaplin's moments. It has the format of his short stories, but here it does have a particular meaning, since we know what drives him to do so, he wants to get the money to pay the rent for the blind girl, his challenge is our hope, and we hope he'll get it. And as the ultimate tragic hero, not only he'll help her, but he'll get enough money to cure her blindness, before going to jail, rejected by the same rich friend who gave him the money. Rich are so rich, they're perverted by money, and treat friends as they deal with valuable things, but things have no value, love, feeling and generosity have.And the value of these things are illustrated in one of the greatest, if not the greatest concluding scene ever, where the blind girl, now cured, after giving the rose to the Tramp, understands that he is the "rich man", the Charming Prince who haunted her dreams. The Tramp is anxious, and timidly asks her if she can see now. The answer of the girl and the breathtaking concluding smile of the Tramp create the most beautiful and inspiring ending ever. Because she had just realized that she saw the essential, which ironically, was invisible to the eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intellectual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a brilliant movie with simple approach, face expressions and body language delivered the message louder than words. Charlie Chaplin manages to expose the contrast in our lives between rich and poor and between dreams and reality. The first point has been delivered in the first seen, when group of politicians were celebrating a monument that has been built by donated money. Charlie Chaplin (a homeless man) was sleeping under the cover of the statue. This seen highlighted the contrast between money spent for cosmetic projects that does not add any value to eliminate hanger and improve the life of the neediest parts of the community. The message is that we are spending money and willing to provide funding for project that at most just cosmetic, and ignore funding to fight hunger, homelessness and curable diseases in our own backyard in the US. We see the same today, almost seventy years after the movie. The willingness to spend many billions on wars, supporting dictators, stadiums, art, and music, on the other hand, the community organized huge resistance to provide health care service for every American. The movie continued to highlight the wide gap between the rich and the poor in our community. The movie showed how a $10 can buy whole day worth of work for the blind girl and send her home for the day. The rich mane has many of those bills in his pocket as pocket cash. The same point is emphasized when the drunk rich man wanted to help and offered a $1000 to help. This amount of money was part of the pocket cash again. The movie proceed to show that portion of the rich man pocket cash was able to keep the blind lady and her old grandmother at their rented home, and cure her vision in addition to opening her own flower shop. The idea of just a portion of a pocket cash of someone can make this huge impact on someone else life is sad reality. It applies to all of us today, the few dollars we spend every day on coffee, cigarettes, and other unessential expenses can make huge difference in someone else life, in this country and in other countries. The culture of spending money we don't have to buy things we will never use is a very well established culture, proved by a simple trip to the nearest Costco or mall. The rich man drives a Rolls Royce (that he was willing to give it as gift in exchange for few happy moments with his "friend" Charlie Chaplin) and he has several servants at his home. The movie succeeded in denying the association between money and happiness. The rich man was not happy and was trying to end his own life; however, unintentionally he was able to introduce major happiness to others. The fact that he was drunk when he offered the money is an indicator that people are good when they are at their simplest form, and turn to monsters when they are back to their complicated personality.At many points, the movie highlighted the harsh reality of the tough job market. The humiliation of cleaning after horses and "elephants" and the job as a boxer to make money were stretched to make the message louder. My personal believe is that money and wealth belong to god, wealthy people are just in control of the wealth in behalf of god and spending money is regulated on the basis of helping the bigger benefit of the community. Over spending is discouraged and greed is discouraged. The spending is to be balanced between the extremes. God like to see the signs of his gifts on his creations. The movie did not touch directly on the social justice and the lack of it; however, it highlighted the dark side of capitalism, homelessness, eviction, medical coverage, and low end jobs brutality. The movie triggered thoughts in many directions due the lack of the sound conversation. This may lead to stretch of what really the movie is trying to say and deliver to the viewers. It opened the door for multiple interpretations for the same seen based on one's background and believes. In conclusion, the movie is intellectual and it is everything but just a popcorn movie.The movie successfully delivered the message that capitalism comes with heavy price. The dark side of capitalism can be minimized by having social justice and implementing social services to benefit the least fortunate among us and the sick.Advance social services do not contradict with capitalism as far as I understood capitalism. Advanced social services may hurt certain business like insurance companies and other business that makes money from the misery of people. The contradiction is how such a religious country like the US denies social services and support for the poor and the sick. It seems to me that money rules, and money map our lives much more than out believes. I always support my claim with our consistent attempts to cash in our ethics like legalizing gambling and certain types of drugs. Some communities went further and legalized prostitution. As I am living in this free country, I am always amazed how major issues are not negotiable and taken granted forever as in the availability and abuse of alcohol and "right" to have sex without restrictions. We choose to deal with the end effect of alcohol but never question its availability and accessibility equally to under-aged and mature abusers. The same applies to our solution to the teen pregnancy where the best we did is making condoms available.This movie was one of the intellectual movies that managed to deliver a clear message by highlighting contradictions in our daily live. I enjoyed the movie and it made it to my favorite movies list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sound was quickly taking over the film industry, and there was a lot of worry as to whether the star of such great silent classics like The Gold Rush and Modern Times could still make people sit through it, of course the answer was yes. Basically the Tramp (Sir Charlie Chaplin, also directing), broke and homeless, stops a drunk and Eccentric Millionaire (Harry Myers) committing suicide, and they become friends, well, at least until he sobers up. The two of them go drinking and partying together, the Millionaire even gives the Tramp his Rolls Royce, and one day walking the streets he meets a poor blind Flower Girl (Virginia Cherrill), and she believes him to be a millionaire, so he just goes along with this. To earn some money and help out his new love interest pay her overdue rent money, or face eviction from her apartment, the Tramp gets a job sweeping the streets, which he quickly loses. He is then approached by a man who offers him a high sum if he can beat another man in a boxing match, which of course the Tramp fails to win, and it looks like the poor Girl is to be evicted. However, the Tramp meets up with the Millionaire who cheerfully gives him a $1000, which can pay for both the rent, and an advertised eye operation for the Girl to gain her sight back. He is accused of stealing this money from the Millionaire and goes to jail, and months later when he released he searches for the Girl, who is looking for the Millioanire who has been so good to her. In the end the pair find each other, the Girl with her eye sight restored runs a flower shop with her Grandmother (Florence Lee), and seeing him she knows the Tramp isn't rich, but it doesn't matter, it is a happy ending as they both hold back tears. Also starring Allan 'Al' Ernest Garcia as the Butler and Hank Mann as A Prizefighter. Chaplin is still wonderful as the lovable Tramp with his slapstick comedy moments, great facial expressions and the famous waddle walk, and Cherrill makes a marvellous love interest. It is a beautifully told story with both very funny moments, but also surprisingly emotional scenes involving the tragic blindness using depths of pathos, a magnificent silent comedy romance. Sir Charlie Chaplin was number 50 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 24 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, he was number 38 on The World's Greatest Actor, and he was number 67 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 76 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 38 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Passions. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Say what you want about his politics, his love life, his Victorian sentiment, or his overwhelming ego; if Charlie Chaplin had never made another film he would still be justifiably famous, not only for creating a masterpiece, but for single-handedly keeping the art of silent comedy alive long after its untimely death. It's ironic how the passing of silence liberated Chaplin to a point where he could fully express his pantomime genius and find, at long last, the elusive tertium quid between laughter and tears. Was there ever a more unpredictable companion than millionaire Harry Myers, matching the Little Tramp drink for drink until the sober light of dawn revealed the callous Jekyll behind his generous Hyde? And was there ever a more heartbreaking moment than the final, devastating close-up, when the once blind flower girl confronts the shabby vagabond she thought was her handsome young benefactor? "I can see now", her poignant last words, leave more unsaid than Chaplin would later be in the habit of leaving, and however unintended reveal striking insight at a time when every other movie was saying, "I can hear now".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quintessentially Chaplin's Little Tramp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"City Lights" came out 3 years after the "talkies" took over -- which Chaplin didn't like, he much preferred silent films and his style of physical, visual comedy (and no wonder, he was a genius at it). "CL" takes a few shots at the talkies, as in speeches by politicians in which -- instead of spoken words, the sounds that match their speaking are much like kazoos imitating speech intonations, inflections. "CL" was snubbed by the Oscars committee possibly for this attitude but, since then, "CL" is widely considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time. It's on Ebert's Great Films list; it's #70 on IMDb's list of all time 250 greatest movies; AFI (American Film Institute) ranks it #1 among romantic comedies."CL" gives us the essential, iconic Little Tramp and a large heaping of Chaplin's gifts for physical comedy -- scenes of him impaling his pants on a statue's sword, as a street sweeper trying to avoid picking up after a group of horses only to run into an elephant, his boxing scene, getting in and out of cars, dance parties, etc.It also gives us the poignancy that Chaplin's Little Tramp specialized in, probably more than any other movie he made. The LT is attracted to a blind flower girl (roughly 20? 23? years old) and, after determining that she's blind, resolves to help her. She thinks he's wealthy and the LT doesn't correct this misbelief.The LT also runs into an alcoholic, suicidal millionaire and prevents him from committing suicide several times. Whenever he's drunk, this A$M calls the LT his best friend but, whenever he's sober, he has no memory of their relationship and orders him away from him.So there are two central characters in the movie -- each blind in their own ways to the LT -- the girl recognizes his true compassion but not his lack of wealth or low status. The A$M recognizes the LT's value and compassion only when he's drunk, never when sober. A couple young newspaper boys never recognize his value and try to torment him whenever they see him.The LT sees a newspaper article about a surgeon in Europe who's able to restore sight to those with the blind girl's condition. The LT, after many failed attempts, is finally able to get and give her the money to have the operation that restores her sight.The final scene in the movie -- in which she, with her vision restored doesn't recognize the LT by sight but does so by feeling his hand -- has often been described as one of the most moving in all film history.BTW, Chaplin also composed all the music for the film including the song, "Who will buy my pretty violets?", the theme played when the blind flower girl was on screen. Chaplin couldn't read or write music but he was an accomplished amateur pianist and violinist. He employed a musician to listen to his playing and transcribe it into musical notation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Charlie Chaplin's best films, 'City Lights' presents him at his best. It is funny - the scenes with the millionaire and at the boxing ring are priceless. It has that ending which is one of the best in cinema, and thus makes this film a great love story. It has a wonderful score by Chaplin himself with a number of themes which pinpoint the action and manipulate the audience into reacting to what they see in a particular way. And it is a silent film, alone is a sea of early sound features.All of this adds up to make a special experience. If you are seeing this for the first time, you won't know what to expect and you'll probably laugh, cry, and every emotion in-between. If you're seeing it after many previous viewings, you'll spot things you haven't seen before. Such was Chaplin's inventiveness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a child of the Sixties, and many of the attitudes I formed were based on essentially special moments, it seems to me. One of my parent's friends opined one evening, stridently, vigourously, something to the effect that because Charlie Chaplin was a Communist everything he ever did was therefore artistically inadmissible. There are times in life where something you hear you instantly know is either completely wrong or right. I knew then that this had to be wrong, even though I had never seen anything more than a snippet of Chaplin's work.Many of what are considered great films were not shown anywhere, not on TV, certainly not on the big screen, for most of my early life. So it is that in my recent viewing of "City Lights" I saw my first full length Chaplin film. And I was not disappointed.In this movie there are only a handful of main characters. Chaplin's little tramp is of course prominent, but the key supporting players certainly get a lot of screen time. Among them is the blind flower girl who becomes the center of the tramp's attention, her grandmother, and a very rich and also very boozy benefactor of sorts. The rich man's butler has a significant part. There are many, many players with brief parts.As far as a plot goes, the tramp meets the blind flower girl and of course he is able over time to appear to her as a wealthy kind-of boyfriend; he helps her when he can. He is smitten with her. In the meantime the tramp has run into the rich man, their initial meeting being the tramp's intervention in the others suicide attempt.But the benefactor has mercurial fits of memory loss and gain, so his generous gestures are at best unreliable. In the midst of the tramp's efforts to do what we would term the right thing, other confounding moments occur. Which leads us to the comedy part.In effect the tramp runs into troubles at every turn. His helpful and often unsolicited attempts make things right do not necessarily provide a real advantage for him or those about him. He does get the money to help the flower girl and grandmother, but at a price.It is fun to watch the little tramp and his antics. Chaplin could certainly do physical comedy, and his attempts at this are very honest, involving tremendous eye to detail touches in all scenes. At one point he briefly eludes two policemen; his quickness and well-rehearsed reaction is actually difficult to follow. I have read about the ending previously from a few sources, but no spoilers were among them. I appreciate this because the last few moments of "City Lights" deliver a terrific payoff. And its nice to know a boyhood suspicion was well-founded.Three Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realize this review is a little late- I apologize. Saw the Chaplin flick "City Lights" last night, and I was really impressed. It was full of socialist commentary and beautiful women. The last scene made me cry (well OK, maybe just get a little maudlin). It was great, because it was all about good karma. I really enjoyed the scenes of Chaplin working on this film on the "Special Features" disc of the "Chaplin Collection". Especially enlightening was the story of Chaplin's conflict with his ingénue Virginia Cherrill. The outtakes of his replacement for her character, Georgia Hale, after he fired her (temporarily) show that as good as an actor/actress is, they are not perfect for every role. Sometimes you need someone totally outside of the game, as Cherill was, in order to create perfection on film, which the last scene is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles once cited as his favorite movie Charlie Chaplin's tribute to the art of body language and pantomime, "City Lights." "I was determined to continue making silent films," Chaplin recalls in "My Life in Pictures" of his decision to make a silent four years into the talkie era, "for I believed there was room for all types of entertainment." "City Lights" features Chaplin's musical composition and various sound effects, but no dialogue. Chaplin opens the film with a lampoon of talkies: at the unveiling of a Greco-Roman stone statue, the dignitaries' speeches are heard only as unintelligible squawks.Smitten by a flower-selling Blind Girl (Virginia Sherrill) who has mistaken him for a dapper gentleman, the Little Tramp takes on odd jobs (including a prizefight, shown in a masterfully choreographed sequence) to raise money for an operation to restore her vision. After the Tramp intervenes to prevent the suicide of an alcoholic tycoon, the tycoon befriends him; but it is an on and off friendship, as when sober the tycoon doesn't even recognize the Tramp. Despite a series of mishaps, the Tramp pays for the operation. But in the process he lands in prison. On the Tramp's elease, the Blind Girl learns the true identity of her benefactor in one of the most rarified scenes in cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin's Masterpiece Of Comedy &amp; Pathos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chaplin edited, wrote, directed, and produced City Lights over a three year period. He initiated the film just before releasing The Circus, and he released it in January of 1931. Talking pictures were all the rage at the time, having been in vogue for a few years at this point, so it's no surprise that Chaplin at least added sound to City Lights, albeit in a limited capacity. The film is deceptively simple both in its plot and in its construction. Chaplin the perfectionist used hundreds of takes once again to get scenes right. As in The Gold Rush and in The Circus, Chaplin used an unknown female for the lead: Virginia Cherrill, who would become one of Cary Grant's wives a few years later. City Lights was Cherrill's debut film, and she and Chaplin did not get along. Chaplin even tried to replace her with Georgia Hale, his lead from The Gold Rush, before realizing it wouldn't be practical. Oddly enough, Cherrill's career lasted only fourteen films.The film contains all the Chaplin trademarks: Comedy, great editing and performances from the entire cast, pantomime, pathos, perfect timing, sight gags, and a wonderful feeling at the end. A blind flower girl, played by Cherrill, mistakes a tramp for a rich man. The tramp then feels obligated to help the girl. As usual, the plot of Chaplin's film is paper thin, but its execution is what matters. Along the way are many comic highlights including the opening statue sequence, the sidewalk scene with the nude sculpture/statue, saving the millionaire on the waterfront, the spaghetti noodle restaurant scene, and of course the famous boxing scene derived from his earlier film: The Champion.Chaplin composed the music for this film, and it is the first time he composed the music for the original release of one of his films, although in later years, he composed scores for several of his earlier films and re-released them. The music is quite memorable, and it's perfect for this film. The cinematography and editing are terrific; oddly this would be the last original film Chaplin would edit. The last ten minutes are cinematic perfection and may well be one of the most recognized scenes in the history of cinema. Although the ending itself is ambiguous, the scene is very poignant and moving. The camera dwells on each character's face for just the right amount of time and their faces express everything. Without words, Chaplin gives us one of the greatest endings in motion picture history.The four principal actors, aside from Virginia Cherrill, enjoyed long successful careers in silent films and then in talking pictures in small parts with the exception of Florence Lee, the girl's mother. This was her last film. Hank Mann, Chaplin's opponent in the boxing match, was the last surviving member of the original Keystone cops. Albert Austin, one of Chaplin's regular actors, appears in his last film in a couple of bit roles. **** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin excels again by delivering a bittersweet classic that mixes a good story with comedy and a timeless ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe it or not (especially nowadays) there was a movement of actors, producers, and directors that didn't like the addition of speech to cinema. While most of these "voices" didn't hold much weight, they did have one frontrunner that could definitely dent the industry of "Talkies," and that was Charlie Chaplin. Chaplin was so strongly against movies with dialogue, that he continued making silent movies (then eventually with sounds) way after the fad had died. Among his films that defied the industry was the charming City Lights. City Lights is a good bubbly film that has easily one of the best endings in the history of motion pictures. Combining slapstick comedy with good direction, a nice musical score, and a dosage of drama, City Lights is another tour-de-force from Chaplin.There are two plot lines to City Lights, both of them involving The Tramp (Chaplin of course). In one tale, The Tramp tries to help and win the heart of a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill). In the other tale, the Tramp experiences a series of antics with a millionaire that gets drunk every evening with him, but then doesn't remember him the very next morning. Both plots mingle a few times, and complement each other as they advance the story forward. The Tramp in the latter half of the movie falls for the flower girl so severely that he begins working any sort of job to come up with the money to fix her vision.Chaplin was one of the most talented men Hollywood has ever had the privilege of supporting; the man can act, direct, write, and even compose music. The music helps make up for the total lack of dialogue and very limited sound. His story at the time was a bit original, as the lead female couldn't see, which adds a dimension of innocence to her character. She represents purity, kindness, and what's right with the world. In the meantime, the drunken millionaire represents all that is wrong. The balance between the two gives City Lights its roller coaster feel, much like the city-like atmosphere setting in the movie. Most of the sight/humorous gags were with the millionaire, while the drama was saved for the scenes with the flower girl. Chaplin himself provides all the funniest moments in the movie, especially the incredible boxing scene.With that being said however, City Lights gets a little repetitive in its jokes, which makes it overall a weaker comedy than The Gold Rush. Whether it's the joke about the amnesic millionaire, the repetitive moments of the kids spitting at the Tramp, or the scene with the chairs; City Lights has a lot of good funny scenes, but they lose flavor and quality once you see them again and again. The Gold Rush doesn't have this problem, as their gags are very varied and never repeat. The Gold Rush also has a much better cast of supporting characters, and has better cinematography.But, the one thing The Gold Rush doesn't have is the incredible ending that City Lights has. In my opinion, if you can't end the movie on a good note, you better be sure to craft a masterpiece of a flick throughout the first two acts. A great ending can save a movie, and a bad ending can utterly destroy a good movie as well. City Lights has the perfect ending for the content presented; it could not have ended in a better way. At this moment, the directing, editing, acting, and music was at its best; its as if Chaplin had saved his best efforts for last. The payoff is grand, and the tears just might stream down your face. That is, if you know what love is.Bottom Line: As a modern, bitter, out-of-the-box independent critic, I try to step away from the expected boundaries of the typical film critic; I try to not give in to the regular mannerisms of the people that get paid to criticize movies past and present. The usual film critic shall state that City Lights was Chaplin at his prime blah blah blah. This isn't the case, as Chaplin has done better work before (Gold Rush; his best work) and since (Great Dictator, a long monologue away from perfection). But, this is a good movie, and is one of the earliest examples of a spectacular ending. City Lights is better and ages better than the typical silent movie, it can hold its own with romantic comedies of today. Its charming story will keep you entertained, and its ending will leave you breathless, wondering why movies of today don't try to end in the same fashion (or at least with the same amount of effort). City Lights is a nice "comedy romance in pantomime."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seventy years old and still a powerhouse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The infamous Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) befriends a sightless flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) and vows to cure her blindness. Every penny as poor as the girl is, he embarks on a series of misanthropic adventures that transport him from the center of a boxing ring to the house of an eccentric millionaire (Harry Myers), who shuns the Tramp when sober and treasures his company when drunk. All the while, the flower girl, unable to see his face, mistakes the Tramp for a rich philanthropist, unable to believe that one so destitute could care so deeply for the woes of another.City Lights joins an embarrassingly long list of films that moved me to tears, though not, perhaps, for the typical reasons. On an absolute level, there's something profoundly touching in the Tramp's devotion to the blind girl, but I found myself even more caught up in what Chaplin seemed to be saying about class. That the rich characters are only capable of empathy when alcohol levels the playing field is only one part of the critique. That the Tramp exists in a moral vacuum, that the needs of others are a constant inspiration for everything he does, that his lack of attachments enables him to come to the rescue not only of the flower girl but of the millionaire himself, whose attempted suicide would have been successful if the Tramp hadn't intervened . . . these are just a few of the reasons for why Chaplin's hobo-protagonist is, ironically, the wealthiest character in the movie. Thematically speaking, it's a well-worn path (the charitable bum versus the miserly aristocrat) yet Chaplin attacks the subject in such a simple, exacting, and unobtrusive way that we forget we've encountered it before. We don't come away feeling like we've swallowed a sermon with characters attached to it. We feel like we've witnessed something fresh and new, something funny and tearful and void of baggage.Rare is the movie that combines comedy and drama quite so fluently. While farcical sequences often distract from the film in question, Chaplin's slapstick actually underscores the drama, since the more ridiculous the Tramp's situation becomes, the more impressed we are at the lengths he'll go to in the service of his friend. And the performances in the final scene are about as good as any of seen, if only because they work with so little, and still say so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, The Tramp is the most sympathetic character of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just plain beautiful. This movie proves how Charlie Chaplin could make you feel for a character without saying a word. This movie may not be the funniest Charlie Chaplin movie, but it is the most dramatic. It is amazing that even with all of these silly physical comedy bits you can still get caught up in character development. Chaplin was truly a master of his craft.No need for me to explain the plot, other people have done that (and they do better than I would) No matter who you are, see this movie!!!Watch this movie and be amazed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silence whispers hopeful wishes from the blind girl's eyes in City Lights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally I had a chance to watch a Charlie Chaplin film completely. Thinking the time it was created, it's not possible to become a fan of Chaplin. I said myself "a silent film could be such impressive" after I had watched it. My second language is English and I found the time of speech quotations appropriate and the musics are also so wonderful. Suddenly decreasing and increasing the voice of themes make the film special.After I had watched it, I also taught that lots of scenes of City Lights were used in "Ye&#x15f;ilçam" which is the name of cinema sector in my country, Turkey. I don't know, the other film might have used these scenes completely or as a part, because City Lights really contain too much material. For example, blind girls are so famous here and they usually sell flower in the street while seeking the love of life or a rich and drunk man inclined to suicide is saved by a poor man and they become friends but the rich one doesn't remember when he sobers up.All the things I counted above are enough reasons to watch and admire it. Finally I would like to say that: "Imitations exalt the original."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin at his finest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have loved Chaplin's work since childhood, and through the years have grown to appreciate his art and talent more and more. The plot is simple: the tramp falls in love with a blind flower girl, played by Virgnina Cherrill, and goes to great (and humorous) lengths to raise money for a surgery that is to restore her sight. This is the classic Tramp character at his finest. In City Lights, Chaplin brings such depth to the character, but never fails to amaze with his brilliant comic talent. Cherrill also does a magnificent job; it's almost as though she was really blind, without a hint of even seeing her surroundings. This film was rated as one of the top 100 films of all time (AFI, 1998), within the top 20. At the time of production, nearly all filmmakers turned to films with sound. But of course Chaplin did not cave in, and produced a fantastic silent film, at a time when adding sound was all the rage. Thank goodness for that!I recommend City Lights to absolutely anyone- it never fails to amaze.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Heroic LITTLE TRAMP works to save THE LADY IN DISTRESS and in his Success, Finds Them Both in A Most Impossible Situation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed mainly during 1930 for an early 1931 release, CITY LIGHTS stands as a sort of stubborn display of Mr. Chaplin's determination to stick by the Silent Film form. Charlie still preferred a protracted sight gag to 2 pages of scripted "jokes".The project had started out to be a "Talkie", but somewhere between the start of the shooting and a dispute with his Leading Lady,Virginia Cherrill, the plan was revised in favor of the old way, the method that the Chaplin Company knew and even had been innovators in so many aspects of the Siilent Form.Following his tradition as a sort of Traditional, Classic Story Teller, his cast is credited with portraying characters with no names. The credits in CITY LIGHTS, as in so many of his films up to the 1st true "Takie", THE GREAT DICTATOR(1940).The story in a nutshell takes us to the City, any Metropolis would do. The city scape looks much like a huge tank of tropical fish, with the various inhabitants scurrying to and fro, going to thousands of destinations, all moving at variable speeds. The fellow next to you is barely visible to you as you are to him.On occasion, usually quite by accident, two of our urban denizens "collide" one way or other, and things slow down enough for some meaningful interaction.The first such occurrence happens when The Little Tramp meets up with a beautiful, young Flower Girl(Leading Lady, Virginia Cherrill), who he soon discovers is blind. Because of the proximity of some Limoseines, the Girl mistakenly believes Charlie to be a Rich Millionaire(and that's the best kind!) The Tramp is obviously smitten by the Girl, and his heart also sympathizes with her affliction.A chance meeting with an intoxicated Millionaire(Harry Myers), who befriends The Tramp, and is his best buddy. There is nothing that he won't do for Charlie, unless of course, he is Sober! When the Millionaire is not under the influence, he does not know the Tramp, nor does he remember whatever promises he made to him! Following a meandering odyssey of menial jobs and incidents follow, in which Charlie both helps to support the Girl and her Grandmother, but at the same time, has hopes of saving up money enough money in order to send her to Europe and a cure for her blindness! In getting the money, The Little Tramp winds up in prison for a "Robbery". Once released he is back in the City, where he again meets the Girl.It is at this point that Chaplin gives us his most unusual ending, is not one of the most different wind ups in film History. (If you don'y know what I'm talking about, JUST SEE IT!!) All of this serious talk might lead one to think that there is no humor here. Far from it, as we have a most impressive array of out and out comic action and great gags ever seen, and together in one movie! A few good examples (without giving it away)follows: 1. The opening scene of an Official, White Tie Dedication of a new piece of Public Art*, a new Sculpture in a City Park. 2. An extended bit of interplay between Sanitation Department Street Sweeper(Charlie) and some large animals. 3. The Boxing, the Prizefight between Professional Boxer, (Hank Mann)and the Little Tramp! (about the funniest thing on the screen!) This is one rare Movie, being so well liked by the Public and the Press Boys alike! When the people(Box Office)meets such as written by the Movie Critics(The Film as Art), we are left with a truly, one of a kind only, Comedy Masterpiece.THANK YOU, SIR CHARLES, and may THE LITTLE TRAMP Rest in Peace.NOTE: * Which reminds me: QUESTION: What is the difference between Obscenity and Art?ANSWER: A Federal Grant! (I know it's not germane to the discussion,but the "Art" reference brought it up in my mind.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin,I have heard through various sources,was a hard nosed perfectionist to the point of being downright disliked by some.He was not only the main star of his feature films,he was the creative mastermind behind the scenes as well.He wrote as well as directed.I have a hard time with anyone that difficult and based on what I have learned,probably would not have gotten along with Mr. Chaplin.Even so,I feel that his films are regarded as great because of his hard nosed attitude.Everything had to be perfect and everyone involved must know it.City Lights is another gem born of this hard nosed genius.We have our beloved little tramp making the acquaintance of a blind flower girl.Their meeting is comical,yet sweet.He falls in love immediately as does she.Through his comical,alcohol induced friendship with a millionaire who is down with life,he finds himself taking on the appearance that he is wealthy when he,in fact,is not.His love for this girl runs so deep that he is willing to do anything for her.Anything,that is,except reveal to this girl what he is in reality,fearing her love would fade.City Lights is another masterpiece of comedy laced with tender romantic sweetness from Charlie Chaplin,the hard nosed perfectionist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple Is Fine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chaplin's City Lights has several funny vignettes, including the climactic boxing match and the scene near the beginning where one of the characters is trying to commit suicide. They are the epitome of slapstick. They're largely unvocal and entirely physical. They're unreasonably against reality, and common sense. This kind of humor can be full of laughs, or simply grin-filled appreciation.What I found the most interesting about this film, and the even later Chaplin film that I previously watched, are the mechanics of the earliest kind of cinematic storytelling. The story threads are so simple, and even close to singular. You can hardly call anything a subplot. There is a single journey taken by a character who encounters several others. I found myself engrossed by this sort of plot. Sometimes the most simplistic stories are the most effective. You really find yourself yearning for Chaplin to get the money for this blind girl's rent. The film may be light, and how can it not be? But while you're watching it, you can't treat the story lightly, which is very impressive for such a threadbare film.Also, having already known that Charlie Chaplin was a multi-talent, a performer, a writer, a director, I had no idea he'd written the score playing over the entire film's action. Most silent film scores are not as beautiful as the score in City Lights. Chaplin pumped his score full of hopeful, naive emotion, which suits the tone of the movie perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Odyssey Review #051: City Lights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>051: City Lights (1931) - released 1/30/31; viewed 5/14/06.KEVIN: While watching the film, it's hard to believe that the production of Charlie Chaplin's City Lights could have been more laborious and time-consuming than The Gold Rush. But Chaplin's penchant for perfectionism wasn't about to go away, and fortunately it pays off in spades here. This is surely the real best picture of 1931 (and the competition was stiff as ever). Although it's not as perfect as Gold Rush, it's still a great example of Chaplin's emotionally-rich storytelling craft, and is a slight middle-finger to the staunch supporters of conversion to talkies. The Tramp truly is born for the silent film and nothing else. In my mind, every time I tried to add spoken words to his act, the magic disappeared. Virginia Cherrill isn't the Tramp's greatest female foil, but she does bring exactly the right amount of understated pathos and innocence every second she's on screen. One of my favorite comic sequences in the film is the boxing match, a hilarious mixture of balletic violence and precise comedic timing. The final moments of the film are far superior to the rags-to-riches ending of The Gold Rush as the blind girl with her sight restored sees her benefactor for the first time.DOUG: After enduring the two-day gulag of Cimarron, we move on to the REAL best picture of '31, Charles Chaplin's City Lights. Moviegoers haven't seen Chaplin in three years (about eight months for us), and in that time silent movies had all but vanished?except for Chaplin, who wouldn't let the format in which he had perfected his act go away so easily. I'd been looking forward to watching this film for a very long time, as it shows up on a great many AFI lists, not to mention there were a number of scenes I was hoping to see, especially the boxing scene, where the Tramp uses every trick in the book to keep from getting taken out by his bigger, stronger opponent. We decided to watch it twice, since we were half-awake for most of the first viewing (it was late), not to mention the fact that it really is THAT GOOD. I was surprised that this was quite a different film from The Gold Rush, with a somewhat simpler story and the romantic plot more at the forefront. It is very interesting to see how Chaplin reacted to sound pictures, using sound while not using it; at the beginning, we see people talking at a dedication of a new landmark, but all we hear is a strange buzzing sound (Chaplin blowing a bit of paper against a comb). And what more can be said about Virginia Cherrill, the lovely blind girl whom the Tramp falls for? Her performance is very understated, letting the simplest of gestures and movements tell the whole story (A screen test on the DVD shows Georgia Hale trying for the part when things got rough with Virginia, and her style is much more expressive. How weird is it that Chaplin worked with one actress named Georgia and another named Virginia?). When the ending came up, I knew what was coming, but it's still so incredibly powerful.One parallel I noticed on the second viewing: the Tramp meets up with the millionaire and makes friends with him. The millionaire treats him as his best chum when he's stone drunk, but then forgets it all and rejects him as a vagrant and an intruder when sober. No doubt our Tramp fears a similar rejection from the Girl when she sees what he really is.Last film: Cimarron (1931). Next film: Dracula (1931).</fullReview>

Not being a film-buff by any stretch I knew of Charlie Chaplin mostly by his mustache and little else. For Christmas my girlfriend bought me tickets to the performance by the St. Louis symphony, she hadn't seen the film either but thought it would be an interesting cultural experience... Turns out it was more than interesting, it was superbly entertaining as well! Its a funny thing, the movie on one hand is full of campy physical comedy, but there is nothing saccharin or over-done about it... I believe its because Chaplin is so genuine. Charlie Chaplin can make you laugh with his characters foolishness in one scene, wit in another, and then touch your heart with genuine compassion that is absent from today's movies.For purity of story its hard to beat this superbly crafted film experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike most of the other reviewers, I'm not really a huge Chaplin fan. In fact, to be perfectly honest, most of his movies bore me to tears. But this Chaplin film was different. It had a much warmer feel to it. There was something special about it. It's hard to describe, maybe because it isn't so much any specific part of the movie, but rather the feelings that the movie brings out. I watched it, as if I was hypnotized and when the movie was finished I found myself thinking "Now that's a nice movie!" I believe the mark of any truly great film is the emotion it's able to evoke. So this movie is nothing less than a huge success regardless if it makes it on any top ten lists or not. If you're looking to see Chaplin at his best I highly recommend you start with this warm, light-hearted film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of seeing a screening of this film (silent, though it came out well into the sound era) with live music accompaniment by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. As you can imagine, this added a tremendous amount to the overall effect of the movie, which I had seen once before on video. This is Chaplin at his most unabashedly sentimental, but darn it if it doesn't work like a charm. This feels the most dramatic of the Chaplin films I've seen, with the most "plot," but that doesn't mean there aren't wildly funny bits, like Chaplin's brief stint as a boxer. I don't cry especially easily at movies, so the ending didn't have me in tears, but you're excused if it has that effect on you, and you might want to have a handkerchief handy just in case.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin was a film genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I join with many others here saying that this is one of the greatest films ever made, and in my all-time Top 5. It is a testament to the genius of Chaplin that he has made three "classics" - City Lights, The Gold Rush, and Modern Times - that people argue about to this day which is the greater film. I will say that Modern Times is the most accessible of these three to the current film-goer because it's the one which uses sound most extensively, and that The Gold Rush has more classic comedic bits, but for me it's always been City Lights, as this is the film that strikes the best balance of slapstick and pathos together, where you're laughing one moment, and then greatly moved in another.I was fortunate that I first saw this movie in a film class in college. I am embarrassed to say that all I knew about Chaplin was his comedic shorts, so this was a great surprise to see City Lights. I was fortunate however, in that I had no idea what this film was about, and in what high esteem this film was held. The ending is moving and tugs at the heart. I don't know if it's the greatest ending I've ever seen in a movie (I might have to give that to Chinatown), but I love it and the movie.I don't know if the PBS Special "Unknown Chaplin" is floating around anywhere on video or DVD, but it's a treasure chest of surprises for City Lights fans. In it, they unearth many of the film outtakes, particularly the number of shots it took to convincingly make the audience understand why the Blind Girl thought the Tramp was a wealthy man. There's also interviews with Virginia Cherrill and Georgia Hale, and how Chaplin didn't care for Cherrill very much, and wanted to replace her with Georgia Hale after almost the entire film had been shot. They even show the final scene with Georgia Hale when she gets her sight back, and wants to give a flower to the Tramp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top ten favorites. City Lights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City Lights (1931) is not only Charles Chaplin's great achievement but it also happens to be one of my top ten favorite films of all time. The emotion and effort that Chaplin put into this film cannot be recreated or matched by anyone. A classic tale about the Little Tramp giving up his livelihood for the benefit of others. Filmed during the height of the Great Depression the situation of life in America has never been caught like this before.The Tramp is hoboing around town doing whatever odd jobs he can find. One day during one of his outings he meets an attractive woman who has an eye sight problem. Smitten, the Tramp vows that she'll see once again. So, he does whatever he has to do to get this young woman to see. He befriends a wealthy drunkard after he saves his life. The problem is that he only recognizes him when he's sloshed out of his gourd. What really moves this film is the great lengths that the Tramp will put his body through for love. When the final scene is shown, you'll understand why many people (including myself) have called this one of the greatest films ever made. Pure magic.A true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece with no national boundaries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much hailed by the critics and audience worldwide, "City Lights" still stand out as one the best movies ever made. Chaplin could rightly be hailed as the "father of slapstick comedy". If only one of Charles Chaplin's films could be preserved, ''City Lights'' would be chosen. The fact that makes "City Lights" better than his other famous movies "Gold Rush" and "Modern Times" is that, Chaplin weaves slapstick, pathos and melodrama into the Tramp with effortless genius.The ending scene of ''City Lights'' is justly famous as one of the great moving moments in the history of movies; the girl's sight has been restored by an operation paid for by the Tramp, now sees him as a bum --but smiles at him and gives him a rose and some money, and then, touching his hands, recognizes them. ''You?'' she asks the Tramp. He nods, tries to smile, and asks, ''You can see now?'' ''Yes,'' she says, and accepts him. This scene has been shamelessly copied by a lot of romantic movies (language being no barrier), that no one knows the source of this scene, just like how Akira Kurusawa's creation of "hero's-entry-action scene-has-nothing-to-do-with-the-plot" in "Seven Samurai" has been repeated in all Bond movies.The movie contains some of his great comic sequences, including the famous fight in which the Tramp always keeps the referee between himself and his opponent and the scene, where a statue is unveiled to find the Tramp asleep in the lap of a heroic Roman stone figure.Its the finer touches which make the movie a classic, consider the scene where the tramp goes to the blind girl's house to give her the money for an eye operation. He has prudently stashed $100 in his pocket for his own needs, but after she kisses his hand, reaches in his pocket, and gives her the final bill.Chaplin's movies knew no national boundaries. His films went everywhere without regard for language. His movies, along with the early works of Walt Disney ("Pinocchio", "Snow White", etc) could be recommended to any parent for their children's DVD collection. Comedy movies being made now all have a "Blockbuster" tone to it and try to add hidden-meaning dialogs (could be seen in "Shrek" movies, where kids would not understand many jokes made for adults) to it.The movie deserves the praise it has gathered over the years. It been listed in American Film Institutes's top 100 movies list, Roger Ebert's Great Movies list and Sight &amp; Sound's list of the 10 greatest films ever made. Even though Chaplin would been listed along with Buster Keaton (his main rival in comedy in his days), Sergei M. Eisenstein and Fritz Lang in many critics' list of giants of silent movies, Chaplin is more famous among the audience and would continue to live in the years to come.If you haven't started with Chaplin, this is the first movie to rent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No doubt: A classic !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I more and more turn to appreciate classics like "City Lights". It's a welcome change to all those new pictures you can see these days. No need for complicated explanations.This gem is a great Job done in the year 1931 by Charles Chaplin who (as very often) directed, wrote, edited, composed and produced. The "City Lights" plot in my point of view is very well considered and done representing the symptom of an extremely conflicting time in history. Many humorous idea's conclude an excellent comedy which for me didn't get boring. If you get the chance to watch this don't miss it.In a short: One of the best silent movies (a part of a movie history, that shouldn't be forgotten frivolously) !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No words can describe the majestic nobility of this movie. Every time I see a new movie coming out that is touted as the greatest thing since sliced bread, plastic and microwave technology, I sink deeper into an unspoken depression because this movie has not surged forth as one of the truly sublime creations of the entire film era.It's simplicity cloaks a recondite whole that few will admit to understanding. Yet Chaplin speaks in an easily understandable language: the speech of human movement and emotion.To say that Chaplin was a master is understating the breadth of his gifts. He combined comedy with pathos, added a hefty dash of physical comedy and threw it all into a bowl of drama. Deep, personal drama. The kind of drama that envelops our daily lives but we are too aware of the rest of the world to discern it for its full worth. The result is a delicious meal perfectly and equally suitable for a gourmet or a gourmand.Many mistake his brand of comedy for vapid sentimentality. But they are missing the reality that life is full of sentiment...pure and noble sentiment. Chaplin's passion is universal and it has lasted for nearly a hundred years -- there is no doubt that his brand of life's basic truths will endure until there is a new heaven and a new Earth.CITY LIGHTS mixes the very best that Chaplin had to offer. A gentle story, comedic interludes, human tragedy and a sense for the grandiloquence in the most innocent and tender emotions that humankind can conjure.SIDE NOTE: One of Chaplin's gifts was his musicmaking. Although I treasure all of his creations, I am glad that IMDB.com finally headed my suggestion and gave credit to, José Padilla, the Spanish composer of the famous "Flower Girl' music as it should be. The correct name of the song is "LA VIOLETERA"; which means the "girl who sells violets".If you treasure human feeling and human comedy in all its veils and ramifications, CITY LIGHTS is the movie for you.10+/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>City Lights (1931) ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first Chaplin film was a rousing success! I really liked the funny yet heartwarming story, which came very close to putting a tear in my eye at the very end. What was very interesting to me was learning that Chaplin preferred to make this film as a silent, when sound films were now the order of the day. My favorite moments, "comedy-wise" had to be the zany boxing match, and the moments just before it where Chaplin is in the room getting nervous prior to the bout. It's not hard to see why so many love Chaplin and consider him a genius. Indeed, I have heard from many Chaplin fans that CITY LIGHTS may be his crowning achievement. This one was so enjoyable the first time around that I imagine it would be hard to top for me! Funny and Heartwarming; A Great Film! **** out of ****</fullReview>

She mistakenly assumes he is wealthy and falls genuinely in love with him too. As her health worsens, he learns of an expensive operation that can bring back her sight. He sacrifices everything of himself in order to get the money, his time, his effort, his health, his freedom.

		<shortDescription>Heartwrenchingly Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen many of Chaplin's best films, and have just finished watching City Lights for the first time. In my opinion, it tops even the brilliant Modern Times. It seems to me that many who claim to be film "connoseuirs" stick up their noses at anything that does not have excessively complicated plots or incomprehensible imagery. To these people I would say, "I feel sorry that you are unable to appreciate some of the greatest works of art ever created". This movie is a nearly ideal case in point. The story is simple: the Tramp falls in love with a blind flower girl and does anything to help her. Although there are some very funny moments, the movie is not really what I would call hilarious. But I don't see these as flaws. The very simplicity of the story gives it enormous impact because it obviously comes straight from the heart, and the humor is present to soften the blow of the drama and make it bearable, the exception being the very end. Much has been said about the ending, and deservedly so. There is nothing outlandish, nothing over the top about it: everything is very subtle, but the way that it is set up, the subtle facial expressions, the lack of dialogue, and the music all have the impact of a sledgehammer. It has to be seen to be believed. I don't want to reveal any more details for fear of spoiling it. Well, I hope that was of some use; at least I hope it helped someone decide to watch this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's face it: Chaplin's "City Lights" is a great film, but it's not flawless. The inspired bits: Charlie making the acquaintance of the Flower Girl, the boxing match, the achingly beautiful, ambiguous, close of the film where Chaplin walks an emotional tightrope between sentiment and sincerity, and succeeds brilliantly - these are incredible and unforgettable moments in cinema, and Chaplin deserves the plaudits he's received. But such moments are interspersed throughout the film, which is punctuated with long stretches of tedium. Chaplin's inspiration was fitful, and it shows. Nevertheless, on balance, "City Lights" is a masterpiece, rising above it's author's shortcomings to become a cinematic landmark which any student of Film would do well to study.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but not that great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."City Lights" (1931) is good comedy drama romance starring Charles Chaplin. He is great here, but the movie isn't as good as "Modern Times". Nevertheless "City Lights" is a delightful cinema.Music is this movie is good, as well as acting and directing. The story is nice, although one could argue about lose of memory after drinking, of course i understand this is a comedy and you should't take it very seriously, yet it's not the strongest part of the movie. The joke with bird ? hiccups was also a bit too long. Overall, "City Lights" is a good movie for the fans of Charles Chaplin. It is not as good as "Modern Times" (these are only two movies i saw with this great comedian yet), but it is a good movie overall. There are many classical Charles Chaplin moments, and boxing fight scene is great one. Many comedy scenes are still working, this is universal humor, although some of them are a bit dated now. The story is simple, but one shouldn't be watching Charles Chaplin movie for a story. Overall, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Silent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the start of the 30's "talkies" or movies with sound synchronized with their films like they are in modern films, really started to take off. Charlie Chaplin resisted that change and we are forever thankful.This is the true romantic comedy, with absolutely superb acting and a fun score to go along with it. Chaplin's humor still hold up, 80 odd years later, with some slapstick tactics that Adam Sandler and the lot should pick up on. The jokes/humor are excellently displayed, and will constantly leave a smile on your face. The ending is one of the best in cinema history, and i'll leave the rest spoiler free.Rating: 9/10. Really short (&lt;90 minutes!!) great, silent film that will hold to the test of time. Really great flick to start enjoying silent movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Definitive Rom-Com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon watching City Lights again, I didn't want to write this until the film's anniversary, but I couldn't wait. This is heart-warming, humorous and tear-jerking cinema at its finest. Charlie Chaplin's eternal character, "the Tramp", returns for an emotional and wholesome story. We find the Tramp inadvertently meeting another unfortunate character (like the homeless kid in the Kid): a blind, female florist. The plot that ensues makes for a lot of sympathy and interest, without resorting to being sappy or melodramatic. Along the way in the Tramp's efforts to help, he encounters a suicidal man that soon paves the way for landmark slapstick comedy. All three of these characters are very memorable, and they should be a subject of character development within silent films, as they all have justified motivations. You could state that Chaplin created an evocative type of slapstick; mishaps-filled comedy with a bigger meaning. The bigger meaning here, much like the Kid and the Gold Rush, is poverty. He shows how it can affect some of the most needful people. Sadly, when the Tramp exerts his socialism, he becomes even more tattered and helpless than before. What the wonderful Chaplin asked for was for the government to not let the financial status of the world fester any more crucially (as throughout his childhood). Like the Tramp, he seemed selfless, as shown very notably in his Great Dictator speech. His ideology is solidified masterfully in City Lights particularly, though. City Lights enchants with its innocent romance, roaring slapstick, and underlying symbolism of the world's biggest problem. He truly, truly makes his mark on cinema with this film, and that is solidified with the ending. I'd call it the greatest in cinema, as it gets me shedding tears of joy every time. After City Lights has finished, you'll be strongly thinking about the poverty in the world, but mostly the humanity that can overcome it --- as long as you can recover from the laughter. This is why it is one of the greatest films of all-time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin proves that actions are louder than words.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tomorrow the birds will sing."Before Raging Bull or Rocky, Charles Chaplin brought us one of the most memorable boxing scenes in film history. The scene is so well choreographed and performed by Chaplin that it proves what a genius he truly was. It's been more than 80 years since the film was released and it still remains as one of the best romantic comedies ever made. City Lights has a lot of heart, several funny moments, and a perfectly executed final scene that will touch even the hardest hearts. I've seen many famous scenes from Chaplin's work, but this is the first time I sat through a full movie of his. It was a unique and joyous experience despite the fact that I'm not the biggest fan of pantomime and some of the gags run a bit too long. Chaplin was not only a great actor, but he also was an excellent director, writer, and composer. The film is well edited and the technical achievements are surprisingly good. In the midst of the talkie revolution Chaplin decided to remain silent despite adding some amusing sound effects and he proved that powerful stories could be told without dialogue. It's a work of pure genius and a film that all film lovers should experience on their own. City Lights has encouraged me to begin a Chaplin marathon during this week and I think it's going to be a lot of fun to get to know one of cinema's most beloved characters: the tramp.Charles Chaplin plays the Little Tramp once again in City Lights and this time he meets a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) with whom he falls in love. Without her knowing it, he follows her to her home and discovers she is in financial troubles, so being the selfless little tramp he is he decides to try to help her out. Despite not having any money, the tramp tries to find ways to help her out while she mistakenly believes he is a millionaire. The tramp begins looking for work and even enters a boxing ring in order to make some money to help the girl pay for an operation that will restore her sight back, but he is unsuccessful in most of his endeavors. While searching for a place to rest one night near the city's river he accidentally runs into a millionaire (Harry Myers) who is about to commit suicide. The tramp saves his life and the two get drunk together and become friends. The only problem is that when the millionaire is sober he forgets about his friend so their relationship is on and off depending on the amount of alcohol he has had.City Lights has a simple premise, but the way Chaplin tells the story is very captivating and heart warming. His physical performance is among the best I've seen and his facial expressions are priceless. There is also an underlying message behind his funny and touching tale and the tramp represents the best side of humanity. The themes of selflessness, kindness, and classism still resonate in our society today. If you weren't won over by the story in general I am sure the ending will touch everyone and the hilarious boxing scene will tickle even the most grumpy hearts. City Lights is a film full of grace and you don't see movies like these made any more. During a troubled time after the Great Depression, Chaplin managed to maintain a sense of humor and bring joy and laughter to an era that was very much in need of it.</fullReview>

Chaplin's comedic timing and sense of light fun is still enthralling, even in 2014. All actors play their roles perfectly. Sure, everything's stilted and nothing's real, but contextually the slapstick all hangs together. I commend the SF Symphony for a note-perfect and perfectly timed score.

He never dissuade her of the misconception. One night, he encounters a drunken wealthy gentleman (Harry Myers) who is about to commit suicide. The tramp rescues the drunk, and befriends him. However every time the rich drunk sobers up, he forgets about his tramp friend. When the blind girl needs $22 for rent, the tramp struggles to come up with the money. He even goes into a boxing match. Nothing works until he runs into the rich drunk once again. The drunk gives him $1000, but a misunderstanding makes the tramp a fugitive suspected of stealing the money. The tramp escapes and gives the blind guy all the money to pay the rent as well as fix her eyes. Later he is caught by the police and sent to jail. When he finally leaves the jail, he is in an even worst shape. The blind girl had her eyes fixed, and in a touching moment, she recognizes the tramp by feeling his hand.There are two great scenes in this movie. The first is the boxing match. It is a movie classic that needs to be seen by all movie lovers. It's funny to see the wires attach to Chaplin and the glove. And the slapstick humor is absolutely hilarious. It is still gut busting funny even today. The other is the final scene where the blind girl recognizes the tramp. It is the conclusion of an emotionally rich story of sacrifice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Quintessential Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always loved "City Lights" the best of all the wonderful gems Chaplin has made. And after revisiting it recently, still do. In fact, the more I see films, the more this one stands apart as the quintessential comedy on what not only making films is about, but loving them as well.The circumstances in which Chaplin made it are well-known, as well as the ironic use of sound. In other words the war between the image and sound that in the early 1930s seemed all but lost. But the crystallization of this concept is in how everything in the film is about seeing or not seeing. There is a review here on IMDb ("Seeing and Being Seen", April 30th, 2002, by "tedg") that I'd encourage you to read, since it analyzes this exact topic so astutely I have really nothing more to say, other than it truly is remarkable how every little thing in the film seems to be conveyed visually, be it a gag at the expense of the Tramp or the the blind girl's loneliness depicted in the birdcage.There is a fine Blu-ray for this film, released last autumn by the Criterion Collection. Had I any influence on you, I'd urge you to see it. It's a marvellous presentation of a marvellous film, and is there any higher compliment I could give any film than that seeing "City Lights" makes me love it more, and not only it but all film? I think you know my answer. I love you, Charlie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chaplin movies are always concentrated on the misery and sorrow of ordinary people. His famous tramp is presented as the core common man in most of his movies like Gold Rush, Modern Times, etc. According to me, the best Chaplin movie is The Great Dictator. But, as tramp, it's City Lights which captures the grace of Chaplin at peak. Story picks a tramp, and his romantic interest, a flower girl. His attempts to support the gave gives way to so many hilarious situations. As an addition, there is an eccentric millionaire, his butler, and a boxing match. Behind every laugh, there will be a stinging pain, and Chaplin successfully captured the woes and worries of the men who lived in this world, with the best as he could. Words won't be enough to praise the artist in Chaplin, since he is one of the pioneers of world cinema. There are no wonder that he made these movies brilliant, because that what he had experienced in his childhood. He conjured his suffering days into the celluloid, and we are calling them classics. Even after all these years, we wonders, sighs, laughs with the tramp, and the master behind all these will be laughing too, from heavens....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of the end of an era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning of the end of an era, City Lights was created as a reaction from Chaplin to "talkies". Chaplin knew that a film consisting in only sketches would not cope with the new films so he had to introduce a story that would unify the film from beginning to end. Hence City Lights was the first Chaplin film with a decisive argument and thanks to its enormous success, for a short time, Hollywood returned to make silent films but sound had come to stay. Also good to mention, the sketch in which Chaplin swallows a whistle and starts beeping every time he coughs, the sound was not applied after the film was completed, it was the true sound recorded during the filming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charlie Chaplin's Magnum Opus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a time when film industry was making its transition to talkies &amp; silent films were becoming obsolete, Charlie Chaplin's City Lights entered into the theatres as a late example of its era yet in the long run, it didn't just turn out to be the greatest achievement of silent filmmaking but has endured the test of time so well that it still remains the quintessential romantic comedy.The penultimate silent feature from Charlie Chaplin, City Lights chronicles the adventures of The Little Tramp who falls in love with a beautiful blind girl who sells flowers for a living. His desire to make her life better becomes a possibility when he saves a suicidal, drunken but wealthy man from killing himself but their friendship continues to be on/off depending on his drunk/sober state.Written, produced, directed, edited &amp; scored by Charlie Chaplin, City Lights is the pinnacle of Chaplin's exceptional film career that presents the extraordinary artist at the apex of his talents, both in front n behind the camera. From its opening moments where the film mocks the unrefined technology used in early talkies to the heartbreaking finale, this unparalleled classic is pure lyrical poetry.The screenplay is exquisitely penned down, beautifully balances the elements of romance &amp; comedy, and each segment is properly weighed before its transition on the film canvas. The technical aspects are a work of perfection as Chaplin leaves no stone unturned to make it all work in harmony. Cinematography wonderfully captures its drama, Editing is immaculate &amp; the soundtrack seamlessly integrates into the narrative.Although Chaplin has always been a perfectionist but what he manages to accomplish with City Lights is something far greater than any his previous works. Slapstick humour is a constant ingredient in his filmography but the precision balance he finds between the elements of comedy &amp; romance in this feature is so flawless that it hasn't been equalled ever since. Plus, the perfect comic timing further elevates this great cinema to an even greater level.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Charlie Chaplin, Virginia Cherrill &amp; Harry Myers, with all three leaving a lasting impression. Myers is hilarious as hell in the role of the suicidal, drunken millionaire, Cherrill brings a warmth to her character while Chaplin is at his usual best and shares a spot-on chemistry with both of them. But it's the memorable finale that marks the highest-point of Chaplin's acting career &amp; it's just as heartwarming as it is heartbreaking.On an overall scale, City Lights finds the most gifted film artist crafting his finest piece with precision, accuracy &amp; controlled artistry and is completely deserving of its unprecedented legacy. An unforgettable example of silent cinema, an ideal blend of art &amp; entertainment, an unsurpassed achievement of its genre(s), and a timeless treasure that's just as awe- inspiring today as it was back during its time of release, Charlie Chaplin's magnum opus comes one hundred percent recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie. Ending thoughts (please watch before reading)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ending of this movie is like an emotional Rorschach test for me. Every time I see it, I understand it in a different way. When I saw the movie for the first time, it was clear: she didn't love the Tramp, she only pitied him. It was a brutally sad ending. The second time I saw it, my opinion changed completely. I saw her holding his hand against her heart, gazing at him, remembering of all the things he'd done for her when she was blind. I decided she really did love him after all. It didn't matter about his social standing or lack of money. She saw through all of that and loved him anyway. After seeing it just now for a third time, I have a new opinion. For me it hinges on her line: "Yes, I can see now."I think she says "Yes I can see now" because the situation is so much more complicated than just "she loves me, she loves me not", and she finally understands the full implications of who the Tramp is, who she is, and what happened while she was blind. She sees that the Tramp is a very sweet person who's clearly in love with her, but she also sees him for who he is: a homely, goofy, lower-class citizen. She sees that there really isn't a hope of them getting together, in the social climate of the day. But she still feels gratitude toward the Tramp and wants him to understand that she accepts his generosity and kindness. She really does love him, in a sense, because of what he did for her; their time together while she was blind is always going to be a treasure to her, but it will probably end there. I also think the Tramp realizes this, and he's just happy that she could finally see his face and understand. It really is amazing the amount of depth this ending achieves with only a few simple lines, a gesture, and some beautifully understated acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before starting the film "City Lights" by Charlie Chaplin, I was a bit apprehensive if I would be able to last the whole movie. Let's just say my last effort with "The Great Dictator" didn't go very well. Fifteen minutes into "City Lights" I knew that won't be the case.The film is full of comic situations topped off by a good performance by everyone involved. It starts out with an unlikely friendship between the tramp and a millionaire borne out of ironical circumstances. The tramp falls in love with a flower girl and tries his best to win her love. We even get to see the tramp in a boxing match which is equally funny. This is a silent movie but it talks to us in many ways. The unending vigor and affirmative outlook of the tramp which teaches a lesson or two, the tramp-millionaire relationship with its classist undertones, the girl's relationship with her benefactor whom she can't see. All this amalgamates to form something wonderful. A classic in every respect. 10/10 :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>you gotta laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being opportune to see many of the old Charlie Chaplin classics, this movie City Lights stands out as the best I have seen him in. Charlie's films will always stand out in the history of film making as he brought something new to the silver screen. City Lights is an exceptional silent film that showed the simplicity of romance and the length of ideology any one will go to keep it, from living a lie, to going to jail all in the name of love.The final scene in the movie has been sighted by many to be one of the greatest scenes in cinema history. I to accept that claim, the tramp's melancholy look as all the walls of lies fall apart will touch you in ways that will make you smile; the acting that followed it was masterfully done.Next to that scene my second favorite scene is the boxing fight, if you have not seen this movie before get ready for the laugh of your life, the screenplay is masterful, the acting is wonderful and the sound effects just enough. Such scenes make you wonder what Charlie movies would have been if he had all the gadgets and money that studios are pumping into movies this days.Like other Chaplin movies, this is a slapstick comedy done in 1931. He wrote produced and directed the movie. By the time of its release talkies were already in vogue (sound) but Chaplin took a shot in the dark making this movie a silent movie, he did fear though that the reception will not be good, but this movie did well in the box office and also was well received.The story plot as others is about the tramp (Charlie Chaplin) this time tramp meets and falls in love with a beautiful girl who happens to be blind.While the tramp was taking his leisure stroll he runs into a wealthy man, whom he befriended but the relationship was on and off, as the man will at times recognize Charlie and later forget that they know each other. The tramp on the other hand used his connection with the wealthy man to help his love as she was going through financial trouble.Holding the eleventh place in the AFI greatest film of all time, City Lights is one classic romantic comedy that will leave Charlie's name in the lips of many film goers for a long time. No matter what your take is concerning silent movies, make sure this one does not pass you by.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

Does it take the viewer places they didn't think they'd go and make them reassess their idea of film making? Yes. What I am outraged by is that only 1/10th of the IMDb viewers who reviewed "Memento" bothered to review City Lights. (No, I haven't reviewed "Memento.") This film barely beat out an animated movie from 2001 in the IMDb Top 250 but only made it # 42 out of 250. Is it better than many films above it? Yes. Should more people comment on perhaps the greatest love story in the history of film? Yes. That's why I'm outraged. But at least it beat out "Citizen Kane!" Kids!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing more, nothing less required; City Lights is perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stories that complete an entire cycle are the most fulfilling ones. City Lights tells the story of a tramp who by sheer luck befriends a drunken millionaire and falls in love with a blind young flower-girl. Both the people have different perceptions about the tramp ? the millionaire only recognizes him when he is intoxicated while the girl mistakes him for a millionaire. In an effort to win the girl's heart and lighten her financial troubles, the tramp assumes the role of a millionaire, a street-sweeper and a boxer, but is mistaken by the others for a thief. The most striking part is that in one of the scenes, another desperate boxer flees from the restroom realizing that the cops are after him. But the tramp, who is the most honest and magnanimous person, is sent to jail. When the two lovers meet again, the girl, who has acquired sight with the money given by the tramp, offers him a nickel. Recall their first meeting when the tramp is the one who offers her a coin and we that the story has completed its cycle. The moment is so poignant that if one just looks at the tramp's eyes, he/she can see the various emotions experienced by him at that point.There are a few movies of Charlie Chaplin that will not work today because of the excessive slapstick in them. I remember being enervated by the abundance of butt-kicks in one of his old films that was close to unbearable. City Lights is not one of them, and here Charlie has blended slapstick, comedy, romance and drama seamlessly. The initial scenes when the tramp parties with the millionaire evokes not just humor but also pity for the tramp because we realize what may happen once the millionaire comes to his senses. We come to terms with the fact that there will be a moment when the tramp will not be aided by the millionaire and he would have to confess this to the blind girl. We still are in fits when the tramp, in fine clothes, cannot walk without slipping on those slippery floors, or when he begins eating spaghetti and takes the long strand of confetti in his mouth or the opening scene, where the tramp stomps on the private part of the statue and hangs by the sword while the anthem is going on. In the later scenes, we root for the clumsy, straggly man because we know how desperate he is. Every person, including the millionaire, the girl, her grandmother, the butler, the rich people and the tramp himself, have the human touch to them that is usually compromised in slapstick comedies.Charlie Chaplin was the producer, director, actor, editor and music director of the film and everything is done by him immaculately. The loose body movements, the eccentric gait, the wide, expressive eyes and the sparkling comic timing are applaud worthy but what is most treasured is his ability to make the audience cry. Virginia Cherrill has terrific screen presence and can emote so well I was surprised to hear she wasn't in good terms with Charlie. Harry Myers gives us two sides of his personality in very believable terms; after his drinking bouts, when he gets up and sees Charlie, he has that perfect expression of confusion and weariness. Florence Lee is touching in her short role; Al Ernest Garcia as the butler who shows contempt towards the tramp shines. The two impish kids who sell newspapers, the prizefighter, the rich people, the two robbers etc are equally memorable.The Tramp gave everything, got nothing but did get his most cherished desire in the end. And we the audiences gave City Lights not even two hours and got one of the best experiences of our lives.My Rating: 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very bright 'City Light' indeed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin was always a genius, never anything less. For anyone today, City Lights may be seen as his crowning achievement, and it comes as no surprise.Charlie combined the visual comic flair and superbly crafted drama that adorned his previous legendary films, but added an extra touch that is difficult to explain. The majority of this film is gold, with several sequences that are engraved into the public conscience such as the boxing match, the Tramp sleeping on a statue and of course, that moving finale.The film is a simple love story between the Little Tramp and a blind flower girl (played by Virginia Cherrill). Along the way, the Tramp tries to support the girl and her grandmother, while striking up a friendship with an alternately drunk/sober millionaire (played by Harry Myers). Its simplicity adds to how effective the film is, and not only because of the fact it is silent and black &amp; white.I urge every fan of film to watch this masterpiece. Sure, the effects are sometimes poor (you see strings on Charlie in the boxing match); but even if it was just for that magical finale that completes a film that has set the template for romantic comedies for all eternity, then it would still be worth watching.'City Lights' is truly a classic of cinema that will be remembered forever and will be loved for just as long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Chaplin Silent Film Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City Lights is a silent film and romantic comedy-drama written by, directed by, and starring Charlie Chaplin. It also has the leads Virginia Cherrill and Harry Myers. Although "talking" pictures were on the rise when this movie was released in 1931, City Lights was immediately popular. Today, it is thought of as one of the highest accomplishments of Chaplin's prolific career. Although classified as a comedy, City Lights has an ending widely regarded as one of the most moving in cinema history.Chaplin was deep into production of his silent City Lights when Hollywood was overwhelmed by the talkie revolution. After months of anguished contemplation, he decided to finish the film as it began--in silence, save for a musical score and an occasional sound effect. Once again cast as the Little Tramp, Chaplin makes the acquaintance of a blind flower girl, who through a series of coincidences has gotten the impression that the shabby tramp is a millionaire. A second storyline begins when the tramp rescues a genuine millionaire from committing suicide. When drunk, the millionaire expansively treats the tramp as a friend and equal; when sober, he doesn't even recognize him. The two plots come together when the tramp attempts to raise enough money for the blind girl to have an eye operation. Highlights include an extended boxing sequence pitting scrawny Chaplin against muscle-bound Hank Mann, and the poignant final scene in which the now-sighted flower girl sees her impoverished benefactor for the first time. Chaplin's decision to release the silent City Lights three years into the talkie era was partially vindicated when more than one critic singled out this "comedy in pantomime" as the best picture of 1931.With its themes of selflessness and grace, as well as its graceful intertwining of comedy and pathos,this film became an excellent silent film and it was even considered a classic despite not having audio in it.As for the lead actor,the British comic is still the consummate pantomimist, unquestionably one of the greatest the stage or screen has ever known for this was a beautiful example of Chaplin's ability to turn narrative fragments into emotional wholes. The two halves of the film are sentiment and slapstick. They are not blended but woven into a pattern as eccentric as it is sublime which made it absolutely delightful, hilarious, heart breaking Chaplin classic and a Chaplin enduring masterpiece as well.</fullReview>

The Reason I Prefer This One Over Every Other Chaplin Film Is Because This Was The First Chaplin Film I Ever Saw (I Saw This For The First Time When I Was 12, I LOVED It) And I've Always Felt His Tramp Character Was More Likable In This Than In "The Gold Rush" Or "The Kid". This Isn't As "Heartwarming" As "The Kid" But Chaplin Is By Far The Funniest He Ever Was In This. I Highly Recommend This Film To Anyone Because Its A Must-See Of Classic Cinema.</fullReview>

It's a little bit monotonous, however, I believe it will never be dated. Because everything else in the film - from that schizophrenic rich man - a tyrant and a benefactor at the same time - to the last classical scene when the girl looks at Charlie Chaplin's character, touches him and the only thing the Tramp could say is : "You can see now?" It's not like I rarely cry on movies, but this time I cried for another reason.

But Charlie Chaplin proved all of them wrong with this one.The story is simple of a tramp falling in love with a blind girl and the various comedy sequences to follow. And I guess this is the only Chaplin film I have seen in which the film doesn't end in a tragic way.Chaplin shines throughout the film and perhaps it is his career-best performance. The music is captivating, easily one of the best scores that he has composed till now.The supporting cast along with the lead actress contribute significantly in this superb movie. More importantly, the comedy sequences are so well handled that you feel that you have never seen anything like this before in a Chaplin movie.Easily one of the best romantic comedy movies ever made.

		<shortDescription>The Tramp's endearing and selfless romance makes "Lights" Chaplin's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wish that today's romantic comedies full of superficial blabber and polluted ideas about love and sex would just -- shut up? Hold on to your ten dollars and rent the Charlie Chaplin classic "City Lights," a heart-warming romance and physical comedy -- where no one talks.It seems like the era and even the idea of the silent love story has been long gone and forgotten. Relationships and courtship are full of drama, selfish sexual desire and prejudices and attitudes about what's attractive. In a modern context, "City Lights" can be viewed as an hour and a half trip back to innocence.The already famous Chaplin returns to the screen in "Lights," his first silent film in the dawn of the "talkie" era. Chaplin once again plays the Tramp, this time befriending a suicidal drunken rich man and taking a fancy to a blind flower salesgirl. As a social commentary, Chaplin picks on the snootiness of the upper class and their fancy parties that only mask their unhappiness, as well as championing those who are not as wealthy but don't create social prejudice. But "Lights" is a love story at heart.Maybe it's only because he knows she won't judge him by his appearance that the Tramp is immediately infatuated with the blind flower seller, but his unblinking kindness toward her is just heart-warming. As he tries to find the money to pay for her rent, (leading to some hysterical scenes, namely a boxing fight) you know deep down that he'll never fully be repaid for his kind deeds. That is until the classic ending that could win even the coldest of fish over with its simple but perfect execution.There's plenty opportunity here for us to laugh at the Tramp too, but it's just not what you take away most from "City Lights.' You can name the classic comedy scenes without problem, but the impression does not follow them. It's the beautiful story of two seemingly nobodies who treat each other with unconditional kindness amidst a city of superficial and judgmental people that makes you stop and wonder. The fact that in all honesty we still search for that ideal today despite an even greater setting promoting the opposite, and that's what makes "City Lights" a classic. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly universal masterpiece - one of cinema's greatest stars in his greatest ever picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People say a lot of things about Chaplin's immortality. Actually, they say only one thing many times, over and over again: he is eternal, his films will live forever, a hundred or two hundred years from now humanity will still turn to Charles Chaplin for joy and relief from whatever burdens they may have, as like or unlike our own as those may be. My gut tells me there is truth in this belief, but I don't think with my gut. To be honest, I am not that optimistic. And my doubts don't spring from common sense, either; common sense says, of course, someday everything disappears - so will Chaplin. But other than that, I, as a 17-year-old, know absolutely no one of a similar age that likes Chaplin or remembers having seen any of his movies in recent times. All kids in Pakistan used to see them, and maybe they still do, but no one bothers to stick to it as the years pass. Tom and Jerry et al are still on TV - their place in public consciousness is continuously reinforced; they can legitimately claim timelessness. But what about all the 17-year-olds that would rather watch 'Transformers' and have only dim memories of a funny little man in a shabby top hat, ones that like movies only in passing, without passion? How will these poor people - and they are poorer for it - find 'City Lights'? This is a truly magnificent film. Its enduring greatness (if not enduring popularity) can, of course, be attributed to nostalgia - but only in part. You need never have heard of Charlie Chaplin to enjoy it. It also has the common advantage of all silent films in that it knows no linguistic boundaries; the story, unlike that of a Buster Keaton film, is simple and silent enough that one does not really need even the sparse title cards to follow it. Keaton's films, while silent, tended to be rather talkative, requiring the viewer to do quite a bit of reading. Chaplin is perhaps more widely known than Keaton because he, unlike the latter, can be understood by people who cannot read English or any language at all.Chaplin's comedic timing is flawless. This is not, perhaps, Chaplin's funniest film, but it strings together sequence after hilarious sequence of classic slapstick nevertheless: the opening scene on the monument, the one with the suicidal millionaire, the one in the restaurant (my personal favorite), the boxing match - each is immediately familiar and unfailingly funny. (Sophisticated humor? No doubt it has its skillful practitioners and talented writers. I love it. But is it, when you get right down to it, actually any funnier than watching a chair pulled out from under someone's descending rear end? Not on this evidence.) But what sets 'City Lights' apart from other Chaplin films, and classical comedy in general, is its heart.The story is, as I mentioned, disarmingly simple. Chaplin plays The Tramp, a homeless man with an odd mustache, a top hat and a cane, who is always in trouble because of his social ineptitude. He is persecuted because of his shabby appearance. He meets a girl that sells flowers who is kind to him, possibly only because she is blind and thinks he is a gentleman. He saves the life of a drunken millionaire, whose help he needs when the girl has trouble paying her rent. Obstacles arise. The obstacles are the comedy.That really is it. It does not, on paper, sound like masterpiece material, but it is brought to life - partly by humor, yes - but primarily by Chaplin's persona as the Tramp. The Tramp is one of cinema's greatest personalities, the people's champion to end them all. His perennially good intentions, his unflagging good cheer, his clumsiness, his social inadequacy, his underdog status and his constant bedevilment by ridiculous misfortune make us cheer, cheer, cheer like we never have for any other character. It is quite possible that of all the great people invented by the silver screen, Chaplin's Tramp is the easiest to love, and love the most.The movie is, of course, a great technical achievement. It is boundlessly entertaining. Each quirky character, from the flower girl to the millionaire to the class conscious butler, serves its purpose in moving the story towards it conclusion. The conclusion, of course, is one of the finest emotional scenes in movie history; in fact, in its length and low-key conclusion, without fanfare or fireworks, anticipates in a strange way the French New Wave. The ending is abrupt. I spoil nothing by saying you will be joyful when it comes.One of the greatest of all movies. Most highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Near the beginning of City lights, Charlie Chaplin is slipping on a marble floor wildly, but still greeting people with a stately dip of the hat, thus epitomizing the charming buffoonery of the little tramp. In City Lights, the best of Chaplin's works, the little tramp is mistaken for a rich man by a blind girl, and taken under the wing of a millionaire, and he does quite well in his new rich life, although he is a tramp. Perhaps this explains the famous W.C. Fields quote: "a rich man is nothing but a poor man with money."So, City Lights is satire of the rich, but it seems to have more dimension than that. It is moving, it is inspiring, it is beautiful. But what makes it beautiful is elusive. It could be the romance, it could be the humor, but more likely, it is the tramp himself, with his little grins and shining eyes. Charlie Chaplin is both a genius director and a genius comic actor, and he was the only one who fully understood his work. And no matter how many speculations there are, nothing will be settled other than the rightful place this film has in cinema history.The ending of this film sticks out most of all as masterful. What does it mean? Will she love him? Will she believe him? Is it melancholy or euphoric? Has the flower stopped wilting? Is that a grin or a tear? All these loose ends make you think and wonder, until you finally come to the truth of the matter: that you have just witnessed the most powerful ending in the history of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A top, top film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are unsure about the silent era do watch this film. It's pure genius and ties so much with Chaplin's childhood on the streets of Lambeth.I cover the film extensively in my book "The Charlie Chaplin Walk" (Stephen P. Smith). The blind flower seller, who he attempts to rescue, represents Chaplin's mother who he failed to rescue from her madness. And the drunk represents his father, sometimes dismissive, sometimes pleased to see him and Chaplin plays the child in that dynamic.Importantly, and I've never seen this pointed out anywhere, the drunk and the flower girl never meet in the film; they are two distinct stories joined by the presence of Chaplin (The Tramp) which mirrors Chaplin's own childhood where he never was in the presence of his mother and father at the same time. His mother was the poor woman who needed rescuing and his father the unreliable drunk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Times They Are-A Changin'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen for Chaplin's, I've placed them in this order: 4. The Gold Rush, 3. Modern Times, 2. City Lights and 1. The Great Dictator.When you think of it, City Lights has everything people look for in a movie - comedy, romance, tragedy, action. The one thing City Lights misses is the true meaning that everyone should hear - The Great Dictator has that.The plot is about a tramp (Charlie Chaplin) who falls in love with a beautiful young flower girl. Being blind she suspects the tramp to be rich.There's a great range of humour in the great dictator - ranging from a scene subtle making fun of talkies (City Lights is a silent film) to a blatantly slapstick boxing match. This film could be enjoyed by people of all ages.When you think of a modern comedy you get slightly disappointing, because they have nothing on City Lights. Well, Bob Dylan had it right, The Times They Are-A Changin'.I give City Lights 10/10 for being there to cheer me up and doing that job better than most movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved the movie, but I wish it felt more special to me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first silent film that I have reviewed. This maybe the first silent film that I have ever sat all of the way through. I have not been avoiding them, but there are just so many movies to watch that I just have not gotten to any. The saddest thing about a movie as great and as influential as this is that as a modern movie goer it is hard not to be jaded when it comes to witnessing the brilliance of the original geniuses of film. There is a lot that modern filmmakers and viewers can learn from silent movies. It is hard to capture an audience for an extended period of time without boring them especially when the movie is predictable every step of the way. Watching City Lights was an extremely predictable experience, yet it did not take away from the enjoyment of the movie. I really enjoyed watching the story play out each step of the way and the movie is made with so much heart and care that it really comes through when watching. The movie starts with some great physical comedy while showcasing the good natured spirit of the Tramp. The sword gag really demonstrates some of the physicality that Chaplin brought to his role, as does the boxing scene, but having grown up with the Loony Toon cartoons and the physical comedians like Jim Carrey we have seen all of these types of gags. Seeing it play out on screen with real actors is still enjoyable to watch, but I am sure that the magic that others experienced watching it for the first time is lost on me. The heart of the film is not the physical comedy, but the relationship that the Tramp has with the flower girl. It is really a touching story that really has not lost any of its poignancy. A man willing to give up anything of his own to bring happiness to a stranger's life is not a original story, but watching the Tramp put everything he has into making the flower girl smile is heart breaking. While this is a moving tale it is amazing how Chaplin balances the comedy with the heart and how the comedy is a necessary consequence of the Tramp helping the flower girl with the means that he has. I love how Chaplin throws himself into the character and embodies the physical nature of the tramp. The walk is instantly recognizable and one can see how the great actors are able to disappear into roles by capturing this physicality with their performances. Cherrill does a wonderful job also and I swear that some of the actress from the black and white films actually glow. Cherrill absolutely glows throughout the whole film and she does have sweetness that matches the Tramps intentions. It also showcases how being physical in a role does not necessarily mean that their movements are loud and exaggerated. The ending will go down as one of the best endings of all time, but it did not hit me as hard as I thought going into the movie. I knew the basic premise of the movie and the ending was sweet as could be, but it did not resonate with me as much as it has with other film goers. I loved watching it the smile on Chaplin's face will sit with me for a while. I did love this film and it really has opened the door for me to want to see more silent films. It was a fascinating experience that I thoroughly enjoyed, but it did not feel fresh to me. I did not seem like I was discovering something special, but had finally watched something special that everyone else had already embraced. With a lot of these older films I almost feel as if it is my duty to watch the movie and that I am not doing it because I want to. I loved the movie and it will go done as a classic in my book, but it was not a special movie experience for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin At His Best?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A poor man (Charlie Chaplin) falls for a blind girl (Virginia Cherrill) who mistakenly thinks he is wealthy. After rescuing a man from a drunken suicide attempt, the tramp befriends him and soon he finds himself able to help the girl get eye surgery. The catch? The rich man forgets the poor man's existence every time he sobers up.Upon my first viewing, I had no strong background in Charlie Chaplin films. Aside from "Modern Times", I cannot recall really seeing all that many before. And I freely admit I had a bias towards Buster Keaton, the earlier, "better" silent comedian. But their comedy is somewhat different: Buster is more physical, whereas Charlie seems to be more of as prop artist.Upon further review, Chaplin's work is better appreciated. We see in this film that he mocks the motion picture industry as a whole, which has now embraced the talkies; the only "dialogue" here is a stream of squawks, and Chaplin noted that "dialogue is superfluous noise". Of course, he eventually gave in, but this film proved that silents could compete -- and sometimes exceed -- the talking films. (Just as today black and white is not common, but can still have its powerful impact.)The bulk of the comedy here, besides falling down, could be called "bait and switch" routines. The tramp is presented with an item, and then it switches to something else (such as pasta turning into confetti). It is funny, and you have to give the film credit for keeping audiences entertained when they cannot verbally tell jokes.One of the greatest things about the film is the casting of Virginia Cherrill. Prior to this film, she was a complete unknown, and through Chaplin she was launched into the stars. Not that her name is well-known today, but she was married to Cary Grant and later George Francis Child Villiers, 9th Earl of Jersey. That has to count for something for a Chicago native!If you have not seen much Chaplin, see this one. Almost all critics agree that it is one of his best, and this was also Chaplin's favorite of his own work. Jeffrey Vance believes it to be his "most perfect film".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin's Crowning Masterpiece of Silent Cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The transition from silent films to talkies proved devastating for many movie stars. Some with thick European accents, like Teutonic actor Emil Jannings who won the first Best Acting Oscar, did not weather the conversion and returned to Germany. The silent clowns who practiced the art of pantomime became one group adversely affected by the advent of sound. Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd emerged as the first casualties of the talkies. Meanwhile, Chaplin had nothing but contempt for sound films. "Motion pictures need dialogue as much as Beethoven symphonies need lyrics," he said. Indeed, Chaplin saw few advantages to sound, despite the sensation that the new technology created for the industry. Warner Brothers introduced sound pictures in 1927 with its quasi-talkie The Jazz Singer, and sound propelled Warners into the big leagues with exalted studios like MGM and Paramount. Chaplin did not rush to climb aboard the sound movie bandwagon. Instead, he hoped that City Lights would revive silent movies. As the popularity of sound waxed, Chaplin grew more anxious about sound. Nevertheless, he produced his greatest silent movie comedy City Lights in 1931. He took into account, however, the impact of sound and added a synchronized soundtrack as well as his own post-production musical score. Chaplin remained reluctant to convert to sound. When he made his next classic comedy Modern Times (1936), he made it as a silent. Eventually, Chaplin converted to sound with his classic anti-Hitler film The Great Dictator in 1940. Chaplin's dismissal of sound grew out of his success as a mime. The former English music hall pantomimist created his life-long comic persona--the 'little tramp'--for the 1914 silent comedy The Kid Auto Races at Venice. Chaplin rose through the ranks at various studios until his success with the little tramp enabled him to finance his own studio. Chaplin's mute tramp appealed to everybody everywhere because body language constituted an international language. Asian audiences appreciated Chaplin's comic body language as much as Scandinavians. "My own pictures will always be silent," he assured his audiences. Although he added a synchronized sound track, Chaplin ridiculed talkies in City Lights. In the opening scene, when dignitaries dedicate a monument to 'Peace and Prosperity,' Chaplin pokes fun at these pretentious people with his use of squawky sound effects. "City Lights" qualifies as a sweetly sentimental saga about Chaplin's trademark 'little tramp' character in his tattered evening clothes and a hat falling hopeless in love with a beautiful but blind flower girl played by Virginia Cherrill. Meanwhile, when the Tramp isn't buying flowers from the heroine and escorting her back to where she lives with her grandmother, he strikes up an on-and-off friendship with a real millionaire. According to the credits, mustached Harry Myers of "Getting Gertie's Garter" (1927) plays an 'eccentric millionaire.' He is eccentric because he lives alone without his wife and has only his butler to care for him. Unhappy, the millionaire either tries to commit suicide or gets plastered and goes from one party to another, even hosting them at his mansion. The Tramp runs into him late one evening when the Millionaire tries to commit suicide by drowning himself. The Tramp gets soaked for saving his new found friend and the friend reciprocates and becomes the Tramp's long-lost friend?that is?until he sobers up and has no memory of their friendship.In any case, the Tramp learns about a treatment that a foreign doctor has used to help some blind people recover their sight and he sets out to earn the money so that the blind girl can see again. The Tramp tries to earn the money the old-fashioned way by joining the ranks as a city sanitation engineer. In other words, he scoops up animal droppings and hauls them away. In one amusing scene, he tries to avoid a street strewn with animals, only to have a couple of circus elephants stomp up out of nowhere. Eventually, he gets fired for being late back to work after his lunch break. Next door, at a gym, he agrees to box for a share of the purse and his opponent agrees to share. Things take a turn for the worse, when the guy has to leave unexpectedly. It seems that the police are after him. The guy who replaces the fleeing boxer is a dour tough guy who is a little afraid of the Tramp's efforts to ingratiate himself to him. Further, the new guy refuses to share the prize money. In one of the funniest scenes ever, we see the Tramp strenuously avoid blows with the rival boxer. The Tramp keeps the referee between them at times or gets behind the other boxer. This confusion is sheer side-splitting fun. Sadly, the Tramp loses, but he keeps trying to get the girl her money.Charlie Chaplin does a flawless job directing this sappy love story. He alternates his love story with the friendship with the rich man. The way that he meets the blind flower girl is brilliant. The Tramp is walking along when he spots a cop (cops always scare him) and he ducks into a limo parked in the street. When he comes out the door on the other side, he sets foot on the sidewalk in front of the blind girl. The Tramp falls madly in love at first sight and the limo cruises away with the girl believing that she has sold a flower to a wealthy gentleman instead of a homeless transient. There is a pretty funny dance hall number with the Tramp setting fire to a woman's chair and then her dress. However, the crowning achievement of "City Lights" is its weepy ending. The Tramp has survived a sentence in stir and he meets the blind girl again, but things are definitely changed. Like the short story about the woman in the arena in Rome, "City Lights" asks you to decide for yourself if it has a happy ending or a cynical ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City Lights (1931)Considered to be one of the best movies of all time, Charlie Chaplin's City Lights stands the test of time and proves to be as entertaining today as it was in 1931. Charlie Chaplin's comedic style comes through and is perfectly crafted. The amount of time spent on creating the tramp must have taken a long time. The character has his own unique walk and walks are often the first thing actors do to get the character right. The comedic style Chaplin portrays is universally funny and doesn't rely on pop culture references or current events to make fun of. Everyone can laugh at falling into a lake, or silly dancing, or running away from an imposing boxer. City Lights was shot in the beginning of "talkies" era, but remains a silent movie with a soundtrack. The reason behind this is Chaplin's comedic pantomime style wouldn't translate as well with people talking.Chaplin's actions, gestures and facial expressions are perfect at telling the story of his character in the film. The elaborate scenes that are shot without a cut must have called for very careful choreography, timing and a lot of practice. An example of this would be the boxing scene where the tramp dances around the referee and the other boxer while sneaking in a punch here and there.The other actors and actresses in City Lights do a very good job at portraying their characters with very little dialog. The blind girl's appearance is exaggerated by her eyes and how they're empathized with dark eye shadow to show that she's blind. After she gets the surgery her dark eye shadow is gone. The film's 3 main characters each have a basic want, the blind girl wants to see, the tramp wants love, the rich guy wants excess and to have a good time. Each has a distinct attitude. The Blind girl is a sweet kind heart, the tramp is a good-hearted fun loving guy in love, the millionaire is a two face who seems harsh and angry when he's sober, but jolly and fun when he's drunk. These three characters and types are very stereotypical and have been used before and after the movie, but in this film the blind girl and tramp's feel like real people with real problems and feelings. The film covers several themes, including love and being in love, commitment, hope, friendship, want for something more, and humor in everyday situations. The lines between the themes are easily crossed and gently blend into each other perfectly. The end of the film is the real show stopper when the blind girl finally gets to see the tramp, the man who helped her in so many ways. This ending is thought, by some, to be one of the greatest endings of all time and after watching it you're left wondering what happened? Several scenarios run through your head and the true ending is decided by you, the viewer. Perhaps she helps the tramp as he helped her? Maybe she's wrong and thinks the rich guy who was in the store earlier is the true rich guy who helped her? The sets and design have an older feel to it, not only because it's shot in black and white, but the architecture feels European and has a feel like it could happen anywhere in Europe. In fact, the movie was shot in San Francisco and doesn't use any of the landmarks, but chooses against them so the story can feel like it can happen anywhere. With universal humor, themes and a simple, but beautiful story, City Lights remains a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful slapstick and a great love story equals a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplain's comic outings are very well known, even today and given the amount that he made, it's difficult not to come across one of his classics every now and again. I happened to stumble across 'City Lights', in which the comedy still holds up.What makes the film still good is the simplicity of the comedy. The situations are common, everyday and relatable to and most things that MIGHT go wrong, do; given the circumstances. These apply to going to a restaurant, fighting in a boxing match and spending time in someone else's home. Early on during the statue scene, everything is placed into context and the scene serves as a good introduction to the film and its content. This is good for people first encountering Chaplain and this is the perfect introduction to his world of 'slapstick humour'. The things that could possibly go wrong; do and everything has an eerie sense of realism. 'What would happen if a tramp was indeed sleeping during a statue unveiling?' or indeed, got involved in any of the other situations in this film. One thing I found particularly interesting was the instance where everyone paused to respect the national anthem, even the tramp amongst the chaos. Nobody moved during the anthem and although they were trying to get him down initially, everything stops for the anthem ? everything. I found this an interesting little piece of propaganda but very humorous at the same time: No matter what's going on around you, always stop to respect the nation when given the chance.What's also interesting is the narrative in the film. Narrative film making was around but was only about a decade or two old. In other films from around the time, narratives were still pretty basic but they got their story across, albeit maybe jumbled. In City Lights, the love story is put across effectively and the whole side story of the drunken millionaire/Chaplain trying to raise money is well sewn in; this adds to the effectiveness of the ending, also. What I like is the feeling of the character just wondering around, living day to day life, encountering people and things. There is that feeling of chance throughout. The backgrounds, given the date, are equally as interesting.Although you do see some gags coming, for instance the spaghetti scene where the similar looking decorations lurk menacingly above, City Lights does enough; with its love story, simplistic and comic situations mixed with actual humour such as the 'I thought you were driving' scene and the bad effect the lucky charms have on the boxers prior to the fight scene and the fact that there's enough in the film for you to take it seriously, especially the ending.'City Lights' will remain a classic.</fullReview>

The story of The Tramp and his love for a blind flower girl is simple but the emotional impact is overwhelming. At times hilarious and always touching, the film is a wonderful testament to the power of unconditional love and what some are willing to do for it. It's impossible not to be affected emotionally by the celebrated final scene when The Tramp is reunited the flower girl after she regains her sight.Modern Times, The Great Dictator, and The Gold Rush all come close, but City Lights edges them out with an unforgettable story and celebration of the human spirit that the others can't match. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charlie Chaplin's most moving film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film often considered to be Chaplin's masterpiece, and one of the true landmarks of cinema. "City Lights" may not be the most skillfully constructed of Chaplin's Little Tramp movies, but it is undoubtedly his most powerful and satisfying.Chaplin has been known for the sentimentality that coexists with the comedy in his movies, but rarely has he used as many pathos as he does here. Chaplin, however, refuses to manipulate his audience with weepy, overblown sappiness. He instead plays out his dramatic scenes in a genuinely convincing manner with a dose of humor sprinkled into it.Although there are some classic scenes in the first half of the film (most notably the scenes with the Tramp befriending a rich drunk), most of the movie's greatness comes in the second half. One of Chaplin's finest moments has the Tramp boxing for a fifty-dollar purse. It would be useless to try and describe how beautifully and hilariously choreographed the sequence is; one simply has to appreciate it on their own.The film's greatest moment is, undeniably, the final scene. Everything about it (acting and music especially) is masterfully executed. The scene is so sublimely uplifting and inspiring, it leaves one in a state of mild euphoria, if only for a short time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Wonderful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, Charlie Chaplin's best full-length film, is perhaps better today than it was to audiences even in his own time. Today we not only see the touching love story play out to a beautiful, bitter sweet ending, but it also serves to take us back in time to 1931. Something of the age vibrates in all of Chaplin's movies; somehow he preserves their style, their grace, and perhaps in this silent movie demonstrates a sensitivity, a gentleness that we've all but lost in todays films. The relationship between the Little Tramp and the flower girl touches the heart so tenderly, yet so deeply, that the viewer comes away a little more human, and perhaps a little more sympathetic to the human condition. Virginia Cherrill is marvelous as the blind flower girl, fragile and wanting, yet wholesomely full of life. This was her first film, and she only acted for five years before marrying and retiring from the screen. We can only sigh and dream of what she might have given us movie buffs if she'd continued. Still, we have the marvelous Charlie Chaplin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City Lights is my favorite Chaplin feature; the climax is a cinematic masterpiece, as other contributors here will attest. No matter how many times I view the ending (I own the film on videotape), tears still well in my eyes at the close. I consider it one of the best films of all time. The plot contrivance of the "Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde" personality of the millionaire is sheer genius. Others have spoke of the artisty of the boxing match, but my favorite scene is where Charlie, while driving the millionaire's car, sees a discarded cigar butt on the sidewalk. Before he can get to it, a panhandler happens by and leans down to pick it up. Charlie dispatches him with a kick in the pants, grabs the cigar butt and jumps back into his luxury automobile. He leaves the bewildered panhandler scratching his head, wondering why a wealthy man would be so mean as to snatch a discarded butt from the curb. Of course, if one is aware of the grinding poverty Chaplin endured while growing up in south London and of his stingy reputation with a buck, the joke is all the more significant. Certainly The Kid, The Gold Rush, The Circus and Modern Times are all classics, but City Lights wraps pathos, superb pantomime and comic gags into a seamless display of artistry that Chaplin never was able to surpass.</fullReview>

The end scene, as has been written before, is truly a Cinema classic, I don't think it can ever be outdone..the first time you see it, if you don't feel anything at all, you have no heart.. Chaplin, definitely the Man of the Millennium..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite 'little tramp' movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the greatest of all of Charlie Chaplin's "little tramp" movies. I was never a fan of silent movies, but Chaplin's were so great, that he kept them going until the late 1930's.This movie is so brilliant. I adore the love story between the tramp and the blind girl. The things he does to try to raise money for her rent are really funny! Everyone recalls seeing the boxing match, one of the most famous scenes. The ending is so sad, when the girl is no longer blind, but does not recognize the tramp because she thought her benefactor was wealthy. This always breaks my heart!!~"City Lights" is a great movie, and my favorite movie featuring Chaplin's famous character. This movie gets a 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Older and especially silent movies get short shrift because we all like the 'new.' There is nothing new under the sun. This Chaplin masterpiece is variably maudlin, silly, tendentious, unbearably funny and sad. Scathing indictment of capitalism without a soul, the Little Tramp gives us an idea of how we should feel about others; alas, an impossible goal--even for Chaplin, in real life. I stand by my statement that the ending is the best in movie history. Period. --if one has a human heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A comedic masterpiece. Charlie Chaplin made a bold move by keeping this film silent, and it paid off. Regarded by most as Chaplin's best work, City Lights has some of the Tramp's funniest and most heartfelt moments. In a more developed storyline than usual, the tramp falls in love with a blind flower girl who mistakes him for a rich man. While this situation provides the emotional drive of the film, the Tramp's relationship with a rich, suicidal drunkard provides most of the laughs. Both plot lines intertwine perfectly, complementing each other well. In the third act, the Tramp sets out to raise money for an operation on the blind girl. After loosing his job as a street sweeper, he enters a boxing match to try and win the prize money. The hilariously choreographed match is one of Chaplin's best routine's ever. As much as it makes us laugh, it still tugs at our heart strings when the Tramp surprisingly goes down for the count. The final scene in which the girl with her restored sight realizes that the Tramp is her benefactor is a study in bittersweet. Chaplin and the girl wisely underplay the moment, keeping it from being too sappy, but still making us care. What happens next is also wisely left to the imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin always made great movies, and "City Lights" is no exception. He plays the Tramp, befriending a blind woman (Virginia Cherrill) and helping her out in her life. He also befriends an eccentric millionaire. Unfortunately, the millionaire only recognizes him when he is drunk; whenever he is sober, he considers the Trump some kind of intruder. The Tramp spends much time in jail, basically as punishment for being homeless.Once again, Chaplin has used humor to show the plight of the disenfranchised. A particularly funny scene is when he is helping the blind woman make yarn (you'll never guess what the yarn is). Either way, this is a movie that everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City Lights by Charlie Chaplin is a silent film released in 1931; it can be clearly categorized in a comedy genre. The movie director and lead character (the tramp) is Charlie Chaplin. The blind girl is played by Virginia Cherrill. Those two characters love grown all along the movie, but during the hour and a half, the film lasted, the tramp set you on another journey full of laughs which were the main purpose of the film in my opinion.The theme is: life is worth living and can be much better with your smile on. Since it is a silent movie the names of the characters are not known. The fact that the tramp was the person that give his life back to the millionaire and the blind girl, is one aspect that illustrates why life is worth living is the theme of the movie. It is a silent movie. Besides the story itself, the choice of the director to go for a silent movie even though at that point it was possible to do the movie with sound is to emphasize the theme. That choice was made to distinguish the other movies front this one ,and to show how great and exceptional it could be. Even though it was a silent movie it is a classic American film, because of its simplicity and it the theme; regardless of the time period is a theme such as life is worth it, will always be an up to date theme. The historical context is also great because it was after the first World War; it gives hope. Those three points helped to illustrate the theme.In 1992 , the Tom and Jerry movie was released; the theme of life is worth it can be also found in this movie. because of the story , the humor and the simplicity of the story, the both movies are similar in key points that that support the same theme.There is two specific technique used in the film that has retained my attention. The absence of any dialogue is most obvious. To compensate with that the director used the transitions to let the watcher know what is happening when it was essential . For instance, at several moment in the movie, there were black screens with a simple sentence written on it. The second point is the angle there is very few close up scene, only with the pretty girl and the hug scene at the end of the movie. That choice for the angles helps the watcher to concentrate more on the facial expression, emotional and non-verbal communication to compensate the non-dialogue when it is close up scene. When the camera is far the actions of the characters are more put in the spotlight..I personally liked this movie a lot, loved to laugh for an hour and a half and adored to watch it again.</fullReview>

Film has no dialogues but background score has done its job.Background score is composed by Charlie Chaplin himself.Restaurant scene was funny.But best scene of movie was the boxing scene.I laughed too much during that scene.It was perfectly directed and executed.I haven't seen such a funnier scene in a long time.I mean you can't expect that a boxing match scene can make you laugh.

		<shortDescription>Best Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The theme of this movie is love - the purest form of human love. Not the contrived romance after a lot of ups and downs,as you typically see in a love story. The movie does have its twists but the key message is loud and clear - when you love another person, you value him/her with care, sympathy and a commitment to helping them thrive at your own expense. It also to some extent defies our 21 century notion of love about finding the perfect match. The encounter between the tramp and the blind girl was simple. They didn't even go on dates.Their mutual affection started with the tramp's sympathy for the girl, and evolved as the tramp started to get more involved in the girl's life. The tramp appeared as a weak little man but being in love made him brave enough to tackle a boxing match.The movie conveys something very pure and clean about love, and makes you ponder that love is most beautiful when it's simple. The movie didn't make me burst out laughing. But it's amusing and moving at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin made many fantastic films, from The Gold Rush to the Great Dictator, but none are better than City Lights. Charlie Chaplins comedy(written, directed and starring) is almost as much touching as it is humorous. The plot is about Charlie Chaplins tramp character, who finds many different ways of producing money for a blind flower girl whom he has fallen in love with. The perfect comic timing, the brilliant performance of Charlie Chaplin, the Wonderful music and the touching themes combine to make one of the greatest films ever made.10/10 for this Film because of not only its comedy, but it's themes. I doubt you won't cry during the movie, I and I even more highly doubt that you won't laugh. 84 years ago it was made, but it's still making people laugh. That's got to be something worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is pretty much the oldest feature film that I have ever seem from beginning to end and it is a truly engrossing experience to watch a very old film, for several reasons:1 - It gave me a better understanding of how our cultural perceptions evolved over time. Interestingly, our modern culture can be seem as an offshot of the culture displayed in the film, in other words, our modern world can be seem as a more "refined" version of the world displayed in this film.2 - The quality of this film is extremely high, in fact, I would say it was almost as good as Citizen Kane, which is my gold standard for films made before ca. 1950. The way that this film builds up a marvelous story without the use of dialogue is very impressive and refreshing, considering the abuse of dialogue in films made later (such as Chinatown).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching film made with obvious passion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1914, Charlie Chaplin created one of the most recognizable and beloved movie icons of all time. With City Lights in 1931, the world said goodbye to him. In this context, it is easy to see how anyone even remotely a fan of the tramp would hold this film dear to their hearts and quietly champion it as one of the best films ever made.Now, to be clear, City Lights wasn't actually the tramp's last appearance in cinema. That came five years later, in Modern Times. However, by looking back to the time in which this film was made, and with the benefit of seeing it from our perspective in history, we can see why it was considered a bittersweet goodbye to the lovable tramp. With the advent of talkies in 1928, it would be a great understatement to say that film was forever changed. To this day some still debate whether that was a positive change or not. One thing is certain, that a great number of careers were ruined by the advent of sound. One of the biggest stars of the silent era was Charlie Chaplin's Tramp. As the years went by and talkie productions began outnumbering silent films ten to one, the world waited with bated breath to see how Chaplin would adjust to this major change. Finally, he answered with City lights. What everyone was expecting was for Chaplin to present the tramp in his first talkie, and in fact Chaplin was under immense studio pressure to do so. He stuck to his guns though, and presented them with what he must have felt was a goodbye letter to the silent era.All things considered, silent films could not have asked for a more elegant farewell. City Lights is an excellent example of everything that makes silent films superior to talkies, according to some. There's the trademark slapstick comedy, which still leaves audiences in stitches. This brand of comedy simply wouldn't work in a film with sound. Replaced two years later with the first Three Stooges short and their brand of somewhat cruder slapstick, Chaplin's humour necessitated silence. The acting in city lights was superb. The kind of subtlety that is called for in silent films is used to perfection here, displaying plot and emotion unmistakably without ever seeming to be overacting. This is due, no doubt, in part to the legendary perfectionism displayed by Chaplin during the filming of City Lights. Shooting 342 takes of one scene illustrates a level of passion for the film, which is evident in every frame.This is a film without a villain, really. The two main characters are extremely likable. The closest it has to an antagonist is the millionaire, however this is only half the time, and without him the Tramp would not be able to pursue his courtship of the flower girl. The tramp acts as a sort of guardian angel to his millionaire friend, saving him from suicide on several occasions. In almost every other scene, he is struggling to provide for the flower girl who holds his heart. She is the classic picture of noble poverty, never complaining, selling flowers everyday to provide for her grandmother and herself. The two of them are outsiders, struggling to find acceptance and love while being trapped by poverty, and in the flower girl's case, physical disability. In one memorable scene, when we first see her home, she seems jealous of a couple next door and the shot lingers on an image of a bird in cage. Later on the Tramp is literally caged when sent to prison for theft. In the ending, which is touted by some as the most perfect conclusion in film history both are freed from their respective cages when the Tramp is released and the flower girl is cured of her blindness. Now that they are free they can finally find acceptance within another.While not a true silent film, as it has a music track and sound effects, City Lights is in many ways the quintessential silent film. It was also one of Chaplin's last. After this he went into semi-retirement and made only a handful of films before passing away. Given this, and the fact that every scene drips with semi-sweet sentimentality, it is little wonder that fans of the era treasure it much the same way that fans of TV shows get misty-eyed thinking about the series finale of their favourite show. This is not to belittle it, as even non-fans can appreciate its message and storytelling. As James Hamilton said, "If you don't like this movie, there is just something wrong with you".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another triumph for The Tramp!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having seen Chaplin's The Gold Rush, I felt compelled to see more exhibitions of his genius. After having seen City Lights, I am that much more interested in seeing even more of his work. Let me reiterate, Chaplin was a genius! His timing was flawless. His ability to evoke emotion was extraordinary, and he knew how to tell a story! Actor, writer, director, producer, composer; it was not unlike Chaplin to do it all in his movies, but to do all of these, and to do them so brilliantly - it can only be described as genius. This film, is a wonderful place to start for anyone interested in the work of Charles Chaplin. While I feel that The Gold Rush is the better film, I would still recommend this just as quickly. It contains the wonderful sight gags, pratfalls, and classic comedy for which Chaplin's films are so renowned. From the opening scene, the unveiling of the monument, you know that you are in for a treat. The film is not all comedy, though. There is romance and drama as well. Yet, this is where this film shines so brightly; it IS comedy, it IS romance, and it IS drama. All three genres are presented here, purely, and yet, they are intertwined so exquisitely that the viewer hardly realizes the shifts in emotion! This film exemplifies the lost art of "classic" comedy, standing today as a monument to what contemporary comedies should aspire to. And just as it was with the monument in the film, it is The Tramp, Charlie Chaplin who makes it all worth-while!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is not much more I can say that has not already been said. This is one of the best films ever made and I would rate it 10/10. What moves me the most is that the little tramp is the essence of decency. The fact that he is a tramp does not make him lazy or not trustworthy. There is a subtle message here about giving of yourself, sacrifice and kindness. I also think the true meaning of love is expressed very well in the relationship between the blind girl and the tramp. And the saddest thing is that even though she will find out he is her benefactor, there is the probability that any true relationship between them is doomed once she has her sight. Could you allow yourself to offer someone the gift of sight knowing as the tramp does that it will end your relationship forever? This is the true meaning of love and giving. I think this film should be required viewing for everyone. You will never ever forget the last 5 minutes of this movie. Great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great movie with a deeply touching message about love and human frailty.I watched City Lights with a bunch of students as part of a series in a class studying Chaplin's work. Someone asked about the dance hall scene, where Chaplin grabs a woman and starts dancing frenetically and dispassionately around the hall. The student seemed a little confused about the meaning of that moment. I pointed out that this was simply an example of Chaplin doing what he did best; showing how silly we look acting out our rituals.After the class, I thought about this a little more. I think Chaplin holds a hope out to those of us not born with a sense of humor; can we find the cure for this in our lifetimes? More importantly; could Chaplin be that cure? I think Chaplin is something of a miracle. On one hand, he embodies the ideal of the humorist who's just simply funny, and evades analysis. On the other, his craft is detectable, and we can learn from it. We can see how he sets up the joke by establishing himself as someone not to be taken seriously. Having done that, he can then proceed to thrash away at our cherished notions of class, propriety, and overcharged "fun" with a kind of impunity. And we can see him as a good sport and laugh about it, rather than cry over our individual and collective plights.A lot of humor, some drama, some fine metaphor, and, as usual, a good dose of Chaplin using film to communicate to us the images of feeling and human passion.Oh yeah, another thing about this film. I was rather impressed by all the acting, not just Chaplin's; and it sort of surprised me. For some reason, my expectations hadn't been programmed to be very elevated in this regard, and City Lights sort of reestablished for me the importance of expecting good work out of all the personae, even in these early movies.</fullReview>

Chaplin's sense of timing was wonderful, as always. Wholeheartedly recommended.</fullReview>

This film proves that a simple story can be all a great movie needs. I just don't understand why modern film makers can not approach film making like how Chaplin does. It's simply incredible that one man has so much talent. His direction is flawless; he gets the best performances out of everyone of his actors. His acting is inspiring; it proves that great actors don't need to say anything. Again, a wonderfully told story that has a perfect mix of drama and comedy, especially with the help of Chaplin's fantastic score.

		<fullReview>City Lights(1931) is Charles Chaplin's greatest achivement as a filmmaker of the early 20th Century. It belongs to the category of tragic comedy where the main character is suffering and the humor is done as sympathy. The relationship between the little tramp and the blind flower girl is touching in the fact that he loves her to the point of having her eyes fixed. This is not only one of the greatest films of the first half of the 20th Century, but also one of the top ten best movies of all time. Chaplin's top three are 1. City Lights, 2. The Gold Rush, and 3. Modern Times.City Lights would be one of the last films that Chaplin appears as the little tramp(Modern Times(1933) would be the last). Charles Chaplin was one of the few directors doing Silent Films in the early 30's when most were doing Sound Pictures. This motion picture exhibits why Chaplin along with Buster Keaton, and Harold Lloyd were the greatest comedians of the Silent era. The final image represents the lost love of Chaplin's little tramp. City Lights was done as the Marx Brothers were appearing in films with sound.</fullReview>

This movie is about a Tramp that falls in love with a blind flower girl. She thinks that the Tramp is rich but he really just has a millionaire friend that he mooches off of. Well, as you will see, he will do anything for this girl. He even resorts to fighting to raise money for her to pay the rent. The conclusion is one of the best that I have ever seen.

		<fullReview>In a Charles Addams New Yorker cartoon, the producer of a melodrama stands at the back of the theater smiling in a sick way to see the rest of the audience all in tears. That producer would be perfectly cast as Charlie Chaplin.Reams of stuff have been written by critics about how the comic genius Chaplin was a sentimentalist who was capable of conveying sympathy and pathos at the same time that he mocked the silliness and pretensions of modern society. This is so often written that I wonder if anyone in the audience has ever gotten the idea that Chaplin was a ruthless satirist, especially when it came to an underclass made up of vagrants and criminals who were the butt of most of his jokes.A great artist and craftsman, Chaplin was extremely industrious, was never a tramp himself, almost never unemployed (dating back all the way to childhood); he was knighted and was quite the proper gentleman. Although he might have been amused if anyone had confused him with the feckless bums he often portrayed, in reality he probably had only the intention of making the audience ridicule such characters. In his ragged suit and derby and walking like he has a broomstick lodged up his rear, Chaplin's Little Tramp represents the familiar character of the once wealthy young rake now fallen on hard times, the poor little no longer rich boy who has to survive on the generosity of his wealthy patrons or scratch out a living among the dregs of society (pugs, convicted criminals). Chaplin probably thought the ultimate joke is on the audience when it sheds tears over the romantic misfortunes of a type of person on whom pity is wasted.</fullReview>

I was amazed by the heartfelt warmth andcompassion I felt from this movie. It's an amazing piece of work. I havebeen a fan of Chaplin and I have seen most of his films, this has to be thebest of them all.Chaplin wrote, starred and directed this gem. He portrays his alter ego, alonely tramp who does whatever he can to try and survive in a cold andcruel world. One day during his many travels he comes across a beautifulblind woman who sells flowers. The tramp is smitten and begins afriendship with the blind woman. Whilst he courting the blind girl, he saves a wealthy drunk. After fishing him out of the water the man is everthankful. The two develop a very bizarre relationship that has to be seen tobe believed.What makes this film one of the greatest is the ending. It is so powerfuland emotional, if you're not moved by it you must have a heart that's blackas coal. A truly remarkable work of art. City Lights has earned it's spot as one of the best movies ever made.Highly recommended, one of the essentials!A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Tramp meets a blind girl who sells flowers in the street. He falls in love with her, and endeavours to raise money for her eye surgery. Chaplin, as usual, pulls off the bravura achievement of writing, directing, starring and composing the music. The characteristic Chaplin strengths are on display - exquisite timing, virtuoso athleticism and rich comic invention. His weaknesses are also apparent - laboured gags and over-the-top sentimentality. The opening scene, a municipal ceremony to unveil a statue, is hallmark Chaplin. In the background a colonial-style church is dwarfed by huge commercial buildings. The homely virtues of America's early communities have been overwhelmed by rapacious capitalism. The joke which introduces the Tramp is a good one, nicely sustained by the clownage with the sword. In 1931 the cinema was feeling its way with the new medium of sound, an innovation to which the Chaplin style was ill-suited and to which he adjusted only gradually. This film uses a distorted 'buzzing' soundtrack to suggest human speech. It has a valid satirical point (parodying the vapid speeches of local worthies), but for Chaplin it has the added usefulness of avoiding any need for lip-synchronisation. Window-shopping because he has nothing else to do, the Tramp notices a statuette of a female nude in a store's window display. He becomes aroused by it (watch for the crafty little 'erection' joke with the cane) and this prepares us for his sexual interest in the blind girl. This portion of the film is packed with symbolism. The Tramp is a figure on the fringes of civilisation, and he shies instinctively from the motor-cycle cop. The blindness of the girl (played by Virginia Cherrill) is important, because she alone is not repelled by outward appearances. She 'sees' his true worth. Back in her little tenement, the lonely blind girl hears her 'normal' neighbour leaving on a date. She picks up the birdcage, the emblem of her own imprisoned beauty. Chaplin's mime of drunkenness as he 'celebrates' with the Millionaire (Harry Myers) is superb, his problems on the slippery ballroom floor are a comic marvel. Particularly impressive is the eating of the paper streamer. Chaplin's face is a picture! Because he is so adept at conveying information through mime, Chaplin pulls off some wonderful things. The Millionaire shuns him when sober, and the Tramp's bonhomie - rejected by his stiff friend - is all portrayed beautifully in a fleeting gesture. Similarly, the Tramp returns to the park railings where the blind girl usually sits, only to find that she's not there. His body sags in a brilliant depiction of the shock of disappointment. Before the boxing match, the Tramp is rapidly losing heart as he observes the meanness of his opponent. His defeatism as he dabs himself with the lucky rabbit's foot is a delight. More bedraggled than ever, the Tramp re-encounters the now-cured blind girl, and the flower discarded in the gutter represents the inherent goodness of the man, and the way in which society has squandered his potential. Well-constructed in a workmanlike sense, the film is really little more than a vehicle for a string of mime routines (the party, the boxing-match and so on). Modern viewers might feel awkward with the outrageous coincidences which keep the plot moving, and with a comedy routine centring on a drunk driver. The film's sentimental finale is very well-known. Might it not have been more effective if the girl had failed to recognise him?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enriched by the chaplinian flavor and genius, the movie is a coin, with a beautiful love story on one side and, on the other side a humorous, and this means tough, analysis of the contemporary era.Born in 1931, the movie balances in a romantic fashion the values of the contemporary society with the values of the soul. An interesting note is that, in a time when soundtrack movie was rising, Chaplin remains faithful to the unspoken movie, using just a musical background, or a few sound effects. Even if the conflict is born in dialogues, the powerful use of mimics, especially facial mimics, render the story in a certain way, reducing written cards along the movie to a few, just for the main guidance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's important when I give my opinion on a movie to note that my 6* out of 10, no way implicates the artistry, the technical genius that is a Charlie Chaplin movie. It purely is my level of enjoyment during my experience of watching the movie. As a 23 year old in 2015, with limited experience in watching silent movies, in fact, just this and "The Kid" so far. It's hard for me to truly appreciate the movie. Unfortunately as time goes by, City Lights (just like all movies this old), will slowly fall down popularity lists like the IMDb Top 250. That is not to take away anything from what is so obviously a masterpiece of it's era. The movies that came before our times will always have their place, and people intrigued enough by our history in general, and the history of cinema, will always give movies like this, time, even if 6 out of 10 does seem like I am dismissing it.During my time watching, I had fun in parts. There were parts where I was bored, tired. This is down to where I am at in the comedy evolution scale. I'm in 2015, I love "The Office UK". Me personally, I'm not going to laugh anymore when I see someone hit their head constantly. This is not ALL that happens in the movie, but you get my drift. Though luckily enough for older fans, i'm a rare breed these days; just because something doesn't entertain me to the highest possible level, I won't just brush it off and call it "shit". My 6 stars come from a respect of the entertainment and therefore intrigue to watch. The freshness of it to someone who is new to silent movies. The freshness of watching a screen legend like Charlie Chaplin for only the 2nd time. The powerful ending. What it leaves me with, for example, I will have more fun thinking back to this movie, than I had actually watching it. The reason for that is I can cancel out the bits that bore me. I am left with some great characters, and my imagination. The Blind Girl, there is a beauty about blind people that only blind people can attain. An unfortunate but also fortunate naivety about the world. I love the story of the tramp and the blind girl. It's something that i'll remember.If you like silent movies, you've already seen this movie. If you don't like silent movies, you'll hate this movie. If you're not sure whether you like silent movies, try watching a master of his generation, if only for that reason. See what happens. I did, and i'm glad that I did, as Charlie Chaplin is now floating around inside my mind for a while, and I like him there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say I didn't enjoy watching this movie. Specially with all this rush of modern times (to quote another Chaplin movie), it feels good to watch a movie that is not very mentally demanding. The plot could be followed by a five-year old, which is also a breath from all the complicated, deep movies I've been watching recently. And yes, it has some very funny parts, though it seems that the whole plot was written by putting together a bunch of gags that Chaplin had thought about, with no connexion whatsoever but that he made an effort to making them look somehow of a coherent story. I cannot say he wasn't successful.I guess the year it was written (1931) explains the somehow political implication of the tramp and a poor blind lady being the main, good characters, while the butler and the rich man when sober are not likable at all.That being said, is not my favorite comedy, by far. It is also not my favorite Chaplin movie, as he pulls of a much better performance at The Dictator. But hey, it is still remarkable that a movie can still be enjoyable 80 years after it was made: I guess that definitely makes it a classic.</fullReview>

Yet I must say that still having the limitations of sound, Chaplin's directing skills quite improved in terms of set selection and the other casts using their facial expressions better.

It is a film that shocks, provokes and seeks to prick our collective complacency and apathy. That obviously adds up to infinitely more value than the price of a multiplex ticket. But CityLights is a Vishesh Films production, and hence the sounds-cape is anything but run of the mill. Jeet Ganguli's musical score is first-rate, but the lilt and the lyricism of the numbers appear to somewhat soften the blow that the film seeks to deliver.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is artistically beautiful--with nice cinematography, music, etc. Some of this can be attributed to this being a sound-era movie (hence better equipment) but I've gotta admit Chaplin had a great eye--the film is quite pretty and exquisitely made. There were some cute little skits and laughs spread throughout the film. During the boxing match, I barely laughed (though it was well done) and my wife almost fell on the floor laughing. However the film was able to provide a decent number of laughs---even though the story was also brimming with pathos. And wow...it will definitely bring tears to your eyes. I could say more, but I think it's best you just see it for yourself. It's not my favorite Chaplin film but it is amazingly good.One final observation about this film as well as Modern Times: While these films are firmly stuck in the past (silent movies well into the sound era), it was a smart decision on Chaplin's part to do this as well as to only make a few films he could really devote his energy into. Lloyd and especially Keaton strongly embraced the sound era and churned out quite a few films in the late 20s-early 30s--and some of them stunk when compared to their silent films. If I were watching any of these three comedians in a film from the sound era, it would definitely be Chaplin, as he didn't try to change the basic formula. Unfortunately with Keaton in particular, as MGM paired him with the very very very talkative and pushy Jimmy Durante and completely tossed out what had been great about Keaton's earlier films, his film quality plummeted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jon Monsarrat review: good only for a glimpse of the past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>City Lights has many limitations: film-making was new, it's shot in black and white, and it's a silent film. So it's really unfair to say that it compares poorly with the modern film, "Shakespeare in Love". But it does. When you watch City Lights, you're doing so not for the story itself but for a glimpse into the past.It's a glimpse worth seeing but there are many problems. Lacking speech, there isn't much plot, and with just gestures and facial expressions there are limits to how much emotional impact the film can have. The high point is some good physical comedy along the lines of what we'd see in a modern Jackie Chan film.Who should see this film:-- Those interested in classics only-- Tramps who can read, drive, and always wear a suit and tieIf this film were made today it would get zero. But as a short peek into antique film-making, I'll give City Lights a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is A Film of A Conservative Man Who Is Stuck In The Past - Unlike Harold Lloyd who was open-minded and progressive and who eagerly produced his first talkie in 1929 - Chaplin continued to live in his fantasy world of the past and released a silent film in 1931 which could have been made in 1890 - The Synchronized Score could well have been replaced with a violin playing "Hearts And Flowers" because the story is as interesting as a revival of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" I give this a 1 - Don't bother watching this film - read a good book instead.</fullReview>
