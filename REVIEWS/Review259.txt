		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder should not call this powerful whiff of the journalism world "The runt" of his cinematic litter!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's first commercial failure, but one of his best films, almost up there with "Sunset Blvd." Ambitious reporter Chuck Tatum (Kirk Douglas) finds out a man is trapped in a collapsed mine. By spewing out bogus engineering, he manages the rescue of the poor man to become more complicated, and time consuming then needed. Meanwhile, it becomes an amazing news item, something that makes Tatum the best known reporter in the country. However, everybody's luck runs out at the end. Perhaps the cause of failure of this film is that there are no sympathetic characters here. Douglas plays a total creep, the trapped man's wife is a floozy "I'm not going to pray for him! Praying ruins my nylons!" in the film. Even the trapped man is somebody who was poking around Indian graves. The screenplay, and the lead performances are top class. The extensive location photography, and somewhat documentary look of the film makes the film feel more modern than most 1951 films. Billy Wilder calls this film "the runt of his litter" Don't be so harsh, Billy, it's an excellent picture!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Press as the Vehicle of Manipulation of a Nation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cynical, unethical and unscrupulous journalist Charles 'Chuck' Tatum (Kirk Douglas) arrives in a small New Mexico newspaper asking for a chance. He was fired from famous newspapers because of drinking problem, lying and even for having an affair with the wife of one of his bosses. His real intention is to use the small newspaper as a "swimming board" to a bigger one. After one year without a bang news and totally bored, Chuck travels with a younger reporter to make the coverage of a matter about rattlesnakes. When they arrive in an isolated gas station, he is informed that a man called Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) is trapped alive in an old Indian mine in a nearby place called Mountain of the Seven Vultures. Chuck manipulates the local corrupt sheriff, the engineer responsible for the rescue operation and Leo's wife Lorraine Minosa (Jan Sterling), and a rescue that could be made using a simple and common process in twelve hours, lasts six days using a sophisticated drilling system and creating a circus in the previously desert place. Everybody profits with the accident except the victim. Movies about manipulation of people are usually excellent. I remember Costa-Gravas' "Mad City (1997), Barry Levinson's "Wag the Dog (1997)", Howard Hawks' "His Girl Friday (1940)", and even the recent real case of the chemical weapons. Yesterday I saw "Ace in the Hole" for the first time and I really was impressed how this film is amazingly real and updated. There are elements present in every modern society, such as: the powerful sheriff very corrupt, like most of the worldwide members of the governments; the press, interested in selling news only; the victim used for other interests greater than rescuing him; and the people, completely manipulated and with very short memory. Kirk Douglas is amazing in the role of a nasty reporter. I do not understand why this movie is not in the IMDb Top 250. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "A Montanha dos Sete Abutres" ("The Mountain of the Seven Vultures")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant movie that lingers in the mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the many movies I viewed in the early 50's, so many ,like now, were here today, forgotten tomorrow. However some movies that became memorable and that were able to make a dramatic impact on this young guy include, Duel in the Sun and Gone with the Wind. Strangely enough, Ace in the Hole is the most memorable of all movies viewed. It is one that invades the mind and leaves one sad.Few films I remember as vividly as this dark movie, the images linger to haunt me still. 'Why?' one might ask 'would a sombre movie like this made over 50 years ago remain so memorable, when so many others have vanished. Was it the surreal inhumanity of the plot, the repugnant newsman devoid of ethics, the exploitation of the trapped victim, the purposeful prolonging of the victim's entrapment to create a media frenzy, the ultimate commercial creation of an 'event' style attraction complete with a circus like atmosphere surrounding the cave while the victim remained entrapped and close to death.'Supposedly based on a real incident, it's a tough movie to watch and more so if one is prepared to accept the premise that such inhumanity displayed in the movie has an element of truth.I echo the desires of others to have the availability of this movie on VHS or DVD. In the interim my memory will continue to keep the images intact. See it if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Billy Wilder's great movies, with a superb acting job by Kirk Douglas as the cynical, glory-seeking and even desperate reporter whose only goal is get back in the limelight by regaining his former big-city news desk job. The idea of such a newspaper reporter manipulating events to stretch out a story at the expense of and disregard for the victim still seems nearly inhuman, but Douglas' performance makes it instantly believable. The story scenario in which locals, then passers-by and finally distant tourists gravitate to and then make a festival or circus out of the event (the film was also released under the title "The Big Carnival") is supported by the real events on which the story was most likely based: the West VA mine disaster in 1925 that trapped miner Floyd Collins and was reported for 17 days, much as in the film, by local newspaperman Skeets Miller, who crawled into the mineshaft for face-to-face interviews with the trapped and doomed Collins.This movie fits nicely into the Film Noir genre, although it takes place largely under the hot, harsh glare of the Arizona sun, highlighting the sweat and grime visible on the characters' skin and creating a visual metaphor for the sorry state of their souls. I wonder if Henri-Georges Clouzot saw this film before he began filming "The Wages of Fear," because the visually pervasive atmosphere of sweat and filth and opportunism are equally present in both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The plot is based on real events</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie very closely parallels the real events of January 30 to February 16, 1925 in terms of the general story line. There are some significant differences concerning the actions of the characters.Floyd Collins, a cave explorer working alone (not a real good idea), was trapped in Sand Cave KY, near Mammoth Cave. He was not looking for treasure, but for a new cave suitable for commercializing to produce income in an economically depressed region...and this was before the Depression occurred.He became trapped on the way out of the cave by a 27 lb. rock which rolled onto his leg in a narrow crawlway. The configuration was such that it could not be moved enough to get his foot past.When he failed to return home, the family went searching and quickly found him only 150' inside the cave.A huge rescue effort was mounted and a cub reporter, Skeets Miller, from Louisville KY showed up to cover the story. It became one of the three most widely broadcast events of the time. Besides the extensive newspaper coverage, the relatively new medium of commercial radio riveted listeners with hourly accounts. It quickly became the first media circus ever seen.Because of the print and radio coverage people began flocking to the site. A carnival atmosphere did indeed spring up around the cave. The state police and National Guard were called out by the governor to control the chaos and the more than 20,000 onlookers. The similarity between the real event and the movie on this account are likely nearly identical.As in the movie, a decision was made to drill a shaft and, also as in the movie, the rock was fairly unstable and prone to collapse from the pounding of the cable tool drilling rig. The longer the effort went on, the more unstable the cave passage became.Unlike Kirk Douglas' character in the movie, Skeets Miller served a most honorable role. Due to his small build he became one of very few persons able, and eventually the only one willing, to enter in an attempt to deliver food and water to Collins. He received a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting. Also unlike the movie, there was no manipulation of the event to delay the rescue, but there was considerable disagreement over how to best do it. Area coal miners made the initial attempts and the event concluded with the above-mentioned shaft.Collins was presumed to have died 3 days before rescuers reached him. Because the conditions were so unstable, the body was left in the cave. The family was able to remove him about 80 days afterward for a proper burial. Later, his glass-topped casket was returned to the now-commercial cave as a tourist attraction. It was removed once again, and finally, in 1989.In 1982, a definitive account of the event was published in the book 'Trapped!'. A most informative read.In a take-off of the 'Free Tibet' bumper stickers, vehicles are occasionally seen with a 'Free Floyd Collins' sticker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fifty years later,Billy Wilder's tour de force has worn so well it should be considered the finest movie dealing with the media,topping "network" for instance.The world described here is so depressing,so disheartening that it takes drama to new limits.Not only Tatum is evil,but so are the miner's wife and family who take advantage of the situation ,regardless of any morals.So is the faceless crowd ,who has a wild time, near a dying man.You and me,we could be part of this populace,and maybe we've already been!Remember the little South American girl who fell into a pit in the eighties.The fair sequences might have influenced Fellini for "la dolce vita" (hype about a girl who would have seen Virgin Mary).The soundtrack ,with its relentless thud ,is so oppressive you feel the unfortunate victim's plight within your body and your soul .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A powerful toasting of the media of the day. Imagine what this would have been like in the age of television. Kirk Douglas plays a self-centered heel, and does so very well. I also liked Jan Sterling as Lorraine. It's true that there is no really sympathetic character in this film, except maybe Leo, the man trapped in the cave. Someone wrote that he too, wasn't a sympathetic character, because he was trapped while collecting Indian artifacts for sale, but I don't think that would have bothered anyone in 1951. The tone of the film throughout was one of total cynicism, that seems a bit out of place for the times. Maybe that's why this movie was not a commercial success. It fits much better now, though, since everyone has seen the media behaving in such disgraceful fashion. However, that may rob it of some of its (probably intended) shock value. Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a neglected gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film in 1951. At least two decades passed before it was occasionally shown on network TV, usually on local afternoon movie programs. The lack of a happy ending (to put it mildly) may have played a part. A flop when it was originally released (and referred to by Billy Wilder as "the runt of the litter"), this movie is still not available in DVD or VHS. This is a shame, because it is a taut, very cynical, and extremely well-made rumination on the idea of media observation and manipulation, and the easy corruption of otherwise earnest citizens.The movie also contains what I feel is the single greatest scene in all moviedom: An extremely high view of a trainload of gawkers arriving at the "big carnival" (the movie's alternate title), along with the soundtrack of a made-for-the-movie country-western song. You'll know it when you see it. Observe as well the hordes of people and cars, the cast of thousands, assembled for the exterior shots. This was not digital, it was casting and logistics and bullhorns and the gimlet-eyed vision of the director.Do not miss this treasure!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this films years ago and it's still gripping.Mr.Wilder seldom did films that gripped the human condition like this one.After this movie flopped he stuck to screen adaptions of stage hits through most of the fifties.Both director and star,Kirk Douglas really delivered a stinging expose of media hype and manipulation of the newspaper business.Herein,burned out reporter Douglas chances on a man trapped in a cave and ruthlessly exploits it for his own gain.There's no softness here,even the leading lady (played wonderfully by Jan Sterling)is as hard as Douglas.The scenes of all the gawkers showing up,complete with carnival,are outright creepy.There's even a cheesy country western singer plunking a guitar and singing about poor Leo,(the trapped man.) The only sympathetic person is poor Leo's mom who continually prays for his release.Definitely a film for lovers of great movie drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great piece of filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, Billy Wilder is one of the five best filmmakers that ever set foot in America; his ability to transform a beat-up formula to an entertaining, intelligent and classic old-time Hollywood flick is uncanny. He´s probably the BEST screenwriter of all time, too. His magic touch hits "The Big Carnival" like fire. The characters, in particular Chuck Tatum, one of Kirk Douglas´ greatest roles, are highly developed and interesting; there are no heroes here, and no evildoers either, just a bunch of working men who happen to have the easiest opportunity of their lives to gain a fortune over a fatal tragedy. The analysis of journalism contained in the movie is simple and clear; newspapers are meant to wrap up fish. Whats the matter if you can make some money in the process? It is the murder of the truth, if there is any. A brilliant film, one of Wilder´s best. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Billy Wilder Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The excitement to finally see the only movie of Billy Wilder's greatest period I hadn't seen, verged on childishness. I love Wilder and I felt frustrated not to be able to find anywhere "Ace In The Hole" Well, all that's over now. I've seen it, in its crispy DVD release. The theme is Wilderesque, bitter sweet. Some of the lines belong, unquestionably, to the best Wilder sharp, unsentimental wit but, and unfortunately there is a big couple of buts here. Walter Newman and Lesser Samuels (his co-writers) are not Diamond or Brackett and Kirk Douglas is relentless in his on your face, loud son of a bitch. His "redemption" is literary but not cinematic. His performance starts way up high and stays there. I was longing for the laconic delivery of a Fred McMurray in "Double Indemnity" Here, one could see through his character way to easy and far too fast. Jan Sterling is lovely as the woman on the verge. Tough cookie. Delivering a couple of the best lines in the film. All in all, maybe my expectations were too high and the film deserves to be seen again. I will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder at his very best again. Punchy, hard and brutal. You don't like anyone in the film - your're not meant to and it's all the better for it. Kirk Douglas is a loud-mouthed, down at heel has-been reporter who seizes on an opportunity of a man trapped in a mine as his meal ticket back to the big time. He has his town hangers on and nearing the end of the film the whole town and beyond is feverish with the publicity, all making a tidy little profit (hamburger stalls circus's fairgrounds etc..) Kirk's relationship with the waitress, herself wanting a meal ticket passage out of town, is fantastically well read. She's tough, she's always had the bad hand in life but compared to kirk, she's a pussycat. In one scene she retorts to Kirk "I've met a lot of hard-boiled eggs in my time, but you--you're twenty minutes" A must see-film and certainly in the top 100 of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the pairing of Wilder and Douglas we get best of both world's.Best director of his day {or arguably any other} and best actor for that decade and beyond{somewhat arguable}In this drama {not Film Noir enough} because there is no dark urban setting or real femme fatale,exist's a very fine vehicle for Kirk Douglas.As the proragonist who is relentlessly absorbed in his work as hard-boiled reporter looking in earnest for big breaking story,he packs more than the usual Kirk true grit.And any actor worth his salt knows Kirk rules on that domain.His facial countenance of clenched jaw and wild-eyed demeanor was his stock in trade,and made for this type of movie.And we,as audience are privvy too and enveloped by sheer ease at which it is demonstrated. The storyline revolves around less than big city newspaper and Kirk's rather new undertaking as somewhat jaded journalist who has trouble dealing with authority and anyone incapable of seeing things his way.Therefore getting the boot from many a newspaper due to intranisigence and lack of good manners.Which makes for really good drama about his new plight and overall character flaws and strenghts. With a good backdrop of out of the way desert to establish the plot and suspence and plenty of foil to go around,the movie is rive with possible deals and double crosses and film noir aspects of storyline.And again who better than Kirk{one of his absolute best roles}to play the lead character and establish all action around.At the pinnacle of his carreer and it shows,he has more than enough grit and sassiness,and tough-guy bravura to go around.In fact,maybe too much.He is so utterly central to overall plot and story as to render other's in scene to be much less important.Nevertheless a very compelling and outstanding display of character depth and emotion,with a quite dramatic flair for ending.An absolute must see for any fans of Kirk,or great character drama,or journalist's-who seem to be getting a raw deal of late.After watching Mr.Douglas play a hard-edged journalist,then journalism will never be the same.Or will it?? 5 out of 5 star or 10/10 for a very complicated character brought to life,with all the gusto and spirit that makes great movies worth watching.Dig Daddio's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hard Hitting Tale Of Man's Inhumanity To Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ace In The Hole" provides a brilliant and blistering account of how a media circus is cynically created, extended and manipulated purely to capitalise on the public's seemingly insatiable appetite for human interest stories. The main characters are motivated by greed and ambition and ruthlessly exploit the gross misfortune of another human being for their own dubious ends. Billy Wilder who produced, directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Walter Newman and Lesser Samuels, paints a grim picture of human nature in this story which is both fast moving and uncompromising.Chuck Tatum (Kirk Douglas) is a newspaper reporter who finds himself out of luck and out of money when he arrives in Albuquerque, New Mexico with a broken down car and no job. He's a man who'd previously worked for a number of prestigious newspapers where his employment had been cut short due to a variety of problems including alcoholism, adultery and libel but his undoubted talent and his ability to sell himself, quickly gain him a job at the "Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin".A year later, Tatum is assigned to cover a rattlesnake hunt but on his way he stops at a desert trading post where he discovers that the proprietor, Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) has become trapped in a cave where he'd been searching for Indian artifacts. Tatum quickly recognises the story's potential and wastes no time in getting into the cave where he sees Minosa trapped under some timber beams. He talks to him, photographs him and assures him that he'll be rescued as soon as possible.Tatum promptly calls his editor Jacob C Boot (Porter Hall) to tell him about the story which is a real scoop. To serve the purposes of the story, Tatum wants Minosa's wife Lorraine (Jan Sterling) to appear to be a devoted spouse who's distressed about Leo's predicament. She's completely uncaring, however, and wants to use the opportunity to leave Leo and their isolated home without delay. Tatum tries to make her feel guilty about her intentions and persuades her to change her mind.Tatum makes a deal with corrupt local sheriff Gus Kretzer (Ray Teal) to ensure that he's the only reporter who's allowed access to Minosa and then the two men pressurise engineer Sam Smollett (Frank Jacquet) into carrying out the rescue operation by drilling a shaft through the rock rather than by simply shoring up the walls of the cave. The drilling operation is favoured because it would take about a week to complete and this would allow the story to be fully exploited. The shoring up option, by contrast, would result in the rescue being completed in less than a day.Vast numbers of people soon arrive at the trading post and the grounds adjacent to the cave quickly fill up with tourists, reporters, hot dog stands and even a Ferris wheel. Lorraine makes spectacular profits, the sheriff receives flattering publicity to help his re-election campaign and Tatum uses his control of the whole event to be handsomely paid by a New York newspaper for them to be given the exclusive story. Later developments, however, derail Tatum's plans and the carnival atmosphere is soon brought to an end.Kirk Douglas gives an incredibly powerful performance as the unscrupulous Chuck Tatum and Jan Sterling is very believable as the cold, callous and coarse Lorraine who is totally devoid of any redeeming qualities.Commercially, "Ace In The Hole" was a spectacular failure and this was probably down to the fact that most of the people featured in the story are unsympathetic characters. Tatum, Kretzer and Lorraine are all despicable, unethical and opportunistic and don't have an ounce of sympathy between them for the unfortunate Minosa. The people who gather at the scene of the accident and turn it into a carnival are voyeuristic and grossly insensitive and the various business people on site simply regard Minosa's plight as an opportunity to make a quick profit. It's encouraging that in the years since its initial release, the merits of this movie have become more clearly recognised and it's appreciated as being even more relevant today than it was when it was made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far Ahead Of Its Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ace In the Hole," which used to turn up on local TV as "The Big carnival," was far head of its time. It wasn't very successful and its cynicism shocked people.Along comes Andy Warhol almost two decades later with his notion of "fifteen minutes of fame" and everyone buys that concept. It's not quite the same as the concept of this. Nor is that of the very popular "Network," which came even later. But the premise here is that reporter Kirk Douglas will literally jeopardize a man's life in order to get a series of big newspaper stories. And does anyone today doubt that such things happen? Wilder was often cynical, though here it is to the most meaningful end. "the Fortune Cookie" and "Kiss Me, Stupid" are cynical also and they are both fun but this one makes a very trenchant point and they do not.The acting is superb. Kirk Douglas gave many brilliant performances. This is one of them. The trailer included in the DVD I just saw crows that with this Jan Sterling will be immediately elevated to the top rank of female stars. That never happened but she is excellent here, as generally elsewhere.The interviews of Wilder by Cameron Crowe tell a funny story about the genesis of one of her lines. I'd better not quote it; so get that book. It's very entertaining, informative, and touching.Wilder was one of =this country's great directors. This will probably never be one of his most popular movies but I'd certainly rank it as one of his best.</fullReview>

I grant that this acting style of which I complain is very much of the period, but the declamatory nature of Tatum's character comes on way too strong, and makes what could have been a complex character into a very one dimensional one. The overall effect of this and the rest of the writing leaves one with the feeling of being bludgeoned, rather than being exposed to a very disturbing and pervasive phenomena.

		<fullReview>I rented Ace in the Hole (aka The Big Carnival) upon reading glowing reviews of it by such critics as Roger Ebert. They claimed it was a neglected classic and possibly the best film of Billy Wilder's career. Although it is definitely a good film and ahead of its time, it does not quite live up to the hype.The film, in short, is a condemnation of media circuses and the exploitation of tragedy by reporters. It focuses on the efforts of Kirk Douglas's character, who uses unscrupulous methods to generate a media circus around a man trapped in a collapsed cave. A corrupt sheriff, the trapped man's discontented wife, and a gullible public aid his efforts.The film's main problem is Kirk Douglas's performance. Even though he is a good actor, his over-the-top approach detracts from the believability of his character. One would expect such a deft manipulator to be far more subtle than the arrogant, raging character he plays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I can handle big news and little news, and if there's no news, I'll go out and bite a dog."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps Billy Wilder would feel vindicated today after putting this film down as one of his lesser achievements. His own background as a reporter in Vienna and Berlin most likely influenced this story of a cynical newspaper reporter who insinuates himself into his byline to influence events instead of merely reporting them. See, and I thought this was only a modern day inconvenient truth.I didn't expect "Ace in the Hole" to be the gripping movie it turned out to be. Kirk Douglas is masterful in presenting a character so out of touch with basic human decency that he never considers that sometimes the law of unintended consequences can intrude on one's best laid plans. Down and out reporter Chuck Tatum (Douglas) happens upon a story in the making in the middle of a New Mexico desert, and his overblown ego takes command of the situation. A master manipulator, Tatum convinces a local corrupt sheriff (Ray Teal) to milk an underground rescue attempt to pile up votes for the next election, and together they bully a contractor (Frank Jaquet) to use a rescue method that will take six days instead of eighteen hours. Tatum also latches on to a local legend, the 'Mountain of the Seven Vultures' to add a tense note of mystery and foreboding to his copy, all in an effort to secure a prized position back at his former New York City newspaper.It's hard not to become angry watching this picture because one instinctively knows that this type of stuff occurs on a daily basis in newsrooms across the country. It's gotten to the point where one can't really trust what appears in print or on the TV screen half the time today, a sorry state of affairs if one relies on accuracy in reporting for any reason at all. The carnival atmosphere that develops around the Leo Mimosa story must have seemed oddly unbelievable, even impossible back when the picture was made, but today it seems about par for the course.One can figure out where this story is going after a certain point; all that's left is for the finger pointing to start. Admirably, for a creepy character like Tatum, he decides to blow the whistle on his own complicity in causing a man's death, but it's too little too late. The gawkers pack up and leave and those who profited from the spectacle are left to their own seamy existence, including the wife of the trapped miner (Jan Sterling), revealed as callous and hypocritical as the sheriff. In a nod to both true noir sensibility and demands of the Production Code, Chuck Tatum goes down for the final count as the picture closes, knowing just before he drops that the circus is finally over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trapped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A journalist from New York, Chuck Tatum, ends up in Albuquerque working for a local newspaper. He is a defeated man who has failed miserably because of his hard drinking, among other things. But his luck is about to change. After being sent to report on a rattle snake contest, he stumbles on a tragic situation where a miner has been trapped in an abandoned silver mine. Tatum recognizes the value of the situation as a news item that will, not only sell papers, but will, perhaps, give him the chance to make it big in the field he knows well. He risks his own life in going into the mine to interview Leo Minosa.In order to do that, he joins forces with the corrupt local sheriff Kretzer, who is game for what the deal will mean to his status in the community. In exchange for his efforts, he wants to be the exclusive rights to the situation. Tatum meets the miner's wife, a one time saloon girl, Lorraine, who Leo rescued from an uncertain life and brought her to the family's restaurant in the dusty desert area. Lorraine sees an opportunity to flee the scene, something that she has done before, but Chuck Tatum wants her as part of the scheme he has plotted in his mind.When the human story hits the airwaves, it finds a captive audience. Soon, all curiosity seekers descend on the area next to the mine to witness whatever happens. Instead of using conventional methods, Chuck decides to "milk" the situation by not doing what reason dictates must be done. He decides to direct the drilling from the top, a process that will delay the rescue operation, but will give Tatum a chance to gain the notoriety he seeks, at the expense of the man pinned down in the mine.This film, directed by the great Billy Wilder, is one of his finest efforts in Hollywood. Yet, the film didn't find an audience, unlike the one attracted within the film. Written in collaboration by Mr. Wilder, Lesser Samuels and Walter Newman, the screenplay is one of the most ambitious in the director's distinguished career. He knew exactly where he wanted to know, using as a theme the manipulation of the news by people that only want to show sensationalism, at the expense of a human suffering. Kirk Douglas had one of his finest moments in the movies with his Chuck Tatum. He knew exactly what the public wanted and he gives it to them. In a way, he was a great impresario, setting the scene for the curious to come to the show to be on the front row to witness the suffering and pain Leo Minosa was experiencing. Jan Sterling, who plays Lorraine, matches Mr. Douglas all the way. She could see inside the man who didn't care about a husband that she was going to abandon, anyway. The rest of the cast does a fine job.Charles Lang's cinematography captures in vivid detail the carnival atmosphere that is at the center of the film. His camera angles enhance the film tremendously. Hugo Friedhofer provided the musical score that blended perfectly with the action. Arthur Schmidt editing works well. Ultimately this was a Billy Wilder film that will stay in the viewer's memory for quite a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It still retains its power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have recently embarked on a chronological retrospective of the works of Billy Wilder that is proving to be a wayward journey through some pretty uneven territory. He hit the jackpot early on with "Double Idemnity" a film noir with a script that is simply light years away in quality from most others of the genre. Then came a really duff period with "The Lost Weekend", worthy in many respects, not least for Ray Milland's superb performance as an alcoholic, but drowned in a plethora of hysterical visuals and a Miklos Rozsa score to beat them all in over-intrusiveness; the daft Austrian never-never-land of "The Emperor Waltz"; the equally daft mission by the unbelievable Congresswoman Frost to investigate what the military rank and file were getting up to in the postwar Berlin of "A Foreign Affair" and, to cap it all, that lurid melodrama "Sunset Boulevard" which leaves me completely out of step with its many admirers. The cocktail that includes a dead monkey, a German "heavy" manservant playing an organ, a has-been ex-actress and her toyboy who delivers the interior monologue when he becomes a corpse in a swimming pool is just too over the top for me. "Ace in the Hole" that followed is an altogether different matter. I have to admit it was the one I was not looking forward to as I had glowing memories of it as a youth. The pedestal of adolescent worship has on more that one occasion easily toppled. Imagine my delight when I discovered that time has in no way reduced the intensity of this savage attack on the power of a newspaperman to exploit human suffering to further his ambition. Politicians, construction overseers, the general public - their ghoulish instincts played upon - all are corrupted in Wilder's cynical attack on the basest impulses of mankind. It is a film where only the weak, the man trapped in the cave, his parents and the editor of a conservative local newspaper, show any sign of virtue. And yet, in the sense of dignity with which Wilder depicts them, they are the real winners, whereas the corrupt journalist, brilliantly played by Kirk Douglas, ends up by losing everything including that gift of life he has so cruelly deprived of the trapped man. In "Ace in the Hole" Wilder gave us a beautifully balanced moral drama, his only work to stand beside the best of Elia Kazan in its sense of social conscience. I know there are quite a few more excellent thing to come in his oeuvre but at this point I cannot imagine anything finer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This hard-boiled egg is twenty minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meet Chuck Tatum (Kirk Douglas). With a low growl and a sizeable assortment of personal affectations, he turns the tow truck driver into his personal chauffeur, he lights a match on the sliding typewriter, mocks everyone he charms and vice versa. With pride and self-contempt, he manages to sell himself to a newspaper by convincing the editor-in-chief that he is indispensable--even though he's been fired from eleven papers for good reasons. "I can handle big news and little news," he declares, "and if there's no news I'll go out and bite dog." He is machismo and self-hatred, and he will do anything for a buck. In other words, he is a typical Wilder anti-hero. A year later, Tatum has taken up his boss's habit of wearing belt and suspenders. To stave off boredom, he pesters his affectionate co-workers. His promised big break comes a year later: when covering the story of a rattlesnake hunt he hears of a treasure-seeker, Leo Minosa, trapped in a coal mine. Enter Mrs. Minosa (Jan Sterling). The sneering bottle blonde would be as iconic as Norma Desmond and Phyllis Dietrichson had ACE IN THE HOLE been popular at the time of its release. Like Cora in THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE, she is trapped in a marriage with a man she doesn't love in a remote diner that doesn't generate any cash. Along comes the attractive but amoral man who offers both cash and sex. Most importantly cash. Cash is the name of the game for all characters in ACE IN THE HOLE. Leo gets trapped in pursuit of ancient Indian artifacts to sell, the implication being that the pursuit of wealth is imprisoning and that nothing is sacred. When Tatum successfully feeds off the sympathies of the masses, the S&amp;M Entertainment Company trucks roll in to erect a lucrative circus. Folk singers, carnies, and thousands of people more interested on appearing on television than worrying about Leo amass. Everyone profits but the victim. When Leo's wife, after having drained the cash register of its last $11, retorts that "Honey, you like those rocks just as much as I do," she is not speaking just to Tatum but to the masses.****MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW****Never has a film noir more explicitly dealt with the theme of entrapment. Leo Minosa becomes a physical manifestation of the claustrophobia surrounding all the characters: Tatum's desperation to make a big story, Mrs. Minosa's desperation to transcend her dull existence, even the sheriff's desperation to be re-elected. In the mine shaft, dust streams down ceaselessly to pool on his face and body. Leo is being slowly buried alive while the drill makes a ceaseless, solemn pound. As it gets closer and closer it feels like the drums of death approaching, tormenting Leo. Grit gathers like fur on Leo's face, and the lighting becomes even more striking, casting ghastly shadows over his face. Here comes what might be Kirk Douglas' finest acting moment: The priest administers last rites for Leo and the camera cuts to Tatum's face during the words "bless me father for I have sinned. *I'm sorry*." Everything is there: profound guilt, shame, grief, a self-loathing that goes deeper than that ever-pounding drill. The consequences of his pathological ambition have finally crept up with him, and he too is being buried alive. The motif of suffocation comes full circle when Tatum wraps Mrs. Minosa's anniversary present--a fur that resembles a "skinned couple-a hungry rats"--around her neck and keeps pulling tighter. "I can't breath!" she gasps. He snarls back, "He can't breathe either." This film is dismissed as cynical by people who don't want to acknowledge how close to reality it is. Acerbic? Absolutely. Sleazy? You bet. But there has never been a film--much less an old film--that so perfectly captured the bloodlust for the sensationalized human interest story. To write it off as cynical is to ignore the existence of yellow journalists who litter flashbulbs on their subjects, who ask them to confide their deepest anxieties before splashing them on the front page news, who alter and rewrite reality to make a better story. There have been other films such as NETWORK and A FACE IN THE CROWD that are praised for being crystal balls into the future of American media, but neither of which were nearly as condemning. There are traces of irony in ACE IN THE HOLE that can only be attributed to the fact that a story so excessive and absurd was actually based on *fact.* 57 years from its release and it hasn't aged a day. The only thing that separates the film from the world of today are the radio and newspaper journalists in lieu of television. There is a basic meanness, a violence, a grit that makes today's edgiest dramas look like white-washed fluff. Even Mrs. Minosa's wardrobe (a factor that ages the timeliest films) looks perfectly modern with its men's plaid shirts and rolled-up jeans. Billy Wilder has made half a dozen great films that could each be argued to be his masterpiece, but it is my opinion that ACE IN THE HOLE has and always will be Wilder's finest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey Fans! Billy Wilder Dares to "Tell the Truth"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great, mind boggling, unforgettable film. It passes the test of time because it is, unfortunately, more truthful and relevant now than it was in 1951. Billy Wilder makes many caustic and sardonic comments on how people dwell on and exploit human tragedy. But on top of the content, we have a film that is well crafted in all ways-- well written, acted, directed, photographed and scored.I first saw it on TV in the 70s, and then it disappeared (small wonder since it totally skewers the media). I'm sure it was (and still is) a required part of college journalism, media and sociology classes, as a friend of mine in college at that time said he had seen it in a class at San Francisco State College. It is a textbook on how the media manipulates (now we say 'spins') and exploits human tragedy for profit. How cynical it is, and what a sad commentary on the culture we have surrounding us today! Of course, 'Wag the Dog' (1997) is great, but it is pretty much after the fact. 'Ace in the Hole', on the other hand, is too horrifyingly prescient. Charlie Tatum (Kirk Douglas), a former New York newspaper reporter now trapped in his own hole, a dead-end job at a New Mexico newspaper, sees his way out by covering the story of a man trapped inside a mine. He sees this as his way back to the big time, to a Pulitzer Prize, and also as revenge on other journalists. When Tatum's first story appears, crowds begin arriving at the mine site to watch the unfolding rescue. Although the man, Leo Minosa, can be rescued in about a day, Tatutm 'convinces' (forces) the local sheriff (Roy Teal in his nastiest role) and the mining engineer to prolong the rescue by using a drilling process that will take about a week, thus ensuring that Tatum can continue to exploit the situation much longer. This film is a dark allegory and amazingly a daylight film noir.Drawn into Tatum's web of exploitation and greed are the miner's wife, Lorraine (Jan Sterling in her best performance), who when she realizes what is happening tries to profit as much as she can from it herself; Sheriff Kretzer, who sees it as a guarantee for re-election; and the innocent young newspaper photographer, Herbie, who becomes swept up in Tatum's visions of success and money. But this is not all: businesses arrive en masse (food and goods vendors, special railroad trains, musicians and carnival road shows) to 'serve' the curious. Lorraine's trading post and gas station become jammed with eager tourists seeking to follow the unfolding rescue. It all becomes, literally, a feeding frenzy and a media circus.When Tatum enters the newspaper office, he notices the embroidered sign on the wall: "Tell the Truth." Although Wilder is hinting at how Tatum will embroider the truth to suit his own selfish purposes, Billy himself is telling us the truth about the media-- and us!-- in this movie: 1) "Bad news sells best," says Tatum; 2) "Good news is not news," he says, and then, 3) "Human interest" is not about how hundreds are being hurt or killed but it is about one person with a name. 4) And then, most damningly of all, Wilder shows us that we, the public, will eat up as much as we can of the 'news' of human tragedy! 5) So, therefore, what ultimately follows, as he shows us, in extremis, is a 'media circus' designed to feed not only our curiosity, but also our presence (ego). Remember that William Holden, when he was making 'Sunset Boulevard,' (1950) said that "Billy Wilder has a mind full of razor blades."No wonder this film was a bomb (but not in Europe!) in the USA of 1951. Without his prior screen writers, Billy Wilder was now free to work without inhibition. The result was what we now call an 'independent' film, an 'autuer' film, a complete product of Billy Wilder.How great is Kirk Douglas! Give him a retro Oscar! Billy guides him perfectly in every shot and action. When Lorraine realizes what Tatum is up to, in a great shot outside the door, she smiles and bites into an apple-- Eve has fallen, and catastrophe will follow. So many other great composed shots! The amazing 'drive in' overhead shots of the cars and the desert. So many great tiny bits of business (from slamming the typewriter to the rattlesnake in the box) that Billy added! The score, a thump, thump, pounding nothing, perfectly fits the environment and the theme.Thankfully, the Criterion Collection has now (2007) released the movie on DVD! Spike Lee in his afterword on it goes totally euphoric in his admiration for the film, even revealing how he stole the final shot to use in his 'Malcom X' (1992).An amazing, fantastic film to watch even if it is so horrible in its devastating expression of the extreme 'Tatum' world of media that we are exposed to now every day! I give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mmm. Two Scoops.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a good movie. It's hard to believe that the audience was considered so sensitive in 1947 that the original title, "Ace in the Hole," had to be dropped and replaced with this less ironic one. Viewers were thought unprepared for a film in which a reporter misbehaved, with lethal results."The Big Carnival" is one of the reasons the director, Billy Wilder, earned a reputation as a cynic. It was probably deserved. He had a keen sense of humor as well (Wilder: "I laugh at everything. I laugh at Hamlet.") but it's not much on display here. Instead we have a naive veteran pinned underground and an ambitious reporter (Kirk Douglas) who deliberately delays the rescue in order to squeeze the most out of the story. Instead of extracting the victim from the heart of the mountain the quick and easy way, Douglas talks the corrupt sheriff and engineer into doing it the long, slow, and ultimately lethal way. The tubby engineer caught in the middle is the unhappy Frank Jaquet. He mops his brow and imitates digging with none of the icononoclastic pizazz of William "Strata" Smith. Just a schlubb. Except for the victim, I felt sorrier for the engineer Smollett than for anyone else. Poor Louie Minosa. He catches pneumonia and dies after being given extreme unction. Douglas dies too, as the code of the time required.Wilder's direction is fine. Douglas acquires a young acolyte and when they last speak together, the light is behind Douglas so that Douglas's sharp shadow blacks out almost all of the kid's face. In the last shot, from floor level, Douglas collapses and his dead face flops almost into the camera lens although the face is too dark to make out, his features, like his soul, in deep shadow. In another scene, Douglas is busily reading his mail and concocting additional material for the Big Story. Douglas again is in deep shadow. Beside him is the bright figure of Louie Minosa's wife, the trashy, blond Jan Sterling. She's a tough and narcissistic cookie out of Baltimore and, impressed by Douglas's power and his ability to bring in the bucks, she comes on to him with a wide and seductive smile. Douglas looks at her over his shoulder and says, "You're the grief-stricken wife, so stop smiling." "Make me," she replies, and he slaps her twice, hard, across the face. It's a shocking moment and, despite Douglas's earlier casual chatter about his ambitions, the viewer suddenly realizes that this guy will stop at nothing. That is, he not only claims to be ruthless, he really MEANS it. "That's the expression I want to see," Douglas tells her smoothly. "Don't wipe those tears away." Everyone gives performances that are at least decent. Porter Hall, whom you will recognize, does a comic/dramatic turn as the stuffy and conservative editor of an Albuquerque newspaper. One of the few chuckles the viewer is allowed is when Douglas first asks Porter for a job and analyzes Porter as a small-time fellow because he wears both belt AND suspenders, compared to Douglas's flashy suit. A year goes by and we see Douglas too wearing both belt and suspenders. (He shucks the suspenders when he gets a job offer from New York.)This is a finely made movie about two parallel scoops: an attempt to dig Louie Minosa out of his underground prison and Douglas's attempt to turn the story into a heady drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Go home! The carnival is over."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie I have loved since the first time I saw it as a child. Kirk Douglas plays the lead role in "The Big Carnival", or "Ace in the Hole" as it was originally titled. As down and out former ace newspaper reporter Chuck Tatum, he finds himself broke in the southwest and manages to talk himself into a reporting job with a small town newspaper. He and a cub photographer are sent to cover a snake hunt and on the way they come across a more interesting story. A man hunting Navaho artifacts got caught in a cave in.Tatum, after visiting the man, Leo Minoso in the cave, has visions of Floyd Collins and a Pulitzer prize dancing in his head. Through blackmail and manipulation of the story, Tatum sells his soul and his journalistic ethics in his quest for a chance at the big time again.This movie was ahead of it's time in estimating how low the media would go to sell a story. Tatum leads the carnival of onlookers, vendors and other reporters wanting a piece of the story until the inevitable tragic ending occurs. He realizes too late how he has turned a simple event into a tragedy and become part of the story instead of a reporter. Kirk Douglas turns in a powerful performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terse, hard-bitten microcosm of America, exposing its lack of morals and ethics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New Mexico man, searching through an old mine for Indian artifacts, is trapped after the floors caves in; by chance, an over-zealous reporter from Albuquerque is in the area, hungry for a story that will get him out of the hick towns and back to New York City. An exceptionally well-written, embittered, not-happy black comedy littered with greedy men and women lusting for power. Kirk Douglas plays the reporter with nasty, snarling machismo; he's so well-attuned to his lines that when he spits the words out, they really do sound like his own. The supporting players are interesting but uneven, ranging from peculiar (Jan Sterling, as the trapped man's soulless wife, who acts like a gangster's moll right out of a film noir), to very good (Richard Benedict as Leo and Ray Teal as the sheriff), to downright awful (Richard Gaines as the New York Daily News editor, whose ranting and raving over the telephone would be funny if it weren't so pitiful). The movie makes no promises to finish up smelling like a rose, and director/co-screenwriter Billy Wilder seems to relish this opportunity to make American tourists look like hucksters and scavengers, but Douglas' pontificating near the climax is a drag, with the irony of the situation substituted by melodrama. A failure for Wilder in '51 (probably due to that dreadful title, which was quickly changed to "The Big Carnival"), it is now considered a cult classic. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Marriage made in Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somehow, I don't think that Billy Wilder had too many friends left in Hollywood or the media following the release of this classic. Coming as it did so soon after his masterpiece "Sunset Boulevard" where he managed to puncture egos in the movie industry, he outdid himself in cynicism and savage wit with this assault on the yellow press which almost tops its illustrious predecessor in quality but easily surpasses it in hard hitting cynicism.The story of a ruthlessly ambitious newspaper reporter who deliberately postpones the rescue of a trapped miner so as to revive his flagging career, the film undoubtedly exaggerates not only the greed of the reporter and of local traders but also ghoulishness of the public.However as with all good satire there was more than a grain of truth in points made and with a scriptwriter of Wilder's calibre it has many hard-hitting lines: the miner's calculating wife when admitting to Douglas not only that she's not the religious type but also that her appearance is what matters most to her: "I don't go to church; kneeling bags my nylons".Above all Wilder's trump card was undoubtedly the casting of Douglas. As Cary Grant was flawless in portraying the suave debonair gent, so Douglas was peerless in portraying the ambitious amoral heel, particularly in his late 40's to mid-50's classics and he gave arguably his best performance here. The matching of Wilder and Douglas was truly a Marriage made in Hell.One of my all time favourites.But don't watch it when you're feeling depressed. It will destroy any faith you have in basic human decency!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good &amp; The Bad Of 'Ace In The Hole'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This hard-to-see film finally came to TCM recently so I was anxious to check it out. (To my knowledge it has never been issued on VHS or DVD).I found the fist hour to be riveting with crisp dialog, interesting characters, and some nice camera shots by director Billy Wilder and photographer Charles Lang. Kirk Douglas was intense as "Chuck Tatum" and Jan Sterling ("Lorraine Minosa") was pure film-noir platinum blonde with attitude.Then, the next 40-45 minutes disappointed me, to be frank. Tatum slowly softens to the point where the film loses its edge, going from an adventure story-film noir to more of a melodrama. Sterling's character almost disappears from the screen, which doesn't help. However, with 10 minutes left in the film, a shocking scene with her jolted me back to full attention.Going back to Sterling for a minute, if you are a film noir fan and rank Marie Windsor high on your list of actresses, you'll love Jan in here. It just wish she had a bigger part. My other "wish" was that this script would have been a little tighter. I drags too much in the second half. About 10-15 minutes cut out of here would have made this easier to watch and keep the suspense tighter.The story is not an unusual one. I've seen it on film a number of times, the from the classic era to now: an overzealous newspaperman going past the bounds of good taste and ethics to get (or "keep" in this case) a good story going, just for the welfare of himself or his paper. Yet, this "yellow journalism" or "tabloid mentality" story has some different twists to it, such as being set in a mountainous desert, not in a big city.The acting is superb, not just with the two leads but with all the supporting actors, led by Porter Hall, who played the newspaper editor "Jacob Boot." I also appreciated the sarcastic comedy in here as Wilder and the screenwriters parody the "carnival" atmosphere which develops when a tragedy occurs and people make a financial profit out of it. As the days linger on and the man in this story clings to his life trapped deep in a mine, the circus atmosphere grows. Hence, the second title of this film: "The Big Carnival."That latter title was used when the film bombed at the box office in America the first time it was shown. Later, it was reissued under that second title. It still bombed. However, today it seems to be getting cult status, I would believe a DVD of this will be forthcoming because my guess is that it would sell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kirk Douglas has often expressed his theory of acting: find the good in the bad and the bad in the good. In no role of his career do we see this at work more than his performance as Chuck Tatum in Billy Wilder's classic "Ace in the Hole". Tatum is a relentlessly ambitious and overtly cynical reporter exploiting a man's misfortune in being trapped in a cave for his own ends. But if that's all he was, he'd be driving away with a smile on his face at the end. But that's not all he is.He's not the worst character in this gallery of rogues. Jan Sterling's non-suffering wife of the victim is a very cold fish and Ray Teal's sheriff is more of a cold-blooded reptile, like his pet snake. They don't give a damn if Leo lives or dies. It might be better if he's out of the way. But Tatum, even if he's the instigator of the drama, can't go that far. He's merely a rat, dangerous but warm-blooded. And that destroys him. Sterling and Teal move on, better off than they were. Tatum falls dead into the camera. You can have him for nothing.Tatum's problem is that he isn't quite as bad as he wants to be. He's been treated ruthlessly by life some time in the past and he's in a competitive profession where compassion seems a weakness and the victor gets the spoils- and all the excitement. He put himself on overdrive to compete and show the world he can be as tough on it as it is on him. But he's not quite bad enough to not care about what he's doing to Leo. He's disgusted when he looks at the wife and sheriff and thinks that he's put himself on their level. He punches the sheriff and almost strangles the wife, but finds that doesn't liberate him form his own actions. Those actions have deprived him of the respect of anyone with any goodness left in them, including himself. You can have him for nothing because there's nothing left.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's "Ace in the Hole" opens with reporter Chuck Tatum (Kirk Douglas) turning up at a desolate New Mexico town. He's been recently fired from a big city newspaper, and so is desperate to get his career back on track.After months of living in a rut, Chuck finally stumbles upon the perfect story. Deep within some old Indian ruins, a treasure hunter has gotten himself stuck in a cave-in. Guy in a well. That'll sell papers, right? What follows is genius, as Tatum engineers the story to be far bigger than it really is. We watch as he manipulates the rescue engineers, the local sheriff, the victim's wife, all with the intent of prolonging the incident and keeping the victim underground as long as possible. This gives Tatum time to write more stories, profit off sensationalism, become a major celebrity in his own right, and land piles of cash.Whilst Wilder's crafted an original screenplay, his film slowly slides into obviousness. We know Tatum is going to lose his "soul", the only question is how soon and how badly. Thankfully Wilder pushes his story into suitably depressing territory. Just as the media circus has reached its most frenzied point, Wilder has Tatum's story literally die. Everyone's shocked and Tatum begins to feel pangs of guilt. And why shouldn't he? He's exploited and commodified suffering! Of course most news reporting is like this nowadays, but back in the 50's this was pretty dark stuff, Wilder chastising, not only the media circus, but the family members of victims and audience members who readily lap up drivel.8/10 - Worth two viewings. Makes a nice companion piece to "Network" and "The Sweet Smell of Success".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Embarrassment to Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many American movies indulge in overdrawn stereotypes and overblown themes, but I can't think of one that does it to this degree. The story line is simple enough: a tough guy alcoholic reporter stuck in Albuquerque delays a trapped miners rescue all to make big headlines. The story went over the deep end for me when he summarily dismissed the authority of the sheriff directing the rescue and took over the effort seemingly based solely on his loud mouth. In fact, throughout the film all characters are unaccountably putty in his hands. It seems society is just waiting for some arrogant tough with a kielbasa sausage in his zoot suit pants to assume command. The trapped man is pathetic and incidentally unaware his wife is a floozy, getting it on of course with you-know-who. Nothing original there.Continually driving home the infantile message about the crassness of society is a brass band loudly grinding out the trite Leo Minosa rescue song every time the camera goes outside the cave. With autos full of sightseers streaming in continually, there is now also a Ferris Wheel and merry-go-round, along with innumerable concessions. You might even go so far as to say that it has become a 'media circus'. Despite the comic book level of subtlety in hammering home this 'message', certain aspects of the film are okay. The role of Minosa's wife is played pretty well. She looks particularly convincing just the way she wears the late 40's clothing.The newsroom set and the New Mexico location provide interest, but what a waste.It would be easy to say my criticism of this flick is really a general criticism of the sophistication of films of that time, but I could cite too many films which would be above that criticism and I doubt many are below this one. Lucky thing for me Douglas' character isn't alive to loose one into my ugly mush for saying so.</fullReview>

Other reviews here tell of the washed-up journalist, who tragically milks a dangerous situation that befalls a man rather recently returned from WWII, who is trying to make a living for himself and his resentful, city-born wife in a barren desert place where his parents live. What I caught in this film that spoke the most to me was the fact that at the beginning of the picture, there was no price for admission at the entrance to the field where the cave was. One is soon posted there and is changed to a greater amount as the ever greater crowds of gawkers and vendors make the scene. This is simply a background detail that could easily be overlooked, but it signifies the dark heart of this story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's cynical view of Yankee ingenuity finds roving reporter/con artist Kirk Douglas searching for front page news and stumbling into a yellow journalist's dream come true when he finds an unlucky explorer trapped by a rockslide deep within a cave in desert New Mexico. To milk the story for all its worth he persuades the authorities to begin an unrealistic rescue operation designed to delay the victim's release for a week or more, allowing Douglas time to fan public interest to a fever pitch, while the clock slowly ticks away for the poor unwitting celebrity underground. This surely must rank among the more implicitly bloodthirsty dramas ever made; the whole idea might be hilarious if it weren't so frightening. In retrospect the film was clearly ahead of its time, anticipating by four decades the current glut of tabloid TV news posing as genuine human-interest journalism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ace In The Hole - It could only happen here ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two ideas that simply can not be applied to understand this film. First and most important, arguments claiming it's based on universal themes ... Well, this is a total non-sense ... it's Americana pantheon from start to finish. Loosely based on the Floyd Collins entrapment, back in 1925, also known as America's 'first true media spectacle' ... and believe me, it couldn't have happened anywhere but in the US of A. The monstrous drawbacks of America's culture. Walt Disney taught us that life can be made to look pretty ... Ace In The Hole will teach you that life just isn't as pretty as we paint; eventually some self-serving creeps will step in devising a variety of schemes which will allow them to explore and profit from the suffering of others.Secondly; some reviews concerning this film level it with Dogville, accusing Billy Wilder of shamefully dangling explicit misanthropy and nakedly exercising his America-hating. Such finger-pointing, as much as I disagree with it, can easily stick on that scornful and grumpy has-never-been-in-the-USA Danish (aka The Wicked Witch of the Northeast), Lars Von Trier ... but will never hold if hurled at Billy Wilder. With this film, Wilder aims his fire basically at the American media and its innate tendency of turning personal dramas into a freak show in order to maximize profits. Nowadays, the hysteria is not so widely used by serious newspapers and TV news broadcasting ... unless our President decides to invade another country. Kirk Douglas is perfect and you'll finish the film felling total contempt towards the character he enacted. I have no idea of how many times I've seen this film ... but definitely, I'll never have enough of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cynical noir with a stunning Kirk Douglas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of famous classics for the first time after years of hearing about them. In most cases, the initial viewing is a let-down. Not so for The Big Carnival.This is the last of Billy Wilder's three great noir's - the earlier two being Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard. The story, cracking dialogue and direction are almost as good as Double Indemnity and certainly better than Sunset Boulevard. The version I saw is titled The Big Carnival and thats a pretty apt title.The story is pretty well known and I'm sure remade several times - Kirk plays Charles Tatum a scruple-less down-on-his-luck journalist who has to settle for a small-town newspaper job because none of the big newspapers wants to work with him on account of his loose morals and drinking habits. One year into his new job, he finds an opportunity to create a front-page story and manage the ensuing carnival for his self-promotion. His angle is ensuring exclusive coverage and prolonging the ordeal for poor Leo Minosa for as many days as he can. He certainly succeeds in turning the event into a carnival.The first twenty minutes of the movie, I felt Kirk was acting a little over the top. But, as the momentum starting building up, I realised that was part of his personality. Witness the scene early on when one year has gone by and he is ranting and raving about it. The way his arms keep swinging like he's trying to throw off some shackles. Thats not over-acting. The script called for it.The dialogue is excellent. The hard-boiled comment is famous but not the best. There are plenty of other memorable quotes.While the premise is over-the-top, it is handled intelligently and the build-up is not rushed. Every scene is watchable and I call that great direction. The music score and photography are exactly what you would expect from a Grade A studio and a director like Billy Wilder at the peak of his abilities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magnificent Lost Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles "Chuck" Tatum{Kirk Douglas) is a $1000 a week down on his luck and unemployed big city reporter, who has been sacked from all his jobs, usually for drink or women. So when his car breaks down in New Mexico, he seeks employment at the local rag in Albuquerque, which he succeeds in doing for $60 a week, while promising to boost circulation and make the owner a rich man. Tatum only intends to stay a week to get some money to repair his car, but like the best laid plans, one year later he is still working for peanuts and disillusioned that he hasn't got that big story that would break him into the big time again. Almost by accident he stumbles across that very story at a local Indian souveneir store in the desert, where a local man has been trapped in an ancient cave dwelling some hundreds of feet below the surface. Tatum sees his chance and takes it, he goes down to see the man who is trapped and gets an exclusive interview and pictures, but the mans no good wife packs to leave but is stopped by Tatum when she realises the story has plenty of legs, and people are starting to get interested she sees a chance to make a buck or two, Tatum cajoles the local sheriff to help him in return for glowing praise which will help the sheriff get re-elected?.The sheriff sees to it that no other press can gain access to this exclusive. But never is the greed of this film exemplified better than when Tatum arranges with the rescue crew to take the longest route to rescue the trapped man so that he can make a killing financially but in doing so, endangers the life of the trapped man. A brilliantly realized satire on peoples greed, full of cynicism and sparkling wit and a terrible indictment of the press. a true lost Noir classic?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Billy wilder's most overlooked films,and a critical and box office flop in it's time that looks better with every viewing! Re-released under the tittle "The Big Carnival",the name under which I first saw it on TV,it did little better. There are NO good guys in this one ,save perhaps the newspaper editor who hires Tatum in New Mexico. Everyone is out for themselves and they don't care who they step on to get what they want.Inspired by the story of a miner trapped in a tunnel in the late 1920's but it has little to do with that story beyond the general theme. Wilder's dialogue is as always crisp and well written,showing why he refused to allow his actors to improvise.("If I'd wanted you to say THAT,I would have written it that way!")It's a shame that this film is not yet available on video in any format.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's exploration of the dark side of modern mass media follows a down-on-his luck newspaper reporter (Douglas) who is trying to resuscitate a failing career while working on a local paper in Albuquerque NM. He's looking for that big story to put him back in the national spotlight, a spotlight he was in once, but lost through boozing and womanizing. Almost giving up hope he stumbles upon the scene of a cave-in where a lone artifact collector is trapped below the surface. Douglas takes over the rescue effort, stretching it out and manipulating it for his own gain. Soon he is being aided by the man's wife and the local sheriff, all who stand to gain in their own ways by prolonging the rescue.Made in 1951 when mass media meant newspapers and radio (at least in this movie), the moral issues addressed here by Wilder are as germane today as then. The actors and Wilder have made this movie a thinking person's treat. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring: Kirk Douglas, Jan Sterling, Richard Benedict, Robert Arthur, Porter Hall, Ray Teal, Frank Cady and Bob Bumpas "Well, now he's dead. You can all go home. The Carnival is over"- Kirk Douglas to the circus folk.Filmed at the same time as Sunset Boulevard, director Billy Wilder's "Ace In The Hole or "The Big Carnival" is a dark film noir starring a young Kirk Douglas, who only ten years later would make it big as Spartacus on the big screen. This movie never enjoyed much success, considering Sunset Boulevard was the more famous film at the time. Kirk Douglas plays Chuck Tatum, who has just been hired for a local newspaper in a small, dull town. He clashes with the editor and anxious for a good bit of news, somethin wild and shocking, discovers that a man has been traped under a big cave mine (Richard Benedict). He keeps him down there long enough to entice the media who make a carnival to donate money for his rescue. He has his story but it has cost him his humanity. His wife (Jan Sterling) desires Chuck but he refuses her advances. The people, from the sheriff to the people in the small New Mexico town, are corrupt. Much of the story is dark and tinged with sarcasm and satirical humor. This was a film which, in 1951, was a product of its time, the cynical post-World War II film noir film. The ending, in which Chuck discovers how his "story" cost a man's life and eventually casues him to have a stroke and die, is melodramatic and biting in its cynical theme. This is an enjoyable movie and has its own merits but it lacks the warmth and more inviting humor in Sunset Boulevard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know when Billy Wilder said this one was the "runt" of his cinematic oeuvre but I'd bet it was not too long ago. With age, Mr. Wilder has mellowed and he may have made this remark because he knew how merciless this 1951 film is. In any event, this overlooked gem is just about perfect. It is still powerful, (very powerful) and the acting is superb. So is the dialogue, so is the premise. Based on the Floyd Collins case in 1920s Kentucky, Wilder re-shoots that real event in New Mexico, with reporter Douglas milking a tragedy for everything it's worth. That the film flopped surprises me not at all; it was and still is an atypical Hollywood film. No "sympathetic" characters, no one to "care about." That, I believe, was and is the point. Remember that Wilder was a reporter in 1920s Berlin, so he knew the print medium inside out, and when Kirk Douglas spews the barb "Bad news sells best. Because good news is no news," it is as accurate now as it was half a century ago. Every character in this film is corrupt to some degree, which almost makes this a noir shot in desert light. Don't see this one on a date, don't see it if you're depressed, but do see it if you'd care to witness the best excoriation of journalism's mean side that ever has been filmed. A ten!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ace in the Hole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of this film had always sounded familiar to me, it was only later when it was featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die that I found out more about it, and of course I became more keen to watch it, directed by Billy Wilder (Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, Sunset Boulevard, Some Like It Hot, The Apartment). Basically Chuck Tatum (Kirk Douglas) is a cynical, unethical, unscrupulous, fiercely ambitious, self-centred, wisecracking and down-on-his-luck journalist who comes from New York, hoping to be given a chance with a small newspaper in New Mexico. He was previously fired for his drinking, lying and an affair with the wife of one of his bosses, his real intention is to use the small newspaper as a platform to get back into a bigger one, but a year passes with no sensational news story, and he is totally bored. One day Chuck travels with a younger reporter to cover a story about rattlesnakes, arriving at an isolated gas station Chuck is informed a man named Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) is trapped following a collapse in an old Indian mine, near to a place called the Mountain of the Seven Vultures. Chuck finds and meets the man still alive inside the mine, he convinces him he is a friend trying to help him get out, however he is manipulating the local corrupt Sheriff Gus Kretzer (Ray Teal) to stop other journalists getting their hands on the story or others getting close to the man himself. Chuck is also manipulating the engineer responsible for the rescue operation into using the sophisticated drilling system from above, rather than through existing passages, this would have taken hours, but it takes days, but it is to prolong Leo's stay and make the front pages of nationwide newspapers. Chuck is also getting too close to Leo's wife Lorraine (Jan Sterling), she in fact was planning to leave her husband, thanks to Chuck's publicity she experiences a financial windfall, particularly from thousands of tourists coming to witness the rescue, this in fact becomes a media circus, even a carnival with rides, entertainment and songs about Leo. Chuck, who has started drinking again, is trying to keep Leo's spirits up whilst he is still trapped, he talks about being with his wife again and things he will do when he gets out, but Chuck becomes aware that his health is declining, and he cannot drill the quicker way, for fear of th faster alternative route making the press, and it is now dangerous as the walls would cave in. After five days of drilling the party atmosphere is abruptly stopped when Chuck announces to the crowd that Leo has died, his mistreatment of Leo's wife also comes to a head when they get into an argument and she stabs him in the back with a pair of scissors, he barely reaches his old office in Albuquerque, he is about to announce that he helped cause the death of Leo, but he collapses on the floor, it is unknown whether he is dead or not. Also starring Robert 'Bob' Arthur as Herbie Cook, Porter Hall as Jacob Q. Boot, Frank Cady as Al Federber, Lewis Martin as McCardle, John Berkes as Papa Minosa, Frances Dominguez as Mama Minosa, Frank Jaquet as Sam Smollett, Harry Harvey as Dr. Hilton, Bob Bumpas as Radio Announcer, Geraldine Hall as Nellie Federber and Gene Evans as Deputy Sheriff. Douglas is fantastic playing the manipulative and intense journalist he goes to extremes, i.e. prolonging a man's agony, to keep what he calls his story, this really displays director Wilder's witty talent, it really shows the darker side of the media industry, it is odd to think that this flopped at the cinema, but it is fantastically scripted and performed masterpiece, a must see and brilliant satirical drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ACE IN THE HOLE is Billy Wilder's gritty censure of a collusion between an egocentric reporter Chuck Tatum (Douglas) and the corrupt local Sheriff Gus Kretzer (Teal), who immorally manipulate the entire action of rescuing a man trapped in a cave-in, to their own self-serving purposes, during the process, Tatum's moral conscience has been interminably tested until the worst-case scenario inevitably occurs and pushes him to a futile redemptive effort which will send him to his doom. Tatum, once a big-city journalist in New York, now has been stuck in Albuquerque, New Mexico for over a year, his sole resolution is to seize a sensational story as the springboard to get his old job back, or it turns out, he can also create one, he is astute enough to sense the opportunity and unscrupulous enough to capitalise on it even if it is a man's life at stake. Flaunting with his smart-ass elitism, Tatum is bluntly unlikeable from the start to the mid-stream where he and Gus, who appears to be a more stereotyped scum, exploit and intervene the rescue schedule to serve their personal interest, this is not pure evil, it is human frailty, which is so common and widely rooted in every corner of the world, that is why such deeds can be rudimentarily harmful to our society and the movie should be enshrined for its boldness alone which can cultivate generations of audience about the integrity of a reporter and more far-reachingly vital, advice us, billions of onlookers, how to take a lucid stand when facing sensationalism on a daily basis. Then, when he finally accepts the aftermath, his transformation brings about a captivating crescendo with sublime poignancy until the film's final scene. Under Wilder's firm hands, and the screenplay is glistening with sharp witticism - bad news sells fast, good news is no news - subconsciously we all know that, but what if this intrinsic response to our curiosity and imagination, could be very handily engineered to lead us astray under the flag of "truth disclosure"? How can we be wise enough to discern it and outsmart it? In a perfect world, the movie should be introduced in every high school classroom. Kirk Douglas, who is still with us today and one-year short of his centenary, the oldest living star from the Golden Era, is utterly fitting in this role, harsh, masculine, misogynous, only belatedly let his remorse and desperation surface when the comeuppance cannot be redeemed. Also, Jan Sterling stuns in a top-notch performance as Lorraine Minosa, the wife of the trapped man Leo (Benedict), who takes the accident not just as a windfall to earn some quick-money, but as a getaway from her dead-end marriage and the bleak land. Her conducts are contemptible thanks to Wilder's effort to make Leo look like a devoted husband, and she is an accomplice in the game, but unlike Tatum, the astonishing part is her relentless pitilessness to his husband, she is also craving for someone better, some place better, a better life, another penetrating portrayal of human frailty and Sterling's acting is overwhelmingly accurate, especially during the slapping scene, her reaction is so genuine and totally believable. It is high time to justify this film's classic esteem since ACE IN THE HOLE was a critical failure in Wilder's output when it came out, it was even renamed as THE BIG CARNIVAL out of despair to lure audience into a revealing cautionary tale, while unfortunately, it was too realistic to those who are looking for escapism in the theatre, critics are strident too, maybe the fiasco did alter Wilder's orbit, since then, his works, as masterful as they are, are ultimately less pertinent and trenchant to social realism, and a comedic overtone would supersede the bleakness, that's another reason why this film is so exceptional and still relevant till this day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Society turned into a show has Kirk Douglas' penetrating lineaments: a society ready to do everything just to gain that famous Warhol's 15 minutes of fame. A society become paradigm of a world gazing at success' mirror. Billy Wilder was so predictive as he didn't run into critics favors because of his brazen exhibition of a herald falsification realm: that is journalism.It's journalist Charles Tatum's arrogant face that fills up black- and-white scenes of this sublime tableau Billy Wilder sketched out in 1951. He puts in the foreground the black soul of a reporter dumped from all the American biggest newspapers, expelled for his deviances (he's a conman, a drinker, and a playboy), and forced to beg for a job in a suburban newspaper in Albuquerque.A proud man who has known footlights and now doesn't accept to remain in the backstage; a man longing for a payback that takes on revenge's violent connotations and it makes Wilder's Chuck Tatum one of the meanest characters of the cinema history: an overbearing, selfish, ruthless man. He is a journalist who knows how to profit by chance ? e.g. Indians' graves looter Leo Mimosa trapped inside the cave ? and how to turn it into his personal opportunity to come back in the Press circle, under spotlights of the whole world.As a handy poker player, Tatum pulls out the ace in the hole: the case becomes a story, the story becomes a scoop, the scoop becomes a hit. And he is the factotum of the game, the fire-eater calling the shots of the show he sets up with an arriviste sheriff and a dissatisfied woman (Leo's wife) in the arid dusty Escudero. So, where there was nothing but a wretched lodging in the center of nothing now there is a crowded carnival, and from every quarter it comes people to attend Leo Mimosa's rescue; Tatum surreptitiously protracts this intervention in order to boost a story on which he had imprinted his brand name.Hugo Friedhofer's grave soundtrack sharpens the echo of overwhelming oppression used upon everybody by the reporter till to crush Leo's wife (Jan Starling) not to run away and to trap her in his bogus gimmick (but she will injure him not far from the tragic epilogue). In fact, his plan screws up because Leo (Richard Benedict) starts suffering from pneumonia under the landslide. The hole puncher try to get to him while time flies out (and his life does the same). The man who had to be saved is dead: "Leo Mimosa is dead", Chuck Tatum shouts out from the top of the mountain: he cries out to the public gathered down in the dusty plains and to the journalists arrived from all over the Nation to take notes on the story. And he also makes the cry roaring inside himself as though he can atone for his petty plan.But it's too late: tragedy's completed. And Tatum's alcohol-deformed face fills up the last shot: he lies down on the Albuquerque newspaper's newsroom pavement becoming the dark side of the show. He stands for the emotional desert of a show created at all costs. He stands for a society dazzled by evanescent things, a society eager to chase the twinkling excess and unable to recognize the goodness of truth.</fullReview>

This situation depicts perfectly the human flaws who is shown as unscrupulous, cold, opportunist, and highlights the power of the media. Unfortunately, the plot runs out of steam as minutes go, the mechanics becomes a bit too repetitive and the story even completely goes in circles during the very long last half hour.

		<fullReview>This film should be required viewing in every journalism school. The one I went to made us watch "All the President's men" or some other self-aggrandizing garbage. But the truth is that there is little truth in the newspaper business and this Billy Wilder noir does a great job of driving that point home. It seems every generation gets their own "boy/baby/miner trapped in a well" story, so this film will remain forever timeless. I remember back in the 80s when it was Jessica McClure. This film drew it's inspiration from Floyd Collins who was trapped in a Kentucky cave in 1925 and three-year-old Kathy Fiscus who fell down a well in 1949, both were media circuses in their day. The media circus shown in this film happens on a huge set built behind a trading post near Gallup NM on Route 66 which itself became a roadside attraction for folks heading out west on the mother road for a few years after the film's release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At a time when the debate around phone hacking and the press control of our lives only seems to increase, this movie feels like it could've been made yesterday.Focusing on Kirk Douglas as a journalist who will stop at nothing to get back to the big leagues of journalism, Ace In The Hole is a testament to the lengths journalists will go to get their stories and once they have them, keep them. His power extends beyond just public opinion but to the whole operation itself. Douglas, despite playing a deeply unsympathetic character(Chuck Tatum), delivers a journalist who you can't help but root for and sometimes admire the lengths he will go to get himself back on top. You feel sorry for him when a once high flying journalist is forced to work in a nowhere job, with a wonderful speech about what he misses. A true fish out of water.Wilder controls with aplomb, gradually showing Douglas more and more isolated from people and public opinion itself.The film really delves deep into what motivates a man to get what he's lost. Along with showing the true power a journalist can have, it's just lucky the Chilean miners didn't have someone like Chuck Tatum around...or did they?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a Closer Look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An exiled big city reporter exploits a New Mexico tunnel cave-in for selfish purposes, turning it into a human tragedy.Of Billy Wilder's classic works, I expect this one is the least known, and for understandable reasons. First and foremost, it's about as cynical as any film of the decade, with little relief from the parade of human vices that surround one man's desperate plight. Then too, the year 1951 was not a year the American public was inclined toward introspection. What with the war in Korea and the hyper-patriotism surrounding the McCarthy hearings, people were not inclined to entertain what might be wrong with the leader of the free world. No wonder the film was greeted with a dull thud, eventually sinking into Late Show obscurity.Nonetheless, the film was definitely ahead of its time, with an appreciative following that has gathered over the years. What the movie does so effectively is to show how one man's (Tatum) unscrupulous use of the media can work to exploit the weaknesses of others. Exiled reporter Tatum (Douglas) hopes to get back to big time journalism by capitalizing on the plight of an unfortunate man (Benedict) trapped in the dusty ruins of New Mexico. But to do that, Tatum has got to get the cooperation of others so that the story can be delayed long enough to reach the desired national audience. And that means putting the story potential ahead of the trapped man's rescue. Thus, the desperate Minosa's life is put at risk for the sake of a big human interest story and one reporter's blind ambition.Now none of Tatum's various successes would be nearly so convincing without Kirk Douglas' absolutely bravura performance. His Tatum is so aggressively cock-sure, that his scheming is made to seem the natural order of things. And this scheming is based on what appears a glib understanding of human weakness. Thus, Tatum enlists Minosa's blowzy wife (Sterling) with prospects of a bulging cash register; the hick sheriff (Teal) with prospects of a bigger political career; the wobbly engineer with prospects of a permanent job; and the curious multitude with prospects of an entertaining spectacle. In short, Tatum has taken a human tragedy in a remote tourist stop and single-handedly turned it into a money-making enterprise.The whole production is given eye-catching cachet by on site filming in Gallup, New Mexico, where the squat mesas and dusty plains look nothing like standard Hollywood. And catch those crowds that stretch for at least a mile outside the digging site. Everyone from the surrounding area must have turned out for the filming. And I like the way Wilder builds the spectacle slowly, without fanfare, such that we only gradually become aware of how Minosa's plight is being submerged within the carnival-like merry-making. Thus, what starts out as one man's selfish drive has come to infect an entire region. No wonder the movie tanked in that Cold War year of 1951.Of course, no review would be complete without mentioning Jan Sterling's wonderfully tacky turn as Minosa's mercenary wife. The scenes between her and Tatum are like two circling sharks sizing up one another. Comedy or drama, Sterling remains a movie treasure from that long ago era.I do, however, have a major reservation with the movie as a whole. And that's with the ending. I detect the dead hand of Hollywood's Production Code behind Tatum's sudden redemptive turnaround and anguished period of suffering. Wilder handles the development about as well as possible given what's gone before. Nevertheless, the compromised ending remains. Of course, by Hollywood rules, Tatum's collusion in what turns out to be a form of murder cannot go unpunished. So, instead of a follow through on the story's basic theme, we get the last minute redemption that strikes me as not very plausible given what we've seen of Tatum's previous behavior. Seems to me, the headstrong Tatum would have found a way to rationalize Minosa's fate and then moved on. I think a more plausibly positive outcome would have the kid (Arthur) reject his mentor following Minosa's death, because he now sees where Tatum's brand of unscrupulous journalism leads.Be that as it may, the movie remains a gutsy look at how one man's corruption can spread like a virus. And given the power of today's greatly expanded media, it's a lesson worth noting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not think it was possible for Billy Wilder to make a bad film. This one was a commercial problem, but I believe it is a real gem. The film is a near-classic. The characters are portrayed flawlessly. The dialog is crisp, the direction is clean and cinematography just excellent.No one in the film has any redeeming value. They are all just "ick". It almost makes you glad that newspapers are going out of business all over the USA.I wish that the film had received the commercial and critical success it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ace in The Hole" tells a simple accident (a man trapped in a cave) which becomes a media phenomenon. We follow the reporter Chuck Tatum played by Kirk Douglas, who will talk a bit each day with Leo, the man trapped in the cave, and also give him rations. Many peoples from the whole USA comes with cars, trucks, camping car... for hoping see Leo. The landowner are making profits and charge each car who wants to come in twenty-five cents and the other day fifty cents because much more peoples are coming. Also, a fun fair and a circus are opened for the children. Wilder denounces in it the human absurdity in these scenes.Some quotes of this film are really funny like when a reporter talk with Kirk Douglas and he told him : "We're all in the same boat" and Kirk Danglas answer : "I'm in the boat. You're in the water." I also loved how Kirk light his match : by rubbing it on the typewriter!A very good film to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film, though on its release it was a critical and commercial failure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film style and purpose achieve for the most part a fusion even more remarkable than in Sunset Boulevard (1950). A cynical journalist (Kirk Douglas) delays the rescue of a man trapped in a cave, in order to prolong the story, boost his newspaper's sales and advance his career.Ace In The Hole is an incisive, compelling melodrama which takes a sour look at the American scene; one of director Billy Wilder's masterworks. This was Wilder at his most disenchanted; it surveys the dark, unattractive underbelly of post-war American affluence and optimism, and remains a ferocious attack on human avarice, and on tabloid news values.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is remarkable that Ace In the Hole was released in the year 1951 and still feels so fresh. The movie is a telling indictment of the media and the ways it uses to sell a story and gain publicity. Kirk Douglas as Chuck Tatum brings a kind of raw energy into his role that is rarely seen. This performance is no doubt one of his finest as an actor. Billy Wilder has chosen a very poignant yet telling plot for this movie. His vision and direction are extra ordinary. Today it is routine for media to garner mileage from horrific events and they rarely bother if people have died or are seriously hurt. It is very sad that bad events and news are given so much coverage and prominence by the media across the world. The movie is almost six decades old but still startles us with its boldness and frankness. I will rate Ace In the Hole as one of the finest movies ever made and anyone who wants to see an exquisitely made movie must experience it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder's prediction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of yellow journalism already existed in 1951, but probably nothing as severe as what Billy Wilder depicts in "Ace in the Hole". It's simultaneously a very accurate foretelling of sensationalism and disaster porn. Kirk Douglas plays Chuck Tatum, a reporter who's been fired from previous jobs at big city newspapers. Hired by an Albuquerque newspaper, Chuck sees his big chance after he comes across a man trapped in a cave. Chuck gets the sheriff to deliberately prolong the rescue so that he can exploit the incident. Before too long, people from all over are gathering around the cave to watch the events unfolding: it practically turns into Disneyland. Chuck even convinces the man's emotionally distant wife to play the part of the heartbroken spouse.Without a doubt, the movie now looks horrifically prescient, given how many reporters have tried to use tragedy to further their own interests, and how the public eats it right up. By now, the movie almost looks like a documentary. Definitely one that I recommend. Also starring Jan Sterling, Bob Arthur and Porter Hall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gem that is Finally Getting its due</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film at a revival house back in the seventies (New York City had quite a few of them). As I remember, this was part of a Wilder double feature with "Sunset Boulevard." I was blown away by how brilliant this movie was, and it was not surprising that audiences in 1951 would totally bypass this film. It is one of the most depressing films made by a Hollywood studio during the fifties. Except for a couple of people, everybody has their own agenda and are thoroughly unlikeable. The screenplay re-defines the word cynical. It is clear that audience word-of-mouth killed this movie quickly, and a name change was not going to bring more people into theaters.And it also meant that it would take society seeing crooked, self-serving people of all walks of life on a daily basis before it would be rediscovered and appreciated for being ahead of its time. Many of the images are truly frightening; at about eighty minutes into the film, the area has turned into a carnival of incredible proportions, and is truly sickening when you consider that there is a man close to death at the time. And there are subtle little touches; the sheriff carries around a snake, and he is a snake himself.Performances are letter perfect, and the script has not one wasted word; it could be remade today with very little having to be changed. The score by Hugo Friedhofer reminds us what a brilliant composer he was.At one time not easily seen, now there is no reason to hesitate. This is a film you will want to see more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unflinching contemplation of the role of big media</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We complain that the media is a bunch of models paid to mouth the words their bosses hand them. --And further, that the content of those words is suspect, often belying the objectivity and absence of self-interest their authors claim for them. In another day --when this film was made-- media was every bit as open as it is in the present day to another charge as well: that the media is far from the objective witness to events they would have us believe, that they often in fact precipitate events either actively, for the sake of a good story, or passively, enabling event-makers by their simple presence on the scene.Taking the basic premise, that the media is never "just a witness", as a starting point, The Big Carnival spins a story that is very hard not to like, even as the misanthropic fury oozes from every pore. It isn't only the media that takes a thrashing here. A good deal of the films fury spills onto "ordinary people". The people who line up to watch Leo Minosa's underground ordeal are The Common Man; the film does a lot to convince us that most of our empathy with The Common Man is pure sentimentality. The ordinary people in The Big Carnival are not of deeply cultivated compassion or insight; if it is being sold, however much it panders to their darkest side and degrades them in the process of their consumption of it, they are always to be found waiting in line for seconds. This unflattering view of The Common Man is part of Wilder's broader critique: that we get the media our standards bring upon us. Yet while nobody comes off looking very good in The Big Carnival, no one is simply made to look bad for the sport of it. This is possibly the film that cinched Wilder's rep. as the most cynical man in the world's most cynical town. (Maybe there was no place he could go from here but toward the more audience-friendly material of Some Like It Hot.) But "cynical" can be merely a pejorative way of saying someone sees things as they are, without the whitewash of sentimentality or wishful thinking. Doesn't a true artist need to be able to eschew the defense mechanisms that help the rest of us make it through the day feeling everything is more or less alright, even when it isn't? In the degree to which he was able to do that, Wilder succeeds as have few filmmakers before or after him. In The Big Carnival, Wilder proves again that The Truth, omnipresent as it supposedly is, is still ultimately the province of the insightful artist and poet, not some talking head responding to the string-pulls of a man behind the curtain, nor some exploitative careerist who lacks the civility to turn off the video cam.Ten stars.

		<shortDescription>A Prime Example of What a Media Circus Can Look Like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chuck Tatum (Kirk Douglas) is a fiercely ambitious, self-centered, wisecracking, down-on-his-luck reporter who has worked his way down the ladder. He has come west to New Mexico from New York City, along the way being fired from eleven newspapers for slander, adultery and heavy drinking, among other charges. Now that his car has broken down and Tatum is broke, he talks his way into a reporting job for the Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin, a paper of little consequence.Tatum is definitely a character, living with the truism that "Bad news sells best. Cause good news is no news." Unfortunately for some of those around him, Tatum thinks that it is perfectly acceptable to make news if none exists. Why save a man in one day if you can drag the story out a week? (Compare this to the 1974 "phantom kangaroo" of Chicago. That stories went on for weeks or months, and maybe was not even real.) Tatum also is not afraid to make cracks at everyone, even the victim's wife. "When they bleached your hair, they must have bleached your brain, too." The movie references and plays off the Floyd Collins case of 1925. Newspaper reporter William Burke "Skeets" Miller participated in and reported on the rescue efforts from the scene. Miller also talked with and interviewed Collins in the cave, for which he received a Pulitzer Prize. His reports were widely distributed by telegraph and printed by newspapers around the country, and in some foreign countries, and the rescue attempts were followed by regular news bulletins on the brand-new medium of broadcast radio. Shortly after the media arrived, the publicity drew crowds of tourists to the site, at one point numbering in the tens of thousands. Vendors set up to sell food and souvenirs, contributing to a circus-like atmosphere. If you watch "Ace in the Hole", this will sound familiar.There is really not much to say by way of review. Billy Wilder has proved he can tell a good story with "Double Indemnity" and "Sunset Boulevard". He proves it again here. And Kirk Douglas made a career of playing "son of a gun" characters. This is one of his earliest, but by no means is he a light-hearted fellow. If you have enjoyed Wilder and/or Douglas in other films, this is one to check out. Panned in its day, now we see that Wilder was ahead of his time.Wilder has said he went into directing in order to protect the integrity of his scripts. Indeed, the strength of many of his films (including this one) remains the story and dialogue. Though he should not sell himself short on the visuals. While that may not be his intention, he does just fine in portraying his characters in a strong light.The Criterion commentary helps point out allusions that we may miss, and may or may not be intentional. Multiple early moments are compared to, of all films, Alfred Hitchcock's "Rope". He also raises the issue of misogyny in Billy Wilder's films, something which may not occur to the average viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good and very cynical indictment of the media's thirst for a good story that nevertheless still left me wanting a little more.Perhaps it's just the fact that so many films between the time of this film's release and now have trodden the same ground that "Ace in the Hole" has a been-there-done-that quality to it. No doubt it was strong stuff in 1951, but the points this film makes you've seen made a hundred times by now.Kirk Douglas is the down on his luck journalist who orchestrates a media frenzy around a man trapped in a mine. He gives a typically hammy performance -- perhaps I would have thought the film had more punch if someone else had been cast in the lead. It falls to Jan Sterling to give the film's most memorable performance as the wife of the trapped man. Cold-hearted doesn't even begin to describe her character, a classic femme fatale transplanted directly from a 1940s noir.Whatever faults one may be able to find with the film, one has to admit that director Billy Wilder deserves credit for managing the sheer size of the production, which earns its original release title, "The Big Carnival."

		<fullReview>Once a newspaper man gets to the top of his profession, the last thing he ever thinks of doing is crashing all the way to the bottom. But that is what happens in the story " Ace in the Hole " also called " The Big Carnival " it's the story of a big time reporter named Charles Tatum (Kirk Douglas) who once had a high salary and a top position with an Eastern newspaper, but then was fired. Now he is sitting on his butt in a small town newspaper, dreaming of returning to the big city again. Tatum is an unconscionable, uncaring and definitely an unscrupulous reporter who discovers a cave explorer has becomes trapped while digging for Indian artifacts in a mountain called the Seven vultures. Taking advantage of the man's situation, Tatum prevents the man from being rescued "Too Fast." He encourages Sheriff Gus Kretzer (Ray Teal) and other officials to play down the easy rescue and plays out the 'curse' angle to circulate more newspapers. Unfortunately, things do get desperate and spiral out of control and then everyone involved tries save the man with urgency. With so many top stars, this early Black and White film by director Billy Wilder, was not given it's due credit, despite the fact it became a Classic for Kirk Douglas. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is possibly the best film about media invasion; not necessarily my favourite, but the greatest example. It creates this perfectly atmospheric mood, making film-noir bliss. Kirk Douglas plays his gruelling character with such force, every motive and action are stunning. He plays a journalist desperate for a story; so he goes travelling and discovers a man trapped in a mountain; soon the whole press is trying to cover the story rather than to help the man. But what is most profound is the impact some attention can cause. It's almost as if, just because people across the globe care, it makes his life worth something. The exploitation is tragic and it's difficult to not sympathise with the poor victim; who would have probably gotten out sooner if only the nearby villagers had cared. It's a film that understands its scale and explores it to the fullest extent. The final image is haunting.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder's Best after Sunset</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ace in the Hole is a movie which has been made in 1951 but after watching the movie I firmly believe that the movie still holds valid in the current mad mad Fourth Estate race.Ace in the Hole is directed by Billy Wilder and was a flop when it opened in 1951 that too one year after Wilder had provided a real treat in 'Sunset Blvd.' in 1950.With all the venom that Wilder spewed at Hollywood in 'Sunset Blvd.', he outdoes himself here. His teeth are clenched, his fists are up and he's out for blood but this time his target is mass media as represented by newspaperman Chuck Tatum played by Kirk Douglas (Michael Douglas's dad). The film opens as he's driving through Albuquerque, New Mexico. Tatum stops by the local paper, The Sun-Bulletin, to ask for a job.Kirk Douglas gives the fiercest performance of his career, an amoral newspaper reporter caught in dead end Albuquerque who happens upon the story of a lifetime, and will do anything to ensure he gets the scoop.After months of living in a rut he finally stumbles upon the perfect story. Deep within some old Indian ruins, a treasure hunter has gotten himself stuck in a cave-in (Co-relate it with our own Prince story which bombarded our TVs couple of years back). Guy in a well. That'll sell papers, right? What follows is genius, as Tatum engineers the story to be far bigger than it really is. We watch as he manipulates the rescue engineers, the local sheriff, the victim's wife, all with the intent of prolonging the incident. He wants to keep the guy underground as long as possible. This gives Tatum time to write more stories, sell them at top dollar to other newspapers, become a major celebrity in his own right and land piles of cash When thousands gather outside the cave and a feverish media circus begins to grow, Tatum smells victory. But of course things go downhill from here.Wilder has always been a master of tone and he continues that trend here. The film starts very funny in a dark, sadistic sort of way, but Wilder slowly lets the humor drain from the proceedings.Wilder often considered Ace in the Hole to be his greatest film and he'll get no argument from me. As of this writing, I can think of few films that are as timely and relevant as this one. It feels fresh and contemporary, and not dated in the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unknown to many - but certainly among Wilder's greatest films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Say the name 'Billy Wilder' to any cinema fan and they might throw back titles like 'The Apartment' and 'Sunset Blvd' at you ? but probably not this film. Ace in the Hole was a flop upon release in 1951; and has had trouble being released since, and thus it has not been seen by as many people as Wilder's other films. However, many more people will know the story featured here - it's the one featured in the episode of The Simpsons where Bart Simpson finds himself stuck down a well; only here the story is spun courtesy of two of the most cynical leads you'll ever find in any film; and while Ace in the Hole is undoubtedly an out and out masterpiece and one of the finest films Billy Wilder ever directed; it's actually not all that hard to see why the film has not sold well to all audiences. The plot focuses on Charles Tatum; a former big time reporter who arrives in a small town in New Mexico. He lands himself a job on a small newspaper and makes no secret of the fact that he's hoping it will lead him back onto bigger and more lucrative pastures. Nothing is happening in the local area; until one day when Tatum gets his big break. A man has got himself stuck in a cave supposedly inhabited by the ghosts of dead Indians and our anti-hero soon spots himself a chance for a story; and quickly he finds a way to delay the rescue operation and turn the area into a media circus.Kirk Douglas is probably best known for his role in Spartacus; but for me there is no doubt that he gives his career best performance in this film. Douglas is absolutely superb as the amoral antagonist and thoroughly convinces that he is the character he is playing. Jan Sterling stars opposite Douglas as the equally cold wife of the trapped man who sees the tragedy as a way to get out of her marriage. She gives a performance that is arguably even colder than Douglas'. The fact that both lead characters are utterly callous means that the film will be hard to get on with for some people; but for me the film is more than just a sum of the lead characters anyway. The film is an expose of what unadulterated selfish greed can lead to (mixed in with a parody on the importance of the media) and this is more than enough to keep its audience interested. However, Wilder does not appear to condemn the actions of the central characters and indeed the film just lets the story play out for what it is; leaving the audience to make all judgements on the characters, and in return the film is much more powerful than it would have been had the director tried to force the audience to think in a certain way. The film could even be considered a test of every audience member's cynicism; as the views of the characters and the situation are likely to vary with every person that sees this film. Overall, Ace in the Hole is an intelligent and poignant masterpiece that really needs to start getting the attention it deserves. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest films I've ever seen in my life and I would warmly recommend to anyone that considers themselves a fan of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a powerful early performance by Kirk Douglas, playing one of the first truly unapologetically characterized anti-heroes of the movies, an aggressively determined, egotistical, quick-witted reporter unhumbled by the shameful slump he is in, having worked his way west from the fast big-city life to the middle of nowhere, along the way being fired from countless newspapers for countless immoral charges, has been writing for an insignificant small-town paper.Bored by his laughable assignment to cover a snake hunt, he learns about a local everyman trapped in a cave collapse. Perfectly aware of a one-shot break, Douglas calculatedly stage- manages the rescue effort, influencing the corruptible sheriff to insist that the engineer use a much more time-consuming method for a eloquent and insincere reason, of course really so that Douglas can draw out the story on the front pages of nationwide.Jan Sterling coldly plays the victim's cheap wife. Wilder, always a wise and sensitive director and once a journalist himself, surprises us with how unfeeling the focal townspeople are behind the scenes and nonetheless steered by the very journalist inspiring the country with an oh-so-heroic story. Wilder's expose very cynically perceives people involved in a media circus are propelled by the almighty dollar. However, he is not too scornful but in fact poignant. His unsympathetic, utterly contemptible portrait of Kirk Douglas's rogue unravels not as someone with a far-fetched lack of any feeling at all but as someone caught up in his own prestige and grandeur, the sort of control felt by a master con man, that when real disaster hits, his delusions dissolve in a harrowing manner. Douglas and Sterling's affair opens out Double Indemnity's bitter two-step.There Will Be Blood is merely one of the works that get a lot out of this farsighted blister. There are also shades that can be found in the explosive Man Bites Dog. The monster ultimately plunges before the camera in a shot saluted sidelong in Fassbinder's Fox and His Friends. Wilder's powerful film swelters under the scorching, overwhelming contempt of the barren region sun, belligerently emphasizing the sweat, soot and dust saturating the characters and generating a visualization of the sterile shape of their hearts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very solid melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's "Ace in the Hole" is a gorgeously photographed film that at first seems hopelessly cynical, at times veers into dangerously sentimental areas, and emerges finally as a vindication of real human nature tempered with the idea that for some of us moral awareness might come too late in life to make a difference. Kirk Douglas gives one of the best performances of his career; I've always found him most convincing when he's playing a bit of a "heel." In this one he's a rogue newspaperman, putting his last chips on the table as he works for a small paper in Albuqurque looking for his last shot at the big time. He manages to manufacture a national hysteria over the fate of a trapped cave explorer (Richard Benedict) and controls coverage of the event through his relationship to the family of the man and his solicitation of the local police. The explorer, Leo Minosa, has a wife (Jan Sterling) who's ready to leave him but who stays around for the media circus because she's selling so many hamburgers. All the time poor Leo thinks that Tatum (Douglas) is his friend and that his wife is anxiously waiting for his return.The most difficult move this film has to make is to convince us that Tatum does eventually become remorseful. It has to show him as an utterly ruthless and cynical person (the dialog is great when he explains why one trapped person is a better story than 50 trapped people, for example) and at the same time make us believe in some kind of moral transformation. I thought the film accomplished to a great degree, largely because of our own sympathy for Leo. It's about how Tatum begins to have contempt for himself. Wilder's scathing camera does not spare the American public either -- they're just as much in for the ride, literally eating cotton candy and riding Ferris Wheels while ostensibly worrying over Leo. When the wife of the first arriver sheds tears for Leo at the end, it's a good example of the double edged nature of Wilder's storytelling because we're actually surprised by her grief, and yet it's perfectly believable and not "corny" at all.Just as in "Sunset Boulevard" Wilder managed to criticize Hollywood at the same time as composing a love letter to it, in this film there's a deconstruction of journalism and at the same time the character of publisher Jacob Boot (Porter Hall) retains a kind of purity much as Cecil DeMille does in "Boulevard." The idea is still there, there is a valid purpose to journalism which the Douglas character in his self-serving nature has lost sight of or never previously had a consciousness of. In this way Wilder takes types (the honest publisher, the wholesome director) and attempts to make what would at first appear naive to be actually the most sophisticated viewpoint in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder leaves no one standing as he eviscerates early 50's America with the blisteringly cynical Ace in the Hole, a story about a man trapped in a New Mexico cave and the reaction of the public at large in response to it.The film opens with down on his luck New York reporter Chuck Tatum being towed in to Albuquerque behind the wheel of his car. He arrogantly pushes his way into the local newspaper and offers the services of a big city reporter at a cut rate price. His blustery confidence belies begging and the editor takes him on. A year later things are working out for Tatum but he is bored stiff since he still itches to get back to Gotham, Yogi Berra and hot pastrami. Dispatched to cover a rattlesnake contest, he and his photographer stumble upon a mine cave in trapping one Leo Minosa. Tatum goes into high gear and in no time has the law, the media and the rescuers doing his bidding. In the meantime folks from across the country are flocking by car and train to the sight. Leo's wife Lorraine who was on the verge of leaving begins to cash in as well. Free entrance to the cave sight goes up to a dollar, a carnival sets up on the grounds, a song about his rescue is recorded and the sheet music is selling like hotcakes for two bits. Tatum has everything under control except the rescue itself. To keep the story going he the sheriff and the contractor stall.Few characters in film history have been as exploited as the trapped Leo Minosa. His suffering if all goes well will make his wife wealthy, get the Sheriff re-elected and get the revenge minded Tatum his job back in New York. Minosa isn't the only one trapped in this film. Tatum and Lorraine are looking to be rescued as well and they have little qualm with crawling over Leo to save themselves.Writer, director Wilder's indictment of society en masse offers no let up as he pours cynicism like syrup over the entire proceedings. The literal carnival atmosphere at the cave in has a surreal effect with cars lining up as if at a drive in while a train in the distance (the Leo Minosa Special) unloads passengers by the hundreds, rushing to take part in the voyeuristic orgy. His script burns with character callousness and his visuals, particularly the aerials, are unlike any other he has ever done.As Tatum, Kirk Douglas has never been better or more convincing, throwing his weight around and spitting venom as he capitalizes on the tragedy. Tatum knows he is a bastard but it is this self awareness that allows him to manipulate those around him who are just as bad. He accepts and recognizes the ugly truths about greed and self interest inherent in human nature and this allows him to stage direct this "reality TV show". Tatum truly understands his audience. Jan Sterling as Lorraine is just as dark and gives Tatum a run for his money in the cold and callous department. Sterling displays an icy tawdriness and delivers some of the film's best lines ("I don't go to church, kneeling bags my nylons").Ace failed at the box office in a huge way when it was first released. People and the media did not take kindly to being insulted with the truth. They preferred the DeMille Greatest Show on Earth circus atmosphere to this kind of carnival with its mean spirited clowns. There were claims that it was un-American (not a good period to be so) but I believe Wilder's allegorical intent was an indictment of all human nature, not just this country.Time and the reality that cable TV news today relentlessly pursue similar stories in the same fashion, garnering the attention of the same morbidly interested audience not only exonerates Ace in the Hole but elevates it to the same pedestal Wilder's two other masterpieces Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard are on. Ace in the Hole is as fresh as today's headlines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know how ruthless and ridiculous the press is. Just look in the paper and read some of the stories they spew out. Billy Wilder's classic film is the perfect story to give and example of the American media's insanity. Kirk Douglas gives an incredible performance as Chuck Tatum, a former big-wig newspaper man who has been reduced to working for the Albuquerque paper after being fired in New York, Chicago, Washington, and other places for his immoral behavior. Here, he hopes to catch a story that will springboard him back to stardom. After a year, he finds it when a man searching for Indian pottery in an ancient cave is trapped and half-buried alive. Thus begins the circus. After a few phone calls and a couple of days, there are hundreds of cars, animals, and of course people at the site to watch the "heroic" rescue of this man. However, thanks to Tatum, the rescuing that could take twelve hours ends up being six days. Overall, this is a remarkable film with great acting, solid directing, and like all Wilder films, a marvelous script balanced with touches of humor, sadness, drama, and dark outlooks on life. What makes this a classic is how well it holds up today. Wilder isn't exaggerating too much here; the media is like this. See for yourself, then turn on the TV and watch Entertainment Tonight. It's shows like that that make this film prophetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder makes us squirm, and Ace in the Hole makes it worthwhile: It's an excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Don't worry, Leo. I'm your pal." That's Chuck Tatum speaking. He's a hot-shot big city reporter who has been fired from every top paper he's ever worked for. Now he's hit bottom. He works for the Albuquerque Sun=Bulletin, a small town daily which puts yard sales on its front page. Tatum needs the job, but he's determined to find that one big ticket story that'll put him back in New York. The man he's talking to is going to be that big ticket. His name is Leo Mimosa, owner of the desolate, dusty Mimosa's Indian Curios ("Gas and Oil, Drinks on Ice") in Escudero, in New Mexico's high desert. Leo is currently 300 feet underground, trapped in a cave-in while looking for ancient Indian pots he can sell for a few hundred dollars. In the next 111 minutes, covering five or so days, we're going to experience so much corruption of the soul, misplaced trust and consuming ambition...leavened by so little humanity...that we'll want to take a bath afterwards. This is one of director Billy Wilder's greatest pictures. For me, it's permeated not by Wilder's famously sardonic outlook toward humanity but by the inevitability of commonplace tragedy. That there are only one or two people we might think well of isn't so much a limitation as an element that sharpens the fascination with great story-telling combined with vivid acting. While Tatum controls his big story, and while Leo becomes increasingly desperate, to the point of believing Tatum is his only friend, we encounter a cast of characters who are either stupid and venal or sly and venal. Top of the list is Tatum, himself. Kirk Douglas gives an utterly believable portrait of a man, excellent at his job, who can taste the big-time again and is determined to do whatever it takes to achieve it. "I'm on my way back to the top," he says, "and if it takes a deal with a crooked sheriff, that's alright with me! And if I have to fancy it up with an Indian curse and a broken hearted wife for Leo, then that's alright too!" Close behind is Jan Sterling as Leo Mimosa's wife. Lorraine Mimosa wants out...out of Escudero, out of New Mexico and out of her marriage with Leo. She's a pouty bleached blonde, callous and discontented. Gus Kretzer, the local sheriff, is corrupt and more than willing to work with Tatum to insure he gets the kind of news coverage he needs for his re- election. And there are all those visitors to the cave where Leo is trapped...gawkers, thrill seekers, whole families out to set up camp and see what happens. Food booths and a carnival keep them contented while a drill pounds away at the rock to reach Leo. It's the slow way which Tatum has maneuvered to insure his exclusive coverage of Leo's predicament can play out over the next few days. Leo literally is Tatum's ace in the hole. The conclusion is as depressing as Wilder's depiction of human character. The movie's whole set-up, in fact, is designed to make us feel uncomfortable at what we're seeing. If we've ever slowed down to get a better view of a traffic accident, if we've ever watched with fascinated revulsion as a snake swallows down a live mouse or a mantis gnaws at a struggling lizard, we have to recognize that in spirit we're also part of the crowd eager to see what happens. What makes the movie stand apart from so much of Wilder's skilled cynicism in some of his other films, I think, are two elements. First, Wilder plays this story straight. There's no sardonic comedy or witty, misogynistic lines. He serves us up a serious, well-acted drama and then compels us to take it seriously while he makes us squirm a little. Second, he includes two characters that give us some relief from Tatum's ambition and our own unease. First is Herbie Cook, played by Robert Arthur, the young photographer from the newspaper. Herbie is a graduate of a journalism school, a little naive and so innocent-looking you want to protect him from Tatum's manipulations. Second, and most important, is Jacob Boot, played by that fine character actor, Porter Hall. Boot is in some ways our conscience, the serious, realistic publisher and owner of the Sun=Bulletin who has the quaint idea that telling the truth is important. Boot is able, although not by much, to show us that people come in all flavors, and that venality is only one of them, no more or less than trying to do the right thing also is. In Ace in the Hole, however, nothing good happens in time. As Tatum said earlier, "It's a good story today. Tomorrow, they'll wrap a fish in it." Same with people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The themes could be characterized as news-media exploitation or the human need for individual glory at any cost or the destructive allure of publicity, but that wouldn't begin to describe Wilder's caustic examination of humanity's ignoble qualities, here its ugly opportunism in the face of tragedy. As well-made as it is hard to stomach, Wilder's film sticks it to journalism, middle-class tourism, rubbernecking, and unfaithful women with equal aplomb to illuminate the moral desensitization of American society in an age of trivial entertainments. (Possibly the most misanthropic shot I've ever seen: a locomotive bearing the name of the dying man bringing in hundreds of paying guests, the camera panning to catch them all running towards the carnival setup as a country-western band sings the victim's ballad.) The main character, Chuck Tatum, is observed in the opening shot riding in his car while being towed to the Albuquerque newspaper, his latest job opportunity in a career of burned bridges. The newsroom is presided over by a scrupulous editor whose motto "Tell The Truth" is embroidered in a deliberately quaint, relic of a portrait. After talking the editor into giving him a job, Douglas walks toward the camera, and in a brilliant touch his figure creates a momentary black screen that gives way to his re-emerging into frame exactly a year later, wearing the same unfashionable belt-suspenders combo for which he teased his boss?an inventive jump-cut not only for its artistic skill, but also for defining a professional nadir that impels Tatum to exploit the cave-in for personal notoriety. The way that Tatum's careful scheme comes crashing down around his ears is akin to Walter Neff reaching for ill-gotten gains and being doubly rebuffed for his efforts. However, Tatum's pathetic end is more demonstrative than resigned: in his fall from prestige, he conjures up one of cinema's unforgettable closing lines. This is a devastating satire, blunt and unsparing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I've met some hard-boiled eggs in my time...but you, you're 20 minutes."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "Ace in the Hole" as "The Big Carnival" over 20 years ago, and it made a powerful impression on me. Seeing it again, the effect it has is even more powerful especially in light of today's media frenzies over everything from Britney, Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton, Lady Diana's life and death - 10 years after the accident that killed her - and speculation about the paternity of one of her children - frenzy over everything, that is, except mundane things like Iraq and the oil crisis.Kirk Douglas is Chuck Tatum, an ambitious, unethical, egotistical reporter fired from many of the big papers who takes a job in Albuquerque and stumbles upon a story that he believes will regenerate his career. Learning that a man, Leo Minosa, while searching for Indian artifacts to sell in his store/restaurant is trapped in a cave, Chuck makes himself crucial to the situation, befriending the man (Richard Benedict) and talking to him through a hole in the cave. There, the man, Chuck's ace in the hole, is trapped and unable to move. Chuck manipulates the situation in various ways to make the story last longer - and as he does, the dead town becomes alive with tourists, and the locals start making money. Eventually the site becomes a circus - with the circus and a ferris wheel actually moving in, as well as musicians, campers, and every other thing imaginable. Chuck aligns himself with a corrupt man running for mayor, and the two plan to emerge as heroes, with Chuck going back to New York to work in the big-time again. He beds Leo's wife (Jan Sterling) and ignores Leo's grieving parents. Along the way, everyone has forgotten about Leo, whose situation becomes a symbol of greed, lust for power, isolation, and finally guilt.This is a magnificent Wilder script that accompanies his crisp direction. Kirk Douglas is excellent as the flamboyant reporter who fights the last shred of decency he possesses, and Jan Sterling is great as Leo's wife (responsible for the line in the subject box - one of my favorite lines of all time) who only cares about getting a lot of money out of the tourists through the restaurant she and Leo own and then blowing town. Surprisingly timely and unfortunately realistic, "Ace in the Hole" is a must-see for its hard look at the media - and us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Way ahead of its time - you can take the theme of this film and apply it to any and all current news stories. As espoused by Kirk Douglas' turn as morally bankrupt reporter, Charles Tatum, nobody really cares about tragedy or genocide on a large scale, but take a kid down a well or a guy in a mineshaft, and then you've got a media frenzy! Like Sunset Blvd. almost every line is a keeper. Wonderful use of symbolism regarding Native Americans seems more like something out of Twin Peaks than a 1951 flick. Loved how the traveling carnival company that eventually shows up is named "S&amp;M," and there are thousands of little moments like this. One of my all-time favorite films.</fullReview>

The understated storytelling meshes perfectly with Kirk Douglas's exhuberant performance. No wonder nobody went to see it, even when it was first released...the symbolism is effective but left half-buried, the "arc" is powerful yet understated. Strong images and thrown in the viewer's face one after the other...but they are secondary images, suggesting other events and relationships that we never see. There is an overwhelming feeling in this film that the viewer is intelligent enough that he doesn't need all the i's dotted and the t's crossed. Thanks to Wilder for that.</fullReview>

"The Big Carnival" is about our society, past and present. Tatum can be anybody: your co-workers, your town's mayor, those Wall Street analysts and lawyers... and worse: he can be YOU.

This theme has been emulated many times (most recently in 1997's lackluster "Mad City"), and probably never quite as well.

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder decided to followup the Oscar winning Sunset Blvd., essentially a dark character study but so playful, fresh and engrossing in the same time to be endlessly watchable, with a movie so unflinching in its portrayal of dishonest, unscrupulous people, so steeped in misanthropy and disregard for all ethics and humanity, as to be almost unwatchable. It's no wonder it's only beginning to click to an audience in the last years, compared to other Wilder films that were popular in their day.Kirk Douglas is Chuck Tatum, a hardnosed, cynic, ruthless journalist down-and-out and looking to get back into business. Hoping for the big headline that will send him back to New York, he joins a small Albuquerque newspaper and bides his time. A year later, the headline falls down on him. A man digging for Indian artifacts trapped under tons of rock in a cave. But it's not quite a great story and Chuck Tatum takes it upon himself to make it one.Curiously for a filmmaker who directed 14 different actors in Oscar-nominated performances, he really missed the mark with Kirk Douglas. Douglas chews the scenery from start to finish with such seething furiousness, hammering down every line and hissing out every word with malicious, bitter irony, that sometimes it feels as there's no movie at all around him, as though he chewed it all away. Add to that an assortment of immoral characters Tatum infects in his own ruthless pursuit for 'the story' and you've got yourself a pretty tough deal to sit through.Wilder's direction is simple and mostly invisible which is an asset to a movie with a central performance screaming for the viewer's undivided attention. Sure, the symbolic qualities he imbues his visuals with are as overstated and unsubtle as the script's main ideas, delivered in that hardboiled film noir way and so on-the-nose you could jot down verbatim a couple of lines of dialogue and have the entire summation of the movie's themes, subtext be damned, but he knows when to get out of Douglas' way when he starts hamming it up. "I don't make things happen, I just write about them" is a great moment and so is the final shot, but as much as the movie lacks subtlety, it's still compelling and gripping in its own demented way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Celebrated performance by Kirk Douglas in Billy Wilder's film masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Big Carnival" is also known as "Ace in the Hole" which is a far better title in my opinion. This is one of my favourite Kirk Douglas films of all time with a magnificent supporting cast including Jan Sterling (superb), Porter Hall (always reliable character actor), Ray Teal (one of his best roles), Richard Benedict, Robert Arthur and Gene Evans.Kirk Douglas is Chuck Tatum - an unsuccessful reporter on his way to cover a news item about a rattlesnake hunt for a small town newspaper when he hears about a man Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) who is trapped in a mine shaft. Sensing this could be the important scoop he has been looking for that will get him back into the big time he makes his way to the mine location. With the help of crooked sheriff Gus Kretzer (excellently portrayed by Ray Teal) he illegally obtains exclusive rights to the story. What starts out as just a small local interest item builds into a major event with hundreds of people arriving daily and a "carnival" atmosphere soon prevails. TV and radio crews plus reporters from other papers converge to cover the attempted rescue - purposely delayed by Douglas to ensure his story is kept in the headlines. With the help of untrustworthy sheriff Ray Teal he deliberately hinders the rescue attempts thereby placing the trapped man in even greater danger. Jan Sterling is perfect as Lorraine Minosa (the unfaithful wife of the trapped man) and her confrontational scenes with Kirk Douglas are electric.Grippingly directed by Billy Wilder (based on a real life incident) the film holds your attention throughout yet its only Oscar nomination was for best story and screenplay - it's hard to believe now but Kirk Douglas and Billy Wilder didn't even get a nomination more's the pity! Just another example of films which are appreciated today but were ignored by the Academy at the time of release.Some favourite lines from the film:Kirk Douglas (to Porter Hall): "I've lied to men who wear belts, I've lied to men who wear suspenders - but I'd never be so stupid as to lie to a man who wears both belt and suspenders".Douglas (to Porter Hall): "Where's my desk?". Porter Hall: "The one by the door - you may be out of here by Saturday". Douglas: "The sooner the better!".Jan Sterling (to Douglas): "I've met some hard boiled eggs in my time, but you - you're twenty minutes!".Jan Sterling (to Douglas): "I don't go to church. Kneeling bags my nylons". Douglas: "You're making enough dough to buy yourself another pair!".Douglas (to Porter Hall): "How would you like to make a thousand dollars a day Mr Boot? I'm a thousand dollar a day newspaper man. You can have me for nothing!". (Last line of film).Definitely one of Billy Wilder's best - a prestigious classic not to be missed. 10/10.

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder never seemed to care much for this film of his but it's actually a very good movie. Kirk Douglas as a seedy journalist who realizes there is a potential big story when a man is trapped in a cave. He milks it for all it's worth and a media circus ensues with him as the central hero. He sees if he creates a delay in the rescue the story will continue. He does and in the end total tragedy is the result. There are no real likeable characters in this film. Douglas is a parasite. The trapped man in the cave was poking around in a place he shouldn't have been so sympathy for him can only be marginal. His wife is an absolute floozy who couldn't care less about him and only sticks around to make a few bucks off his misfortune. Then there is the crowd that shows up showing human beings at their worst. Most of them are there because it seems like the place to go and have a good time. This movie is certainly worth watching particularly because it's a Kirk Douglas film that isn't often mentioned when his career is discussed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As if to rub viewers noses in his versatility Billy Wilder shot Sunset Boulevard and this one back to back with Sunset being released one year earlier in 1950. Not surprisingly a failure on its release this movie is as good a definition of Wilder as any in his vast and impressive repertoire indeed the words cynic, cynicism and cynical might have been invented to describe the typical Wilder film. As always he had no time for 'fancy' shots and angles - in Wilder everything is couched in 'traditional' Long, Medium, Close and the standard variations, Medium-Close, etc, but he does shoot a couple of low angles sparingly here and uses Chuck Tatum's body walking toward and blocking the camera and then walking away again to illustrate a time-lapse, the twelve months that Tatum has been cooling his heels in New Mexico. The exposition is equally brilliant with Tatum (Kirk Dougles) flaunting his journalistic CV and explaining to his protégé that one story is all it takes to make it back to the big time and how, when such a story appears, a smart reporter will milk it to the full and then, of course, he proceeds to do just that when Leo Mimosa gets trapped in a cave and Tatum works the angles to keep him there. For those caring to look for them there are parallels with Sunset Boulevard - the audience who flock to see a Norma Desmond and/or a Leo Mimosa and then, once the novelty has worn off, turns away from them and in both cases it was skillful PR work and/or intrepid reporters who brought them to the attention of the audience in the first place. Wilder liked to use actors more than once and both Porter Hall and Richard Gaines appeared in both Double Indemnity and this one. Religious overtones abound both overtly in Leo's conviction that the 'Gods' are angry with him because he 'steals' their artifacts and a tad less overtly in Jan Sterling - as Leo's floozy wife Lorraine -taking a bite out of an apple whilst trying crudely to tempt Tatum, and Sheriff Ray Teal's pet rattler. Just as Bill Holden's Joe Gillis thought he'd landed on the gravy train only to wind up on the wrong end of a bullet so Chuck Tatum in Wilder's very next film winds up on the wrong end of a pair of scissors; like Crime, Cynicism Does Not Pay. A small masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While it may not have the class of some of Billy Wilder's other films -- you could say it's a bit lurid -- this is an absolutely brilliant satire on the news media, one of the best there's been, and it's absolutely relentless in its attack on not only media hypocrisy and amorality, but the seediness of human nature in general. Few films are quite so misanthropic and almost completely lacking in any display of human goodness (you'd have to look to Pasolini's 'Sal?,' although I wouldn't encourage you to look in that direction), yet you can't really argue what's being presented here.This is a comedy that is almost perfect without quite being funny. It's satire that cuts so close to the bone, it's scary. One could call it prescient because it resembles recent news items, but those recent news items resembled less recent news items which resembled even less recent new items, as the media repeats itself. 'Ace in the Hole' will always be timely, because it will always apply. The media is now as it was then and things aren't changing any day soon. When the carnival finally rolls into town here (the movie is aka "The Big Carnival"), it's at once absurd, metaphoric, and completely plausible.And that title. "Ace in the Hole."

		<shortDescription>Brilliant (also scary) take on the media and a wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ace in the Hole is one of those movies that, unfortunately, seems to get better with time. In 1951 it spoke about a media world driven and corrupted by profit motives and the literal and figurative carnival-like atmosphere of the sensational stories that business craves. Like Network, this movie nails the future (and 1951) right between the eyes. What's unfortunate is that the writers were so accurate. The script is filled with punchy, pithy, witty stretches of dialogue that sound like the exact best thing each character could say at any given moment. (It could be Kirk Douglas' best performance.) Everyone in the film sounds like someone real, and yet, more brilliant or observant or concise than most real people can ever be. And the film looks good, too. Real good. Why isn't this film considered to be one of Billy Wilder's best? It's depressing. He's right about the media and people and that the bad instincts can't be stopped and if you're not cynical about it all you should get started real soon. Not a happy message. But brilliant.If a nearby festival screens this film, go. That is if you love movies, Wilder, and the well shot, well written, well acted state we're in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Billy Wilder's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be Billy Wilder's best. A tough, cynical, but incredibly tight, well-written work. It's a shame no one knows about it. I also think it's one of Kirk Douglas' best performances. Over-the-top for sure, but any heightened drama comes out of the urgency of the story. See it whenever you get the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just short of a great film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got interested in this film because I am a former newspaper man. The truth of the matter is, the film is a statement against society in general with its greed and corruption. The concept is, Let a man die just so we make a few bucks and everybody has a good time dancing and singing and riding on the ferris wheel. Let's not leave out the promotion to a better job and life. The man in the cave did not have to die. The real warning comes at the end, when the by now evil Douglas falls dead. The Big Carnival is unique with a plot like no other movie I know of, I do not think it could be remade today, movie making and society has changed to much. It just falls short of being a great film; probably because it reminds us to much of ourselves. It could be considered a cult classic. I am sorry it is not available on VHS or DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your standard film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I mention a film-noir setting, where does your mind go? Maybe to a damp alley at night or a detective's office or maybe a police interrogation room. Probably not to the New Mexican dessert. Yet that's exactly where this very dark film-noir is set.A man is trapped in a cave. No problem. A local contractor can have him out in eighteen hours. Unfortunately that rescue gets in the way of other peoples' needs. Instead of a quick rescue a six days-long media circus (and then, later, an actual circus) is staged for maximum effect.The reporter at the center of the story is played by Kirk Douglas in a powerful performance. He's cynical, unethical, unscrupulous and a master manipulator. He was fired from a high-profile newspaper because of his drinking problem, lying and even for having an affair with the wife of one of his bosses. He convinces a local corrupt sheriff to milk an underground rescue attempt to pile up votes for the next election, and together they bully the contractor to delay. Even the wife of the trapped man is a cold remorseless woman. As in most film-noirs, sympathetic characters are rare.This movie comes from Billy Wilder who also gave us, "Double Indemnity" and "Sunset Boulevard." This movie is as dark and cynical as its cinematic siblings.At is heart there is a basic meanness, a violence, a grit that makes this movie unforgettable. In its day it failed to find its audience. Today, its statements about the media and about mis-applied ethics are, perhaps, more timely than when this film was released 65 years ago. Take a look!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Newspaper reporter Chuck Tatum (Kirk Douglas) has been run out of every big city due to one thing or another. He's eager to return but he must hit on a big story first. He lowers himself to get onto the Albuquerque Sun Bulletin to wait for his one break. It's been a year, much longer than he expected. He's assigned a story out of town with youngster Herbie Cook. They run across Lorraine Minosa whose husband Leo is trapped in a cave-in while searching for Indian pottery. Chuck works to get his big human-interest story.Billy Wilder brings his biting cynicism and Kirk Douglas is the perfect vessel to embody this character. It was far too cynical to take down the media back in the day. It's ahead of its time. The greedy world of tabloid journalism is laid out in all its ugly glory. It is insightful in the darker shades of humanity. This is devastating. Douglas is wonderful. Wilder is a genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cynical and ferocious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder - the American director whose body of work sailed as closely to perfection as one can get - reportedly referred to Ace in the Hole, a rare flop for Wilder, as "the runt of my cinematic litter." Dismissed by critics upon release for its cynical depiction of the tabloids and law enforcement, it has since been re-discovered and lavished with praise for foreshadowing a world in which we are bombarded with sensationalised news stories that are now never more than a thumb-swipe away. Kirk Douglas plays Chuck Tatum, a hard- drinking, troublemaking reporter exiled from New York to New Mexico, where he plans to recoup at a low-circulation local paper until he lands a story that will have his big-city former pals clawing at each other for his services.After over a year without the big break he was counting on, Tatum bitterly takes to the road to cover a rattlesnake hunt. On route, he stumbles across a weeping woman while filling his car with gas and, when a police car whizzes by, quickly sniffs the air for something big. It turns that a local man called Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) has become trapped in a cave while looking for local Indian artifacts. Remembering W. Floyd Collins, who had the nation gripped while in a similar situation, Tatum seizes his chance and quickly sets up shop, convincing Minosa's unhappy wife Lorraine (Jan Sterling) to stay and play the weeping damsel for the cameras and microphones, and strikes a deal with corrupt local sheriff Kretzer (Ray Teal) to support his re-election bidA more recent film to cover similar ground was Nighcrawler (2014), starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a more outwardly slimy reporter, manipulating events to his own benefit. The difference with Ace in the Hole is that Tatum does, by the end, discover a shred of humanity without losing his ferocity, as Leo's situation starts to look increasingly dire. Before his moral epiphany though, he shapes events with a Machiavellian wickedness, delaying the rescue and therefore allowing the story to garner national coverage, and using the strong-armed sheriff to shoo away any rival newspapers. It turns into a media circus, literally. Tatum stands on a mountain admiring what he has created while people flock to the scene in their hundreds and carnival rides are set up. A band even performs a song about Leo to the crowd and sells the recordings.Partly down to Douglas's astonishingly acid-tongued and energetic performance and partly Lesser Samuels, Walter Newman and Wilder's ferocious script, Ace in the Hole rests easily on par with the likes of The Lost Weekend (1945) and Some Like it Hot (1959), although it falls short of Double Indemnity (1944) and Sunset Blvd. (1950). He didn't get much wrong in his career, but Wilder's evaluation of the film is certainly dumbfounding. Unrelenting in its foreboding of where journalism was in danger of heading, Ace in the Hole is gripping storytelling. Douglas stampedes through the scenery like a branded bull, and his characters increasingly desperate actions remain shocking even now, 65 years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Leo and the Newspaper Dudes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody, almost everybody needs a piece of cake, it doesn't matter what they have to do to get it, and this movie portrays it superbly. The movie also depicts the ugly face of media, which goes down to a gutter level to create stories by risking human life. A disgraced reporter, brilliantly played by Kirk Douglas, takes the advantage of a man named 'Leo' who is trapped in a cave. He directs the entire rescue (not so rescue) operation to fulfill his ambition of becoming a world class reporter in a major newspaper. Along with a corrupt sheriff, and a driver cum contractor, he prolonged the rescue operation from a day to a week so that he can get the limelight, sheriff can get sympathy and votes, and the driver can get contracts. This rescue operation soon turns into an ugly carnival when hundreds of people after reading about the incident in the newspapers gather to watch this operation. The victim's wife (who isn't in love with the victim) also gets involved in this ugly plot when she notices that her struggling restaurant business has lots of visitors. Even the victim is trapped (who is already trapped in cave) in this whole drama because he believes that everybody loves him, and everybody is doing their best to get him out of the cave (poor Leo).Seriously, do newspaper headlines make a strong impact on our daily lives? Are we living our lives, or we are a puppet of media? This is the question I asked to myself after watching this movie. One more point to note down, that this movie was made in the year 1951. The story was written by Victor Desny, what a prophetic vision he had, this is 2016 and media has gone worse. The direction was also mind blowing, Billy Wilder took care of everything, and there was not a single dull moment in the movie. Do watch this great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ace in the Hole - Ever more relevant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is understandable that such an uncompromisingly cynical film was not well accepted and it was not until the more satirical approach used in "Network" that a film depicting media as a money-driven circus became a money-making proposition."Ace in the Hole" is a masterpiece of cinema that has not dated and, in fact, has become ever more relevant as newsreaders become "emotionally involved" instead of being objective conduits, beat-ups abound and adjectives are thrown around with gay abandon.It is worth watching this film just to hear the dialogue between Kirk Douglas and Jan Stirling. They portray two tough cookies who know that their futures have by accident become dependent upon each other. Both actors give bravura performances.Most films ever made will diminish over the years but not this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In his Most Uncompromising Work To Date, Wilder Holds All the Aces!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twenty years before the phrase 'media-circus' found its way into the lexicon, Billy Wilder envisaged a literal one while relating the story of a conniving reporter who attempts to turn invisible spectacle of a spelunker trapped in a cave, into the scoop of his life. Charles Tatum (Kirk Douglas, at his most powerful and hypnotic) is an unrepentant, sneering, quick-witted reporter whose weakness for liquor has washed up all but the lowest of job prospects. Relieved from his elevated post, he finds himself writing for a podunk daily in Albuquerque, all the timing hungry for a scandal or a tragedy that could turn into his big break. Enroute to one of his tabloid stories, he follows police sirens moving towards a hubbub at the nearby cliff, where a man has been trapped under a cave-in. Tatum knows a scoop when he sniffs one and he realizes he has finally found his ticket back to the big leagues. He sees a human interest story in the situation that he can profile to his needs, even if that means fabricating details. He paints the mountain as a haunted attraction and the man's icy, bottle-blonde love (Jan Sterling) as a virtuous wife. His reports soon become a national media sensation, drawing huge crowds to the scene - thrill seekers, media hounds, hucksters and profiteers descend on the scene in a frenzy of crass curiosity, turning the site into a gaudy carnival. The literal media circus that ensues turns Tatum into a star - he contrives to delay the man's rescue, milk the public's lust for spectacle, and auctions himself off to editors - but it comes at the expense of his integrity, even as the victim quietly faces death.Over 60 years later, Ace in the Hole has lost none of its sharpness. As a diatribe against all that is worst in human nature, it is dipped in pure vitriol. It's as dirty a noir as ever there was. Its world is fallen and irredeemable; its people are impotent ideologues; and concepts of faith and love are childish lies. It's the most cynical, uncompromising work from Billy Wilder - a searing indictment that is clairvoyant in the manner in which it mirrors our fascination with cheap sensationalism and shallow journalistic practices. The only thing that's hard to believe about the movie is that Wilder and his co-screenwriters could have been this far ahead of the curve in their criticism of the media.Ace in the Hole is like a punch in the gut, a kick in the nuts, a bucket of bile flung in the face. Bitter to the end, Ace in the Hole nearly suffocates you on its cynicism. But this is one time you will enjoy being breathless!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ace of spades.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder made so many great Hollywood films ("Double Indemnity", "Sunset Boulevard" and "Some Like It Hot" to name but three) and they almost all made money, but here's perhaps the best of them all and yet it was a commercial failure. I can understand why it failed as it holds a mirror up to its audience and exposes it to universal character flaws like morbid curiosity, profiteering, dubious morality as well as those old bedfellows, selfishness and greed. All these traits are fanned to a red-hot flame by unscrupulously ambitious former big-city-reporter turned small-town hack Kirk Douglas, looking for his meal-ticket back to the big time. When he lucks into a real-life human interest story about a hobbying excavator who falls down a mine shaft he quickly comes to exploit the situation by dragging out the rescue time, with the connivance of the corrupt local sheriff just coming up for re-election and his contractor digger, to benefit themselves at the expense at the poor victim just waiting to be rescued,The way Wilder builds up the mood is masterful, both at an individual and mass-crowd level. Eons example of the former is the depiction of fhe victim's jaded, past-caring wife, just on the verge of quitting the one-horse-town she's signed up to when she changes her mind in the hope of basking in the profits of her general store when the crowds roll in to see the potential disaster scene. Then there's also the turning of the idealistic young photographer out on assignment with Douglas who likewise changes his nature with the grave new world that his misplaced hero opens up for him. Wilder's management of the crowd scenes as hordes of the morbidly curious flock to the scene is superb but is exceeded when they leave town at the end, their "fun" over. The only contrary voice against the mass clamour of the rubbernecking crowd and the vulture-like national reporters is that of the wise old local newspaper editor whose dictum is "Tell the truth" and who attempts to turn Douglas back to the straight and narrow but knows he never will.The drive of the story-line and earthy verve of the dialogue are wonderful to see and hear in the hands of the maestro director plus he gets a fantastic lead performance by Douglas. He dominates the movie, is in the first and last scenes and most of those in between too. He's dynamite, stretching his lucky break right up until it breaks, breaking himself in the process. I can't speak highly enough of Wilder's direction either. Superbly shot, where you feel the heat of the desert, claustrophobia of the trapped man and clamour of the gathering crowd to name just three examples plus the final shot is as good and dramatic as an you'll ever see on the big screen.I've been very spare with my 10 out of 10 ratings but here's one that's more than justified. Aces high undoubtedly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kirk Douglas along with Robert Mitchum were two actors who since they started out played villains and good guys with equal aplomb. Therefore when it came to play someone cynical, someone with shades of darkness in the mix you can rely on these actors to imbue layers in their characters.Billy Wilder's Ace in the Hole sees Kirk Douglas playing down in the luck journalist Charles Tatum. He once courted the big time but is now reduced to a small town rag in New Mexico dreaming of a return to the big time.On an errand with a young reporter he arrives at a gas station and is informed of a man trapped in an old Indian mine in the nearby mountains. Tatum seizes his chance to make headline news by prolonging the man's agony. He gets the man's floozy wife who is about to leave him to play the dutiful, concerned wife and make money at the diner. He gets the local Sheriff in on the action to keep rival reporters away.The media circus brings in people and money. Tatum is negotiating a move back to a national newspaper but realises that his ace in the hole is in serious danger and it may be too late to save him.Wilder as in Sunset Boulevard brings a cynical eye to the world of media, journalism, the pursuit of fame and money. Tatum is all about wanting to be back in the big time and using his journalistic skills to keep the edge. Yet Tatum is a better and more decent person than the trapped man's wife who has lived in a one horse town for years and has had enough. The accident is her chance to get some money together and leave with some money in her pocket.Kirk Douglas is in his element here, not a total monster, just a man taking advantage of circumstances and making sure everybody has a piece of the pie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wilder masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Ace in the Hole' is like no other Billy Wilder movie i have seen before that acts more like a Hitchcockian thriller than an actual film-noir movie. The movie tells the story about a frustrated ex- journalist named Charles Tatum (played by Kirk Douglas, who gives the finest performance of his career since that of Spartacus (1960)) who ends up working for a newspaper in Albuquerque, New Mexico and is assigned to cover a story about a rattlesnake hunt with a fellow worker named Herbie Cook (played by Robert Arthur. While on the way to a town six hours away form where he works he learns about a man named Leo Minosa (played by Richard Benedict)who is trapped in a 450 year old ancient Indian dwelling. While watching this movie the plot reminded me a lot of Sidney Lumet's 1975 masterpiece Dog Day Afternoon because of the few similarities between the two films. This is one of the best Billy Wilder movies that I have seen in a long time along with Witness for the Prosecution (1957), The Apartment (1960), Sunset Boulevard (1950), Some like It Hot (1959), and The Spirit of St. Louis (1957). The Kirk Douglas performance reminds me of John Wayne's career defining performance that he gave in The Searchers (1956). I do find it hard to believe that this movie was only nominated for one Oscar at the 24th Oscar ceremony when I really do think that it should have been nominated for much more awards but the crappy excuse at the time was that it was a critical and commercial failure at the time this movie was released into theaters which I find to be really unfortunate because of how great this movie actually is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Underrated Treasure In Billy Wilder's Impressive Bag Of Films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A ruthless exposition of media sensationalism, an unforgiving examination of the dark side of press media &amp; a careful reflection of human nature, Billy Wilder's Ace in the Hole covers a wide array of relationships between press, the news it reports, the manner in which it reports it, the lengths to which some journalists choose to exploit someone's misfortunes &amp; the morbid curiosity of us human beings who are always attracted to the scenes of tragedy.The story concerns a fiercely ambitious &amp; self-centered reporter who settles for a reporting job at a small New Mexico newspaper after being fired from every other agency. But when he learns about a man stuck in a cave, he quickly uses this opportunity to re-jumpstart his career by exploiting the trapped man's situation, bribing the officials to prolong the rescue operation &amp; eventually creating a national media sensation that soon goes out-of-control, leading to terrible consequences.Brilliantly directed from start to finish, it's quite shocking to discover that this quality feature film was a critical &amp; commercial failure when it released but its reception has improved with time as the disgusting portrait of press media it paints has only become more relevant over the years. Deftly written, crisply photographed in black n white &amp; seamlessly put together by its narrow editing, its major strength comes from Kirk Douglas' biting performance as the disgraced reporter who stops at nothing to regain his tarnished reputation.On an overall scale, Ace in the Hole is one highly underrated gem in Billy Wilder's impressive filmography that truly deserves a much broader audience. It may not have the seamless blend of humour with tragic events unlike most films by Wilder, is pretty straight-forward with its content and is quite direct in its attack on the cruel side of free press &amp; government corruption but it hits all the right buttons over the course of its runtime and offers an observation that's absolutely worth your time &amp; money. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At times, we need lethargic and nonchalance to cope with life, Billy Wilder delivers that with this masterpiece.Throwing caution to the wind and making a movie devoid of embellishments of humor, romance, music but just with drama is an intrepid attempt. This I believe was the reason for the initial failure of this movie called Ace In The Hole. It was deprived of many formulaic things that are a part of any movie, be it Wilder's too. Yet, this one had only a line that was made into characters, they form scenes and these scenes of enormity give us a grand picture. This is about a man trapped in a hole, whose story is being manifested by a selfish, ambitious journalist Chuck Tatum played flawlessly by Kirk Douglas. This tiny story, surpasses many things and makes the little known place into a tourist spot. A fair is setup, sales are picked up at the store. And what more, the wife of that poor struck guy is enticing the macho journalist who has the knack of convincing people by his charm. I loved Kirk Douglas in "Bad and the Beautiful" and "Paths of Glory" my love for him grew with this film and the way he played Chuck Tatum, the enigmatic journalist who has a humane side, Alas! it came a bit too late in the film. Well, the variation of emotion or modulation of voice, he seems to be doing many things on screen all at once and that too without any effort. More than anything, he made Chuck to be a next door journalist and indeed an affable one. Yet, he is rigid on terms and work with his own mindset and his own ambition. Coming to other actors, they have ably supported Kirk in his endeavor to rescue that poor guy who was struck in the hole. All have done their job exceedingly well, be it the silent mother who prays or this big media tycoons who are willing to pay any money to Chuck to buy the story. As a story, it's utterly cynical of how media sensationalizes any petty issue and makes it headlines to attract readers. It's not news anymore, it's business. That's how we are governed now by media. I am more than happy to have seen such a satire, the other media satire I fondly remember is "Peepli Live". The technical departments, for this movie have done their job well, and Billy at the helm has handled direction superbly. With each film, my love for Billy Wilder grows, and he is one of my favorite directors. With simple story lines, he made huge masterpieces that are etched in the memory forever. I loved this film, this is what you call master storytelling and Billy precisely did that, it's 4/5 and I thank myself for making time to watch this cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cynicism Borne From Compassion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's role as the master of cynicism has always drawn from a wellspring of compassion and both are in plentiful supply in this dark, dark masterpiece. Wilder, writing with Lesser Samuels and Walter Newman, delivers a hard-boiled tale in which a faded newspaperman (an excellent Kirk Douglas) stumbles upon a human interest story about a miner trapped in a cave (Richard Benedict) and milks it at the miner's expense until it has become an event of carnival proportions and a national media sensation. In addition to the media, Wilder eviscerates a host of sacred cows, including marriage (an intriguing Jan Sterling plays the miner's lonely, corrupt wife), the police and the gullible--yet ultimately penitent--public (represented by everyone's favorite sad sack, Frank Cady, who would later gain fame as Hooterville's store clerk Mr. Drucker on "Petticoat Junction" and "Green Acres"); but his empathetic treatment of the miner and his desperate parents prove to be a filter through which Wilder can channel his rage and the results are devastating. The Fifties proved to be a fertile era for a burgeoning psychological cinema that questioned the everyday tropes that Americans were living their lives by but were beginning to reject; with pointed images of a community formed to celebrate an individual's despair, Wilder evokes feelings in his audience that are consistent with a jaded post-world war worldview and which, with his prescient subject matter, continue to resonate today.</fullReview>

Anyway, American writers and filmmakers took a very dim view of their country even when they were ruling the world.

		<shortDescription>'Ace in the Hole': Fogotten Materpiece Far Ahead of its Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I profiled Billy Wilder in 1984 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of "Some Like it Hot," not only interviewing him but serving as the host of a live "an evening with" question and answer stage presentation, he surprisingly turned the subject at one point to his 1951 film, "Ace in the Hole," and the plagiarism lawsuit it engendered. He was still smarting nearly a quarter of a century later, as well he should, and was eager to talk about it and set the record straight. Now, all these years after his remarks to me, I can fully grasp how very far ahead of its time "Ace in the Hole" indeed was, both in its subject matter _ still incredibly timely in its depiction of an unscrupulous newsman and the public's insatiable appetite for news and anything remotely resembling it _ as well as in the legalities surrounding this harbinger of what we now call "social media." The film was inspired by two real-life events, a 1925 incident in which a man named W. Floyd Collins was trapped inside a landslide in Sand Cave, Kentucky, and a 1949 incident in which a three-year-old girl named Kathy Fiscus fell into an abandoned well in San Marino, California. In both cases, the victims died and in both instances the tragedies had turned into media sensations (reporter William Burke won the Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Kentucky story). After the movie's release, Wilder, who co-wrote the screenplay as well as directed and produced the film, was sued for plagiarism by actor and aspiring screenwriter Victor Desny, who claimed he had contacted Wilder's secretary, Rosella Stewart, to propose a film based on on the Collins story. Wilder's lawyers protested that this verbal summary did not make it a formal story submission and that the Collins story was historical and not governed by copyright laws. In 1953, a judge ruled in favor of Wilder and Paramount, the distributor of the film, but in 1956 the California State Supreme Court overturned that decision, saying the oral submission had been legitimate. Wilder settled, paying roughly $15,000. The case set a precedent, as Wilder pointed out to me, and is a large part of the reason writer, producers, studios and others are so careful about speaking to anyone or receiving correspondence about "new" ideas nowadays. It's important to underscore Wilder still insisted plagiarism had not been involved. As for the film itself, a fictitious down on his luck New York reporter (played by Kirk Douglas) banished to an inconsequential newspaper in New Mexico stumbles into a nearby cave-in where a man is trapped and sees the opportunity to get back in the big time by milking the incident for all it's worth, to the point of conspiring to slow the rescue effort. Along the way he has an affair with the victim's wife, beautifully played by Jan Sterling, who is in on the deal. "Ace in the Hole," not surprisingly, was savaged by much of the self-righteous press of the day. No doubt this had much to do with its failure at the box office (the film's final cost was $1,821,052, its box office $1.3 million). It was Wilder's first critical and commercial failure. It was also the first filming which he served as writer, producer and director _ as well as his first film after his breakup with writing partner Charles Brackett, who by the way, took along the duo's more experienced secretary who might have fared better in answering Victor Desny's fateful lawsuit-inducing phone call. Now, in retrospect, many consider this as arguably Wilder's finest work, and certainly his bravest (see Orson Welles and "Citizen Kane"). Be aware that a misguided studio pooh-bah at one point renamed "Ace in the Hole" as "The Big Carnival" without Wilder's knowledge or consent, and that copies of the film may be floating around under that title. No matter what it's called now, it's well worth tracking down and watching, a marvel in virtually every aspect, from writing to performances to its documentary style. The film could have been made yesterday _ that is, if any filmmaker could match Wilder's remarkable talent, and unwavering courage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder was way ahead of his time, here...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For multiple reasons, I found myself checking out Kirk Douglas' bio on IMDb this morning. He and Eli Wallach are now in their late 90's and not much longer for this Earth. Both men have been giants of the entertainment industry, and will be even more gigantic losses when they pass on. Mickey Rooney's recent departure was a reminder of what will come soon.Mr. Douglas has given us such amazing performances over the years, such as: Spartacus, Vincent Van Gogh in "Lust For Life", Colonel Dax in "Paths of Glory", and here, Chuck Tatum in "Ace in the Hole". In the latter, Billy Wilder hit gold in his casting of downcast newspaper reporter, Chuck Tatum. As Douglas would later accomplish in "Lust for Life", he literally oozes emotional complexity, as the characters' would in reality, and in extremely different times and circumstance.Billy Wilder somehow foresaw the pathetic future descent of the media into the prurient, exploitative, tabloid-like image of the present. Some cases in point would be: the O.J. trial,'Baby Jessica' in the well, the Menendez trial, a host of other trials, and the Pretorius trial going on right now, to name just a few. In 1951, this film must have been a sensation, causing outrage and denial in its depiction of the alleged 'media circus' phenomenon. The alternate title, "The Great Carnival", would have been even more apt, as it doles out the appropriate sarcasm the events to come on-screen would so richly deserve. I give no further details about the film, here, as previous reviews have done this all too well, already. A landmark film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly relevant study about the exploits of a cynical journalist, from a truly great director.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film works both as film noir and melodrama, whilst cut through with some nice lines in spiky wit. It does however still require strong central performances to make it work, and whilst Kirk Douglas may not be my favourite actor, his performance as the lethally cynical journalist is very good. Yet Jan Sterling who plays the wife of a man who is trapped in a cave, does steal the acting honours. She has a difficult and seemingly unsympathetic role. One which makes you care about someone who couldn't care less about the plight of her husband. The story which involves the trapped man being made to stay trapped, in order to allow the journalist to get a better story, is made for Billy Wilder to direct. He exposes the cynicism of the journalist and then a crooked sheriff who allows the man to stay trapped for political gain. Billy wilder makes it seem effortless in turning a potentially cold movie into a film where wit is allowed to offer a break from the overall cynicism.The film is not without flaws, but they are minor ones, and for some might not be seen as such. Melodrama for example is not to everyone's taste, and it does veer too much towards it at times. Kirk Douglas acting does perhaps strain too much towards it as well. I didn't find it off-putting, as I sometimes do with Kirk Douglas, because overall his acting style is suited to the story.The cinematography is very crisp and clean, and gives the film a freshness that belies the fact it was made in 1951. The film's take also seems fresh. The cynicism of journalistic methods today, may not be as overt as in the film, but your are constantly reminded of the hacking scandal and the way the paparazzi operate today. The last scene of Kirk Douglas falling towards the film camera in the moment of his death, is a justifiably famous one, and comes at the culmination of a terrifically tense sequence. This film also does some nicely nasty detail in the way that even the man trapped in the cave is not entirely innocent. He is in the cave basically too loot an old Indian spiritual site, so he can sell the recovered artifacts at his roadside diner. It's the way all the characters seem to be compromised by their desire for money or fame that suggest that Wilder was attacking capitalism, rather than just the characters themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful movie dealing with moral themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ace in the Hole is about a brash, self-centered news reporter, Charles Tatum, who shamelessly exploits a tragedy to satisfy his own personal needs. He doesn't care about other people; he just cares about himself and abuses his responsibilities as a journalist to create havoc. Kirk Douglas delivers a powerful performance as Charles Tatum. Douglas succeeds in capturing Tatum's depravity. Jan Sterling also delivers a strong performance as Lorraine, the cynical yet emotionally vulnerable wife of the man trapped in the cave. Lorraine is on to Tatum. She knows that he's a con man doing a con job. Yet, this movie is not about Lorraine, it is about Tatum. Tatum drives this story. Charles Tatum is not a tragic figure. He has no redeeming qualities. He is a womanizer, a bully, a drunk and a trouble maker. Tatum is too crass, too deceitful and too violent to warrant any sympathy. He cruelly exploits the plight of a suffering man and beats up on a woman, not once, but twice. His conduct is beyond mitigation. He is not a Walter Neff, who was just doing his job, gets caught up in something and then gets manipulated into making questionable decisions. Tatum knew the rules of conduct and by his own volition deliberately violated them. He knew he was doing wrong and did it anyway. He has only himself to blame. Yet, the story is tragic, not for what it says about Tatum, who by the end of the story is revealed to be what he is, a broken down, discredited nobody, but for what it says about a society that would give credence to a creep like Tatum in the first place. Had a society that produced heroes like Sergeant York and Lou Gehrig and solemnly prayed for the safety and success of its brave soldiers on Omaha Beach become so decadent and depraved that it could gloat and laugh over the plight of a suffering man stuck in a cave? Or tolerate the idea of man viciously hitting and terrorizing a woman? Or permit a drunkard to masquerade as a savior? Or produce people willing to sell out in order to gain cheap political advantage? In this respect, this movie is a form of social commentary and by watching it, a consciousness raising experience. For those reasons alone, it qualifies as a work of art.On second thought, Charles Tatum, the principal character in Ace in the Hole, is a tragic figure. Although he is thoroughly despicable, by his own admission he is a murderer, his pomposity and pretentiousness calls attention to our own weaknesses and imperfections as human beings. Tatum was not born being bad. At some point in his life he was innocent, spiritually pure, and happy. Then something happened to distort his personality and corrupt him. The movie does not allude to that event but it can be inferred that some trauma must have occurred to cause him to become warped. He harbors resentment against the paper in New York that fired him, but even if the firing was unjust, that trauma alone is not sufficient to explain Tatum's twisted personality. He craves power, prestige and money; his grandiosity knows no bounds; he wants to be treated like a god. These aspirations are a fool's dream and one that can only bring destruction. Tatum's strivings are an exercise in futility. He is like a puppet that is trying to pull its own strings, in the process getting the strings tangled. Throughout the story Tatum is a mess and his behavior erratic. He is attracted to Lorraine, yet beats her. He risks his life by going into the cave, but it is only for show. He is energetic and resourceful, for reasons that are self-serving. He is the kind of guy who will bail you out of a jam but only for a price; the kind of guy who will help you out then do you in; the kind of guy who will help you fix your car because he wants to steal it. Tatum could have been a hero. He could have called attention to Leo's plight not as part of a gimmick for self-promotion but because he really wanted to help save a life and really cared. He could have been a positive role model for Lorraine and Herbie, and for everyone else who admires him. But he squanders the opportunity and winds up acting the fool and being the fool. What a waste. In this respect, Charles Tatum is a tragic figure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Viewing this film reminds one of the headlines involving the little girl who fell down into the well several years ago and all the surrounding hoopla. Did the journalists who covered that story ever see this movie? Perhaps some things will never change in America. A problem in selling this picture is the fact that the main character, played by Kirk Douglas, is extremely unlikable. If Billy Wilder had shaded him a bit more ambiguously, showing that he originally did have a conscience-- that he became so caught up in the job and surviving, well then maybe that could have made the film and its main anti-hero more understandable to audiences. An interesting line of dialogue is spoken by Douglas' character when he says that bad news is big news, and good news is no news. But do we really believe that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but left me wanting for more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm the kind of person, who looks for the moral of the story - the philosophical message expressed in the film. In the case of Ace in the Hole, it could be something like "don't be selfish and don't manipulate others for your own gain". Which at the end of the day isn't that bad, but it does seem a bit simplistic and unfortunately left me wanting for more at the ending.The performance by K. Douglas is, as usual - splendid and it was quite a journey witnessing him turn from a charismatic but arrogant journalist into a broken man - brought down to his knees in the realization of his own miserableness as a human being.This film has quite a few memorable moments and scenes which will make you stare in amazement or disbelief (the slapping scene, for example, caught me completely off guard), many of which owe their merit to K. Douglas' splendid acting.Overall, Ace in the Hole is a good film with great acting and cinematography, but with some drawbacks as well. Nevertheless, it definitely deserves to be watched at least once by everybody. It gets 7.5 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb film that has gained status as it aged</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been much of a fan of Billy Wilder. It seems to me that he always brought out the worst in his characters...the snide...the sarcastic...the hypocritical. That's not to say that I don't see him as a talented director. It's just that he focuses on the negative.This film is no exception. But I have to give him credit...it's a memorable film. And by that I mean that the first time I saw it was on one of the network movie nights, certainly back in the 1960s...and I never forgot it.You're not supposed to like Kirk Douglas here (for all the reasons mentioned above)...and you don't. In fact, you don't from the first 3 minutes he's in the film. When he walks in the newspaper office and says "How" to the American Indian working there, you know Douglas' characters is something very close to the title of the film. But not liking the character is not the same as not liking the actor, and this is a superb performance by Douglas. I would say that it would rival whatever his best performance is.The other actor here that you're not supposed to like is Jan Sterling. And you won't. I've never been impressed with her as an actress (although perhaps I need to relook at "The High And The Mighty"), but she is perfect in this role.Robert Arthur as the young photographer is very good...plays it all somewhat innocently. He had the face for it, and it worked well for him here. Porter Hall as the Albuquerque newspaper editor was down-home honest and good...good performance. Nice to see Frank Cady in something other than "Petticoat Junction". Richard Benedict is good as the victim of the cave-in. And, Ray Teal -- always a favorite of mine -- does well here as the crooked sheriff.The plot is gripping. You're never quite sure how it's going to end, although you will probably have a hunch the victim dies. But there are twists and turns that maintain the excitement throughout the film. As much as I dislike the premise of the film, it's a superb effort by all concerned. Ray Teal as Sheriff Kretzer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Kirk Douglas tends to go a bit over the top in a few rants, that is the only thing that is unfortunate in this otherwise spot on, cynical expose on the Media Circus, Egocentrism, and Yellow Journalism. No wonder it was a flop upon its initial release. No one wanted a prescient reminder of just how self-centered, greedy, and badly we can behave at times.This is a ferocious, ahead of its time, display of depravity that is riveting and revolting. It has the audacity to "Tell the Truth". Not a pretty picture sometimes and this is anything but a pretty Picture. Everyone is a target here and they all deserve the shots. The Media, Common Folks, Law Enforcement, Politicians, Hucksters, and Golddiggers. This one has bite and is forever chomping at the Human Condition. It is Film-Noir right out in the bright sunlight for all to see. You just have to buy a ticket. Capitalism in its raw form. All take part and all are put to the test and fail. There are only Father and Mother who really care about the buried Leo. Only after his life-blood is draining does the Reporter feel any remorse and it is only on his "Deathbed" that he says..."you can have me for no charge".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like a film where no one wins, cheesy acting, and corny sets then I would recommend this film. The idea of a small town reporter being able to create a national awareness to the extent of this film was not only unbelievable but in a way disappointing. I would even take this film as a mocumentary in the sense that it created a theme park out of a serious situation. Maybe the director was attempting to show that people will do things for their personal benefit rather than for the actual cause. As in the movie people were showing up to a carnival rather than a attempt to rescue a person stuck in a hole. You can even connect this idea to the main character himself. Not only was he a selfish creep but towards the middle of the film you realized the he did it all for attention. I feel as if that was one of the reasons I had a hard time enjoying this film. There was no character the I actually enjoyed watching. Even the man under the boulder was scavenging things that were not his own. I'm not trying to say that in order for me to enjoy a movie there needs to be a good guy, but it is a bit more enjoyable when there's a character you can have sympathy for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Lost" Classic Billy Wilder...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe I've seen all Billy Wilder films...except this one eluded me. Why in the name of Good Cinema is it not well known and available as a proper DVD release? Why does it take the Koreans to produce the only (as far as I'm aware) means of buying it? I've never, ever seen it on TV and could hardly have seen it when it came out as I'd have been minus 15 years old!That's the rant over (justified!) and here's to a classic Kirk Douglas and Wilder collaboration. As with his 'The Fortune Cookie', Billy really lays on the spot-on satire about the greed of modern America. And how apt that still is today, with newspaper's hacking mobile phones etc.Douglas is a not-so-young journalist of the thuggish kind who just keeps the wrong side of being a "louse". Having lost all credibility in big- time New York, he begs and weedles his way into getting a job on a small-time local rag in the desert. Soon, he has found his gold-digging honeypot of a story - a married man who's fallen down a crevice in some caves that are a shrine to Native Americans.Instead of just getting the poor man out, he calculates and hatches a plan to elongate the man's agony by padding out the rescue but hyping up the story by any means possible. Enter the man's wife, played by a superbly calculating and common Jan Sterling. Soon, the diner that the couple hardly ever had a customer at is turning over big bucks, due to folks flocking in to see the rescue, after Chuck Tatum (Douglas) gets a picture and exclusive on the front page of his grateful paper.Within days, there's a fairground and even a song written specially for the poor fellow still below ground. Entrance to the site has risen from 25c to a dollar. Lorraine (Sterling) sees her way out of a miserable life and it's obvious that she wants to be hooked up with and taken to NY by Tatum, with all that money they've dubiously earned.You can probably see where this is going, though the result, maybe not. The film resonates of the Chilean miner incident not so long ago. There's powerful acting, specially from Douglas and Sterling and superb black &amp; white photography. The original script earned an Oscar nomination for Wilder and his two co-scriptwriters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're interested in this type of stuff. You can actually visit the movie location for "Ace in the Hole." The movie was great and I loved Kirk Douglas. I gave the movie a 10. So if you would like to visit where this movie was made, it's still there.I believe this movie had one or two other titles before it's release. One of them I believe was "The Big Circus". I know there was "The big Carnival", but I do believe one of the other titles in the running was "The Big Circus".The Movie was shot at Indian Ruins, located on old route 66 just alongside US 40, exactly on the New Mexico/Arizona state border.Not much has changed. The cave area still looks almost exactly the same. And the open surrounding fields are still wide open and the Indian Ruins are still there. Progress has not yet taken over this area like most tourist locations. Of course there are some tourist attractions, but the mystery of the Indian ruins and New Mexico Desert still have a sacred ambiance. It's simply a unique area. Visit there with an open mind and experience the tranquility of the area. It's like going back in time.If you go....Have fun...:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Belt and braces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review was written of a screening at Cambridge Film Festival (UK) - 15 to 25 September 2011* Contains spoilers *Billy Wilder co-wrote the film, so it seemed well deserved to think of reviving Ace in the Hole, not just as part of a theme of journalism in film. As to the pairing with the short (not so short) Wakefield Express about a newspaper of that name (and its production and that of four sister papers), I am less sure, and think that I would have preferred to go, without an introduction, straight to Kirk Douglas, as Chuck Tatum, talking his way into a job in Albuquerque.(If the short had been screened second, there would have been a risk that that some might (I would) have left after the feature (but so be it), and, although I accept that accompanying films were part of the fabric of how films were shown even in my childhood, that is not a usual way with revivals.) Chuck has been there a year when we see him next, and I failed to notice that now he has 'gone native' by adopting the local habit of wearing braces on his trousers, but also a belt. Everybody knows him, everybody knows his rants about the stultifying nature of small-town news. (Garrison Keillor may have seen this film: his narrator in Love Me reminds me of it, now that I ? have a chance to ? reflect.) Rattle-snakes aren't Chuck's thing, unlike the sheriff where he ends up, but he is dispatched to a gathering in their honour: he does not get to the destination, but we have a flavour of it through the Sheriff Kretzer's specimen (and its tastes in food), because he sees the meat in a news story of Leo Minosa, a man trapped underground, trapped because (since Leo interprets being imprisoned as punishment) he went there to plunder a native American burial-ground yet another time.Leo trusts the journalist who pushed past authority to get to him, and believes that he is trying to get him out quickly, rather than realizing that Chuck is spinning out the story as part of a plan to get back into a job in New York (or Chicago). The plan works, but the curse is that the delay has brought about Leo's inevitable death ? by then, Chuck, sure of himself, has already taken off his braces, thereby transporting us to the proprietor's office and his mockery of such means of playing it safe.So, as the imagery has told us, Chuck has started playing without a safety-net, and, when he could seek assistance for himself, he delays ? again, the theme of putting something off ? too long, because he feels obligated to see that Leo is given the final rites. Still not tending to his needs, and, after both dismissing the crowd that has gathered in the preceding days and having failed to interest his New York boss in the story of his betrayal, Chuck goes back to Albuquerque with that story.He had played the newspaper bosses off against each other to get what he wanted, but his self-destructive self stakes everything on a closing story behind the final one: having seemed unable to announce Leo's death to the world as 'a scoop', he has declaimed the matter in public and told everyone to go, a scene perhaps reminiscent of Christ clearing the Temple (but, here, the idolatrous temple of his own making, and one that contains a body to prove it).Not for the most pure of motives, he has resisted the advances of Leo's wife Lorraine (with the suitable bewitchment of Jan Sterling), who really just wants something better than Leo, his family, and the run-down desert café that they run. She only did not leave earlier (as she does afterwards) because she, too, believes in Chuck's persuasive rhetoric, but she does not want to have to play the grieving wife to help the rescue story. Misjudging it, Chuck pushes it too far, too far beyond what is safe, by trying to force Lorraine back into her role, because it is his role, not hers.In the final analysis, he staked too highly. In spotting and creating a dramatic story, in exploiting (as he says in relation to the sheriff's snake festival and the card-game there that Chuck forced him to miss), he thought that he had, in Leo, an ace in the hole, not a pair of deuces.With whom (or what), then, has Chuck been playing poker that his seemingly winning hand has collapsed, and been shown for what it is? Is he really a tragic hero, and is that what made Ace in the Hole, for all that it is well written, something that also did not make the film itself a winner with an audience that does not seek that sort of ending?</fullReview>

Kirk Douglas plays Chuck Tatum, a down-on-his-luck journalist, that has been fired from numerous big-city newspapers. Chuck's car breaks down in Albuqerque, New Mexico, and being light in the wallet, he tries reestablishing himself reporting for a small paper that revers truth over substance. The months drag by and a bored Tatum is assigned to report on a rattlesnake hunt. With photographer Herbie(Robert Arthur)in tow, a stop for gasoline at a small store will provide Tatum with the chance to exploit a man, Leo Minosa(Richard Benedict), trapped in a cave. The victim's misfortune allows Tatum to orchestrate the rescue and by stretching out the process, he manages to cash-in by selling daily reports to a larger newspaper in NYC. He keeps building up the story and a frenzied crowd gathers and a carnival even sets up. Meanwhile Leo is dying; not in the unethical reporter's plans. Others in the cast: Jan Sterling, Ray Teal, John Berkes, Harry Harvey, Porter Hall and Frank Cady.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Straight from the headlines the film "Ace in the Hole" shows just how unscrupulous those in the media can be to get the big scoop and makes themselves both rich and famous at the expense of others.Down and out former big city reporter Chuck Tatum, Kirk Douglas, gets himself a job on the barley surviving Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin and plans to make it big in the newspaper business even if he has to kill someone in order to do it. Tatum gets his big chance when he and his fellow reporter and photographer for the paper Herbie Cook, Robert Arthur, come across this cave-in deep in Indian territory outside of Escudero New Mexico. Smelling a big story in the works Tatum finds ancient Indian artifact hunter Leo Minosa, Richard Benedict, trapped deep inside the cave clinging to life and an idea suddenly pops into Tatum's head.Being the only reporter on the scene Tatum plans to keep Leo trapped in the cave as long as he can and make the headlines with the tragic situation Leo finds himself in! It would have taken less then a day to save Leo by shoring up the cave and pulling Leo out of it. But instead Tatum decides, against the advice of the local engineers on the scene, to drill through some 200 feet of rock to finally get to Leo and save his life. Something that would take almost a week to accomplish! Using the corrupt country sheriff Gus Kretzer, Ray Teal, as his strong arm man Tatum gets the ball rolling in making a complete circus out of poor Leo's tragic fate that even Leo's gold digging wife Lorraine, Jan Sterling, who was about to leave him joins in on. With Leo becoming headline news all across the country the fact that his life is in serious danger due to Tatum and Sheriff Kretzan, who up for re-election, manipulating and milking him, or his story, for as long as they can makes things much worse for the poor and desperate man.***SPOILERS*** It's very late in the Leo saga that Tatum finally comes to his senses in what he's not only doing to Leo but to himself as well. With both time and air running out for Leo Tatum decides to stop the drilling and shore up the cave, which he was told to do in the first place, in order to save Leo's life before he dies from his injuries. Tatum has by now completely lost it and in an attempt to get Lorraine to go along with his scam of her being the grieving wife ends up getting stabbed, when he tried to strangle Lorraine,in the gut by her. With his meal ticket,Leo Minosa, now gone Tatum finally sees the light and the damage in what he did and meekly returns back to the office of the Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin to get a job that he feels is more then fitting of his talents: As the papers's junior mans room attendant working not for a salary but on tips alone. Tatum trying to compose himself doesn't quite make it back to his desk dropping dead, from a loss of blood, right there on the spot with his shocked boss the editor of the paper Jacob Q.

		<shortDescription>A seemingly brutal film, yet one that never ceases to be interesting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic structure of Ace in the Hole is essentially a story that has been told countless times. It's a rags-to-riches story, with the central character encountering mass amounts of corruption when met with the new position of power. Usually when these stories are told, they are predictable and tiring. However, Billy Wilder takes this basic structure and turns it into something much more unique for this film, making it one of his best and most underrated films.The story of Ace in the Hole is extremely unique due to the central character, Chuck Tatum, played masterfully by Kirk Douglas. Unlike most rags-to-riches stories, Tatum never starts off as some sort of mild-mannered, lovable everyman. So, gone are any comparisons that could be made to tragic figures in films contemporary to this, such as Willie Stark in All the King's Men. No, Tatum is already a despicable, rotten, pathetic excuse of a man from the start of the film. He is in the position he's in because of his own treacherous acts and shows no hint of looking to change. As he progresses into a position of power, the audience is not asking itself questions such as, "How far can a man of such a humble background overcome his poor surroundings and rise to the top?" but rather asking, "How much can a corrupt individual use his trickery to his advantage?" Yet the audience is never turned off from Tatum. As much as he is unlikable, he's never one that the audience can't care for. He's the kind of character you hate yet can't take your eyes off of because you have a need to see what he says and does next. He immediately draws those watching in with his fast-talking nature and ability to carefully manipulate other characters. One of the opening scenes involving him talking the seemingly hard-to-crack newspaper editor Jacob Boot (Porter Hall) into giving him a job for his newspaper effectively shows that he is no ordinary protagonist, luring the audience in to see what could he possibly do next.What also makes Tatum quite the unique character is the fact that he's not the man who others look to change and turn into a good man. The majority of the supporting characters are made up of people as equally corrupt as he is, or those with morals who look to just get him out of the picture. They realize the kind of man they are dealing with and look to deal with that many only. The only character that comes the closest to changing Tatum is Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict). He is the only character that Tatum looks to help other than himself. However, what prevents Tatum from even considering to change his ways is the fact that most of Tatum's attempts to try to help Minosa contain underlying selfish concerns. He only wants to help Minosa because it would have an adverse affect on himself.Focusing on a character such as Tatum establishes that Ace in the Hole is a film meant to be ruthless and mean - something especially unique for the time period in which it was made. In the wrong hands, it could be one of the most unpleasant experiences one could ever sit through - the fact that it is lost as one of Billy Wilder's "lesser" films in comparison to efforts such as Some Like it Hot, Sunset Boulevard, and Double Indemnity does suggest that it has yet to fully gain the recognition it deserves. However, Wilder does just opposite, and turns this film about mostly unlikable people into one of the most interesting subversions on the rags-to-riches stories. It's a "small" film, but it is also a film that deserves to stand aside other films of its time and be held in regards as a classic.4.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The twilight of film noir?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Ace in the Hole, I can see why Billy Wilder wanted Kirk Douglas for the lead in Stalag 17 two years later. Both leads are thoroughly dislikable anti-heroes, but who are redeemed, barely, in the end. And after watching Douglas' performance here, it is apparent that Stalag 17 was written for him. But Ace in the Hole was not a box office success, so it is understandable that Douglas would not want to reprise both the role, and potentially the results, in his next film. You might say he was a little too successful at being hated. But almost everyone in the film is either dislikable or a bit pathetic, not a very cheerful reflection of humanity. Douglas' performance is absolutely electric; he projects onto the screen with great intensity. When you look at the chronology of his credits, this appears to be his first big leading role. Surely, producers understood his great talent from this performance, even if the public did not. But I guess he did not want to be typecast as a bad guy so early in his career and so passed on Stalag 17, even though William Holden won an Oscar for his performance. Wilder also apparently learned from Ace in the Hole that it was now the Fifties and the days of straight up film noir were over. So he added a large dose of humor to Stalag 17, almost too much, but the result was a big success, pretty amazing for a film about a German prisoner of war camp. As the film opened with Douglas in the Albuquerque newspaper office, I couldn't help but think of Groundhog Day. Douglas' cynical reaction to the sampler on the wall, "Tell the Truth," and the woman's facial expression, reminded me of the scene in the bed and breakfast in Groundhog Day with Bill Murray as the cynical big city weatherman. You might say Groundhog Day was a humorous take on the idea of a big city journalist stuck in a hick town. If the measure of literary or cinematic art is to embody eternal truths, then Ace in the Hole qualifies as true art. I guess just about anyone can see how Ace in the Hole captures the spirit of so much of modern journalism, particularly the 24 hour satellite news overkill coverage of any sort of disaster or event, even on the weather channel. The word processing gear has changed, but the spirit of greed has not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kirk Douglas like you've never seen him before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I'm not that familiar with Kirk Douglas (outside of Spartacus and Paths of Glory) or Billy Wilder for that matter. I had always pictured Douglas as the heroic, honorable type and Wilder as the fun, classic "Hollywood" type of filmmaker who works with Marylin Monroe and Jack Lemmon. However, this film proved otherwise on both counts.Douglas plays a no-none-sense, often times ruthless journalist who has a tendency to "shape" his own stories into mass-media, front-page news. He's egotistical, unapologetic, and seemingly heartless. This is not the Kirk Douglas I've always envisioned, and he really gets a chance to become a completely different person is this film. You almost completely hate him, until you realize that he's ultimately a self-destructive lunatic, which, in a strange way, makes the character more sympathetic.The supporting cast is very good here, and every scene "pops" with intensity and unpredictability, thanks to quick, snappy dialogue and editing. It's a film that doesn't seem to slow down, and soon you the viewer find yourself caught-up in the mania. Of course, this is what the film is really about: the mania of mass media and the utter mercilessness and ruthlessness of the modern press. It's also about how one lie or deception can snowball into a force of its own, not to be reckoned with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creating A Mass Mentality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man gets trapped underground. An unscrupulous newspaperman named Chuck Tatum (Kirk Douglas) uses the unfortunate event to boost his newspaper career. It's the old story, repeated again in "Network" (1976), about the tendency of a corrupt media to manipulate people's perceptions of events. Made less than a decade after the fall of Hitler, the film's anti-hero is a genius at creating a mass mentality.Tatum is thoroughly unlikeable. He's cocky, arrogant, ruthless, and greedy. Yet he's good at exploiting situations. He's an opportunist. My problem with this film is the lack of subtlety in Douglas' performance. The script's dialogue helps not at all. Tatum is an in-your-face villain, almost from the get-go. Further, the Tatum character completely overwhelms the story. All other characters, including the trapped man, revolve around Tatum. They exist to further the Tatum character study.This is a very cynical film. There's not more than two or three humane characters in the entire script. Even law and order characters are corrupt. The general public is portrayed rightly as easily manipulated, morbidly curious, and excruciatingly glib.B&amp;W visuals emphasize the negative aspects of humanity, as people descend like vultures to the rescue site that gradually morphs into a literal circus. The labyrinthine cave, a set that is poorly constructed, is a kind of metaphor for Tatum, as he digs himself deeper and deeper into a thematic hole.There's very little nobility or sense of humanity here, and not an ounce of humor. "Ace In The Hole" is clearly a message film, one that stresses a deceitful press and a gullible public.It's a message that needs to be repeated, apparently for each new generation of viewers. But I think I would have appreciated this particular film more if the story had played down the Tatum character a bit, and if someone other than Kirk Douglas had been cast in that role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What make this movie work are the performances of Kirk Douglas and Jan Sterling because the movie's development is a little naive even though it's entertaining.The film's beginning and final are the best parts. I had read very good things about this movie and when I saw Kirk Douglas in his first scenes at the newspaper I thought wow this is going to be a great movie but at the end it was just satisfactory even though it has a good plot and a good message. I think there should be a remake of this movie because it could have been great at 1951 but as I said before it looks a little naive and old fashion for these days, though the performances are very good. Charles Tatum (Kirk Douglas) is a journalist who can't find a job in the big cities because of his background that's why he works at a little newspaper's town in New Mexico until one day he gets a second chance to recover his former job at NY because of a man's accident which he will cover......I recommend you to watch it if it's on TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got to see my most-wanted Billy Wilder film. This excellent picture has Kirk Douglas in one of his best performances as ultra-cynical reporter Chuck Tatum, who will do anything for a good story. He chances upon one when, sent off to cover a rattlesnake meet (!), he learns of a man trapped underground. Tatumn then creates a media circus as he exploits the situation for all it's worth.One of Billy Wilder's darkest, acerbic films, this has a great script and is thoroughly entertaining throughout. I like how Wilder shows us that the public is almost as morally bankrupt as Chuck as they gobble up the headlines. Douglas was always great in this sort of role, and he dominates the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the film Wilder directed after Sunset Boulevard. This is an important thing to state. He was by than, i feel, immersed in several issues, some concerning his in satisfaction regarding life and cinema industry in America, and others concerning his exploitation towards noir and its narrative possibilities. My opinion is that Wilder took the original conception of noir to its limits with Sunset Boulevard. So in a away, he ended noir with that film. This one was sort of a reprise, a bonus track, a last breath of the primitive conception of noir.The narrative core here is about writing, as with Sunset Boulevard. We have several entities which are responsible for "writing" visually what we see, and fight along the story for being in charge of the facts:.the 'seven vultures', the natives belief. they are responsible, at least we suspect, for the imprisoning of a man, which will motivate the whole 'circus' (or was it pure coincidence? fate?) .Kirk Douglas' character, himself responsible for the report of the whole event, during a good part of the film. He is something of a god as he writes (and invents) everything we get to see. this is interesting because we don't have Douglas as our noir 'detective', someone who is as blind about the events and what's behind them as we usually do in noir constructions. We assume he manipulates everything, even though we suspect he will loose control .The crowd. The circus Douglas called for self-promotion will take over, as a multi-headed monster (or a no-head monster); Douglas allows for this to happen, nevertheless e he lost (emotional) control as he moved along; These three elements alone make our construction. This becomes noir as Douglas becomes victim and not god, and we get to question who is in fact controlling the whole thing. Was it in fact a 'curse' of the Indians, was it something we might call fate (Douglas was running from city to city until ending up in that town with an Indian tomb!). This is not good or influential as the masterpiece Wilder produced the previous year, but it is a good piece. The fact that the detective here becomes a writer and aims at controlling the whole thing hints that those behind this project were aiming at breaking noir and taking it to another level. This wasn't it, it's not an important film, it was even a commercial failure. But it was a good try.My opinion: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I didn't make it cynical enough"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has probably never been a movie from a major director quite like Ace in the Hole. It is a movie of almost unrelenting bleakness and cynicism, lightened only slightly at its outermost margins. It also not only stands up well more than 50 years later, it has a freshness and relevance that comes from an almost uncannily eerie spot on prediction about the future of the role of media in our culture. Wilder notably responded to the initial negative reaction to the film by noting that he did not think he made in cynical enough. In a time of wall-to-wall media coverage of the parentage of Anna Nicole Smith's baby, breathless television commentary on the suit Kobe Bryant wore to a hearing on his rape case or a prosecutor's hairstyle, crowds of gawkers outside of a mine disaster, Ace in the Hole plays with a more harshly realistic light now than it probably did on its initial release.Kirk Douglas gives a tremendous, fearless performance as Chuck Tatum, a newspaper reporter who has fallen off the face of the journalistic globe and who smells the chance to regain his fortune when he stumbles on the story of Leo Minosa, trapped in an old Indian cliff dwelling. Tatum immediately recognizes that he can remake his name on Leo's story, if he can stretch the coverage out long enough. With the connivance of the fame-hungry local sheriff (despicably well played by Ray Teal), Tatum deliberately delays the rescue in order to maximize the story.I have never seen Douglas give a performance quite like this, or in a role like this. In fact, there may not be another role like this in that era. Tatum is almost uncompromisingly nasty and self-serving to everyone; his boss, his coworker, Leo's slatternly wife, and Leo himself. Douglas the movie star disappears completely in this film. It is a masterful performance; any clue that we are watching Kirk Douglas acting would tear the film down.Also wonderful is Jan Sterling as Leo's femme fatale (literally) wife, whose reaction, at first, is that Leo's predicament gives her a head start on leaving him. Later, Tatum convinces her that she can make scads of money of her husband, which she does with tremendous malice - the price to visit the cliff dwelling goes from free to one dollar quite rapidly. Sterling brings a great balance of sexiness and ruthlessness to her role.But the goat of this movie is not just two or three heartless people, it is all of us. As in Frank Cady (Sam Drucker in Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies and Petticoat Junction) who, with his wife, is proudly and fiercely the first of the throng that encamps at the cliff dwelling, and who is not above using his status for his own personal gain; he turns an interview into an advertisement for his insurance business. Leo's predicament draws a huge crowd, including a literal carnival, and other people who are looking to cash in on Leo, most notably a country band hawking the sheet music to their song, "We're Coming Leo." Wilder handles all of this material with his usual straightforward aplomb. Wilder is not one for shots that call attention to themselves, and the unpretentious nature of his direction serves the starkness of the story well. Likewise the script is full of the bitter wit and great lines that grace any Wilder film.But the film has one major failure, and that is the end. Tatum, it turns out, at least belatedly has a heart and isn't the most cynical person in the film, and we get an unnecessary and unlikely attempted murder, a stabbing, comeuppance for the bad guy - all of which seems tacked on and diminishes the film. To me the real end of the movie comes a few minutes earlier, when Tatum announces that Leo had died, and the carnival closes down, the crowds leave and even as the dust begins to settle, we see a long shot of the solitary figure of Leo's lame father, slowly hobbling back to the mountain that still holds the body of his son. That is an unforgettable shot. That ending, with Tatum essentially unredeemed and alive, would serve the movie much better.Still, this bitter, cynical and well-made movie is a great gem, and a fine addition to Wilder's brilliant oeuvre</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having exposed the cynicism of the film industry in "Sunset Boulevard", Billy Wilder turned to the newspaper business in his next assignment "The Big Carnival" (or Ace in the Hole as it was originally called).In his Charlie Tatum, Wilder created one of the most hardened characters in cinema history. Yet as brilliantly interperted by Kirk Douglas, the viewer actually has some feeling for him.Here is a man who had it all threw it away. And when the opportunity to redeem himself comes his way, he plunges to even lower depths.Those depths include playing with a man's life for the sole purpose of rebuilding his own and in the end neither survive.While this is a hard hitting, uncompromising film, it was one of Wilder's few failures. Perhaps journalists who have some power of of a film's life and death in their typewriters, do not want to see themselves portrayed as they were in this film. Still the acting is uniformly great.Douglas sets the standard, Jan Sterling, Robert Arthur, Porter Hall, Richard Benedict and the rest of the great supporting cast compliment him perfectly.Had this film been made in the 70s or 80s it would be revered as it is now. Back in 1951, it was too strong to digest.</fullReview>

Well, it is shot in a classic film-noir style - but the pacing and especially Douglas is full throttle all the time, meaning that by the end his bolt was way spent before the denouement.The tale of a journalist looking for a way back into the big time and looking to a mining cave-in to do it is timeless. However, the film looks more dated than many half a century later due in the main to the very stylized approach.It is hugely watchable, but doesn't quite reach the heights of Wilder's best efforts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even for Billy Wilder...this is pretty Billy Wilder.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Such is the mystery of movies; When this movie was released in 1950, it was both a critical and commercial flop. In desperation, the studio tried to rename the movie "The Big Carnival." Were they trying to trick the audience to going to a happy, "Greatest Show on Earth"-type movie? Or were they just taken over by Billy Wilder's trademark cynicism? It doesn't even matter; the movie was still a flop. Lost forever and never released on VHS or DVD in America until July 2007, Ace in the Hole, along with Vertigo and just about any Nicholas Ray movie, gathered a cult following and proved that time was all it needed to be recognized as the masterpiece it always was.Kirk Douglas is hard-shelled reporter Chuck Tatum, fired from just about every big newspaper. Hoping to rebuild his reputation, he grudgingly takes a job at a small newspaper in Albuquerque, where nothing really happens...until a man gets trapped in a mine. Using his wit and cunning, Tatum takes this small-town emergency and transforms it into a media circus before the word was even coined. Part of his strategy includes manipulating the corrupt sheriff into delaying the rescue, which gives the story time to reach all over the country and become a media sensation, a la Baby Jessica, the real-life human interest story of the late 80s. And then, everything goes horribly, horribly wrong.Billy Wilder, as noted above, was well-known for two things: for crafting as many classic movies as Spielberg, Ford, Scorsese, Hawks and Bergman, and his wit and undeniable cynicism. After his classic Sunset Blvd., a scathing tragedy disguised as a black comedy about the Hollywood machine, it didn't seem like Wilder could get any more cynical. That was proved wrong by this movie. Chuck Tatum makes Norma Desmond look like Mary Poppins--throughout the course of the movie, he never grows a heart, and his only mild redemption is realizing that the man's wife is even more acerbic than he is, and through her seeing the empty human being he himself has become. Like all dark Billy Wilder movies, there is absolutely no hope or shining light at the end of his characters' tunnels. All paths lead to death, madness or both. Ace in the Hole is absolutely no exception, and it's for that deep cynicism and pessimism that makes this movie so endearing, so timeless, so contemporary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Billy Wilder's "Ace In The Hole" was released back in 1951 it was not a very popular film. It's reputation was such such that Wilder himself referred to it has his "runt of the litter." While "Stalag 17' from the previous year had been a major hit audiences found nothing upbeat about this entry. It stars Kirk Douglass as a newspaper writer who gets stuck out west doing stories about quaint local events because his reputations proceeds him at the big eastern papers. It seems as if our hero has had a habit of seeking out his publishers' wives for his own purposes.Douglass gets his chance when he runs across a man trapped in a cave in that happens to be in the middle of a sacred Indian burial ground. As the entrapment drags on Douglass gets exclusive rights to the story and manipulates events to catapult his power until the trapped man eventually dies when he could have been rescued. A broken man, Douglass has about the same future now as Walter Neff had in the closing frames of "Double Indemnity." Time has been good to "Ace In The Hole." It's critique of the media has become what we now expect of all news and entertainment sources. We understand and feel for the reporter in a way that was not possible in the 1950's and we are much more likely to root for him. The film was remade in 1997 as "Mad City." Those that are into film noir or classic Hollywood would be advised to take a look at "Ace In The Hole" and from what I have heard the knew Criterion DVD is a great package.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KIRK DOUGLAS was always a dependable actor and occasionally brilliant when he had a good script and a good director. Here he has both, and he's in his element with Billy Wilder's direction making the most of a cynical story of a reporter exploiting human drama for his own benefit.JAN STERLING, as the trapped man's wife, matches Douglas for toughness every step of the way. "I met a lot of hard-boiled eggs in my time," she tells Douglas, whom she sees through with his scheme of profiteering from the accident. "But you're twenty minutes." A few more cynical remarks and he's smacking her across the face twice.No one looks any good, as far as the characters go. The gawkers are shown to be the sort that stare at accidents and are soon turning Sterling's tacky establishment into a gold mine. The cynical screenplay catches all of the nuances of the exploited situation and Douglas comes up with remarks like, "Tomorrow that will be yesterday's news and they'll wrap a fish in it." As the arrogant man who delays the rescue to milk the situation for the most he can get out of it, KIRK DOUGLAS gives a riveting performance as a louse. He never tries to soften the part, nor does director Wilder ever shy away from exposing the hypocrisy at work.Still a very timely story and expose of hypocrisy on several levels by the press and public. RICHARD BENEDICT as the trapped man and ROBERT ARTHUR as a naive young reporter are both excellent in strong supporting roles.Summing up: Brilliant film deserves much more attention than it gets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant film directed by Billy Wilder and starring Kirk Douglas. Hard to describe, better just watch. Mr. Douglas stars as a probable alcoholic newspaperman who milks a story about a man trapped in a cave. You do get the feeling his awareness of human condition (all humans, not just journalists) is what's eating away at him. Jan Sterling is a revelation as the blonde Douglas and Bob Arthur pick up - she has lines like, "I don't go to Church, kneeling bags my nylons." Porter Hall has a great supporting part as a the "Tell The Truth" editor who is first to lap up the lies."Ace in the Hole" is also know as "The Big Carnival" - currently, (in real life) it's called "The Media Circus". The film grows more horrific every year. The parallels to today's "news" are so obvious they almost need no mention - I would only add that today's media circus promoters like the big rescue to occur on a Sunday. ********* Ace in the Hole (6/15/51) Billy Wilder ~ Kirk Douglas, Jan Sterling, Robert Arthur, Porter Hall</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took twenty five years, but when Paddy Chayefsky wrote and scored a critical and popular success with Network it went a long way towards redeeming Billy Wilder and Ace in the Hole from the critical and popular drubbing it took in reviews and at the box office.The cry then was that Wilder was way too cynical and in the height of the superpatriotic McCarthy days maybe he was for that time. Perhaps Kirk Douglas's Charles Tatem would find employment as a writer at UBS for Howard Beale's mad prophet of the air or at Fox News or if your tastes run the other way, scripting one of Michael Moore's documentaries.Kirk Douglas is a veteran reporter who's been fired off a whole lot of newspapers and arrives in Albuquerque looking for a job. Editor Porter Hall after an interesting job interview hires him. Two months later, a bored Douglas and cub reporter Robert Arthur are sent on some nothing story and on the way learn of a man, Richard Benedict, trapped in an old cave with a broken leg. Remembering the real Floyd Collins story from the Twenties about a Kentucky man trapped in a cave for 18 days while America followed every move of the rescue attempt, Douglas smells a return to the big time. With the aid of a corrupt sheriff, Ray Teal, Douglas starts controlling the story and indirectly making the story. Of course things get out of hand.Kirk Douglas has never been afraid of being seen as unlikeable on screen and in Charles Tatem he's at his most unlikeable. In fact until he did There Was A Crooked Man in 1971, I'm not sure he's ever been this big of a canine descendant. He's matched every step of the way by Jan Sterling who plays Benedict's tramp of a wife who wants her cut of the proceedings and takes it out of Douglas literally.Ace in the Hole was made when newspapers still were a major source of news. Televisions were still scarce and I don't think it's an accident that Billy Wilder chose a sparsely populated state like New Mexico as the setting. Television sets in the Rocky Mountain states in 1951 were scarcer than the people.I think Ace in the Hole could be remade today, maybe with Michael Douglas taking over an internet news blog to bring it up to the times. Still Billy Wilder's magical cynical touch would be missing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The great media-circus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is basically a social commentary, or rather said a commentary against the power of the press and the media-hype they can often create out of something so seemingly small and insignificant. Here we have an average man, being stuck in collapsed mine. Kirk Douglas walks in and bombards it to the 'curse of the mountain of the seven vultures', based on some old Indian legend and creates a big media circus out of it when all of the big newspapers and radio-stations gets a smell of it. This is of course still all real relevant today. This present time perhaps even more than was the case back at the time of this movie. It's all rather effective and I can tell what the film-makers tried to achieve with it all but is it all that interesting to watch really? I don't think so and as a movie it therefore falls kind of flat.It tells the story of the Kirk Douglas character, who is a journalist who has basically hit rock bottom due to circumstance and lost his job at all of the big papers and therefore decides to start all over again at a small and insignificant local newspaper, hoping that his big break will come soon again, once he'll get noticed again for his writing and journalism now that he is back at the game. Once this just doesn't happen he smells his chance when he just happens to come across this story of this guy that is stuck in the mine, when he is passing through on his way to cover another far less significant story. He decides to milk the entire story completely dry, which gets himself back in the picture again in the journalistic world. And her lies a bit of a problem for this movie for me. The one moment it feels as if the Kirk Douglas character is doing this all out of sympathy and the other he's just a cold-hearted journalist, doing it all for his own personal gain. It's hard to really get into the character and what to think of him, since the movie its story keeps trowing things around. It's not really pleasant, also really not since when his characters is cold and stubborn he really is cold and stubborn. Can't really say that I blame Kirk Douglas for this, since he is simply being a superb actor in this movie.I'm a big fan of Billy Wilder but I have to say that this is one of his weaker directed movies. It just misses that little edginess and smartness about its subject that for instance a movie like "The Lost Weekend" did had. It's as if he himself did not fully know what direction to head in and what style to apply to it. It's a bit of a bland movie that heads in too many different direction, also with its characters, throughout the movie.But as mentioned earlier the movie is still mostly being effective with its subject, that is quite relevant and shows what's wrong with modern journalism, when all morals are gone and people are doing everything to create and often attempt to control the cause and outcome of their own stories. The movie is just not being told and shot in the best way imaginable. In my opinion still a good- but also a Billy Wilder movie you can easily do without.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They just don't get much more cynical than this film--and unfortunately, it was right on target!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Kirk Douglas' best films, yet oddly it lost money when it was released and is still a relatively overlooked gem. Why it never has caught on with the public is beyond me--perhaps it was just too cynical and people wanted to believe it couldn't be based on truth.Kirk Douglas plays a newspaper man who happens to be out in the middle of nowhere. It just so happens that there is a cave-in nearby and Douglas decides this is exactly the sort of story he can bleed dry AND establish himself. So, this minor little story is soon blown totally out of proportion and the area becomes a huge media circus. The only problem is that soon Douglas finds out that the man trapped inside is already dead, so he struggles with his conscience and his instincts that this STILL can be a top story. Amazingly, when the dead man's widow finds out the truth, she isn't particularly concerned about him--just how she, too, can profit from the media attention! This is a very rich and insightful film--one that is as applicable now as it was then. In an age where minor stories are prostituted by the press (such as when there is ANY car chase in L.A. or when a pretty White woman either disappears or commits a crime), this movie manages to still be very timely and brilliant. Amazing writing, acting and direction--this film has it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daily on the world like that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ace in the hole" (1951) directed by Billy Wilder as movie it is always a tale concerning fake evaluation, that still explains no accomplished rights of survivors dying slowly from a catastrophe that occurs daily in the world like that. And what makes any people angry, when things are going badly and aren't immediately under prevention - before it might have happened - even then when a sensationalist survey for the good it is hysterical and whatsoever is already too late to secure the labor activity. Perhaps barely much more inevitably and a quite hypocritical still, because delaying its unbelievable truth that is also responsible for an inner circle and so that produces a bitter consciousness concerning the social value of every life in danger. Wilder here in this fiction of strength and passionate feelings, gave us almost one of his most interesting movies of the fifties about social values, when economic standards weren't under regular check up by innovation and responsibility from the owners of the wealthy underground. This spectacle in meantime at open air, view from the entirely social landscape around the horizon, it is of great angriness and despair if you understood what it was at stake here, as inhuman conception of such a sensationalism in the press like a fairly day of payment in a given mine from the beginning of the colonization. Seemingly, director Wilder as Austrian of gem put some irresponsible carnival as being his own style of making a portrait of the collective stupidity, in a time where others were searched by another motivation than greed and cupidity either that it were such as mere items. The cars driven around as in a kind of a caravan's race, going away from the place of all dangers, for the deaths as in the time of Indians, it is as scene showing us there as in an ambulant circus the speed of their drivers, after the news boom was finished for the bad. If it is the truth, it is too with a flavor of ashes of the dust covering the landscape sharply. Possibly getting out any adversity against this kind of running away, for confounding country people about the aim of this speculative event of a retainment of a death, for nothing more than selling its result surely not on the front page of the sensationalist paper. Faith, speculation, business, promotion, all linked with such a happening in a cavern near the frontier of desert, when a man is imprisoned there by the legs and his wife and parents or relatives seemingly entering in such affair for earning something else with this fatality for the communication at the scale of the entirely country, making a deal to sustain the attention of all people hearing the direct broadcast of this epiphenomena of disproportionated size as diversion for keeping in touch with mediocrity for learning nothing than cynicism and hypocrisy. Wilder in his plot gave us the devolution of such a black hole of tiny and reduced importance in news as social panic, for revealing the nature of anyone before the chance of improvisation and bad instincts for social help on the spot of confusion, all that for earning money to increase the prosperity of a few characters there at expense of a victim of popular mind and crazy conscience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tremendous Billy Wilder satire reflecting the darkest side of a human being</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say this is one hell of a satire, much more close to Sunset Blvd than Billy Wilder's comedies. The story is engrossing. No scene where did I find it boring. The satire reflects a frightening darkest side of human being. In this case, a reporter (played by Kirk Douglas) who would manipulate for his personal gain a person (played by Richard Benedict) trapped in a mining disaster.I thought the cast performance was exceptional starting with Kirk Douglas. Kirk Douglas is quite an expert in playing a selfish and manipulative person, much like his film producer role in The Bad and the Beautiful. I am wondering if his these kinds of roles have great influence on his son Michael Douglas' Oscar winning role in Wall Street. The wife of the trapped person was played by Jan Sterling. She was fantastic, especially those tension moments in the scenes between her Kirk Douglas. That slapping scene was top notch in the change of facial expression from admiration to shock.I say the utmost credit has to go to the screen writing. Billy Wilder really can write slick quotes. When the role Jan Sterling was about to abandon her miserable life instead of taking advantage of her husband's disaster, Kirk Douglas' role said something like "When they bleached your hair, they must have bleached your brain too" It is amazing that a great movie like this one never appeared in any video medium until the Criterion DVD release. I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a cynical and absorbing look at the relevance of a hard-boiled journalism and humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ace in the Hole's main character, Chuck Tatum (a classic turn from Kirk Douglas), creates all his own problems for a glory that, as for any addict, is practically unattainable. This is because for all of his pontificating about the greatness of 'human interest' stories, if it'll suit him the story can go on for much longer than it needs to for the people in it. There's a very strong current throughout the picture about what the value of life is, not just for Tatum but for everyone involved, from the practical journalists on both sides (the honest Albaquerque press-man who hates what Tatum is doing in delaying it, to the other press people who hate that Tatum is trying to take all the credit), to the hordes of bystanders who turn the outside of the cave where trapped Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) is on his last breath into an amusement park, to even his own conflicted wife (Sterling), who isn'ty sure if she even loves him anymore. By the end, it becomes a desperate twist of fate for Tatum, and it ends up all boiling down to something that is very (and frighteningly) relevant for today.Billy Wilder makes this such an unflinching tale of greed and the now given "media circus", and he does an excellent job in not making Tatum much at all sympathetic. This is important because it allows Douglas the room to make his interpretation so full-bodied and red-blooded that he almost resembles the doomed lead in an Aesop fable. He's a 2nd-level writer who's been kicked out of one major newspaper after another, landing in a little blip on the map like Albaquerque, driving along with his young co-reporter to a Rattlesnake convention or other. Then he comes upon poor Minosa, stuck in a mine with little air and no supplies. He jumps on the chance to make it not only a big news story, but *his* news story. Douglas takes Tatum on for all he's worth, in a performance that marks him as something quite different from the character he would play in Paths of Glory- self-interested and with so much pride and confidence-edging-and-over-arrogance, and even makes him true to form as he goes back and forth on trying to do the right thing (bring the man a priest, why not), and to save his own hide. Probably one of Wilder's best chances to take was Douglas in the role- a role that is established in a perfect opening shot of Tatum in the driver side of his car, being towed right up to the newspaper office. But it's not the only bright spot for Wilder. He's got a strong sense of how to capture all of the scenes, particularly the claustrophobic mine scenes with Minosa- sometimes with the trapped man huffing away as the most honest character in the film- and the shots showing the expansiveness of the 'circus', with the small rest-stop loaded with people all into the hype and riding the ferris wheel. Wilder isn't necessarily doing a full-on film-noir like Double Indemnity or Sunset Boulevard (also very dark and bleak in view of humanity at large and small scopes), but it has that feeling in many scenes, of an atmosphere of mounting dread, corruptible law (the Sheriff, played by Ray Teal, is a personification of the truly despicable and dumbest officer) and without much of a happy ending. It's even been considered to be Wilder's bleakest and least commercial film, and it's not an unfair consideration. But it's also drama of the highest caliber, where a lesson that's made isn't crammed down the viewer's head but is surrounded by characters that could just as easily be around in today's media environment. It's almost prophetic in detailing the tediousness and lack of real human connectivity in such "human interest" stories, particularly those lacking a happy ending. One of the best, and most underrated of all, films of 1951.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The essence of the American Spirit toned down by the Hayes Code</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about the harsh reality behind the glamor of the "American Dream". It's like a punch in the face, it shows all the rudeness and ugliness of the life behind the billboard. As long as "American Beauty" shows the stagnating waters of the rich upper middle class, this is about the road to that calm suburbs home. It's about (at that time) growth of the spirit of good presentation and about having the nerve to ask for what you want without caring if you have the means of supporting your claims or on how many bodies you will have to step over. It's about having respect for nothing be it God (the woman praying) or a plain human (the Ace in the Hole). It's about the uselessness of having an education as long as you bring results. Personal improvements mean nothing if there is no profit tag attached. And even if you do go to school, there must be about something practical, about something recent as anything beyond your birth date is down right irrelevant. Sure, that reference to the real case which this story is based upon also points to the reality of this story, but also to the hollow image of the schooling system. And on these theme there will be another great story - Blackboard Jungle - in just about four years. It's about making the school (the last bastion of knowledge) as shallow and money oriented as the rest of the society. The "it has always been like this" of the 21st century was back in 1951 the shock of "how did we get so far?".Also you have preeminently figured the cigarettes. You can smoke everywhere, and both good guys and bad guys do it. Now alcohol is a different story, only the bad guys do it and only when they are really bad.Bottom line, this movie makes useless feeble attempts to recreate the story along a milder storyline. I'd take Costa-Gavras' Mad City for example. It might look like a good try for those who did not see Ace in the Hole. Bored, shallow, badly acted (at least for what's expected from the Mad City cast), this movie does not have the guts to point out the finger at the audience. You don't get to see the participants at the circus, you don't get to meet them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder &amp; Douglas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ace in the Hole (1951) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Billy Wilder's dark comedy about a hot-shot reporter (Kirk Douglas) who has fallen on hard times but gets his shot back at the top when he fabricates a story about a trapped miner, which turns into a media circus. There's a lot to admire about this film but I still found a few problems, which I comment on first. I think the film makes the mistake of making the carnival a tad bit too big. I think the point is well received but the screenplay goes a bit too far in beating the viewer over the head with its message about telling the truth. I think we get beaten over the head a tad bit too much that it becomes rather obvious what's going to happen in the end. With that said, this is still a very impressive film that certainly has a lot going for it. The direction by Wilder is excellent throughout and he really sells the comedy hidden within the darkness of the story and characters. He also comes up with some very beautiful shots including the terrific stuff inside the mine where we see the trapped miner looking up through a small hole to communicate with Douglas. As for Douglas, he turns in another terrific performance and I think I say that after each new film I watch of his. That crazed intensity he brings to his characters is something that no other actor could do and I think that's what makes him so great. The supporting cast is equally impressive with Jan Sterling being a standout as the miner's wife. Richard Benedict also really stands out as the trapped miner and his role and performance gives what little heart the film has in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kirk Douglas was Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film about a newspaper reporter who burned himself out in New York City with lots of boozing and fooling around with plenty of women. This reporter is Chuck Tatum, (Kirk Douglas) who comes to town in Albuquerque, New Mexico in a tow truck after all his tires blew out. Chuck seeks employment from a local Albuquerque Newspaper and manages to get a position on the paper. Chuck gets a big assignment to cover a rattlesnake convention but finds a more interesting story about the cave in of a mine which traps Leo Minosa,(Richard Benedict). Chuck knows from past experience that this will make a great story and he contacts all the right connections for a doctor, construction engineers and the local sheriff. Lorraine Minosa,(Jan Sterling) is the wife of Leo and is really bored with her marriage and Lorraine becomes interested in Chuck Tatum. This entire event brings a media circus to this New Mexico story. This is a film that will capture your attention from the very beginning to the very end, there is some very serious signs of violence and romance. This is a great Kirk Douglas film who gave an outstanding performance along with Jan Sterling who was very sexy and also a very tough and rough gal.</fullReview>

This film didn't do well when first released, which I was surprised to have found out, but it got well received over the years and it is now seen as the masterpiece it truly is. Kirk Douglas gives yet another electrifying performance as a journalist who trys to milk the story of a man trapped in a cave in. I am not going to give any anything. you truly do have to watch this movie. It is EXCELLENT!!!!Kirk wasn't even nominated for an Oscar but he sure should have been!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:I am not a Billy Wilder fan. Stalog 17 was a painful watch with just a few good scenes. This is his best movie by a mile. This is the movie Network wanted to be; how good is this movie? You will never look at journalists ever the same again. This was made in the ascendant 50s not the decadent 21st century. Today, Douglas would have slept like a baby. There are no morals here. What he does to that man trapped in the mine for some ratings, money and fame. As the movie progresses, his disciple, the photographer grows more and more disillusioned with his role model. He knows, at the end, when he flees the mine that he killed that man as much as if he shot him. Wilder paints a picture of humanity very evocative of Kubrick. It is not a pretty picture; you will think of the Kubrick parts of A.I. the Flesh Farm. It is a circus of humans that you see relived every day by the crowd of ghouls around every auto accident. Here you have the hilarious juxtaposition of putative, religious, well wishers hiding from themselves the monsters they are. Wilder spends as much film time on the corrupt sheriff, the disgusting media circus, and the worthless, faithless wife who cannot wait for him to die in the mine.Some of the most heartbreaking scenes are when the trapped guy worries to Douglas over the welfare of his tramp wife. Watch the repressed anguish in Kirk's face, he finally snaps on her and gets inadvertently killed for she is even more ruthless than he is. I could not believe this was a Billy Wilder movie. It is such a great film; the acting, writing and directing could not be better. As I said, the depiction of human nature is on the level of Stanley Kubrick. Douglas chews up the scenery oozing resentment at being relegated to some back woods piece of crap town. He is sniffing about for tragedy and suffering like the giant vulture he always was. He seizes upon the trapped man in the mine and does everything he can to keep him there until he can squeeze as much power and ratings as he possibly can. Like I said, if you found Network painfully too literary with words only authors use coupled with stupid soap opera relationships utterly irrelevant to the main theme: this is the movie for you. It is very down to earth, thankfully devoid of trying to impress us with its knowledge of a thesaurus. It is a hidden gem I had not seen before; yes, it is a Criterion Collection pricey Blu Ray or DVD. Be warned, if you buy the DVD, get ready to curse and yell. You need explosives to get it out of their stupid box. I was reenacting that Larry David episode. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. It is everything that Network wanted to be and failed. It gets slow, just in parts, but it moves like lightning compared to that overrated behemoth. The best thing is to see journalists as the slugs that they are; it always is about them and their glorification and personal wealth. A Great Movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big names but you will like nobody!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kirk Douglas stars as Chuck Tatum, a disgraced newspaper journalist who after being sacked from many top American newspapers can only find employment at a small daily paper in Albuquerque, New Mexico.He continues working for the small time paper despite there being no challenge or news of any interest; this is until the opportunity arises for him to exploit the story of a man trapped in an Indian cliff dwelling.Tatum's eagerness for his big-break story, the one that could drive him back to his A-list journalistic career is an accurate display of how the corrupt media circus works. The scandal-hungry newspaper is portrayed through the exploitation of a life-threatened man.The film stars famous names but has an absence of likable characters or heroes. Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict) is trapped in the Indian cave, however this is due to his greed and disrespect of the local tribes. Jan Sterling plays Mrs Minosa, the money-grabbing wife who shows no dismay at her husband deteriorating condition.Jan Sterling, although her character's role is heartless, gives a performance that is nothing more than ordinary. In contrast Kirk Douglas suits the role he plays perfectly, his appearance and manner gives a real feel to his part, allowing the audience to forget he is acting unlike the unrealistic Sterling. Douglas out acts everyone else on camera.The language used matches the shooting style and black and white element of the film. The film uses Billy Wilder's trademark language which combines brilliantly with Douglas's sarcastic nature and cockiness shown in the film.The film has a combination of hard-hitting scenes, none more than the scene in which Leo Minosa's death seems imminent. However, it is hard to feel sorry for any of the characters, due to their ignorance and attitudes. Some witty lines are used adding relief to some long-winded scenes. The ending is predictable and an anti-climax.</fullReview>

As the film goes on, it settles down to become very long and dull with no pace.Apart from the melodramatic Mr. Tatum (Douglas), most of the characters are very unlikable and have no personality even the wife of the entombed `Leo' Mrs. Minosa.</fullReview>
