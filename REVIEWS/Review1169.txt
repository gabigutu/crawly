		<fullReview>We thoroughly enjoyed this production. Released today, we saw the matinée and were somewhat surprised at being what seemed like the youngest couple attending. You will not be disappointed with this movie. Watching a familiar story, you're waiting for unexpected items or things just plain screwed up. It didn't feel way, and while there are some plot topics that were different from my expectations, I was not bothered by them.Going to this movie my thoughts were, 1) would a 21st century version make the chariot race be more violent than necessary?, 2) would the faith portion of the story be erased down to a minor thought? 3) would I recognize the story at all? Answers in a simple style are the circus race had me close my eyes a couple of times -- I'm old enough to know how dangerous these races could become, and faith portion was well done and not overplayed presenting the truth of Jesus' life during this period, and the story was well familiar and my wife commented that portions were actually clearer than we had understood from previous versions. So well done! Comparisons: Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ is an 1880 American best selling novel. It has been a play and movie multiple times. I found the 1925 silent version of the same title a very impressive production. The 1959 movie "Ben-Hur" is the version most people are familiar with but at 3.5hrs you'll want to find a complete copy of this (and it's one my favourite movies). The '59 movie has more story than today's and the action sequences are somewhat more simplified but very impressive. This Charlton Heston version won 11 Oscars and will be the version of most people's thoughts.With Morgan Freeman being the only performer I was familiar with, Ben-Hur is great having fresh faces, amazing Italian country sides, and a well paced showing. Go and see this, and find one or two of the other movie versions and maybe the book as well -- so you can make your own comparisons. My wife believes this may now be her favourite, and I'm still committed to the 1959 version. I believe there's enough room for both versions to be enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last time I watched the Ben-Hur with Charlton Heston the thought did not cross my mind that perhaps the world needed another version of the story directed by the guy who brought us Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and that weird movie where they make bullets bend. Anyway, the Heston version is one of my favorite movies. I saw it when I was 8 and two times when I was about 20. I love it and quote it all the time. But this is not a review of that version because (surprise!) it is not that version. This is a review of the 2016 version and I don't feel it is fair to give this movie a bad rating simply because it was an unnecessary remake. In case you are wondering, this is the sixth version of Ben-Hur.The story follows Judah Ben-Hur, a Jewish prince in Jerusalem at the time of Christ, and his adopted Roman brother Massala. They love each other but they get in the middle of an attempted assassination on a Roman leader and wind up on opposing sides. They both feel they are in the right, get in a very sticky situation, and thus begins an 5 year journey of survival, revenge, forgiveness.I liked the movie. The chariot race was thrilling. I was worried about it because the trailer showed a scene which an obvious CGI horse running through the stands. To my delight that was the only part that really used a CGI horse (that I could tell, anyway). The rest of the race was intense even though I already knew how it was going to end.The movie focuses very heavily on the relationship between Massala and Judah as well as Massala and the rest of the Hur family. Massala's intentions and actions were understandable and he wasn't just some evil man who betrayed his family.The main actors and actresses do a good (not great) job. I felt Morgan Freeman may have phoned it in a little, but he delivered one of my favorite lines of the movie. My favorite actors were the slave drivers on the galley along with the drummer. They have small roles but I loved them.I didn't care for the Jesus scenes though. He is a hard character to portray, and I just didn't like it when he spoke. I'm probably picky, but I would have preferred to hear him speak in King James English or not at all (like in the Heston version). I just felt something was off with the scenes and they could have been more powerful.Overall, I felt it was a pretty good movie that succeeds in many aspects chiefly with the themes of revenge/forgiveness and delivers one exciting race. It's not perfect but a good movie overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, compelling, and realistic take on a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The classic 1959 Charlton Heston version is the one I and the rest of the baby boomers grew up on and it remains one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time. But I was very impressed by the 2016 remake. Gone is the stilted dialogue and "holy look" (as Victor Mature described it) of the old time biblical epics. The 2016 version has a bold take on the classic and a fresh approach to the story. It surpasses the 1959 version in originality, imagination, and devotion to detail. The Roman legion is shown in all its scope, strength, and ruthless brutality. The character of Jesus has a prominent role, whereas in the classic version, he never spoke nor did we see his face. With anti Christian sentiment on the rise in the entertainment industry, I wonder if the negative reviews written about this film reflect the agenda driven bias of the critics. The sea battle was spectacular and far surpassed the 1959 version. The epic chariot race was a wonderful homage to the Heston version, complete with the awe inspiring stadium built into living rock and with giant statues in the middle of the track. The race itself rivals the classic one in intensity and imagination. Terrific movie, great acting, and intense realism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Not so much of a spoiler, but read at you're own risk). It seems everyone was looking for another embodiment of Charlton Heston, but failed to see the other potential this actor (Jack Huston) brought to the screen in his role. I felt the movie still had the same greatness as it did in the original film of 1959. The story line is so profound in more ways than one and it still kept the Christian values and aspects alive the same way it did back then. Now if I can compare this movie along with Noah (which was based on fact. Only the creators screwed the facts up terribly as if they had just picked up the bible for the first time and decided to move some things around),this movie definitely is a 10 star movie!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is apparent that those who have given this movie a poor rating are among those who do not understand the story of Ben Hur. This version, like those of the past was a depiction of a wealthy Jew who had everything; lost everything, and then through his faith regained far more than he ever had; faith, hope, love and mostly forgiveness. And it was beautifully depicted; kudos and many thanks to Mark Burnett and Roma Downey. I was particularly impressed that relatively unknown actors were chosen so that we could see the characters without the prejudgement that comes with more recognizable actors. Those who went to see this movie to find out who won a chariot race were as lost as Ben Hur was when at his lowest point. That is not a criticism; that just makes me sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>actually pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't really going to write a review but when I saw all the hate this movie was getting -I couldn't help myself and thought that this movie deserved some justice... I can understand that fans of the original movie aren't pleased- I guess they feel like seeing a book they really like getting butchered on screen- but in this case I don't think that happened. I came with low expectations and actually quite enjoyed it! The visuals were amazing-I'm an archaeology buff- roman to be specific and I think that for the first time in a long time I really felt immersed and got excited from seeing stuff I usually see in a museum come to life- The hippodrome was amazing!! And so were the costumes and the sets. In short the art director is a genius. And I finally feel that they got the look of Jerusalem almost right- at least the best version of Jerusalem on screen I've ever seen. (Kingdom of heaven's Jerusalem was awful). As for the characters they were likable- and I did find myself caring for them and being moved at the end. (All though I'm not sure I liked Jesus in it.. His portrayal made things slightly cheesy.. But not too bad.In short... I think it's pretty good and stands on it's own and should be given a chance-especially since some part of me felt the honest need to defend it- and that doesn't happen a lot..And I do actually want to see this movie again :) Sorry that I didn't put further details- but you know- spoilers... Plus I'm sure that all the other reviewers already have..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie - very well made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new "BEN-HUR" motion picture is truly an exceptionally well-made movie. We enjoyed it very much. For me personally it was one of the best movie releases in years. Earlier in the year I was somewhat disappointed with "Risen" but the redemption definitely came now with "Ben-Hur". I found this new version much better than the original version with Charlton Heston from 57 years ago.The acting had some great performances and it was engaging. Next to the nail-biting action scenes and the history of the era (28-33 A.D.) we're also touched by the spiritual connotation of that particular time period. This film has such themes as personal sacrifice, humility, redemption and forgiveness masterfully interwoven. I'll watch it again in the theater next week which I rarely ever do to watch a movie twice in the cinema, but this film was very impressive and most certainly I'll reserve my Blu-ray disc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huston Did a Beautiful Work of This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Huston conveyed emotion, remorse, rage, resignation and relief with depth and the effortlessness of truth: each won by long years of pain or the grace of an instant. A sort of well, dare I say 'goodness' seems to emanate from the man. He is blithely naive, callow, filled with talent and care for his fellow man and beasts. A mantle of grace rests upon him....you can feel it.I would give his performance 10 stars. In fact, I do.The film, however...I do not like the inclusion of contemporary music in historical settings. It grates at the suspension of disbelief required to be lost in the time and place being brought to life. It holds the entire narrative up against a shadow puppet screen and says 'remember, this isn't real.' That's not what I want. Contemporary music plays at the close of the film, I recall.Also, the costuming.... they didn't get away with the use of polyester fabrics ~ particularly with metallic elements. They could be seen and were glaring anachronisms, particularly in the women's clothing and in the beginning scenes. Again, jarring to one wishing to believe he is indeed looking upon the time roughly corresponding with the beginning of our calendar system. The costuming recovers, however. Huston's tunics and attire are flawless. But what about Freeman's Tuareg clothing? Was he a Moor? A Tuareg? An Amazight? They might have made it more clear which sort of African he represented.The film is worth seeing. It is stirring. It touches the depths of suffering and sorrow and leaves an impression if not a few tears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do I do this to myself ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One often wonders why I continue to exchange my time of life and my hard earned cash to drive to a theater to pay exorbitant or confiscatory prices so that overpaid actors , directors and other assorted persons involved in the production of cinema can continue to grow rich sucking the wealth of their victims while foisting trash on the screen. I know the the 1959 version was a remake itself but this remake of that remake shows that film makers of today have very little if any originality to add to the screen. The producers would have been better off remastering and cleaning up one of the prints from 1959 and releasing that. At least then one would have gotten a film that was worth driving to the local cinema to see. This effort stands out as an example of why people do not flock to the theater to see the trash Hollywood sends out these days, that is those of us who still have an independent thought in our heads. For those mindless individuals who still live in mommies house and can not wait to go see the latest trash it really does matter what they put out does it ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better than Reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just came from the theater having seen "Ben-Hur" tonight, and I found it to be much better than the reviews (the film has a 27% rating on Rotten Tomatoes at the time of this review). Read on to find out why this film is not that bad.First things first, if you're not familiar with "Ben-Hur", this is a movie that is based on a historical fiction novel that incorporates the crucifixion of Jesus into its tale. The main story is a completely fictitious tale that focuses on a pair of brothers, one a Jewish prince, the other an adopted brother who joins the Roman Imperial army. The plot circles around the dramatic sibling rivalry that unfolds between these two family members, and the various episodes that the family goes through as a result of events related to that rivalry. None of that story has any biblical basis whatsoever-- but peppered throughout the story the family has run ins with Jesus, and ultimately he is crucified about the same time as the climax of the film, and (tiny spoiler coming up here.......) the crucifixion ultimately inspires reconciliation amongst the two brothers.Again, this is all based on a novel. The story is what it is, and is drawn from a work of fiction that was quite popular as a book before it ever became a popular film. That book was first made into a silent film in the 1920's, and then was turned into the classic Charlton Heston movie in 1956, for which the latter won the Oscar for Best Picture.Having said all that, this 2016 film is the latest attempt at bringing the book to the silver screen, and I myself found it to do its job quite well. One can make what they will of whether or not they like the book or the plot of the movie--there's certainly much that could be said about that. The book's subtitled "A Tale of the Christ", and so it obviously is written for and marketed to a Christian audience, and the overall message is overtly Christian oriented. Obviously one's faith perspective will therefore influence what one makes of this film, and even if one is a Christian there's nevertheless room for criticism of whether one may or may not like the plot of the film. I personally am reviewing the movie less for whether or not I liked its message or its plot, and more so as to whether it was a well made film. Based purely on that criteria, I'm giving this movie 8/10 stars. I've seen the Charlton Heston version some years ago, and I liked it okay--but not being familiar with the story at the time, I found that movie a bit hard to follow. The 1956 version was great for its time, but compared to modern movies it pales in comparison in the storytelling department. This 2016 remake does much better in that regard, and I found the story easy to keep up with--and it also arguably does a better job of expressing its religious message, since the tiny bits of the film that feature Jesus early on in the script are more overt in this movie than the Charlton Heston film.I also found the film to be well made overall, with good acting and extremely well done special effects and appropriate costume design.Now, let's talk about the chariot race. The truth of the matter is that the 1956 version of this film was significant just as much because of the chariot race as anything to do with its religious message. Sure, "Ben-Hur" is an overtly Christian movie--but nothing like the chariot race scene had ever been done in film making at that point. That scene set the standard for modern movie making for a generation to come. So how does the suspense and drama of the 2016 film stand up to the 1956 chariot race? Well, obviously we live in a different day and age today, and as such the effects of the race could easily be reduced to just another dramatic CGI effects scene akin to a great many movies even in the ancient genre--"300" and "Noah" come to mind.Still, I found the chariot race scene to be very well done, and done in a way that was both period appropriate but also made for modern audiences. Indeed, there's a bit of gore involved here-- albeit "gore" may not be the right word. The scene is far from a Tarantino movie, but there's definitely some intense moments in the course of the race, with several wrecks and both humans and animals left for dead along the way. But, in my view, it told the story it had to tell quite well.All in all, I'm giving this movie 8/10 stars. Just as was the case with the Heston version of this movie, I think that there are better stories out there and better movies to watch, even in the intentionally Christian genre. Still, this is far from a bad movie. It's well made, has good acting, and the religious element certainly is presented in a way that exhibits a redemptive theology as opposed to the more negative portrayal of Christian theology that films sometimes embrace. Indeed, I would have to say that I found this to be the more enjoyable of the two films--Heston's chariot race notwithstanding. I'd say most people can find something to appreciate here unless you're just overtly against all things Christianity. And even then, you still should see this movie, or the 1956 version, simply due to its place in popular culture over the course of the last 100 years or so.So, yeah. Very good movie. 8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me point out that this movie is unfairly labeled a remake of the 1959 film. It is based on a book so it is an adaptation not a remake. Do not be put off by reviews who say remake because chances are they are unfairly comparing the 1950 to this one. I don't really like comparing this version with the 1959 because I see it as separate. However there are things I'm going to discuss that shows the difference between the two films and the book. OK. now for the review and there will be SPOILERS so keep that in mind. I think that there are things that could have been done better (I'll get to that in a minute) but all in all this was a good movie and I love that if you can say that it has a theme the theme is forgiveness rather then revenge. In this way this version is better then the 1959 version. It also could have been really cheesy but I think it was handled rather well I'm also glad to say the chariot race was awesome and I'm very glad that they didn't use CGI except when necessary. the sea battle was kind of cool but the camera work made me a little sick. The whole cast did a good job (although I like Hugh Griffith's Sheik Ilderim better). Rodrigo Santoro was awesome as Jesus and though he was in it more then in the 1959 version I wished he was in it even more. Judah's and Esther's relationship seemed kind of rushed but I like that they are married when everything goes to hell in a hand basket. I'm not sure how I feel about the Ben Hur family getting in trouble because of a young zealot instead of an accident so I guess I'll wait till I can hear the commentary to judge. the transition from the garden of Gethsemane to Jesus walking, to Judah arriving at the crucifixion needed to be smoother. Both films needed to make it more obvious that Judah becomes a believer in Jesus but this one needed it more so. I have to say I did not like what they did with Quintus Arius. In this version they don't even say his name so they might as well not have had him and they made him an asshole and instead of rescuing him Judah sees him holding on to his oar and so he flicks the oar so that Quintus Arius falls into the water and most likely drowns. The character of Quintus Arius is a big part of the story. Judah needs his home in Rome and the wealth being the adopted son of Quintus Arius gave him and Judah killing him does not go well with the theme of forgiveness and saving Quintus Arius would have been in line with Jesus saying "you do the same" after he gives Judah water. and I love his and Judah's relationship and so they really needed to have kept that. They also shouldn't have killed Simonides. I love his loyalty and again Judah needs the money he saved for him. I also didn't like how it ended because it ended like there could be a sequel and I was left wondering why did they leave Jerusalem with Sheik Ilderim and The book and the 1959 leaves you feeling satisfied but this version leaves you wondering what happened next did Messala ever become a believer and did he marry Tirzah?(another thing I have mixed feelings about) what happened to them afterwards? now some nit picky things. Even if taking God's name in vain was a thing back then (which it wasn't in the way it's used in the movie) no Jew would do it and it seems unlikely that a female horse would be used a chariot racer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding depiction of faith as well as excitement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of a few cinematic presentations based on Lew Wallace's novel of the same name, a story about a fictitious man who met Christ. (The first one was in 1925 which starred Francis X. Bushman, the second one won the Best Picture Award of 1959 which was quite a spectacle which, in turn, starred Charlton Heston, and then there's this one.) Jack Huston, though not well-known, was excellent in the title role. Morgan Freeman, probably the best-known of the cast, acted the part of Ilderim well. There were graphic parts in the movie, such as the Romans marching loudly through the streets of Jerusalem, the chariot race, and then Jesus hanging on the cross while his blood was running down from him. And yet, on a personal note, this movie had a great effect on me. The one thing I didn't like was that there was not, as there was in the book and the 1959 movie, the depiction of the nativity there in Bethlehem. But still, the movie had a great effect on me. It had a surprisingly upbeat ending. A wonderful movie in so many ways. No doubt Paramount and M-G-M are so very happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben-Hur : Of Remakes, Revenue and Redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I type this, it's been just over 5 hours since I saw Ben Hur (2016) at the movies and I want to review it while all is fresh in my mind.Yes, I knew all about the only $11 million + take for a $100 million dollar production but I wanted to see it for myself and not base my decision for attending on that.Well, after watching it for 2 hours, I can tell all of you out there,it is only a 'financial' bomb and not any other kind. (Even the great, "It's A Wonderful Life" failed at the box office but it's become a classic.) Happy to say, despite the bleak box office, it wasn't empty where I saw it. Along with fellow patrons, I was 'literally' (no exaggerating here) on the edge of my seat. Not just during the chariot race (which I'm glad wasn't "all" CGI) but the whole movie. I'll give that the opening horse race between the 2 brothers reminded me of the start of "Prince Of Egypt" but it's too nitpicking a detail to lower my rating.Judah Ben Hur being a more down to earth person made it very interesting to watch. Of course it's not like Charlton Heston...then again, why would or should it be? Huston is his own person and his own kind of actor and 'his' portrayal of Ben Hur belongs to him, just as Heston's "Ben Hur" in 1959. Ben Hur's 'odyssey' (for want of a better word) is. from the moment his adoptive brother leaves, told in every bit of emotion, action and effort. Not just from Huston, but from all major &amp; minor characters here. Some complain of the actor who played Jesus. 'Jesus wasn't very interesting.' Which goes to show, they do not understand what kind of person or maybe even 'being' Jesus was supposed to have been. Morgan Freeman is (and never fails to be in serious roles)mesmerizing,as well as simply being almost impossible not to pay attention too and hang onto the words of his best lines of dialog.Along with his narration, he brings that wonderfully nameless ingredient that makes up his acting style. This is not an action movie or any other kind of 'big summer box office' film. It's a story about a man who, in protecting another, is made to suffer for his humanity &amp; beliefs and yet somehow survive and find redemption in the end.The chariot race is all but a small, yet nearly deadly, part of that journey. That race, in whichever version, is iconic.....but it's not the 'whole' of the entire work. The chariot race here just as much as the 1959 race (or the other remakes) was a nail biter, despite knowing the outcome. It's not about trying to 'top' that race or the Oscar Winner...NO ONE will ever do that. I do know, it 'is' possible to remake a Best Picture.The question is: "Do studios want to make a work of art or do they just want to cash in, on a known entity? If answer #2 is the reply, then they're destined to fail. This 'Ben Hur', artistically and emotionally, IS powerful movie making on all counts. In that light, it's a success. So, I've no doubt Ben Hur (2016) will be a favorite of many for along time, just for that reason alone. #1 one at the box-office or not. 10 stars ladies and gentlemen. Please don't let the box office take stop you from seeing this movie. In the theater or on DVD. (END)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than a lot of Reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am starting to question why I even read Reviews before I go to a movie anymore. Ben- Hur was no different and I went in quite skeptical; based on a number of critical takes. I gave it a 9 because it was a really well done movie. I have seen the original and really liked it. But I took this version no different than any other remake I have seen through the years. I am a huge Spider-Man fan and we are at remake number 3, and I view each one like I would any other movie - a remake shouldn't be an exact duplicate of the original - otherwise I would just stick with the original version and not waste my time. The 2016 version of Ben-Hur is done in 3-D, capitalizes on modern technology (cinematography- wise) and keeps the main storyline. Yes, it takes a few liberties with the original story - but viewed by itself it is a really well done movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic of forgiveness: A heartfelt/powerful journey from survival to the glory of the chariot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen it five times already! And I still curl up in my seat and grip my knees during the galley sequence...And I still rich out for my Kleenex at the end! oh my!! So the main writer, Keith Clarke (The Way Back), wanted to retell our beloved classic Ben-Hur: a story of forgiveness. Thank you Hollywood for bringing us a refreshed and updated version of this cinematic jewel of action, drama, and historical fiction. 100$ million dollars to create this wonderful film? Thank you!The wonderful: It's exciting, inspiring, and touching!I had chills and bit my nails...I could feel the sweat from rowing, rowing, rowing in the roman galley; I could feel the breath of the horses and their churning muscles on the arena and the flying dust; I could smell the stench of the Roman Galley on fire. I gasped for air as Huston tried to unchain himself and survive amid st a floating rigging and broken sails...And the romantic moments -- that tingly sweet pomegranate scene...lovely and enchanting. And so many more sensory moments! Beautiful rhythm of scenes: the parallels and foreshadowing work in harmony throughout.Entertaining action!! Lots of energy. From the start this film grabs your emotions. The full throttle force of the chariot is foreshadowed in the opening sequence - the love and rivalry of two brothers on horseback sets the pace for the story. Then from a happily-ever-after family life of Ben Hur and his brother and family, two events change their status quo: Massala's decision to explore his roman heritage and the arrival of a young man who is enemy of Rome. Here is when Ben Hur must grow into a warrior and know how to outlive his enemy...The director, Timur, brings us up close and personal with the human side of the story and all its action. First, he makes sure we love these characters: the connection between Judah Ben Hur and his roman adopted brother Massala. We get to see their every day life and their romantic desires and learn of their dreams. Then Massala rebels, tragedy strikes, chaos burns, and it changes Ben Hur's life forever. I love the sequences that that shows Ben Hur's transformation: from a Jewish prince to a prisoner--from prisoner to hero--from hero to survivor--from survivor to a chariot warrior--and then, the circle of the heart. Huston plays a powerful and evocative role as Ben Hur. Ben Hur's journey is touched briefly by the presence of Jesus of Nazareth and the counsel of his beloved wife. But ultimately, fate and the African Prince-- Morgan Freeman, will take him to the triumph of the chariots. I loved the roman ship/slaves sequence - stunning and immediate; the becoming of Ben Hur the charioteer; the confrontational scenes with Massala; and the climatic sequence--Ben Hur's final transformation and completion of the journey of his heart...breathtaking! I broke up in a sob in that last sequence!!Authentic, brilliant acting! Huston, a fresh Ben Hur! Not a Charlton Heston at all, but a very unique, gentleman-like and charismatic Jack Huston! Toby Kebbell is a perfect roman soldier and Santoro makes a compassionate Jesus: fantastic performances! And of course the amazing presence and witty remarks of Morgan Freeman. Pilou Asbaek is a charming and wicked Pontius Pilate! Great!The not-so-great: a bit slow at the beginning. It dwelled too long in the family life, I wanted to see Ben Hur become the fighter much sooner in the story. Also, this kid rebel brings tragedy into the family: it all seemed too predictable. Also at first, I was confused to who was the protagonist - Massala seemed to take the leading role for a while. Then Ben Hun takes over, but he doesn't seem strong enough as Massala. Things change after Ben Hur falls into disgrace and he begins his journey into transformation.Overall: What a beautifully rendered spectacle! A delight for the emotions and the senses. I left the theater in tears and inspired! There's ambition, perseverance, revenge, humility, brute-force, forgiveness, romance, hope, despair, etc! So many dimensions of the human heart!And did you know the making of this film witnessed a miracle? Kebbell said in an interview that a charioteer was thrown off--but the horses jumped over him leaving him unharmed.I'll be watching this film ten times or more!!Please go and delight your heart and senses. Watch this beautiful Ben Hur. Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairy tale version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes come in various shapes and sizes. Gus Van Sant's "Psycho" is a shot-for-shot remake. Ridley Scott's "Exodus" is his own statement of the iconic Biblical event, entirely different from Cecil B. DeMille's masterpiece "The Ten Commandments". Most interesting is Yoji Yamada's "Tokyo Family" which is an updated version of Yasujiro Ozu's immortal "Toyko Story", one so cleverly done that it is well worthy of the original (although some Ozu loyalist may disagree).Timur Bekmambetov, whose claim to a place in the film industry is in his expertise in respectable zombie and vampire movies, is not in the same league as master William Wyler. Still, Ben Hur (2016) is not a total write-off provided that you don't waste any money on a 3D version. Ben Hur (1959) was structured on three building blocks comprising two set pieces and the Biblical element. Of the two set pieces, the chariot race is unquestionably the highlight while the sea battle is extra entertainment. A "zealot" might have said that "Ben Hur" IS the chariot race. I have not mentioned the "human story" as that is supposed to be the basic building block of a vast majority of motion pictures anyway.Still, let us take a look at the human story first, through the characters. I wouldn't bother with name of most of the actors. For the old one, they are mostly well known; for the new one, they are mostly unknown. The historical background and the love-hate relationship between Judah Ben-Hur and Messala Severus are essentially unchanged. The most striking change is in the role of Quintius which, played by Jack Hawkins, was pivotal as Ben-Hur's mentor in his return with a challenge to Messala. In the remake, while Quintius is still there, his importance is much dwindled and the character is out of the picture (no pun intended) after the sea battle. The role of Ben-Hur's mentor is doubled up by Arabian chief and racing-chariot owner Ilderim. In 1959, this role earned Hugh Griffith his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. This year, Morgan Freeman is unlikely to aspire to any Oscar claim but that does not take anything away from his solid performance of a character that, in this movie, in addition to the name Ilderim, may also aspire to a nickname "God". That may even be one of the reasons Freeman is cast, as who can claim to be more qualified to play God, after his "Evan Almighty"? While on this reference to divinity, albeit on a figurative basis, just a quick mention that in 1959, the face of Jesus was never shown, if I remember correctly. This inhibition is of course long gone and Jesus, with appearances in only a few scenes, is played by Rodrigo Santoro.There is really not that much more to say other than echoing my earlier comment that this movie is not a total write off. The key set piece, the chariot race, is quite well made. The acting will not excite you but are passable. The cast, other than Freeman, is relatively unknown but I would not leave out mentioning Ayelet Zurer who plays Ben-Hur's mother. You may remember her running all over the place with Tom Hanks in "Angels &amp; Demons".Oh yes, my summary line. You may find it difficult to hold back a chuckle seeing the fairy-tale ending slapped onto this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as epic a story today as it was during Hollywood's golden age!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paramount Pictures and MGM Studios present the reimagined classic historical drama of Ben-Hur. Appropriately released by two of the most recognized names in the industry hearkening back to the early days of cinema, Ben-Hur plays out almost as well as it did decades ago. Sitting in the auditorium last night, I wondered what it was like to see a larger-than-life nail-biting story on the silver screen when the original was released in 1959, just before the final decline of the former powerhouse of motion picture production, the studio system. The grand experience of this film is only overshadowed by the unusual pacing. Typically epic stories require a minimum of two hours, and typically come close to 3-hour runtimes in order to do the story justice and tell is visually and emotionally in the most impactful way possible; however, this film is just over two hours. This moderately quick pacing hinders one's ability to really appreciate the foreground and background stories. The grandeur of the Roman Empire fails to show as prominently as it should have in this film that bares a striking resemblance to Ridley Scott's Gladiator in many respects. Still, there are many sweeping shots of the Circus (chariot racing arena) that is disappointingly mostly CGI'd. Still, there is something remarkable about this story. Whether you are approaching this film from a historic standpoint (historic in an appreciation for classic Hollywood stories), religious perspective (forgiveness and sacrifice), or simply for the bad ass racing of chariots in a grand arena, you will likely find something to enjoy about this movie.On the backdrop of the final years of the messiah, Ben-Hur is about a Jewish prince named Judah Beh-Hur (Huston) who is falsely accused and betrayed by his adopted Roman brother Messala Severus (Kebbell). Sentenced to a life of perpetual rowing of Roman galleons in battle, Ben-Hur endears harsh treatment and near-death experiences in order to one day seek his vengeance. Meanwhile, Messala becomes a war hero and favorite of the people and the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate. When the destruction of his shop opens the door for escape, Ben-Hur finds himself washed upon the shore to be picked up by a wealthy African (Freeman) who races chariots--or pays for young men to race chariots. Striking a deal between them, the wealthy African and Ben-Hur work together to train for Ben-Hur to defeat Massala in the circus in order to reclaim his name and truly hit the Romans where it hurts--losing at their own game.One of the most unique aspects to this film is the parallel plot between the background and foreground, the plot and subplot. At the end of the day, the message of Ben-Hur is one of forgiveness. The forgiveness between brothers and the forgiveness of Christ. Although this is not a film based upon the story of the messiah (or passion), the character of Jesus is an important element in the journey from vengeance to forgiveness. On three occasions, Ben-Hur encounters Jesus, not knowing who he is. Each of these chance meetings can be read as symbolic of the different acts (or stages) in the film itself. As the story of the passion of the Christ is one that many recognize (even those who are not Christians), it helps to get an idea of what is going on in the background at the same time at the story at the forefront of the film.Cinematically, the film was a little disappointing. It feels like a lot of potential and opportunity for incredible cinematography and production design was wasted. Although there are many wide or establishing shots, the majority of the film consists of American medium shots. It would have been exciting to see more of the physical world of Jerusalem and the Roman Empire but instead we spend a lot of time indoors or in close proximity to our cast. Likewise, I would have liked to have seen more in the way of physical production design. The world on screen should have been one that I could have almost felt. Furthermore, I find that the pacing of the film was not adequate enough to actually tell the story in the manner in which it should have. It's mostly like there was a 2.5-3hr movie condensed into a typical 2hr runtime. Sometimes epic films are guilty of way too much exposition, but Ben-Hur definitely could've benefited from additional development and exposition. Everything just happens too quickly and with minimal challenge.Chariot racing. That is synonymous with Ben-Hur. And you will get plenty of horses, chariots, and crashes. Not unlike NASCAR of today, chariot racing was all about the violence and crashes. Thousands of spectators gathered to watch heroes battle it out on the ground of the circus (or race track) to see who will be the "first to finish...last to die." Many early films were more concerned about the spectacle of cinema more so than the story or message. After all, MGM's famous logo states Ars Gratia Artis (latin for "art for art's sake"), meaning the goal of cinema was to contribute to the wold of the visual and performing arts. Not necessarily to entertain, although that is certainly part of it, but to create beauty, intrigue, and push the boundaries of the mind and eye. One of the most mesmerizing elements of the original Ben-Hur was the chariot racing. Likewise, the most exciting parts of this new incarnation are the sights, sounds, and spectacle of the chariot races. Although there are certainly areas of the film that disappointed me, as I have mentioned, I highly recommend for anyone who appreciates historic dramas that wax nostalgic the days of the golden age of Hollywood. And who doesn't love a great chariot race???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Hollywood remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood remakes. For every Ocean's 11, there's 10 Willy Wonkas. So here we are saddled with another previously untouchable classic getting a slickly made, soulless studio remake. But is it fair to judge it just because it's a remake? Or does it succeed on its own merits? I love the William Wyler '59 original classic, and watch it often. The quoteable lines are brilliant. "Your eyes are full of hate, 41. That's good. Hate keeps a man alive". Charlton Heston is great as Ben Hur. And that chariot race is one of the greatest action spectacles ever put on the silver screen. I just can't envisage myself re- watching this. The effects are impressive, but any tosspot on a computer can conjure up digitally creative wowzers, so that is no selling point. And the action is predictably impressive, but it's so stagnant, slick and with no standout unforgettable moment. Jack Huston brings nothing new to the role of Ben- Hur, and Morgan Freeman clearly has a new flat screen TV to pay for, so he shows up to phone it in.For the past 16 years we've seen sword &amp; sandal epics go from fun genre revival (Gladiator) to moribund cliché (Hercules, 300 Rise of the Empire). In fact Rodrigo Santoro (Xerxes from 300) shows up as Jesus Christ this time. From Persian tyrant to Jewish prophet, now that's an improvement. I left the cinema knowing that I'll forget about this in 3 weeks. Remakes can improve on the original (The Fly, The Thing, the '59 Ben-Hur is itself a remake of an early silent B&amp;W version). But you risk falling into trap of being so slavishly loyal to the original that to redo the film becomes pointless (Pyscho). I can't recommend paying full cinema price. Stay at home and watch the '59 original. On the small screen, Chuck Heston commands a stronger presence than anyone in this large screen bore.</fullReview>

Worth a look and very watchable.Beh hur, once a prince, becomes a slave and thereafter seeks justice in the arena.Comparisons to the Charlton Heston masterpiece are inevitable,and the current picture does tend to lack any outstanding performer and a number of players in this 2016 film seem out of their depth and mis cast such as the actor playing Masala (which sounds like an Indian curry).What saves this movie is a strong enough story, a brilliant chariot race and an uplifting conclusion.Hence, 6 and a half, rounded up: 7/10</fullReview>

This latest version of BEN-HUR never acknowledges that this story was written in the 1800s by the Pachyderm Party governor who put the fatal hit-man contract out on that slandered Freedom Fighter William H. "Billy the Kid" Bonney, but what would you expect from people with the Audacity to rewrite The Holy Bible to Trump Up the sensationalism of their grisly flick? Golgotha becomes a picayune sideshow overlooking an Epic International Horse Race Betting Extravaganza, and 99% of the Palm Sunday Hosannas are reserved for a Jew named "Judah," NOT Jesus. Speaking of the Christ, apocryphal sayings and miracles are tossed into BEN-HUR chock-a-block, whenever the Action is Dragging. Viewers will suspect that the Cavalry will arrive in time to Save Our Savior from Calvary: this Blasphemous Bathos is that Powerful!

		<fullReview>The same problem as for The Gods of Egypt with Christian Bale (remake of The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston). Also this movie (remake of the original Ben Hur also with Charlton Heston) is being turned into simple action movie instead of beautiful timeless epic story. A lot of plot threads of significant importance were cut off. I have a feeling that film makers came to a conclusion that today audience will be bored to death with this story and decided it will be action movie instead of complex story driven movie. If you are a fan of the two originals mentioned in the beginning avoid this one at all cost. Its not worth the time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Faith-Based Market Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have sympathy for younger audiences who will probably never experience being mesmerized by a movie. As a 10-year-old in 1959, 'Ben-Hur' was an experience on the movie screen.Faith-based movies are made by cash grabbers who know they have a market. At 100 million, it appears most of the money and time was put into CGI effects. Both the galley ship war and the chariot race were very well done. But the rest of the film displays some of the worse casting, screenplay, and directing that I've ever seen. The music score is uninspired.Word is out that this film does better at centering around Christ. Non-sense. Jesus is presented in the new film almost as a cliché. To reveal Christ, the 1959 offering utilized subtle visual concepts to suggest Jesus' divinity. This in keeping with the novel's and the 1959 rendition's title: 'Ben-Hur; A Tale of the Christ'. The ending is so adolescent that it is profoundly embarrassing.</fullReview>

The start sequence just makes you want to leave the Theater right away, burn it to the ground and never come back. Its like a cheap TV show with bad lines and people who cant take a "punch". The best way to describe it is "Hercules meets Robin Hood" and had it been a TV show, lots would have been forgiven because most TV shows seldom has the budget or the actors to do make historical drama's stand out. But if you really want to make a "follow up" on an eternal historic movie like the original 1959 Ben-Hur, you better make it count, but this fails on all levels. Its just terrible and Im sure that Charlton Heston is turning in his grave. May Director Timur Bekmambetov be ashamed of himself</fullReview>

There was not a bad moment in the movie.

It was a movie that your family will love it will make you smile from ear to ear. Ben-Hur was a fabulous film that if you loved the original Ben-Hur than you will love this movie. The acting was spot on from the second it started to the very end of the credits that is how perfect this movie is.There was absolutely no flaws with this movie and I hope you agree with me and I am pretty damn sure you will agree with me.

		<shortDescription>Ben-Hur don't that: nope, actually it's a different interpretation and very unpredictable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version portrays Jesus as living in Jerusalem and has Judah Ben-Hur kill Quintus Arrius. The movie has great redeeming value. In this version,Messala is an orphan adopted into the Hur household. The beginning scene loosely based off a story told in the 1959 version, instead of hunting, they are horse racing. Messala carries an injured Judah back to his house. The version takes a sympathetic portrayal to Messala's character, even though he is raised in a loving Jewish house, he still clings to his Roman roots and doesn't feel at home, he feels unwelcome and leaves to join the army. He wants to be worthy of Tirzah. Judah is laid back at the beginning. As he and Messala grew up together they respect each others cultures. Judah is a pacifist, always wanting to help. There are two redemption stories in this movie that tie in greatly together even though Judah and Dismas only interact once. Dismas wants justice for his family. Judah's advise to Dismas probably went with him the rest of his life, telling him not to blame all Romans for what a few men did as well as asking him how many Romans he has talked to. Later Messala returns to Jerusalem and they talk about how their lives have been since Messala left and joined the army. Judah and Messala were criticized for defending each other's people. Judah has talked to fellow Jews about peace, a few people didn't agree with him. Judah protects their identity, the rift comes when he won't name names for Messala to crucify. Dismas gets the Hur house in trouble by killing a soldier. Judah takes the blame hoping to save the other people in the household. This encounter with Judah impacted Dismas who remembers Judah 5 years later at the chariot race, even leading the cheering. Sheik Ilderim replaces the roles of Quintus Arrius and Balthazar, acting as a wise father figure who pays for the freedom of Judah's mother and sister. Esther's father Simonedes is killed when the soldiers break into the Hur home, so the role he played in the 1959 version as well as Malluch are left out. In this version, Judah stops Esther's engagement and married her(opposed to the 1959 version where she broke off an engagement to care for her father) before Messala returns. Messala's friend Druses plays a notable role in this version. Druses gets Naomi(the mother's name in this version) and Tirzah commuted to life because Messala cherished Tirzah and keeps Messala from making that mistake. Even though Druses did what he could, he still feels guilty. Judah thought leprosy was worse than death, especially when they tried to protect his health by shooing him away. Like Arrius in the 1959 version, Sheik Ilderim also lost his only son. The role of the goofy character goes to Simonedes in this version while Sheik Ilderim was the goof in the 1959 version. This movie has a good message. Jesus gives Judah water on the way to the galley, Judah tries to give Jesus water on the way to the crucifixion. Judah's pacifist nature is seen on the galley where he reminds himself not to get involved in other slaves' abuse. The flashbacks define how even though he lost everything, Jesus's act of kindness gave him hope as evidenced by his statement to a fellow slave about outliving the masters. In 1959, Quintus Arrius says "we keep you alive to serve this ship, roll well and live." In this version he gruffly says "This ship is your body and this drum is your heartbeat". He's a tyrant. Judah grabs the sail of one of a ship that freed him, he's freed and kept alive only by a cross. Messala said right before dying in the 1959 version, "the race is not over, it goes on." The zealots fight the Romans at the arena after Judah's victory, leading to the arrest of Dismas. Shortly after Jesus's triumphal entry, Judah has his triumphal entry at the chariot race. Dismas may have remembered Judah's words and realized he was wrong to take the law into his own hands. There are multiple redemption stories as not only did Jesus speak into Judah's life, but Messala hears Jesus's kind words after saving a leper from being stoned. At the crucifixion, Judah finally finds peace. Jesus keeps true to his teachings by not letting Judah stone a Roman. Judah remembers Dismas as he hears him screaming "We deserve to die for our crimes, but this man has done nothing wrong", then asks Jesus to remember him and Jesus promises, "Today you will be with me in paradise." After Jesus says "Father forgive them, for they know not what they do", Judah remembers the good times with Messala and to the last time he saw him, he drops the stone Jesus wouldn't let him throw. The man who got Judah in trouble, whom Judah helped at the beginning, was now helping Judah find peace and witness the love and mercy of Jesus. Judah saw Jesus's impact on this man and how he is a changed man. A perfect example of Jesus as well as the contrite attitude of Dismas help Judah finish his path to peace and redemption. The difference is the way they handled the wrongs done to them let to different fates yet the same destination. Both men were bitter, but found peace in Jesus. I recommend this story of forgiveness and healing. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEN-HUR (2016) *** Jack Huston, Toby Kebbell, Rodrigo Santoro, Nazanin Boniadi, Ayelet Zurer, Pilou Asbaek, Sofia Black-D'Elia, Morgan Freeman. Bold remake of the classic tale of Jewish prince turned slave bent on revenge Judah Ben-Hur (Huston, grandson of John and nephew of Anjelica, acquitting himself nicely here) facing his adopted brother Messala Severus (Kebbell in full douchebag mode) who for unforeseen reasons has taken ranks in the Roman army and created a living hell for Ben-Hur involving the fate of his family and his future. While of course it nowhere near the epic Chartlon Heston blockbuster the film holds its own in grand production design and skillful direction by Timu Bekmambetov and an able script by Keith R. Clarke and John Ridley based on Lew Wallace's novel, blending well-wrought CGI and set pieces including the infamous chariot race/grudge match with just enough violence and steadfast resolve. Freeman continues to bring the gravitas as the anti-hero's mentor and enabler as well as occasional narrator and Santoro makes for a dreamy and soulful Jesus Christ.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Story of Redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people don't realize that Ben Hur was the number one best selling novel just after the Civil War, and remained as such until the publishing of Gone with the Wind in 1937. The book has been given credit for healing some of the nation's deep wounds and divisions after the Civil War. The latest cinematic version exhibits some minor departures from the story line of the novel, and some necessary omissions due to the vast length of the novel, but the essence of the story is powerfully adapted to the big screen. This movie is a strong antidote to the usual negativity that flows out of the Hollywood sewage pipe. The love, hatred, and redemption between step-brothers from different sides of the religio-political conflict of the day is as relevant today as it was to the post-Civil War generation. Because the movie takes us into the environment of a different age and a different place, the universal theme sneaks up on the heart and creates a strong pay- off at the end of the movie. The nation needs this movie at this time in history, but the theaters have been so flooded with comic book heroes, that people are neglecting movies that are more important to our national health and vitality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not epic enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay so I am a dire hard fan of the original movie. For the most part Ben-Hur was in all ways perfect. From Judah's enslavement because of an accident, and not by a rogue arrow. To the galley scene where Judah saves his commander, and becomes the commander's adopted son. I suppose to add more in this film from the original would make it over three hours, but that is why it was needed. I could not wrap my brain around some of the scenes that were changed to fit under two hours. Epics such as this kind of film needs the extras. The extra attention to detail, and on to more of an involved story. Masala died in the original. Why not here? A happier ending? Maybe.Also both tierza, and her mother were supposed to be in the valley of the lepers yet they are only shown to be imprisoned deep in the lowest parts of the dungeons. Again - details. However to be fair to the younger crowds it does give a unique perspective at how the Romans entertained themselves with some of the most vicious games, which include gladiators, chariot racing, and public executions.Still the race was interesting. Very violent as it was meant to be. With no holds barred action with the poor drivers who got mangled or contorted by horse's hooves running over them. Chariot racing was in fact the ultimate expression of winning. You can kill with a sword easily but to win with four horses, and a hand built cart meant that racers were the elite in the sports arena. Last for the end credits with a song. I have to say the movie did not need such a thing to end it off. A present day song to lift the spirits done in a modern pop song does not do it justice. Especially when the voice sounds like Cheryl Crow. All in all, a nice summer filler. Not bad in some ways but definitely needed more story wise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched the 1959 version maybe 10 times and I love it, as does my 19 year old daughter who has seen it at least as many times. Neither of us is a believer in God, but we are fascinated by movie magic and we went together to the opening. I was actually a bit fearful when I went to the theater but still hoped that I wouldn't be too disappointed. But ... Yes, I know this is a movie in its own right and one should not compare to the classic '59 masterpiece - but how can you avoid it?Seen as a pure action movie it is quite okay and well crafted. The acting is ... well, okay - except for Morgan Freeman who is unbelievably wooden as an almost God-like figure, a nice Big Daddy who steps in to explain and arrange everything for the best. Jack Huston as Ben-Hur, though, is rather good. But the movie just lacks the poetry and magic of the 1959 epic (the 1925 version is actually more worth seeing). Yes - the cinematic technique is of course better than in the predecessors, especially in the galley scenes, and it is visually stunning. So why isn't it as gripping and exciting? Pro primo: The tragedy of the "original" (I refer to the 1959 epic although I know it is NOT the original movie) story is that it begins with the accident that sentences Ben-Hur to the galleys. An accident! In this movie Ben-Hur is actually hiding a rioter which makes the whole premise a bit shaky. In a way you have to understand Messala's decision to through "his" people into jail - or he would probably himself be cast into roman prison. The character of Messala is designed to attract more sympathy than in the "original", and it does and you feel sorry for him, but ... as a consequence the story just fails to build up to the climax - one really doesn't care who wins or loses the damn race.As technically spectacular as it is, this version manages to distort and bungle the greatest action sequence in movie history: The chariot race. It is drenched in fiery music to build suspense and chopped to pieces in editing so that you hardly understand who is who and what is happening among the clouds of dust. Just like tens of dozens of other action movie sequences with or without crashing cars. Oh, what a pity.The 1959 chariot race is pure nail-biting suspense for about ten minutes ENTIRELY WITHOUT MUSIC to boost suspense. Just the sound of the hooves, the shouts, the lashing whips and the roars from the crowd. And it is the most thrilling action sequence ever made, without any CGI tricks. What a feat! I always suspected this race sequence couldn't be topped, and it obviously couldn't.This movie also lacks the beautiful score by Miklós Rósza, a musical masterpiece in itself (in the 1959 version).One absolutely ridiculous thing is when the end credits start sliding around the race track gathering dust! Why?? We couldn't help ourselves laughing out loud instead of feeling elated and moved by the love message. If you ever get the chance to see the 1959 Ben-Hur in a really good movie theater: GO! It is still unsurpassed among the great epic blockbusters and truly moving - whether you believe in Jesus or not.I hope that young people as a consequence of this movie may get curious and discover the Ben-Hur of 1959.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a bit nervous to go to the theater because of the bad reviews. I was very pleased to see that I did not agree with the bad write ups. The movie was well made, great cinematography, great acting with the exception of Morgan Freeman which was a shocker to me. He usually delivers a stunning performance. It did not ruin the movie though. Overall this was a very good remake of the epic from the 50's and now will push me to read the novel. The movie was very entertaining and well made. Definitely worth the price of admission. If you are looking for an epic feel of the old story, this will deliver! Nothing like the horrible biblical films like Noah which was anything but.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At times a movie may become a cultural milestone (so to speak) when it becomes ingrained in the memory of the popular culture, as was probably the case with the 1959 version and the chariot races.This movie is in itself no masterpiece and certainly it isn't quite as remarkable as the 1959 version and as some have said it wasn't necessary to do a remake.That being said, I do not think it's fair to punish this movie because it isn't as momentous as the 1959 version was. I think that when compared with all the other movies out there at the moment, it really isn't bad.Going in (based on what I had read before) I expected to see the role of Jesus to have been expanded significantly but I found it mostly in line with the previous one.Messala's motivations here gave the impression that he was caught between a rock and a hard place where he was fighting for a cause he believed would bring peace.Also, the CGI chariot race was done well enough so that there was a sense of suspense and excitement about it.Overall, I believe it was a movie worth watching, provided you just watch it on its own terms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie This Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has taken a beating in the press for daring to "remake" the 1959 award-winning classic; but it's a solid piece of entertainment, and arguably, has far more powerful spiritual themes than any of its predecessors. The cast is terrific, the script never lags, the romance is believable, and the sense of realism in Jerusalem is wonderful. It explores the political upheaval of the region at the time, using the zealot conflicts as a cornerstone for the event that lands Judah in trouble with Rome.While I do have a few minor nitpicks with the production's historical accuracy (it's a bit shocking to see so many beards among the Romans), the costuming and set design is magnificent. The chariot race isn't the only pulse-pounding moment but it does boast spectacular action scenes (and some gritty carnage). The camera is used to give a sense of claustrophobia inside the ship. The score neither overwhelms nor detracts from the experience.I wanted a bit more duality in the Roman characters than the script allowed; most of them are simply villains. The audience is left to assume Messala's emotions and motivations, and he doesn't seem to have as much emotional conflict as one would expect, in condemning his former family to death. It is confusing toward the start, as it establishes the zealots, but resolves all its major plot arcs.Sentimentality may make people consider passing this up, but if they can put aside comparisons and see it as a new take on the novel, rather than a remake, they'll find it a thought-provoking and powerful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the original Ben-Hur and liked it very much, this time I was very excited going to the theater hoping for at least a 7 stars movie. I ended up leaving with disbelief why there is such a lame move in every aspect of it except the clothing and beautiful scenes. In short, they put Morgan Freeman in cameo appearance to lure moviegoer, he just appears very briefly. The story may be good for reading but the acting is very poor. Remember how officers and generals in Roman Legionnaire look? They are mostly glorified and be surrounded by thousands of troops in full battle (beautiful) gears. In this movie we only see a few officers and they are mostly by themselves in every scenes arguing, fighting, escorting prisoners to Rome, no more than 5 Roman soldiers around wherever the officers go, to the point that they are beaten, ridiculed, wounded, or killed easily. The most ridiculous part, to me, is those no-skilled peasant-turned-fighters were able to fight off or killed the fiercest gladiators who side with the Romans. Lastly, the story put lots of people (suddenly) to appear at the perfect time, perfect location, with fighting skill, or luck, to fight the Romans, and won; The whole movie is just like that. No offense here but I don't know why other viewers put this movie more than 3 stars? To me, if you give movies like "Gladiators", "300" 100 points, this one barely makes 10 points.Unbelievably lame!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A failure of a Hollywood blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Ben-Hur is back on the big screen this time directed by Timur Bekmambetov starring Jack Huston, Toby Kebbell and Morgan Freeman. The movie is set in Jerusalem and tells the story of a prince who goes by the name of Judah Ben-Hur. Judah's adopted brother Messala Severus is part of the Roman army that occupies the city. Both brothers have a different idea of what is needed to keep the peace in Jerusalem and this eventually causes the brothers to directly oppose one another. Ultimately this causes the enslavement of Judah and his family made possible by the betrayal of Messala himself. What follows is a story about Judah trying to regain his life and his road to revenge.The movie starts out trying to establish the relationship that Judah Ben-Hur (Jack Huston) and Messala Severus (Toby Kebell) have. This is however not done in a very convincing manner due to the very stupid screen writing. It seems as if no thought has gone into the writing of the dialogue as almost every conversation feels fake. The story itself is presented in an incredibly dull fashion with story- arcs that have no real purpose paired with an ending that is completely ridiculous. What also does not help is that the acting is never really anything to write home about. The two main actors at least seem to have tried to bring some depth to their characters, but the same cannot be said about the many supporting actors. This is especially true for Morgan Freeman who seems to bring as much life to the screen as a decapitated sock puppet.The direction of the film also leaves a lot to be desired. Almost every scene was shot by using hand-held camera and instead of enhancing a certain aspect of the story this achieves the opposite effect. During the many conversations the director puts a heavy emphasis on the characters through excessive use of close-up shots. Once again this achieves the opposite of what it sets out to do as no one is really interested in seeing characters that are as flimsy as possible.Most of the times the only redeeming factor of these kind of movies is the action itself, but Bekmambetov's incompetent direction also finds a way to ruin this part of the movie. Quite a lot of action sequences only seem to exist to liven up certain parts of the movie, mostly to no avail as the movie still manages to come to a crawling pace halfway through its runtime. The action sequence themselves are filled to the brim with shaky cam and quick cuts. This in turn causes the action to be extremely hard to follow as it is never really clear what is going on. This was of course the intention of the director to be able to hide the poorly choreographed stunt work. In a lot of scenes characters pull of certain moves that they would not have been able to if they did not have control over the power of editing. For these reasons it is very hard to become invested into the action especially since we never really see the actors do certain stunts themselves.In the end 'Ben-Hur' is a complete and utter trainwreck. Nobody really asked for another retelling of Ben-Hur's story and I am fairly certain that nobody really wanted to create it either as it seems that almost no love and devotion has gone into making this failure of a Hollywood blockbuster.My Rating: 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't remember 1959 version so I rate this as its own movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure I've seen the Charlton Heston Ben Hur. I can vaguely remember the chariot scene. Therefore when I watched THIS Ben Hur I was watching this movie not comparing it to an earlier version. This was a fast paced exciting film. It was beautifully photographed and the scenery reminded me of my travels to Israel and Jerusalem despite the fact it was filmed in Italy. As an avowed atheist I found the reference to Jesus, the disciples and Judas' traitorous kiss well handled and very believable. Christs' appearances were infrequent but I believe probably as they may have been when he was a Jewish radical stirring up the Romans and the Rabbis. The character Judah Ben-Hur was well portrayed by Jack Huston. It was a very physical role and he was up to the job. His empathy and humanity were well played making him likable and having you gladly on his side as his life was turned upside down. Messalla Severus; Judah's roman adopted brother was carried off extremely well by actor Toby Kebbell. His role required him to change allegiances and turn against his childhood support. He handled this as an actor by making a believable character from the strong script he was given. The chariot scene was thrilling, edge-of-your-seat cinema. Occasionally CGI seemed obvious but it was cut so cleverly you didn't have a chance to dwell on it. In the end, you believe horses MUST have been hurt in the filming. The ending was a bit trite, cleaning up all the plot lines a little too quickly, but if they had made it any longer it would have been an epic. I can't understand why critics panned this movie, and why it is apparently failing at the box office. I'd recommend it to anyone but the very squeamish.</fullReview>

There was no bad language or nudity but, this movie is not for small children due to the violence. This is a must see movie!This movie is more for the new generation of movie watches that need things in movies that get their attention. Now I love the classics with just silent moments of body motions and facial expressions that can tell a lot about characters. The younger generation doesn't even see the meanings in that, I know cause my wife and kids ask about what's going in the classic movies all the time. So this movie is a great classic remake for this generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am completely baffled as to why this movie is getting such mixed reviews because on a scale of 1 to 10, it is at a minimum a solid 6.5 out of 10 stars by any objective standard. For those who have seen the 1959 version, don't expect a complete deviation from that version, nor from the original novel written in the 1800's, but the ways in which it does deviate from the 59 version are brilliant. This movie is less "Hollywoodized" than the 59 version and has more of an authentic historical feel to it as a story which takes place in ancient Jerusalem. Know-it-all historical purists might take issue with that, but as one who has studied this time period extensively, there is a bit of a glimpse into how a wealthy Sadducean Jewish family would have lived under Roman occupation. The acting and directing are all solid and the action scenes are not over done which is refreshing. This movie does not drag but therein is a mild criticism. The plot development seemed a bit truncated and pushed at times which did make the film feel a bit choppy, but this is probably because they did not want the movie to drag. A director's cut could easily remedy this provided whatever was removed on the cutting room floor deeps the plot development.</fullReview>

The development of all the characters was superb and the flow of the story was flawless. As I watched, I felt the strong bond between the two brothers played by Jack Huston and Toby Kebbell. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the 1959 original version with Charlton Heston and I consider it one of my favorites, I have to admit, there were times in that version that was too slow and boring for me. That is not the case with this version. It was action packed, exciting, intense and suspenseful but at the same time very moving. I was moved to tears.

I have noticed any movie that references Christianity seems to get low ratings. I see a movie once a week- this would be in my top 3 this year- no reason for low ratings. The theater was filled with an older crowd who wouldn't be rating on this site. It's worth seeing and a lit shorter than the book. I'm sure there are plenty of places where they stray from the older film or from the book. But taking this film on its own right it was historically and culturally accurate. It had lots of action. Jesus was well played. I think having an intelligent viewer who knows history going in makes it easier to follow. I will rent it and watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland and misjudged. Furthers the bad reputation of remakes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes, reboots, re-imaginings, revamps ? whatever you may call them, they're predominantly regarded as unoriginal and/or unnecessary cash-ins. They're not all a waste of time (think The Departed or Let Me In), but it's vapid movies like this that ensure their bad name stays in tact. Lets start with the positives though. With Russian director Timur Bekmambetov (Day Watch, Wanted) behind the camera stylish action sequences are all but guaranteed, and an incredible battle at sea witnessed from below the decks undeniably delivers on this front. He's also lucky his two leading men, Jack Huston as the eponymous persecuted Jew and Toby Kebbell as his vengeful Roman (adopted) brother, are both extremely strong actors who manage to turn even the worst dialogue into semi-watchable melodrama. That's where the praise stops unfortunately, for the rest of the film shouts disaster. The most notable flaw is the casting of Morgan "paycheque" Freeman, who plummets to new depths of awfulness thanks to his phoned-in performance, a lazy and clichéd narration, and a wig that'll enter the hairpiece hall of shame alongside Travolta's hairdo from Battlefield Earth. There are also a plethora of bizarre choices made by the filmmakers, including an embarrassingly out-of-place epilogue featuring Jesus (Rodrigo Santoro) that should've been either fleshed out more throughout the runtime or cut away entirely. As is increasingly common in modern blockbusters there's also a heavy use of CGI ? which in and of itself isn't necessarily a bad thing ? except here it is woefully underdone and sticks out like a sore thumb, especially in the numerous wide shots attempting to establish scale and grandeur. Perhaps most disappointing is the underwhelming chariot-race finale that, for all its hand-held camera-work and gritty intentions, is stunted by messy editing, weirdly absent violence and poor choreography that fails to hide the dumb conveniences within the race. Capped off with an atrocious song played over the final moments, Ben-Hur 2.0 is a bland and misjudged rehash of a swords-and-sandals classic.</fullReview>

And a message that's the need of the hour in the strife-torn world today. This is cinema with a purpose. The new age American cinema styling gives the period drama a fresh look. The cast is great, despite relative unknowns leading it. I would've given it a higher rating but for the irritating use of shaky cam in close ups.

		<fullReview>"Ben Hur", the latest remake is by no means flawless or a classic; yet it's a very entertaining piece of movie making which could have been better with the help of more steady camera-work, and maybe if we'd gotten a bit more background on the main characters. Nevertheless, we ended up with a fairly decent film that can stand on its own, mostly because of its production values and excellent work by Morgan Freeman.This time Masala and Ben Hur are closer than in the Wyler film. They share a deep bond and a love for horses and racing them. Masala struggles with his identity and his social position in Jerusalem, and he eventually seeks a way to solidify a better status by moving to Rome. We get some sketchy presentation about their relationships, and we get some good actors taking on the main roles. Each representing a member of the family or their surroundings, with Jesus getting a bigger role this time around."Ben Hur" seems to be moving faster through the story, but it suffers from the dramatic interludes which don't resonate in comparison to the action pieces. There's no denying that we side with the plight of the main character, but we need to get used to the grey areas which give the characters a little more dimension. Yes, the Romans are not really good guys, but we have different layers and groups within the Jewish society, too. The incident which lands Ben Hur and his relatives in different types of situations which might result in their deaths shows that life is indeed complicated, and both Ben Hur and Masala can't find an easy way to solve their dilemmas.Through a strike of good luck Ben Hur runs into the African, a mysterious and magnificent character, beautifully played by Morgan Freeman who gives it a solid foundation and a strong moral center. He's pragmatic, with room in his person to understand and maybe help others. He and Ben Hur forge an alliance, and they eventually find themselves back in Jerusalem, where Ben Hur must deal with the consequences of Masala's actions and the proposed race which might mean freedom, death, and vengeance. The centerpiece of the film is the superb presentation of the chariot race. Wyler's entry is still breathtaking and elegant. This time the thrills are bigger, and we are closer to the action, with some dazzling combination of stunt work, editing, and computer generated animation. Unfortunately, this scene also suffers from the same shaky camera work that lessens the impact of earlier scenes.There are outstanding elements in this production, mainly the marvelous music score by Beltrami, and the sensational costumes, which show plenty of care and period research. Their clothes are given much attention to their detail, with fabrics, layers, trims, to take us back to a place that existed long ago."Ben Hur" is old fashioned entertainment with a modern twist, made with respect to the original sources, aiming to satisfy its audience, staying close to the source and beating with a strong and intelligent heart and mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jesus please resurrect this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Concept-wise, this strangely-refreshing interweave of Ben-Hur's story to Jesus' life has the potential to work out just fine. Director Timur Bekmambetov acknowledges the pressure of living up to the 1959 Academy-Award winning classic by starting the film with a flash- forward of the iconic chariot scene, hinting us on the blood sport to come. From there, I perceive that Ben-Hur wants to be a serviceable Hollywood remake. When it gets to the point when the main storyline nears to an end, it suddenly unwraps its true agenda: Ben-Hur wants to preach. There's nothing wrong with that. I personally prefer films with message, no matter how overt they can be at times. But it's drastic and disappointing end, makes the religious theme feel shoe-horned. Ben- Hur takes a while to get its proper footing and when it does, it picks up the pace in an increasing momentum only to stumble upon reaching the finish line.To be fair, I bought the brotherhood love and the political difference that caused the gash between Judah Ben-Hur (Jack Huston) and his adopted Roman brother Messala (Toby Kebbell). Judah's arc is a quest for vengeance. Falsely accused of treason by his own step-bother, the Jewish prince returns from his five-year exile to challenge Messala in a sport where killing is allowed and vengeance can be coated with grandeur ? the chariot racing. On the other hand, Messala is not a single note evil character. He betrays his foster family because of his loyalty to Governor Pontius Pilate (Philip Asbaek) and his desire to earn his own name. These are fully- fleshed characters and both actors are committed to their roles (they sometimes even make up for the weak dialogue). Hence, the story of brothers turning back against each other is already a strong material.However, it's difficult to say that removing the Jesus subplot will make this film better and more focused. Will Ben-Hur still be Ben- Hur without Christ on it? I don't think so. I actually didn't mind that Jesus's role here is more of a phantom figure ? Jesus (Rodrigo Santoro) crosses Judah's path a few times to spout some biblical passages and enact moments from the Gospel. This is no secret so don't go berserk on me: In the film, Jesus gets crucified on the cross. From there, it is revealed that His significance to Judah's story is to quench him from his thirst for revenge and turn this tale of suffering into a tale of forgiveness. Am I supposed to feel awed in witnessing a mini-remake of Passion of the Christ or am I supposed to feel awed because Judah's "healing" feels earned? It fails to convince on a plot-perspective. The resolution between Judah and Mesalla is even harder to swallow. The last minute change of heart or say, "miracle" here happens in a snap of a finger. Ben? huh?Ben-Hur certainly boasts its climatic and violent chariot race scene but I would say that I'm particularly more impressed with the galley scene. This event which transpires for five years is deftly- condensed within minutes without sacrificing any dramatic tension. The transformation of a wide-eyed prince into a weathered and experienced slave is one of the pivotal moments for Judah. Enter a sea skirmish and we see fire arrows shot and oil tars dripping, then down to the moment when Judah and the slaves are dragged underwater shackled to each other. That, I believe, is an excellently-directed scene.Ben-Hur is not entirely a bad film. I am appalled by some of the critic reviews that I read online, calling this movie "soulless" and "empty" when clearly it is not. There's vengeance, hope, despair, resilience, forgiveness, humility, etc. The fault of Ben-Hur lies on its misguided ambitions which led to its terrible ending. It's unfortunate that this movie flopped big time on the box-office, despite its strong appeal for Christian movie-goers. Maybe Jesus can resurrect this picture with immense DVD sales around Christmas and Easter season for the years to come.Full review: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/ben-hur</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i gave it a higher rating than it deserved(solid 7.0) because of the rating NOW...it deserves better... i'm pretty sure i know what put people off in this film. esPECIALly those who have compared this one to the charlton heston/demille production... this one is not as dark. a bit more airy fairy... not so much vengeful and jealous jehovah as the loving Christ. but isn't that at LEAST a subplot of the film? the cyclical plot? the prophecy? or maybe i saw another film... yeah...i thought the ending was terrible, too. but i understand the choices made. but i thought the REST of the movie was good enough that i didn't really care about certain specifics in the ending that were 'offputting'. it was like, 'ok. that's that...show's over...catch the next train home'... it wasn't GREAT. it SURE wasn't BAD(except for the ending ;-)... and i thought all the dynamics hit their marks...the suspenseful parts weren't overlong...i felt the actors did a good job. and it's a good story... and then, of course, there's morgan freeman...it occur to anyone else, the irony of this man being in this movie? not JUST b/c he's black...but his name 'free man'... anyways...how could a movie be under 6 rating bad with morgan freeman in it? is that really POSsible? worth a watch. and it's a big screen movie...i'm just not sure it's worth the prices most people have to pay these days, though...there ARE better movies out now...like mel's new one, 'blood daughter'. not the usual father/daughter film... ;-) anyways...there it is. hope it helps you figure out what you want to do about this movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Rendition of Lew Wallace's Novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the Charlton Heston film version of this Lew Wallace novel more time than I have fingers to count. It is an classic in every sense of the word. However, this version has much to commend it. Without giving away any spoilers, its underlying theme is perhaps more Christian oriented. I think all of the actors are all very good in this version and some of the performances are quite compelling. I don't think every rendition of a great novel has to be compared with prior interpretations of it. For example, both "True Grits" offer something quite wonderful for the viewer. There is a tendency for people to think of two versions of a film to be in competition with each other when, if fact, they are simply two distinct interpretations of the underlying literary piece. I have seen this film twice and would see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wasted my money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today I saw Ben-Hur 2016 [ Knox City, Melbourne, AU ]. B-H 1959 version is one of those movies you love to watch. But the 2016 version does not even come close. Weak character development. An video amateur effort. Poor quality of pictures. Last ten minutes - "Chariot race" is sloppily framed, choppily edited with special effects that look like they needed another few passes through the video editing machine. The 1959 sequence is one of most famous in the history of movies because, for all the chaos and carnage, audiences could easily follow the action shots. Bekmambetov's insistence on close-ups might have been a saving money matter, but the result is a muddled, inconsequential mess?and another symbol of the modern action films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben-Hur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben-Hur (2016) isn't based on the Bible, but the eponymous novel by Lew Wallace; even though it is undoubtedly much more famous the 1959 film version, which consecrated Charlton Heston and ended up forever stamped in the popular culture... of 20th century. That's why the idea of a new version with the 21st century sensibility didn't seem so far- fetched. And I have to say that the result ended up being unexpectedly solid. My expectations for this new adaptation of Ben-Hur were very low, but I can say without any irony that I found it a very competent movie which can be appreciated on its own merits; and even though it's not perfect, it kept me quite entertained with its "peplum" drama seasoned by some action and solid performances from the whole cast. And, sure, the tranquility of knowing that the legendary quadrigae race employed digital animals in order to avoid the repetition of the atrocities committed during the shooting of the 1959 version. The dramatic axis of Ben-Hur (2016) is the relationship between step-brothers Judah Ben- Hur and Massala Severus. The destruction of their friendship is well handled, and neither of both is portrayed as hero or villain. Well, I guess Massala is "the evil one" (after all, the film isn't called "Severus"); but on a human sense, both were victims of cultural and political strengths much bigger than them. Oh, and we also have the affair of the carpenter who is obviously inspired by Yoda, because his dialogues are identical. Or he might have some historical relevance; I will have to look for him in Wikipedia. The cast is a bit more ethnic than other "whitened" epics for Hollywood commercialism. Sure, everybody has British accents, but we can't ask for miracles either. The only one speaking with a North American accent is Sheik Ilderim, but it doesn't matter because he was played by Morgan Freeman, and we already know that his voice is magnificent and doesn't have to fake nationalities in order to bring all the weight in the world to his lines. Jack Huston and Toby Kebbell have a perfect chemistry with each other, while feeling credible and enthusiastic. Nazanin Boniadi also makes a competent work, while Pilou Asb?k credibly transmits arrogance and cruelty as Pontius Pilate. And here comes the sacrilege: Rodrigo Santoro brings a decent performance as Jesus, but I frankly found all the religious affair in Ben- Hur (2016) unnecessary. When it seems that the movie is going to end, we still have 20 minutes of biblical passages... and I found them out of place, as if they belonged to another tale which was forcefully incorporated. Talking about cutting material, this review is already getting too long, so I will just say that I enjoyed Ben- Hur (2016) pretty much mainly because of its substantial drama and competent performances. And even though there undoubtedly are special effects, it wasn't a techno-nightmare such as Gods of Egypt or The Legend of Hercules. In summary: I expected to fall asleep in the cinema, but I ended up entertained and satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's actually a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not an earth-shattering movie, and it's not the end-all, be-all of movies. It obviously has its shortcomings, but it's baffling to me why some people are so harsh on it. The story, although changed up a little from the 1950's version, is well adapted,and it's easy to follow. The actors are good, and I think that the actors who played Ben Hur and Mesala succeeded in portraying the bond between the brothers. There is some character development, and the movie itself looks good, especially the chariot racing scenes towards the end. I don't think it will become a classic like the 50's version, but still, expect an entertaining movie, with some good characters, a good number of well shot scenes, and all in all, an enjoyable way to spend two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining But It's Just A Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film (in this case probably never on "film") was very visually striking, it communicated the chaos of the Sea Battle and the brutality of it in such a manner that you could truly sense the terror and hopelessness of it. When Judah floated to shore saved by sheer luck he was truly beat up looking, in the 1959 movie Charlton Heston looked buff and unbruised pretty much, as if rowing in a galley was a spa. They changed quite a bit from the screen play of the 1959 version, and since it was all fiction it doesn't especially matter. The Chariot race was the high point of the movie, at least entertainment wise. It was hard not to get excited, I almost felt like a blood thirsty Roman. It was a good deal of CGI but that would be the only way they could have horses flipping up in the air like it probably did happen in the real circus races of the time, although I don't know if there are written descriptions surviving. The Christ part of it was handled without going too overboard except the ending was odd. Lew Wallace, the original author did not have Messala and Judah become all super great friends and forgive each other, so this movie took it a bit too far. I personally couldn't help thinking as they all rode of in to the desert or where ever they were headed, that Masada was in the future for the Jews, and the destruction of the the Temple, not to forget the banishment of the Jews from Israel. Christ was suppose to deliver the Jews, as the Messiah, so apparently the message got mixed up, and the Romans eventually became war like Christians. Maybe that wasn't suppose to be the underlying message, but that's what happened. Good movie entertainment wise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Hur is a historical epic, a genre even rarer than Westerns or film-noir. It's a remake of the 1959 classic, but Ben Hur is a timeless story and this 2016 iteration tells the story well.Ben Hur isn't a superhero movie featuring sheer entertainment or spectacle, although it has both in spades. Ben Hur is built around a moral: forgiveness. Ben Hur's about letting go of grudges. Throughout the story the players find that they've lost everything, but by the film's end, they see that nothing is lost at all. Jesus Christ is portrayed in this film respectfully. The filmmakers wisely don't show him to be a magician performing miracles, but as a peaceful man and as a leader with charisma, like Martin Luther King. Christianity is the only religion that's safe to make fun of nowadays (check out "Hail, Cesar," a movie parodying Ben Hur to see what I mean) but there's no arguing the logic of Christ's teachings. ""He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone at her." It's hard to argue with, you know?This movie is filled with great set pieces, moments, and spectacles, all one after another. This is also a cast of unknowns (apart from Morgan Freeman, of course) but that just adds to the production. There's no ego or celebrity culture/worship at work in this movie. Everyone's giving it their all, not wandering on screen and riding off of their personal branding. Perhaps that's why this movie is tailing at the box office, but in time it'll be celebrated.Morgan Freeman's character, Ilderim, says at the movie's close: "Don't look behind you! Your life lies ahead!"Beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a drag going to a movie that your companions say has bad reviews so I really girded my loins expecting the worst out of Ben-Hur. But, Ben-Hur is actually a very enjoyable movie and to me, an unfair victim of negative reviews. I like a movie with a story that is cohesive from start to finish, and Ben-Hur has that. The visual appeal of the movie's setting was also a big plus, especially the Jerusalem environs. The action scenes were just fine for me. They were compelling and realistic without being gratuitous. The sea battle was quite gripping. The relationship scenarios offered good drama and were especially strong in scenes involving tensions and conflict with the Romans. As a Christian I was also very comfortable with the Biblical aspect and the presence of Jesus. All in all, a fine movie that I think good-hearted, happy people will appreciate seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie in the tradition of the old swashbucklers. Nowadays is hard to find a movie like this. I'm a fan of the 1959's epic version and I'm not going to compare the two movies. Both are great and different in the story-line. The ending in this one has a great message and I was not expecting it.I liked the performances, photography and the race was very well done! I think that the new one is a mix of "Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves(1991) + "The Mask of Zorro"(1998) + "The Count of Monte Cristo"(2002). It's an adventure with action and romance. As a big fan of these kind of movies, this one was a good surprise. I give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

Tried not to compare with the original Charlton Heston epic.The actors were OK, but too neat &amp; tidy, would have liked to see the guys with more muscles . The constant close up of Marsallas face showing his scar from ear to cheek irritated me , I knew it was only a matter of time before he told the story of how he got this! Seemed that the movie concentrated on the scars, wounds a lot Just annoying for me. In all not a bad flick in today's line of movies. The chariot race didn't seem that long either, surely they could have made it longer and more exciting. We loved the music in this film, and would have loved to have seen it in 3 D. A lot of the actors I didn't know which was a good thing as I have seen enough of actors doing all roles in movies</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched the movie today. I liked it. I had heard a LOT about Benhur when I was a kid. Hence I went to see the movie. the moment I saw the movie I immediately knew why it bombed ( will bomb) at the box office. Wonder why the makers didn't see that....anyways 1) the movie is about a fictional character Benhur. It's supposed to have offered at time of Jesus. Now this is the problem. Christians didn't come to see because they want to see Biblical facts , not fiction ----it means nothing. Plus many don't like made up things about Jesus, good or bad. 2) Non Christians didn't come too. But why? Because they are not interested in a religious story. Though this one is not really that religious . Yet it is. So they let this one pass.Thus the movie received a powerful double whammy and ended as a colossal flop. Makers must sample audiences before making such outdated movies.they must take opinions of experts like me who, in one view, can predict if a movie will make it or not. That being said I thought the movie was beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never rises above mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most forgettable, underwhelming films I've seen in years. "Long story short" seems to be what filmmakers were going for, as everything seems to be condensed into a fairly generic, sword and sandal action movie. Looks like something made for the History Channel, with unimpressive CGI, which drifts in and out of focus, as depth perspective necessitates. Greek rebels ambushing the ships by ramming them even has little effect, because it's all just mediocre CGI. We know a scene is intended to be a dramatic or sorrowful or adventurous moment only because the music tells us. This entire film, while never sinking to levels of *bad*, never rises above mediocrity. It gets better as it goes along, but again, it never rises above being merely "good enough", and is 100% forgettable. I can barely remember enough to be able to write enough to post a review, so much of it was gone as I left the cinema. The song played during the closing credits was not only out of place, but also a rather crummy little ballad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not half as good as the 59 version but still worth a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If like me you know the 59 version well, is this 2016 worth watching? The answer is yes, it's such a good story that such an extravagant remake is worth watching. This is despite the fact that this 2016 movie is definitely not as good on many levels and will never replace the Charlton Heston version. The good points first: The galley scene together with "ramming speed" is quite exciting with some elements not seen before. The chariot race is well done as well just as exciting. The scenery and setting are excellent. Bad points: Casting. Toby Kebbell as Messala is just wrong. He has a cross eyed rather daft expression most of the time and is just not good looking enough for a major role like this. Compare to Steven Boyd in the 59 version. Secondly, the Danish actor playing Pontius Pilate is also completely wrong. He looks like some Game of Thrones background character with his light coloring - not Roman or dignified at all. What were they thinking? Morgan Freeman with his full on American accent is just so out of place. Nazanin Boniadi as Esther is a bit cold if pretty. She lacked the passion and Middle Eastern accent of Haya Harareet. On the other hand Rodrigo Santoro makes a suitable looking Jesus and his some dialog. Jack Huston as Ben Hur wasn't as bad as I thought he would be. He looks more ethnically appropriate as a Jewish prince. Not blond and blue eyed. He doesn't act or look the big hero. Some of the costumes looked contemporary and out of place. The music is wrong too. The score in the 59 version was memorable and suitable. The pop song in the end of the 2016 version was just ludicrous. The plot changes are significant. Messala's back story is interesting to watch his point of view. Roma Downey produced the movie and her Christian message of forgiveness of Messala removes one of the most powerful scenes in the 59 version - Messala and Ben after the chariot race. This change regarding Messala's fate in the end spoils the story. This movie shows the 59 version was almost perfect. Nevertheless it's still worth one watch. I watched it in IMAX 3D - not really necessary. It was a terrible gamble remaking a perfect movie. It isn't as disastrous as the remake of Psycho with Julianne Moore, Roman Holiday with Catherine Oxenberg or Sabrina with Julia Ormond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remakes: We've Ben-Hur before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1959 the world was introduced to Ben-Hur, a movie that today remains on many top movie lists. So of course Hollywood, would be ready for a remake in this golden age of well? remakes. My final review of the weekend is on the latest rendition of the classic tale that promises the entire plot with more of the action. So let's get started shall we?LIKES: ? Sticks to the story ? Acting ? The chariot scene finaleWith remakes sometimes comes a major plot overhaul, which is sometimes good and sometimes bad. In Timur Bekmambetov's production the story is pretty consistent with its 55- year-old predecessor. The backbone is essentially the same, but they have made a few tweaks such a making Messala, Judah's brother and using assassination as the means of starting war instead of a tile falling from the ceiling. Some of these additions I think make the drama more gripping, and others were a little more long-winded and overdramatic. At least most of these additions added to the plot and allowed us to get closer and more involved with Ben-Hur's tale. I liked most of the plot points myself, despite rolling my eyes at times, and welcomed the additions. I also welcomed the acting, with Jack Huston being an extraordinary Ben-Hur of the modern age. He captures the noble side of the character well and did a decent job for most of the hopeless romantic scenes as well. I can't lie that his deep brooding voice, sounded a lot like a comical Batman impression and his shaken faith moments were a bit overdone, but overall he did a nice job. Toby Kebell also does the role of Messala well too, though he is a bit more overbearing and brash compared to Huston and bleeds over to the overacted realm a few times. But these two sync with each other well, and both have a great chemistry with the rest of the cast making for a believable crew that you fall into place with. And as promised, the chariot scene was quite the display of technical ingenuity the modern day Hollywood. The sequence is well put together, with the cinematography capturing all the glorious chaos and action in glorious detail. Its stable, multi angled, and all designed to maximize emotion without making you sick (take a look at this Michael Bay). Now throw in a killer symphony score and sound editing and you get the next component that brings the 15 minutes of adrenaline pumping shots to full force. Finally, throw in some beautifully choreographed moments and planned accidents and you get the complete picture that immerses you into the moment. It certainly was a fitting ending to the tale.DISLIKES: ? Some of the Drama overdone ? Writing is surprisingly lacking at parts ? The savage nature of the film As mentioned earlier, the writers of the script added some good story elements to the mix, but there were parts that were a little overdone. Many of these parts often had to do with the mother and sister roles, very shallow moments that did not add much to the plot for me. The obsession from that point on led to a lot of circular arguments that were not impressive to me and kept the plot from moving along. A few other character introductions and building rivalries were almost not needed, for the characters weren't on screen long enough to really add much to the story other than fodder for the violent moments. This brings me to the next dislike: the lacking writing. For a movie all about finding faith and challenging the reign of the prestigious Roman Empire, you would have thought there would be more boisterous and moving speeches. There are a few of these pride-stimulating moments, but much of Ben-Hur's dialogue has been reduced to casual conversations where testosterone leads to a semi heated complaining match. Morgan Freeman probably has the best conversations of the bunch when he interacts with the group, filled with the wisdom and enlightenment this time in history was famous for. In addition Esther (Nazanin Boniadi) also had a few wise moments though not as well thought out. While you certainly aren't there for the writing, it was something that I had hoped would match the intensity of the 50s film. Finally comes the savage nature of the film. Yes, I know times were horrendous back then and the might of the army was merciless and not shy of brutality. Still I didn't expect so much focus on it. Ben-Hur's modern day graphics truly amplify the reality of suffering as both Roman and Jewish citizens are burned, maimed, and crushed under the wrath of entertainment. Some of the violence was indeed necessary, but the cruelty towards the horses in this film was a little too focused for my liking. Yes it does bring you into the heat of the moment and I did feel the suspense building. But seeing those horses (even CGI ones) suffer was not entertaining to me. The violence is certainly fitting, but those with weak constitutions might want to stick to the 50s lower technical qualities. The VERDICTBen-Hur is one of the better remakes I have seen in a while, and has many of the elements we fell in love with all those years ago. The actors play their roles nicely and the modern day graphics certainly bring the world to life and immerse you into the entire story. But it is a remake that is a bit more savage and is does not hold anything really special to constitute a trip to theater, with the exception of the few action scenes. Yet those looking for a good historical, action, drama will get their fill, but I recommend waiting on this one to grace RedBox. My scores:Adventure/Drama/History: 7 Movie Overall: 7</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expectations met - but not in the way the makers intended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who doesn't like a sword and sandals epic? We sure as hell do so we skipped happily off to see the remake of BEN HUR, it being date-day and we being in a movie mood. We weren't expecting much because we hadn't been particularly enamoured of the original starring Cold Dead Chuck. So we went along with low expectations and these were met although not perhaps in the way the makers intended.Judah-Ben is a Jewish prince who is good to his slaves in a 'please' and 'thank you' kinda way. His adopted brother might be a Roman and his name is Garam Masala although it isn't spelled that way in the credits. It's spelled that way in our spice rack but.Judah and Garam are besties as well as being nearly-brothers. Garam goes off to fight for Rome mostly because his attempts at the burgling of Judah's sister's panties have been met with the furrowed brow of stern disapproval of his nearly-mother. Foreskin issues? Mebbe. He gets in a lot of battles none of which are nearly as good as the Battle of the Bastards. Jesus pops up every now and then and says something enigmatic.Garam comes back to Jerusalem and him and Judah-Ben cuddle and are back to being besties in a heartbeat and there is a sword prezzie but nothing lasts forever and they squabble and Garam sends Judah to the galleys . He spends 5 years row, row, row your boating and it's tough. Fortunately, scurvy hasn't been invented so he keeps all of his teeth and they get even whiter if that is even possible.He survives a battle and has a Life of Pi adventure and is discovered by Morgan Freeman who wears a dress and is, if anything, even more prone to making enigmatic observations than Jesus. One of the great voices, has Morgan. However this loses much of it's potency when exposed to a script that sounds as though it may have gone through a series of translations from the original Aramaic before it arriving in a form of English.Morgs is a horse trainer and race fixer and has a team of ringers and no driver so he offers the job to Judah-Ben because he was a vet. Sort of. He challenges the Pilate to race against his team of white horses and you just know that this's going to be good. The gun roman driver is,you guessed it, none other than our old friend Garam Masala. He's the villain too, although in fairness his villainy is more Wascally Wabbit than, say, Ted Bundy. You can tell that he's iffy because he has black horses.The big chariot race is an absolute ball-tearer! We were on the edge of our seats cheering and 'Hyaaar HYAAAR-ing' and 'GO you good thing-ing' like there was no tomorrow. The Zambuks were flat out like lizards drinking. Talk about carnage! I half expected that the crowd would start singing 'You'll Never Walk Alone' and that was about the only thing that could've improved it.I won't ruin it by saying who wins. Even Pilate has a go at being a bit enigmatic after the race. Jesus says a couple more mystic things and is crucified and makes it rain and cures some lepers.Was it any good? Nah. Rubbish.Unless you look at it as an action/comedy and then it is oddly satisfying.</fullReview>

Has the big ticket title, set and budget but dialogue &amp; delivery are reminiscent of "Pompeii" -but without Kit Harrington. Never saw the original so I really was willing to give this one a go. Just thought Ben-Hur might of had more gravitas to him and less toffy Londoner.

		<shortDescription>Author Wallace would be appalled.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The book is entitled "Ben Hur, a Tale of the Christ". It tells the story about the effect Jesus has on his followers who then meet Judah Ben-Hur and influence him in turn. I had no problem with Judah and Messala being portrayed as brothers. The scene where the story of the Governor's injury is changed from the book and the first two movies was tolerable. The huge problem is that we see Jesus, but he is misrepresented. Very little can be seen of his Divinity. The 1925 and 1959 movie versions pay a great deal of attention to this. For example each of them has a Nativity scene, and each one shows Jesus being judged before Pontius Pilate.The story is spiritually sterilized. We are left with is a standard sword-and-sandal movie. The book is much more and deserves better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!!! Loved it!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disregard all the negative reviews of this movie. This faith based film was VERY well done and put forth the message in the story in an extremely tactful manner. It was a powerful story of betrayal and forgiveness. The acting, directing, and scenes were high quality and I consider myself picky on which historical films I see, because it detracts from a film based on history when you see modern reflections. The acting was also believable and exceptional.All the actors depicted true to form what it would have been like to live during that period. While, I have never seen the 1959 version, movie viewers today would not be able to sit through a movie that is over 3 hours long and I've heard the pace is much slower in the original version. So naturally this shorter version will have some elements that vary from the original. But we thought this in no way lowered the quality. The many reviews of this movie that are negative are coming from non Christian viewers (and our current culture is not Christian centered) and I wonder why they bother to see a film they will undoubtedly find objectionable anyway? We found this to be a great movie with a great cast and a great message. While it is a faith based movie, even non Christians who just want to see a good movie with positive elements and a great message will appreciate this film. Two thumbs up!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why even bother?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is abbreviated, basically, leaving the audience with no investment in the lead character or his family/friends. The thin attempts at stringing together the "faith" aspect of the story are not successful. The acting is mediocre at best, including Morgan Freeman's effort?he clearly just mailed this in for a paycheck. The ending is absolutely silly, too. Who mourns for Simonides? No one, evidently. Sometimes you wonder who green-lights a film like this?and why they didn't lose their job(s). Some token respect is paid to the William Wyler version of the film via similar dialogue, etc., but the whole chained-to-the-oar sequence is extremely thin and unsatisfying to the audience. The chariot race is predictable and silly?especially Freeman's character "coaching" from the infield. Right ... ::eyeroll:: ... Visually, the film is nice to look at, but when that's the highlight of the movie-going experience? It's been a waste of $10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, But Not Consequential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, which seems to have come about because the producers felt the story should be re-told, is a beautiful production. It has value as an exciting race scene, which was the centerpoint of the film, and an almost-felt sentimentality about family love: its main theme. Happily, the theme of the 1959 version--comparisons will be inevitable--of bitter revenge was only a sub-theme here. There were some nice plot devices, and all in all I was mostly pleased with this telling of the story.I was disappointed that the subtitle, "A Tale of the Christ," that MG Wallace put to his book wasn't imported into this film; and I was most disappointed by the maudlin presentation of Jesus Christ. It is not accurate to portray Him as doing carpentry work alone in Jerusalem; and only a calm, pious presentation of His three hours on the cross has surely been corrected by Mel Gibson's film.There is an apocryphal story about Ben-Hur's origin that I heard in my youth. MG Wallace was riding in a train one day with Robert Ingersoll, a very popular public speaker of the time who was an agnostic. He and Wallace were discussing how Christianity has damaged civilization, human progress and the American way; and Ingersoll challenged the general to write a book disproving the faith. Instead, after earnest research, Wallace came to belief in Christ and this is the book which came about. Published in 1880, it was the most popular novel in America until the advent of Gone With the Wind. So there's a little background for you and the reason I wanted this movie to be good.But, I wanted to enjoy this movie, and I was able to do so. Again, the production itself was great, the acting though unevenly directed served to move the story along, and the story was worth telling. After all, this has been an American classic for many years. It could have been better, though, and we want our movies to be 10/10 every time out of the chute!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben Hur for the 21st century?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new reincarnation of Ben-Hur takes us back to the 1st century but with less fanfare and artistic value than the 1959 version. The story has certain twists and turns that many will not find artistically appealing, though the depiction of Jesus Christ is more direct and less ambiguous than the 1959 version. However, the Jewish-Roman conflict which has been part of the story since its inception is also on full display in the movie.Needless to say, this time technology is in full command throughout the story but at the expense of a well-crafted, believable, deeply emotional script. Obviously it is always difficult to compare a modern remake with a master piece, that is so well-known by some many moviegoers around the world. Also, the chariot race is fascinating but messy and hard to follow from the emotional point of view. Given its presentation and editing peculiarities, it is clear to see why the producers decided to make it a summer movie, which characteristically involves a lot of action and special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Descent Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Ben-Hur", starring Jack Huston-Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, The Longest Ride; Toby Kebbell-Warcraft, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes; Rodrigo Santoro-The 33, The Last Stand and Morgan Freeman-London Has Fallen, Ted 2.This is a remake. And not the first one, either. There was a silent movie in 1925, the Charlton Heston 1959 classic, a Broadway play and even a TV mini-series. Most people I know, have fond memories of the Charlton Heston version-I don't think I've seen any of the other ones. This one is pretty good but changes a few things. Jack/Ben_Hur is a rich prince with Toby as his adopted half brother. They were best friends growing up but as adults, they grew apart. Toby leaned towards the domineering Romans and goes off to join the army. When circumstances cause the brothers to cross paths again, Toby is in charge of security to the Roman leaders. When an assassination attempt on one of those leaders points to Jack-who is innocent, by the way-Toby has Jack sent away to be imprisoned as a rowing slave on a Roman ship for the rest of his life. He escapes and meets Morgan, an African gambler/entrepreneur that likes to bet on chariot races, a popular Roman pastime because of the lording it over the peasants thing. Guess who the Roman's best racer is? If you guessed Toby, you are right. Jack thinks this would be a good chance to get his revenge. The chariot races look pretty good and I don't see how no animals were hurt making the movie-some of the crashes looked lethal. Rodrigo is playing Jesus and he tries to convince Jack to turn the other cheek and have forgiveness for his brother, in a non- violent way, of course. There are religious undertones throughout the movie but it is only in light touches, it's not like they are just preaching a Sunday morning sermon. It's rated "PG-13" for violence and disturbing images and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 4 minutes. It is a descent remake but I don't think I would buy it on DVD. It would be good as a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that this was a disappointing movie! I can not believed they altered the story lines just to shorten the length of the movies. Personally, I feel that the 2016 remake of the movie did not capture the injustice of Judah Ben Hur's character. It almost gave messala a little bit of credit as to arresting him. This alteration alone causes the betrayal between the 2 characters less impactful. However, I do appreciate Judah forgiving Masala at the end of the remake, I mean who doesn't like a happy ending? However this ending did not put forth the same or even a similar message to the 1959 movie. I kind of wished I did not see the 1959 version before watching the remake. I might have enjoyed it a lot more if I did not have expectations or comparisons in mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the film Ben Hur 2016. If you are a fan of the past, it is nothing what you will expect. It is re booted for the crowds of today 2016. The film reminds me of "Risen", and other Christian made for TV films. The acting is OK (scripted), the CGI is what you would expect, the musical score is completely different than you would expect. A little over 2 hours of fresh new material. Not a "period" piece film, because of the "white wash" of the full intent of the original material. Go see the film with an open mind, and take in a fresh new approach to someone else's vision and interpretation of Lew Wallace's great literary work of Art. Now, that every studio is making remakes as a "staple of goods", it is hoped that someone else will finally take the original work of Lew Wallace and invest in its true content and intent.Lew Wallace's interest that inspired him to write Ben Hur, was the mystery of the Magi. Don't expect Milkos Roza music or William Wyler's direction. Expect what you come out with, once you see the film, nothing more. TIMUR BEKMAMBETOV?Abraham Lincoln the Vampire slayer, and now Ben Hur both icons destroyed?Waiting for the final remake in 2020.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular special effects - full of action.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The famous story of Ben-Hur has been done in film multiple times throughout the years, but none has reached this level of excitement and beautiful special effects. And none has ever been this action packed and intense. Ben-Hur will certainly appeal to action genre fans, but it has so much more to offer. Along with multiple dangerous adventures comes strong love story, drama and history, which keeps you excited but surprised by events that unfold in front of your eyes. The film starts when Prince Judah Ben-Hur (Jack Huston) is accused of attempting to assassinate a Roman Leader. His adopted brother convinces him and his family about the worst punishments available. His family meets a mysterious fate that leaves him guessing about them for years. Judah is sentenced to life as a galley slave (a person that rows Roman ships). He barely survives this terrible punishment for six years before escaping. Back on land, he trains to take revenge on his brother in a place with no law - the dangerous, yet exciting sport of chariot racing! Although the plot seems confusing, it actually is easy to follow. Towards the beginning it may be a bit confusing, but by ten minutes into the film pieces snap into place. This film not only packs a lot of action, but it is also very historical and truly makes it look as if we are watching these scenes take place in ancient Rome and Jerusalem from the boats, to warfare, to their attire. Throughout the film, I felt transported back 2000 years to the large Roman Empire. Most of the special effects portray the chariot racing and the outcome is nothing short of spectacular, detailed and very realistic. It is exciting and intense, but also easy to follow. The acting in this film exceeded my expectations with many known actors such as Jack Huston and Morgan Freeman (Ilderim), but the entire cast delivers spectacular performances and really make their characters come to life and shine, as well as make the viewer think they actually are seeing life 2000 years ago. My favorite scene is the galley slave scenes. In a way, these are also my least favorite scenes because it shows how terrible Romans treated these slaves. In one scene, you see Judah changing over the six years from a handsome and healthy prince to a depressed, skinny and beaten slave. Another factor of these scenes that impressed me were the visual effects. Judah escapes when the ship sinks in a battle. The scene is very dramatic, scary and intense. It is full of action and everything from soundtrack to acting makes it a heart- thumping moment.Ben-Hur is intense with many adult references, but the mature aspect that concerns me most is the gore. Since this takes place in Ancient Rome, there are many violent acts that are unsuitable for young children. I recommend it for ages 14 to 18 and give it 4.5 out of 5 stars. The acting, special effects and soundtrack are all fantastic but the story is slightly confusing at the beginning which makes it a bit annoying for the viewer.Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST!

		<fullReview>'BEN-HUR': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The fifth feature film telling, of the 1880 novel 'Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ' (by Lew Wallace). It of course begs for comparisons to the Academy Award winning 1959 blockbuster, starring Charlton Heston, and no one should be surprised that it's horrendously inferior. This version was directed by the Russian-Kazakh genre film director Timur Bekmambetov; who's most well known for helming 'DAY WATCH', 'NIGHT WATCH', 'WANTED' and 'ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER'. This film definitely doesn't live up to any of those either. It was scripted by Keith Clarke and John Ridley (who amazingly also wrote the Academy Award winning '12 YEARS A SLAVE'). The movie stars Jack Huston, Toby Kebbell, Morgan Freeman, Nazanin Boniadi, Ayelet Zurer and Rodrigo Santoro. It was savaged by critics, and the Box Office alike. I pretty much hate it.The movie recounts the story of Judah Ben-Hur (Huston); a nobleman who was falsely accused of treason, by his adoptive brother (turned Roman army officer) Messala (Kebbell). Judah then became a slave (for five years), on a Roman slave ship, before escaping. He returns home and challenges Messala to a chariot race. The entire time he keeps having mystical encounters with Jesus (Santoro).The film is extremely slow-paced, uninvolving and dry (really dry). The acting is almost all bad, and the characters aren't at all likable. I could barely stay awake, for a lot of it, and I couldn't wait for it to be over; 2 hours is way too long for this (even though the 1959 epic is over 3.5 hours long). I expect so much more from Bekmambetov, and such a classic story! The chariot race is still pretty cool though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/lcZBQp0HBZg</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even-handed review.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Context: I am an atheist, and not one of the evangelical Christians with which this film would most resonate.First: The good. People seem to be whining about how this is not an "epic" like the 1959 version. I am not sure why an "epic" is such a good thing. This film takes the original story and presents it on a more human scale, and that is a very different animal from the 1959 version, but it is no less valid. Most of the actors understood what the vision was, went with it, and played it to the hilt. After reading what the producer team of Downey/Burnett have had to say, I understand that this was their way to bring Christ's message to people in this day and age. The over-the-top style of Heston and his compatriots would go over like a lead balloon today. Instead, the characters are played by actors who are especially good at bringing humanity and humility, as opposed to bombast, to their work. I believe it was Variety who accused lead actor Huston of looking weak and, in an interestingly witty but not quite on-the-mark comment, of being "moist". Well, thank god for that. His character starts out being weak yet well-intentioned and naive, while displaying the raw potential for greatness as a leader. I totally got that. He brought it across masterfully. To go through the whole film with the granite-jawed demeanor of Heston would have made it less-than-believable. At start of the film, Kebbel does a solid job of expressing his position as somebody who is reaching out, not only for identity, but also for achievement, in order to prove his own worth to himself. You can see the ambition and unrest boiling just below the surface. The transformation of Judah from spoiled prince to hardened, revenge-obsessed, juggernaut is presented well, although the paucity of time in which it takes place is an issue. Say what you want about his ability to dominate the screen, Jack Huston knows how to take on a character and make it his very own. Kudos. In a film in which the cinematography proved to be particularly unfortunate, the galley scene was very effective and presented the action in a way that provided some serious suspense and thrill, as it was shown only from the limited point-of-view of a galley slave. Playing peek-a-boo with the action going on outside the ship proved to be a whole lot more effective than just laying it out on the screen could ever have been.IMO, the chariot race was successful. Bekmambetov is supposed to be good at depicting action scenes. To me, this is a human story, and I am not one to particularly enjoy "Fast and Furious" films, so giving an effective rating to a scene like this would not be in my wheelhouse.Now: The bad. During every single scene, with the exception of the galley and chariot scenes, I wanted to scream at the screen, "HOLD THE FCUKING CAMERA STILL ALREADY"!!!!! The whole shaky camera thing has it's place, but when a scene is dramatic, as opposed to an action scene, I just want to see what is going on already and not have to be subjected to this type of nonsense. (It is a good thing that the dramatic scenes were good enough that I actually wanted to see them.)I know there is a lot of Freeman-love out there, but sometimes I thought he downright sucked. It was like he was reading a teleprompter as opposed to actually acting. The emperor was not wearing any clothes. I felt that the film would have benefited from being longer. It would have been good to have a the characters and situations fleshed out a bit more. I agree with some other critics who wrote that it was like they were checking off boxes on a list of what was supposed to happen in the film. Every character transformation and relationship that I can think of would have benefited from some extra time and attention. I find it ironic that the Downey/Burnett team wanted to bring a more religious message to this film, and yet they managed to present the religious part in such a way that it lacked feeling. Santoro did his job well, but the crucifixion scene itself did not move me the same way as previous parts of the film. Maybe it was that I had become emotionally invested in other characters during the course of the film, and Jesus was just presented as an interlude set apart from the main story line. My biggest criticism of this film was that it was about ten minutes too long. The reconciliation between brothers was expected, and welcomed, but everything that happened after that made what could have been a successful film into a Hallmark Channel special. It was just so saccharine and, I don't know, "family friendly" (?), that it made me throw up in my mouth a little bit. We don't need to be bludgeoned over the head with the concept that forgiveness makes everything a-OK. Maybe the filmmakers underestimated the audience in this respect. However, I do have to give them credit for presenting us with characters who were nuanced and complex. I was afraid that this would be too much like other programming aimed at the evangelical set that presents characters as black-hat vs. white-hat (or horse) with no shades of grey in between. Good job on that.That about sums it up. While the film is, as a whole, somewhat uneven, it is worth watching for its many good points. Go into the theatre understanding what the film's creators were trying to accomplish in order to understand it in context. With that as your starting point, enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben-There/Done That!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first remember seeing the 1959 version, with Charlton Huston, on CBS for what might have been its 20th anniversary. But, I more clearly remember it as an Easter Sunday offering (probably to compete with ABC's annual telecast of 10 COMMANDMENTS, Heston's other Biblical epic). With commercials, it had a four-hour running time, in total. This version was ninety minutes shorter...and four stars lesser in terms of faithfulness to the original source material. Gone are the rescue of the Roman official from drowning and Judah's adoption by same in gratitude. Gone is the meeting with Balthasar, one of the Three Magi, as a fellow dinner guest of Sheikh Ildarim. Gone are the astronomical names of the four Arabian horses (who often prove smarter than some of the protagonists). And most peculiarly gone of all? Any mention of Lew Wallace as author of the original novel!(Even in public domain, the book and its author should still have been officially acknowledged.)All that's left is the climactic chariot race and the interaction between Jack Huston in the title role, Toby Kebbell as Messala, and Morgan Freeman as the sheikh. The latter, by the way, portraying Ildarim with a lot less comic relief than the late, great Hugh Griffith.In short, what we basically have here is an attempt to surpass RISEN, the Italian-made Biblical epic from three months ago. But, an attempt that is basically unsuccessful, despite this remake being an otherwise enjoyable time-killer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong Performances From Kebbell and Huston Wasted by a Mediocre Update at Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely are classics improved upon with remakes, others tend to tarnish the original versions. This iteration of Ben-Hur tends to fall somewhere in between those two extremes.There was no need to remake Ben-Hur to begin with. I'm not even sure why they had to do an animated version in the early 2000's and bring back Heston. The 1959 tale is a classic and the chariot race will never be touched. It did so much for filmmaking at that time and attempting to top it in any way shape or form, is a huge mistake. While I don't think they tarnished the legacy of the original, it also didn't fix some easy mistakes that the 1959 film made.The crux of the story in both cases is the troubled relationship between Judah Ben-Hur and Messala Severus, this time played by Jack Huston and Toby Kebbell respectively. With that said, in both films they make the same mistake of forcing the Jesus arc into what is already a jam packed film. I'm not saying I can't appreciate the faith element, I can. But there are other ways to portray Ben-Hur's struggle to come to grips with his faith and lack there-of. By forcing the Jesus angle into the film, it becomes painfully uneven. Either make him a more demanding presence or cut it out completely, make a choice.However, there are plenty of good things about this remake. Kebbell and Huston actually hold their own as friends (brothers?) turned foes due to political issues. I really enjoyed watching their relationship unfold into surprising directions. At the same time, the ending that was chosen for that relationship is absolutely one hundred percent garbage, and unfortunately is the exact direction a clichéd Hollywood film would take them.Morgan Freeman (with putrid dreadlocks) is also quite good in the film, and not as distracting as the trailers make it seem. Having just watched the 1959 version recently, I think Freeman is just as good as Hugh Griffith was as Ben-Hur's companion, Ilderim. There are plenty of refreshing choices this film makes in its story structure that are beneficial to the story, and I enjoyed those updated elements. But it's unfortunate that a sword and sandals epic in 2016 just doesn't hold the same type of gravitas that it did back in the day. The new chariot race is fine, but I think I still prefer the 1959 take even more. And as good as I thought Kebbell and Huston were, I can't possibly believe they hold a candle to what Heston and Boyd did. I didn't hate the update, but man it could have been a whole lot better.+Kebbell and Huston hold their own+New updates improve the flow-But with the Jesus angle, it's still incredibly uneven-Wretched Hollywood ending4.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into the movie, hoping for some 'Gladiator'esque drama, but came out a tad disappointed.Some main points:1. The story is not very well-developed. The part after the chariot race seemed forced, so as to take this epic to the clichéd 'happy ending'. 2. The action is great. The navy battle sequence gives you goosebumps, with all the Roman Galleys and the ammunition. The chariot race is also thrilling, but personally, it came up well short of the re-enactment of the 'Battle of Zama' in 'Gladiator'. 3. The characters fit in their roles perfectly. Judah, Messala, Jesus, Esther are a delight to watch.I haven't seen the 1959 version, which I have heard to be much more religious in nature. But I guess this reboot is much more suited for present-day's audience.In a nutshell, the action is good, the cinematography is nice, but the story leaves much to be desired. Do not go to watch the movie expecting a movie comparable to the mind-blowing spectacle that was 'Gladiator', and you can credibly pronounce it as a good popcorn movie.</fullReview>

That 1959 version was a stellar production that still holds the gold to this day.It feels from the get go that 2016's version was trying it's hardest not to be compared to that epic. First off, this Ben-Hur seems far more grounded in real life, with a production design that seems more realistic.Speaking of "realistic", I loved how they took more from the book Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ, by Lew Wallace (The book the films were adapted from) by adding the fact that Juda Ben-Hur and Jesus Christ knew each other back in the day, and how these two effected one another lives, giving a new arch to the story.The down-to-Earth tone did not effect the movies epic capabilities. The set design of the movie was actually quite amazing. The Roman Colosseum was an impressive set to look at.Which is the start to the key scene of the movie. The chariot race. that was the part in the 1959 Ben-Hur and the 1925 version that came before, that made those movies. 2016's action sequence was pretty stellar, but I must admit, in this day and age when most movies give us this type of action, I was not fully blown away this scene, not that it's not good, but it does not impress as much as 1959's version.There were still some great scenes in the film. Like when Ben-Hur was getting trained to be a Chariot rider by Ilderim, a rich African played by Morgan Freeman. Thought I like the scene, this was the movie that made me tired of seeing Freeman's old spiritual negro dropping knowledge on these white boys routine.And with that, 2016's Ben-Hur still does not hold a candle to the 1959 version if it's able to point out how tiring Freeman's archetype is. It was a good effort to go back to the book and try to sum up something no one has ever done with Ben-Hur, and the production design was actually remarkable, so was the music added to that design, yet still it does not click altogether to make it epic.http://cinemagardens.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie well suited for plebes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben-Hur is a movie for plebes. This is yet another cash crab remake from Hollywood. If you see this movie, you are pretty much supporting the imminent Back to the Future remake.Ben-Hur is not only dull, tripe fan fiction in the story department, but it lacks imagination or gusto in its action. The CGI is a mess. The acting - just ridiculous.Overall, Ben-Hur is a movie well suited for plebes and fat Americans who will eat up garbage movies like these. They eat up garbage and ARE garbage. You would never find such disgraceful films or movie-making in Europe. Here we have a respect for art.1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think most of all watched old Ben-Hur. It's running time is 3h 32min's. The 2016 version had 2h 4min's and no lags but only extreme action. In Ben-Hur (1959) the director shoots Jesus with side and back angles. At that time there is no popular Jesus movies. But in new Ben- hur you can see Jesus and he speaks about love and peace. This movie is about making love and peace between people. 1959 version Won 11 Oscars.But 2016 version will change people's behaviour. The film is produced by Roma Downey and Mark Burnett. They also produced the BIBLE series and most of Christian films. Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ is a novel by Lew Wallace and considered the most influential Christian book of the 19th century. I don't like the healing scene of Judah's mother and sister and is not like in the 1959 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an Oscar worthy movie but a movie for the family!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of classic Ben Hur that won 11 Oscar awards (That I haven't watched yet). The main character of this movie is Judah Ben Hur and he is a fictional character and the title character from Lew Wallace's 1880 novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ.Ben-Hur is a 2016 American epic historical action drama film directed by Timur Bekmambetov the director of Wanted, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and Hardcore Henry so what do you expect for this movie? THE BLOODY CHARIOT RACING!I love historical films so I enjoyed this movie, but not a lot! The performance of Rodrigo Santoro as Jesus Christ for me is amazing because his scenes were actually effective to this movie! Aside from Santoro, Jack Huston as Judah Ben-hur and Toby Kebbell as Messala is okay to me, okay means not good but not bad as well.3 over 5 stars! Not an Oscar worthy movie but a movie for the family!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Content and story-wise this is a below average but the movie will survive for acting and action sequence.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of 1959 Oscar winning classic Ben Hur. I think right now Hollywood depend on the excessive remake and adapted story and almost all of them failed to create any success. They should give concentration on the fundamental storyline and well- written script. Because without a good script all of the efforts may be will go wrong. In the recent day's maximum comic book adaptation, remake, based on true story and adapted storyline movie complete;y disappointed me. Very few movies meet the expectation and made an impact on the audience and has done good business.I already said this is a remade movie and there are lots of critics already searched millions of wrongs in this movie and I know the paid critics will not give good ratings for this movie. Anyways, this is not a very good movie or an Oscar worthy movie. Trade analyst already declared this is one of the most summer risks in 2016. The direction is not up to the mark and the director completely failed to maintain the pace which is very important for a historic drama movie. The script is not well written and at least 5-6 times I failed to follow the subplot. Content could have been better and the theme is very confusing for realizing and several subplots created over the top impacts. The main positive point is the acting. Jack Huston has done a wonderful job and Morgan Freeman also has done a fair job for the role of Ilderim. background score is good and you will enjoy it. The action sequence is very well made and the CGI using is good. The director missed a very good opportunity and if he concentrates about the content and the subplots this would be a nice movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not better then the Original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you didn't know the original movie Ben-Hur 1925. Had a lot more of a plot story. Basically, in the original, the main person (Ben- Hur) meets Jesus Christ, and Jesus gives him water. This was a great movie especially in the 1900's. I'll tell you, what is wrong with the current Ben-Hur, showing in movies soon. Ben-Hur had a discount Morgan Freeman, which honestly you could have chosen better people than him. I love Morgan Freeman, for some reason, I feel like he doesn't fix in this movie, trust me, this isn't the main problem with the movie. It has mostly the same plot-line as the original. But it really isn't, it doesn't have the same feel as the original. Basically, there's no "Jesus" in this movie. Which is a huge down point? Jesus appears in the original which makes it spectacular and awesome.The original makes sure Ben-Hur is jailed and executed. The "new movie" doesn't really include this, at all. The only basic thing in this movie is the chariot race, which mostly is the main action scene. But the new one does have better scenery because you know it 's 2016. Thanks for reading my review :3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best re-make I've seen! Can you name one that is better?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben-Hur is surprisingly good for a re-make! This movie is much shorter than the 1959 version but still did a great job covering the story without leaving any holes. The pace started a little bit slow but it picked up as the movie went on. Every actor and actress in this film was perfectly chosen for their role with no "weak links". This movie had a $100 Million budget and it showed! The special effects were stunning and even better in 3-D. I expect a lot of people will give this remake a bad review simply because they want to stay loyal to the original. It had been 57 years. With how Hollywood works these days, it was long overdue to try for a re- make. Do yourself a favor and give this movie a chance. You will not be disappointed.I challenge you to find a better re-make than this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEN There &amp; Done That</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen this movie yet. Question: How in the world can you even compete with the 1959 gem with all the seasoned actors, story writers, director, musical scores and depth or commitment to the project itself when choosing this movie to remake? What was anyone thinking? I read the book which was not very inviting but full of here &amp; there bits and pieces but having first seen the 1959 made it easier and memorable to do. One of the strengths of the first movie was not focusing on Christ himself but on the story and events He brought about. After all, the movie is about Ben Hur. In this remake, they give Jesus a starring role, they tell the same story with minor changes, reproduce a classic race and want us to fall under the spell of the concept. But that is just the point. The concept has its origins in the 1959 movie. How do we know this? Ask anyone who has seen it how many times did they watch it again &amp; again? That should tell you that it is a classic, must see top of the line high bar movie with unforgettable scenes. Today, Hollywood may have the words but not the music. They have the money but not the talent and if they would concentrate on quality instead of rate of return, they would get both. I will see this movie because you can't go wrong in the story which captures ones imagination for it is down to earth, emotional pulls and pushes. But looking forward to seeing it? No, you will have to try harder Hollywood to get that. For you first timers, see the 1959 version first then go see this or read the book. Then, you will know what I know and be happy and content.</fullReview>
