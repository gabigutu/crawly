		<shortDescription>The Genius of Buster Keaton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably Buster Keaton's best film, and oddly enough, it's not even a straightforward comedy ? it's actually an action film, with clever doses of romance and comedy tossed in for good measure. `The General', which is set during the Civil War, is about a train engineer named Johnny Gray (Buster Keaton, of course) who tries to enlist in the Confederate Army . . . and is turned down because the army feels he'd be much more valuable for the war effort as an engineer instead of a soldier. However, through a series of misunderstandings, both Johnny's family and his girl think he's a coward, and they refuse to speak to him until he becomes a soldier. Months pass, and Johnny, sad and alone, is piloting his train ? the General ? when it is stolen from him by the North. Johnny's efforts to recover the General ? and to win back his girl's love ? become an unbelievably funny and action-packed series of events, as Johnny tries to go from being a sad-sack buffoon to being a hero.If you haven't watched many silent films, they demand a greater amount of attention than `normal' film ? there are no audio cues; and volumes can be spoken with a simple facial expression. Buster Keaton is amazingly expressive, as he's fully capable of going from wildly happy to downtrodden and sad in the blink of an eye. While funny, Keaton is much more than just a clownish figure ? he manages to evoke a lot of sympathy as well, and he genuinely becomes what can only be described as an action hero as well. His timing, whether for a joke or for a tender moment, is absolutely impeccable.What's also great about `The General' is the sheer amount of stunts and physical humor ? a movie like this couldn't be made today. No amount of insurance would cover it. Keaton does all his own stunts, and manages to perform a number of feats that are simultaneously hilarious and dangerous ? he chases down `The General' with a bike, he sits on a moving cattlecatcher, knocking away railroad ties with a tie of his own. All these stunts are fantastic, but it's scary to think that any one of these probably could've killed Keaton if something even went slightly wrong. `The General' is a lot more than slapstick. Personally, I think it's one of the first films to push the envelope of movies ? it goes for action, romance, and humor, and it pulls all of those elements together into a terrific movie. If you've never seen Buster Keaton ? or, for that matter, a silent film ? go find this one and watch it. It's a classic. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understated Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton once said that if he hadn't been a comedian, he might have been a civil engineer. He was not only a mechanical whiz but a spatial genius who devised stunts and gags with the grace of pure physics. It's no wonder he adored trains, the most elegant of machines, and brought them into his movies whenever he could. When one of Keaton's former gag-writers loaned him a book recounting the theft of a locomotive from Georgia by Union raiders during the Civil War, he was immediately fired with enthusiasm to bring this "page of history" to life. His first certainty was that the production had to be "so authentic it hurts." He even insisted on using historically accurate narrow-gauge railroad tracks, which he found, along with appropriate landscapes, near the sleepy town of Cottage Grove, Oregon.Most importantly, the area had stretches of parallel tracks, which allowed scenes of Buster on his train?agilely scrambling over the cars, balancing on the roof to scan the horizon, chopping wood for the engine while armies pass unnoticed behind him?to be filmed from another train running alongside. Buster, his train, and the camera are all in motion; the wind whips through Buster's hair while smoky pine-covered hills rise and fall around him. These scenes are not only the highlight of the movie but a peak in the history of *moving* pictures, and they put to shame all later back-projection and process shots, models and computer-generated effects. The quality of Keaton's film-making is simply?pun intended?unparalleled. Every shot in The General is clean, fresh and efficiently composed; the action is captured honestly and legibly at all times. The film never tries to be beautiful; its beauty is functional, just like the grave, masculine beauty of the locomotives and railroad bridges and Civil War uniforms.The General's narrative structure is as strong and uncluttered as its look. Like a train, it stays on track, never meandering for the sake of a laugh or a stunt. All of the gags rise organically from the coherent and straightforward storyline. Adapting the historical incident, Keaton made himself the engineer of the stolen train (Johnnie Gray), rather than one of the raiders. As he saw immediately, The General is one long chase, or rather two chases, structured like the flight of a boomerang. First Johnnie on a borrowed train, the Texas, chases his own stolen train, the General. He manages to steal it back and races it towards his own lines, pursued by the raiders in the Texas, who try to prevent him from carrying their battle plans to his own high command.The General is not Keaton's funniest film, but here he was going for quality over quantity in laughs. A number of the gags, like the box-car that keeps appearing and disappearing as it switches tracks, have a long build-up for a relatively modest payoff. But the laughter is mingled with a gasp of awe, and the best moments never get stale on repeated viewings. The cannon attached to the back of Buster's train goes off just as the train starts around a curve, so the ball flies straight and hits the raiders' train coming out of the curve. Riding on the cowcatcher, Buster hurls one railroad tie at another lying across the tracks, striking it precisely so that it flips out of the way. A forlorn Buster sits on the crossbar of his train's wheels, so lost in thought he doesn't notice when the train starts to move, carrying him up and down in gentle arcs: stillness in motion.I agree with author Jim Kline who describes The General as Keaton's most personal film, the one that best captures his unique vision, spirit and personality. In many of his films, Buster starts off as an inept or effete character and develops into a hero. But his competent, ingenious and athletic character in The General, who is also modest, tireless, and underestimated, comes much closer to his real nature. There is a shot in The General of Buster's eye isolated on screen, framed by a hole in a white table-cloth, that has always reminded me of Dziga Vertov's kinoglaz, the "camera-eye." Keaton melds with his camera; there's no distinction between his qualities as a performer and the qualities of his movies. They have the same silence, the same strictness, the same strange blend of gravity and humor.The General might be the most serious comedy every made, but it's not a tragicomedy. That, as in Chaplin's blending of pathos and low humor, was something people took to immediately. But no one knew what to make of The General. Original reviews accused the film of being dull, pretentious, unoriginal, and unfunny. Even today, people who have heard it acclaimed as one of the greatest movies of all time are sometimes puzzled or disappointed by it on first viewing. The General is challenging because it doesn't flaunt its virtues; like Keaton's concise and economical performance, it holds a great deal in reserve. Take the movie's most famous shot, of a train crashing through a burning bridge, for which Keaton built a real bridge and destroyed a real train. The shot lasts a few seconds in the finished film: he doesn't dwell on it or hype it. Who else in Hollywood would sink money in a spectacular effect and then downplay it? Keaton never forces a response from the audience, never manipulates, never overplays. He doesn't show off his acrobatic skills or his enormous repertoire of comic talents, nor does he play for sympathy. Anything so subtle will always leave some people cold. But for those who can see the expressiveness of Buster's so-called "stone face," who get his peculiar dry humor, who appreciate the rigorous purity and taste he displayed, these virtues are all the more stunning because they are understated. Buster Keaton always has more than he's showing; you can see it in his eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Richly inventive comedy with a logically impeccable plot that makes the hyperbolic slapstick seem plausible and inevitable; this is a work of art and a work of genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton's "The General," about a man and his engine, puts you in a world where the most comically inventive situation that could happen will happen. From major comic situations to throwaway gags, "The General" always knows what to do.The story begins in leisurely fashion. A title card tells us that Johnnie Gray (Keaton) has two loves in his life: his engine and his girl?respectively, The General and Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack). Johnnie goes to visit Annabelle, followed by two engineer-worshipping boys and, unknown to him, Annabelle Lee herself. He and his entourage arrive at the door; Johnnie polishes his shoes on the back of his pants legs, slicks back his hair, and gently taps the door with the door knocker. Then he turns to notice Annabelle. Keaton's understated reaction is a testament to his uniqueness. Any other comedian would have done an explosive double-take.Now Johnnie and Annabelle are together in her parlor, but the boys are there, too. Johnnie stands up, puts on his hat and opens the door as if to leave. The hero-worshippers are ready to follow, but Johnnie lets them out first, then closes the door on them. This is a gentle ruse in the world of silent comedy. At Keystone both boys would have gotten kicked in the pants.Now the two are alone. Annabelle's father sees them from another room and is about to break things up when her brother enters and announces that Fort Sumter has been fired upon: the War Between the States has begun. Annabelle kisses her father and brother as they go to enlist, then turns expectantly to Johnnie, who cocks his head like a confused puppy. She asks, "Aren't you going to enlist?" Realization hits him, and he leaps off the seat. Before he can run out the door, Annabelle kisses him. This so overwhelms Johnnie that he flings out his arm in a farewell gesture and falls off the porch.Johnnie races to the general store, which is now a makeshift recruitment office. Taking a shortcut he manages to be the first in line. The door to the office is opened and Johnnie comes marching in?only he and the rest of the line go in two different directions, and he has to jump over several tables to get in front again. He gives the enlistment officer his name and occupation, but the man rejects him. Johnnie is more valuable to the South as an engineer. Later, Annabelle believes that Johnnie didn't even try to enlist. She refuses to speak to him again until he's in uniform. What follows is a classic moment: Johnnie sits on the connecting rod of his engine. He's so miserable that he doesn't notice when he starts moving up and down, until just before the train enters a tunnel.Time passes and we learn that a group of Unionists are secretly passengers on The General. When (nearly) everyone is off the train having dinner, the Unionists climb back aboard and take the engine. Annabelle, a passenger herself, was still on board. She is now their prisoner.But Johnnie only knows his beloved General has been stolen, possibly by deserters. He pursues the engine by taking another, The Texas. Through a mishap he becomes the sole person aboard The Texas, but the Unionists think they're outnumbered and continue to run. What follows is the true joy of the movie: two long chases (separated by an important plot twist). Now the movie changes its quiet pace for almost nonstop action.I love it when the Unionists break off the rail car to hinder The Texas. At one point, the car, which Johnnie thought he had switched to another track, reappears in front of the baffled engineer, only to disappear later just as mysteriously. We see the logical circumstances that lead to the car's seeming magic act, and the equally logical situations that keep Keaton occupied, preventing him from seeing what we see.Comic logic is important to "The General." In no other movie do hyperbolic slapstick gags seem so plausible and inevitable. In a throwaway gag, Johnnie empties a burlap sack full of shoes because he urgently needs the sack. Of course?of course!?he loses his own shoe in the pile and must stop to hunt for it.We move to the second chase, where Johnnie has The General and the Unionists are the ones pursuing him. Now Johnnie must contend with Annabelle Lee.Marion Mack leaves no mark of her personality on the screen. She deserves credit mainly for being willing and able to take it. Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn were never thrown around, trod upon or knocked about the way Marion Mack was. She has hilarious moments. The excitement of the chase does not prevent her from taking out a broom to sweep the dusty floor of the engine. An exasperated Johnnie tells her to keep throwing wood into the fire. She takes a small stick and daintily puts it in. Johnnie sarcastically hands her a sliver, and she puts that in, too. Then, in a moment that has an audience roaring and clapping, Johnnie grabs her and half-throttles her before kissing her instead.The final section, most of it a battle scene, includes the shot where The Texas begins to cross a burning bridge, only to crash into the river. Owing to Keaton's disdain of fakery (one of several reasons his works seem modern) he did not use a model but a real train on a real burning bridge. The crash cost $42,000?reportedly making it the single most expensive shot ever in a silent film.A worthy closing gag was too taxing even for Keaton's ingenuity. Johnnie's dilemma is to kiss his girl while saluting the passing soldiers. His remedy is only mildly funny. Is anyone complaining? "The General" is a work of art and a work of genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest War Comedy ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is "generally" (or should I pun and say "General Lee"?) said that the best comedy of the silent film career of Buster Keaton's career was his Civil War epic THE GENERAL. Apparently planned with more care than any of his other film projects, it involved not only researching a period of history some sixty years in the past, but getting the correct rolling stock, costumes, weapons, and props to make it look correct. And it worked so well that Keaton never really could (despite some great moments in STEAMBOAT BILL JR.) out-do it. In fact, the closest thing to his best sound film (or film that he influenced that was a sound film) was his work with Red Skelton in the comedy A SOUTHERN YANKEE, where he returned to a Civil War theme.THE GENERAL (as I mentioned in discussing the Disney film THE GREAT LOCOMOTIVE CHASE) is based on the "Andrews Raiders" stealing of the Confederate locomotive "The General", and an attached train, which was used to damage tracks and bridges. The raid (in February 1862) was from northern Georgia into Tennesee. It only lasted 20 miles, as the coal for the train was used up and not replaced. Andrews and several raiders were hanged after a trial. Others went to southern prisoner of war camps. The effect of the incident far outstripped it's military success. The damage (after all) could be repaired. But like Jimmy Doolittle's Raid over Tokyo in April 1942, it had a tremendous effect hurting Confederate morale. The area attacked was hundreds of miles from the battlefronts of Virginia or Kentucky/Northern Tennessee that were in the current events of the War at the time, and so was considered safe by the Confederate government and public. Instead it had been shown quite easy for Northern raiders to hit and run for awhile.Despite it being a brief incident of the war, the locomotive chase would remain famous after more important events were forgotten. The actual locomotive is still in existence in a museum in the south. When Lesney did it famous series of "Models of Yesteryear" the first locomotive that was included in that series of collectible toys was "The General".The story, however, was ultimately a downer. But Keaton took the basic tale and made it a comedy of the period. First he changes the viewer's perspective - it is not concentrating on Andrews and his men, but on the Confederates. Secondly, he builds up the story of Johnny Gray, a railroad engineer who tries to enlist but is rejected (the twist of logic failure in the script is that the Confederate draft board head does not bother to explain to Johnny that he is more useful as an engineer to the cause than as a soldier). Because Keaton's family and girl friend (Marion Mack) see he is not enlisted, they believe he turned coward.Johnny eventually is the only person who tries to retake "the General" from the raiders, and the film has actually two chases in it - first Andrews and his men stealing the train, and then Keaton sneaking into Northern lines with Mack and retaking it.Along the way are many comic classic moments, such as Keaton carefully standing on the cowcatcher and carefully using physics to knock off broken wooden ties that might derail the train, or when (at a moment of dejection) Keaton sits on the connecting rod that links the trains wheels and finds himself pulled into the locomotive barn while in a sitting positions. The situation of fighting the Yankees during the second chase, and finding Marion Mack there "helping" him, are wonderful - especially when she judges which lumps of coal are pretty enough to be used to keep the engine fired (she throws away the ugly little ones). Keaton's reaction to her stupidity is a wonderful moment.The classic conclusion of the comedy is the battle of the two sides at the river, and the burning of the railroad bridge (with it's destruction of a second locomotive). It has been called the most expensive sight gag in history. By the way, the Northern General who ordered the locomotive across the bridge is of some special interest. He was Mike "Turkey Strut" Donlin, a frequent member (and starring player) of the old New York Giants under John McGraw and Christy Matthewson in the first two decades of the 20th Century. Donlin (who got his funny nickname from the way he ran the bases) left baseball to become a film actor (he had worked a bit in vaudeville). Keaton was a sports fan (and showed this in his film COLLEGE, where he shows his abilities in several sports) and hired Donlin. This was the latter's most famous performance - look at his reaction to the collapse.It must be regarded as Keaton's finest film, and certainly the best war comedy to come out in the silent period. It may also be the best war comedy to come out of any period of motion pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Comedy Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE GENERAL represents the greatest achievement screen comedy ever accomplished. From the brilliant gag construction to the sheer excellence of the filmmaking technique, THE GENERAL is a hilarious and amazing journey into comedy. Written and directed by Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman, Keaton brings brilliant gags into the story. The film begins when Keaton is told he is of no use to the South as a soldier, but as a train engineer. However, his girlfriend refuses to talk to him until he is in uniform. After the war has started, the girl is kidnapped by some Union raiders on Keaton's train, and so begins the greatest (and funniest) chase ever filmed. For the next 75 minutes, the viewer is in Keaton's world. His gags, routines and amazing slapstick serve to make this the greatest screen comedy ever filmed.-Matt, age 16</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loco and Motive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one will top Keaton for physical risk, and risk is what deep film experiences are all about. This might be classed as a comedy, but for me it touches deeply enough. Its about a man who needs to prove himself by taking risks and being true. And its by a man who takes even greater risks and is more true. True to the spirit of the social compact, here displayed as the chummy south.He's always done stunts that amaze. Many of his other films have things in them that if the timing were only a little off, he'd be seriously injured, or die. But this takes the cake. Its almost as if he started with the idea that he'd have three locos to play with and had a year to think up stunts. And the stunts are so physical! And so dangerous. And so, so very effective. His trademark is the deadpan face placed as a sort of innocent cluelessness. Its particularly funny when you see the physical movements and you know that 1) they take incredible preparation and timing to pull off and 2) the fellow you see that looks so puzzled by the reality you see is the guy that devised and directed those stunts.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Humor, Action, &amp; Melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great masterpieces of cinema, Buster Keaton's "The General" combines inventive humor with terrific action and fine melodrama, all beautifully and carefully planned and photographed. It is filled with subtle and wonderful details that make it well worth devoting your full attention to watching. As an extra bonus, it offers a fascinating look at the Civil War era, with many realistic details, inspired by a historical incident.After a short opening sequence, the movie divides nicely into two halves. Johnny (Keaton) is a railway engineer, turned down in his attempts to enlist in the Confederate Army and subsequently rejected by his girl. Continuing with the railroad, one day his locomotive is stolen by Union spies, who also kidnap his girl. Johnny first chases the engine into Union territory to recapture it, and then is himself chased by the Northern Army as he attempts to return home. Both chases are filled with excitement and manic fun, with some breathtaking stunts by Keaton thrown in. It all leads up to a dramatic and memorable climax that includes many ironic and suggestive touches.Keaton is at his best, with the story offering him a perfect showcase for his many talents. His slapstick and acrobatic skills are given free rein, and his character's stoic perseverance is a fine complement to the frantic action.This belongs near the top of any list of great films, a classic worth watching and re-watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An instant favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't had so much fun watching a movie for a long time. The General is a silent comedy (mostly slapstick) about Johnny Gray, a train engineer with two loves: his engine and Annabelle Lee. Annabelle soon dumps him because of his failure to enlist into the Civil War (they would not take him because he was too valuable as an engineer). Things are then sped up a year, where we see some Union commanders planning to hijack a train to unleash a highly sophisticated master plan. As it so happens, they steal Johnny's engine, a big mistake.Buster Keaton does a phenomenal performance as Johnny. His face and character is ideal for this type of comedy. He reminds me a lot of Leslie Nielsen from the Naked Gun movies (but, of course, less old). He is often ignorant of what is going on around him, leading to plenty of laughs. This also makes him a very charismatic character.There are countless train related jokes. The first one comes right at the beginning, when we see Johnny being followed by two kids and a woman, in a line much like a train. The bulk of the movie is made up of Johnny running a train, either chasing or fleeing from the Union soldiers. The movement and maneuvering of the trains is beautiful. The stunt work is an incredible accomplishment. The finale is explosive.The General was a lot of fun to watch. It gave me more laughs than most modern comedies, and had plenty of substance on top of that. This is enough for me to label it as one of the greatest comedies ever. After my first viewing, it instantly became one of my favorites. It is timeless gem that should be watched at least once by anyone interested in movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen one other silent movie in my life, but it was Mel Brooks's The Silent Movie so I don't know if it really counts. I really enjoyed The General overall, more than I thought I would as someone who was born after The Godfather.The main thing that surprised me was the fact that I couldn't look down to write very many notes; any time I took my eyes off the screen I ran a serious risk of missing something. It seems to me that the film, even though it was long (or seemed so), it was very dense in terms of action. I imagine that since the movie has no dialogue, the filmmakers must make up for it by making it as visually interesting and entertaining as possible. I am accustomed to more modern movies with snappy dialogue and special effects and such-movies in which you can look down at your popcorn or kiss your date and not miss too much because you can hear pretty much what's happening. This was a nice change for me.Obviously, I've never seen a Buster Keaton film, and I'm not even sure if I'd heard of him before this class. But I can see why he is so appealing in his films. I loved his facial expressions, particularly the stoic-but-crestfallen look in his eyes on the train when something else goes wrong. He also has great control of his body, as we discussed in class, and a fine sense of comic timing.I found the film surprisingly funny. Many modern films that I think are funny (e.g. Austin Powers, Toy Story, American Beauty) rely largely on witty or outrageous dialogue for their humor. As a silent film, The General must rely mainly on images for its humor-the slapstick images of Johnnie falling over constantly, the unusual image of Johnnie riding up and down on the crossbar between the train wheels, the stereotype exploitation in the scene when the girl sweeps out the locomotive. I'm sure that some of the things that I considered amusing might not have been considered funny by the original audience, such as the record-scratch lightning bolts.I really liked some of the cinematic techniques and blocking that Keaton used. One of my favorite scenes in the entire film is when Johnnie is chopping wood on the train while the Southern army retreats in the opposite direction in the background. Even though the `real' army is pulling back, the one they didn't want is rushing into enemy territory. It's a nice integration of plot and character commentary. I also liked the way he kept cutting back and forth between the Yankees on their trains and Johnnie on his, at first the pursuer, then the pursuee. By continually showing us what both sides are doing, Keaton builds the tension between them, adds to the comic effect, and keeps the audience interested by always giving them something different to look at. This montage technique is used in nearly all action films and many comedy films today.I did not realize that the rain and fire sound effects were added in later. I think they are interesting, and I can see why someone put them in, but I think I would prefer that the film be left the way it was originally shown. Or at least they should take out the chirping birds. Some people complained about the repetitiveness of the music, but I found the music quaint and very much in the character of the movie. It was as if each person or group had its own theme music, perhaps to make up for the lack of dialogue. The use of the `Beautiful Dreamer' love theme reminds me of the `Dreamweaver' love theme in Wayne's World that plays when Garth sees the blonde woman.Although the battle scene was interesting, I agreed with much of the class that the movie could have ended earlier. The movie seemed to change a bit once the entire army got involved and the focus left Johnnie for a time. Perhaps they could have ended the battle scene with the Southern army lying in wait for the enemy, and then cut to a later scene in which Johnnie receives an honorary enlistment so he can get the girl. But hey, then Keaton wouldn't have gotten to play with the bridge fire and the dam; maybe audiences then weren't so different from us, and would prefer an exciting ending for a movie like this over a more subdued one. But I still think it changed the character of the movie and should have been changed somehow.Overall I give it a 9/10. If you've never seen a silent movie, this is a great one to start with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If you lose this war, don't blame me".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have eventually gotten around to watching this film, but my curiosity was piqued when I saw that it had miraculously jumped to Number #17 on the 2007 version of AFI's Top 100 Movies of all time list. It didn't make the cut at all for the original compilation in 1997, so even before seeing the picture, I had to wonder what might have affected movie critics in the intervening decade to reach this conclusion. I usually line up with the majority in most cases, but I have to admit, I don't quite get it with this picture. I found it entertaining enough on occasion, but I never got the sense that it was one of the great comedy classics of all time the way it's heralded on the DVD sleeve. I don't think the Civil War lends itself much to comedy, so right there my expectations were greatly reduced. Keaton's somber demeanor and generally stone faced disposition don't help. On the flip side, I wouldn't have expected slapstick to move the story along either, so at least I wasn't disappointed in that regard.What I DID enjoy were some rather offbeat moments that showed genuine creativity. When Johnnie Gray (Keaton) dejectedly considered his rejection by the Confederate Army, and pondered his situation while sitting on the train's connecting rod, the resulting visual was pure genius. The up and down motion lent a truly surreal juxtaposition to Johnnie's thoughtful reverie, and was one of the highlights of the picture for me.The other significant scene that gave me pause was when The Texas collapsed on the burning Rock River Bridge. For starters, I found it unbelievable that a wooden bridge could possibly be constructed strong enough to support a locomotive. Then I came to learn that the scene was the most expensive ever made for a silent film, and I have to give Keaton credit for going out on that kind of a limb - unbelievable.Oh yes, and I can't forget the sequence where Keaton's marksmanship is dead on when he makes contact with the rail tie blocking the train tracks, flipping it out of the way with a well timed throw of his own. Could that have possibly been done in one take? In a pre-CGI world, it's difficult to imagine how stunts like these could have been performed, particularly by an actor who had no recourse but to do his own. For that, Keaton deserves accolades.In between all this clever film making however, I just wasn't inspired. The central plot element doesn't hold up for me - if Johnnie Gray was rejected as a volunteer, why wasn't he simply told the reason why. One could argue that then, you wouldn't have a picture, but for me it left the story on a shaky footing. If Johnnie was more valuable as a train engineer than a soldier, the picture might have taken a different approach, but the rest of the elements could have remained the same and he still would have come out a hero. Maybe I'm second guessing a master, but that's what I come away with.Conclusion - if this movie didn't make AFI's Top 100 Film List in 1997, I don't understand what might have occurred in the intervening years to suddenly have film critics vault it into the Top 20. At the same time, Chaplin's "City Lights", in my estimation a superior silent film, fell OFF the list, while "The Gold Rush" moved up a few notches. I may not be a professional, but I know what I like, and this one just didn't do it for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buster Keaton always amazes me. He was truly one of the most hilarious deadpan screen clowns of early cinema. And The General, even clocking in at around three hours, is surprisingly watchable based on his physical performance alone.Granted, I still admit that I prefer the silent clowns in shorts, because it can be a bit exhausting to watch them in an entire feature, especially since they are often strings of vignettes thrown together and my modern brain prefers to edit out everything that's unnecessary, but some of the joy in these films is found in those very moments. There are multiple points in the General, a story about a Southern engineer that has to rescue his beloved from the clutches of the North in the Civil War, where Keaton's character, Johnnie Gray, has to stop his train, jump out, and remove something from the tracks, which in itself can be quite boring, but the way that Keaton injects physical comedy into those moments keeps me entertained.And it's a marvel how so many realistic, yet comedic stunts that Keaton could come up with. It's nothing fantastic like some of his other films, but it's still funny. And I think the strongest point of his comedy is his completely stonefaced response to all adversity--but he lets you see just a little his plight in his eyes and it's just enough to know that he is frightened, but that the rest of him doesn't react similarly creates such an amusing dissociation that it goes from bizarre to funny. Whether he's pratfalling due to surprise or erroneously succeeding at something he's unskilled in and being shocked by it, that response of his is winning.But the General does show its age a little. It exists in a time when people were still getting quite used to movies and so there is a lot of space that doesn't get edited out to help people get a better sense of the context. I wouldn't dare cut those moments out of this film, even if I could re-edit it, because the space always had something going on, but at the same time, this film, if made today, would be cut to one-and-a-half, or two hours and pack in the comedy more tightly. The plot and story are simple, but exist more than to just help the comedy move along--except at the end when the first story was accomplished. Then we move into a second extraneous, but still amusing, story regarding a battle between the North and the South that could've been excised and still having a decent, though simple, story.I didn't really love the score that the DVD company attached to it, which is a number of classical pieces end on end. I think a new commissioned soundtrack would've better matched the piece, but I guess we get what we get. And on the plus side, you can always mute the movie and play whatever on top of it.Is it perfect? No. But despite the age it shows, it still holds up as an enjoyable work from one of cinema's greatest physical comedians. If you want to spend three hours with a silent clown, this is not a bad way to go. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buster Keaton is simply awesome, only he could pull off a film like this. Everything about it was superb, while his other films made me laugh, this is the only silent to make me laugh so hard my sides hurt.

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton 's performance in "The General" was purely enjoyable. The story takes place during the civil war on centers on Johnnie Gray (Keaton) a train operator in the South. Johnnie is not accepted for service in the confederate army because of his value on the railroad, and suffers the shame of being home while the other men are fighting a war. When his beloved engine is hijacked by Union soldiers the unpredictable story goes into overdrive. Johnnie's adventure includes train chases, rescuing the love of his life, a daring escape, and a climactic battle. This film has a distinct action/adventure aspect, but at its core it is a brilliant comedy/drama. Keaton's performance is superb. He has the ability to effortlessly change your mood, and the mood of the film with his facial expressions and physical comedy. Keaton's character seems to make endless mistakes that work for the best, and good decisions in dangerous situations. It is easy to imagine Keaton as a major influence for a future comedians, and I personally felt like I was watching the Mel Brooks of a previous generation. "The General" was a fun film to watch with a true star Buster Keaton turning in a timeless heartfelt performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The General (1926)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When watching The General (1926), the similarities between Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin are almost unmistakable. The story was original and humorous and the performance by Buster Keaton was pleasing. What I didn't like was the fact that the protagonist still was pursuing the girl who was so quick to leave him when she thought he wasn't brave, and then ends up staying with her at the end. He is too good for her. I thought the stunt where the bridge gives out and the train falls was very well done and must have cost a fortune. There were scenes where I found myself laughing out loud, and scenes where I was bored. So unfortunately the film doesn't do a great job at keeping the viewer glued to the screen, but overall it was enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The General</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel the The General is a great silent film because even though the story line is relatively complicated the way in which each character played their part and the way it was filmed made it easy to follow. I am fairly new to the silent film experience and when I saw that this movie was partially a comedy I was expecting something more along the lines of Charlie Chaplin, however I was pleasantly surprised at Buster Keatons more subtle comedic style. I felt that the film was well shot shot considering the technology of the day. I was actually shocked during the scene where the Rock River Bridge collapsed under The Texas. Knowing full well it was not special effects I couldn't believe the producers would spare the expense of destroying a locomotive and an entire bridge. This movie is sure to be one of my favorite silent films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Second Favorite Buster Keaton Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnnie Gray, a train engineer, tries to enlist in the Confederate Army to impress his girlfriend. Unfortunately, he is rejected because his role as engineer is deemed more important. Lucky for Gray, he is given the opportunity to prove himself when a band of Union soldiers in disguise hijack a train.At the time of this film's release, it was a flop and considered to be not very funny. Since then, it has gone on to be declared one of the greatest films of all time. Funny how that works. I would tend to agree that it isn't really very funny, but it is a great film for a variety of reasons.Buster Keaton was an amazing actor and director. He was willing to put himself in dangerous situations for a laugh -- he was his own stuntman, right there when the train falls in the water, really sitting on the side of a moving train and on the front of it... he could have been killed. And this was captured on film flawlessly.Personally, I enjoyed his "Sherlock Jr" better. I thought the tricks were better and the action funnier. It had a faster pace, too, that kept me hooked enough to watch it a few times. "The General" was not boring, but as a silent film it could have done more to grab the audience and I'm not sure that it did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fall in love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first encountered Buster Keaton in "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum." Reviewers made frequent reference to his status as a "silent film great", but I paid no mind. To me, silent films were Chaplin, and Chaplin leaves me cold. And thus, in my mind, silent film buffs were arty snots who feigned interest in quaint old things to show how sophisticated they were. Nobody, I thought, could really like that stuff.But I joined Netflix, and their little recommendation system suggested "The General". The picture of Buster Keaton atop a locomotive promised some action. The guy had been funny in "Forum". I could stream it, effectively for free, as a bonus while awaiting my next DVD. What did I have to lose?Aside from my preconceptions, that is.Within fifteen seconds I totally forgot that I was watching one of those classic silent films. I was totally engrossed in letting Buster tell me a story. And as the film progressed, I moved from rapt interest to amusement to amazement to -- well, to something akin to falling in love. I would never see silent film -- or, of course, silent film buffs -- the same way again.Keaton's Johnnie Gray is an earnest, conscientious, courteous little fellow who gets undeservedly emasculated: He's rejected by the Confederate army (because he's more valuable on the railroad), and by his girl and her family. And it is in Johnie's low moment that we first see how Keaton handles his films: a death-defying stunt, in which Buster rides the connecting rod of an antique narrow-gauge locomotive -- isn't played as a stunt. It's played as subtle, poignant humor, with Johnnie's beloved General comforting him by rocking him gently like a mother rocking her baby.A year later, a sad and forsaken Johnnie still tends his train. His girl, Annabelle Lee, is about to board, heading off to tend to her wounded father. She still loves Johnnie -- else why would she go to the trouble of taunting him with her brother's war ribbons while pretending to ignore him? Johnnie, silent and subdued, watches with his haunted eyes.But Union spies steal Johnny's beloved General -- with Annabelle Lee aboard. Johnnie takes off in pursuit, undaunted by any obstacle. He wins our admiration and sympathy not because he's asking for them; he's too busy recovering his train, his girl, and his honor. He wins us over because he's who he is: brave, resourceful, and dogged in pursuit of his goal.The things he does in that pursuit take your breath away. Suffice it to say he gets hold of another train, and does things aboard as it speeds along, as nonchalantly as you might reach for a light switch. A moment that stands out for me -- neglected by other commentators -- finds Buster casually riding along on the cowcatcher, picking splinters out of his hands, until he notices an uncoupled boxcar hindering his progress. How he deals with the recalcitrant boxcar has to be seen to be appreciated. And there are countless such moments throughout this gem of a film.As the chase transitions, with Union officers chasing Johnnie as he heads home with his prizes, we begin to see why Johnnie loves Annabelle Lee. She's out of her element, but proves brave and resourceful and eager to help, for all her foolish moments. She never apologizes to Johnnie for misjudging him, but he never asks her to. She simply recognizes him at last for who he was all along, and shares his joy when the Confederate Army does the same.If you've never seen a silent film, or seen others but wondered what all the fuss is about, take a chance on Keaton. And you can't do better than "The General". You may find yourself becoming one of the inexplicable silent film buffs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie once, about 8 years ago, and remember few of its details. I do remember that it was one of the most enjoyable, funny, entertaining movies i've ever seen. It was a true rarity, both an epic and a comedy, and it worked as both epic and comedy. It remains the only complete Keaton movie that i've seen. I still don't seek out silent films, as i attended a festival of Chaplin movies and was sort of turned off. But Keaton's movie avoided any hint of sentimentality, even though there was a romance.I remember thinking that the only modern equivalent to this movie, almost certainly influenced by this movie, is Raiders of the Lost Ark. I've always thought Raiders was a great movie, but The General surpasses it in artistry and magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If you lose this war don't blame me."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was an early Saturday afternoon, and I was searching about for a light-hearted comedic adventure film to keep me amused until dinner was ready. My eyes suddenly fell upon 'The General,' starring the inimitable Buster Keaton, and released in 1927. I had never seen it before, but ? having greatly enjoyed the absolutely hilarious 'Sherlock Jr.' of three years earlier ? I was more than willing to give it a shot. On its initial release, 'The General' was a mammoth box office flop, by and large disparaged by the critics, though time has been kind to the film. Today, it is rightly considered a comedy masterpiece, and is often the first stepping-stone for newcomers to discover the treasure-trove of silent comedic classics released by "The Great Stone Face."Johnny Gray is Keaton's usual glum-faced character, a young man with courage, bravery and a thirst to prove himself, but ultimately without the means to do so. First in line to join the American Civil War to fight the Union, Johnny is turned away at the enlisting office due to his importance as a railway engineer, and he suffers the shame of not being able to fight with his fellow countrymen. Aside from his engine, The General ? a type 4-4-0 steam locomotive ? Johnny has but one love, Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack). However, when she is wrongly told that Johnny never even stood in line to enlist, she believes him to be a coward, and refuses to be with him until he is in uniform.One year on, Johnny finally stumbles upon a means to prove himself, when Union Army spies (headed by prolific silent film actor Glen Cavender) hijack his beloved General, and Annabelle finds herself a prisoner at the mercy of a group of cunning and unpredictable soldiers. Determined to recover what he loves, Johnny single-handedly gives chase, acquiring another locomotive, The Texas, to assist in the cross-country chase, which is based on true events. Facing setbacks at every turn in the railway, Johnny must use every inch of intellect he possesses in order to outwit his adversaries, rescue his loved ones (both the General and Annabelle) and save the day for the Confederacy.Technically, 'The General' is a cinematic marvel. A considerable portion of the movie was filmed on an actual moving train (you'll find no miniature plastic models here), and the actors ? especially Buster Keaton ? do a remarkable job of completing their performances with the additional burden of wind, motion and the potentially fatal consequences of a single misstep. As in all his films, Keaton's dedication to the medium is instantly apparent, with his character completing a wide assortment of hair-raising stunts, including jumping from the engine to a tender to a boxcar, sitting on the cow-catcher of the slow moving train while holding a railroad tie, and running along the roof. The final climactic crash of the locomotive, in which a bridge crumbles as the Texas attempts to cross it, was the single most ambitious and expensive scene of the silent era.The laughs come thick and fast, with Johnny persevering forwards despite any number of obstacles that may come his way. The film does slow down a bit during its centre portion, namely because there is temporarily not a train in sight, but, once Johnny manages to reclaim his General, things get exciting again. The second half of the film is a complete reversal of the first, with Johnny now at the helm of the locomotive being chased. Some absurdly-dangerous stunt work, and some high-speed railway thrills, makes this ride a highly entertaining one.'The General' is currently sitting in the public domain. This is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it allows practically anybody to access a copy of the film, whether it be on DVD or the internet, increasing public awareness of Keaton's films and perhaps even inspiring an interest in the silent classics that are too often neglected. On the other hand, being in the public demand means that any distributor can digitize a poor-quality print and sell it as 'The General' to make a few quick dollars. The version I uncovered was decent enough, but the soundtrack was a rather random assortment of classical music, which was passable but not ideal. Needless to say, if I were to ever encounter a high-quality print of the film, I would have absolutely no hesitation in purchasing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Failure - only in it's time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read through the various comments on this movie, I find it interesting that no one has yet mentioned that 'The General', Keaton's pinnacle was a flop in it's day. There are various theories as to why such an excellent film bombed. Some suggest that the American Civil War was simply too close at heart at the time. Veterans were immediate family members. Others suggest that Keaton's choice of making the Hero, Johnny, a southerner was an error. (If I'm not mistaken, in the book - and true story - that the film is based on, the heroes were not Confederates, making Keaton's choice just a little pondersome.)My pet theory is that Keaton alienated his fans by making a movie that is NOT a comedy. Funny, oh yes, but not a comedy. "Our Hospitiality" "Sherlock Jr." "Steamboat Bill Jr." are the sort of films that Keatons fans were accustomed to. Genuinely funny movies. But "The General" in an adventure. And in the context of silent film, it is an excellent adventure. (By today's standards it is structurally weak.) But it is not hysterically funny like most of the films in Keaton's main canon. His fans didn't know how to take it. And as a result it made considerably less money than his previous movies had. Keaton followed "The General" with the more conventional "College" and financially speaking returned to the world of successful filmmaking.Today - indeed since the resurfacing of Keaton's classics (In the late 1950s?) - we see "The General" from a distance. It is with this perspective that we see that it is in fact his best film. Amongst it's accomplishments "The General" is chock full of his most ingenious business and stunt work. The only stunt which rivals anything in "The General" would be the house collapsing on him in "Steamboat Bill Jr." and there are those who will argue that the bridge collapsing under The Texas is more spectacular. I have to say that this is simply wrong. Both are heart stopping stunts. But the house collapse seriously endangered Keaton's well being. (Possibly apocryphally, all of his crew except the cameraman left the set 'cause they "couldn't stand to watch. The cameraman closed his eyes hile he cranked.) The destruction of The Texas was then the most expensive shot in film - and may still be in adjusted dollars. (Probably not.) But nobody was imperiled by the stunt. Nobody was actually in the train.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Keaton considered this his best movie, but it was a financial and critical disappointment at the time. While its reputation has increased considerably, I find myself in agreement with the original reviewers. It's a well-made big-budget movie, but it's not Keaton's funniest by far.The movie deftly combines action and comedy, and there are some suspenseful moments amidst the slapstick. Keaton's physical skill is remarkable, although at times this made his gags more impressive than funny.The movie is pretty solid, but it lags towards the end as it gets into big war scenes that sometimes overwhelm the drama. It also made the movie less sympathetic; I can cheer for the little engineer more easily than I can cheer the Confederate army.Anyway, a good movie, but not nearly my favorite Keaton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The General" is one of those films eventually converted in a cinema icon. Buster's image in front of the "Texas" holding a cross in his hands is a symbol of cinema."The General" is a film which correspond to the period in which Keaton had absolute control over the production of his films, and it shows in the resources and technical means nothing usual for the time allowing some especially spectacular sequence as the Confederate retreat and Avenc of Federal and of course the great scenes of persecution including railway bridge collapse in the final battle.The technical difficulty of these scenes, make them even more meritorious because they are masterfully resolved, conveying an overall likelihood undoubtedly Keaton made a great shooting preparation and careful installation planning. Keaton makes perfect cinematic language that marks the superiority over any other Keaton silent film classic. The film does not become a series of priceless, witty and Juggler "gags" as often happens in Keaton, but also that these are inserted into a whirlwind of events perfectly bound and taken a central part of most melodramatic content with the meeting lovers, and an almost apocalyptic end culminating in the battle between federal and confederate.The excellent performance by Keaton stands above the rest of characters. It has good photography and superb staging, general shots are excellent (barracks, the city of Marietta), the sequences of the locomotives taken, probably from vehicles on road side are equally insurmountable. The domain of visual "gags" is masterful as ever in Keaton (the scene where he sits on the rod locomotive is wonderful).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It could be said that this is a Silent Movie that can be Enjoyed by those that Don't Really Like Silent Movies. It is a Spectacular, Wide-Open Tale of the Civil War mostly set on a Moving Train. Keaton's Masterpiece is a prime Example of a Movie that Moves, literally.There are Few Indoor Shots, there are Few Stagnant or Still Shots. The Film just Goes and Goes Unreeling one Sight Gag after Another. Sight Gags on a Grand Scale. Keaton is Stylistically accustomed to Larger than Life Surroundings that Wreak Havoc on the Little unassuming Hero. Here He takes It to a Logical Conclusion.The Comic Timing is typical Keaton, that is to say, Impeccable. There is very LIttle Dialog or Exposition required and therefore there are a Minimum of Title Cards to interrupt the Flow of the Film.One can Point to this Scene or that to Illustrate the Grandeur or the Greatness of this Timeless piece of Cinematic Art, but Truth be Told, it is the Whole Film that Stands Out as there is Barely a Frame Wasted. It is Non-Stop Fun and is Appreciated more Today than when first Released. It received Tepid Reviews and wasn't a Big Hit, but has Since Become Recognized as one of the Best Comedies of All Time and One of the Best Silent Films and One of the Best Films Period. Certainly to be of Interest and Enjoyment to anyone who Loves Movies, Historians, Silent Film Fans, and for those that need an Introduction to Buster Keaton or Silent Movies in General.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even After a Century, Buster Keaton's 'The General' Has Lost None of Its Steam!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1926, Buster Keaton had the opportunity to make the biggest film of his career. He chose to make the ultimate train movie ? his comic masterpiece 'The General'.The narrative of The General has its basis in fact, with Keaton drawing inspiration from an incident during the Civil War that saw Union spies steal a locomotive and escape north with southern soldiers in hot pursuit. Although the real story ended in bloodshed, Keaton saw past that to find humor, action, romance and the opportunity for period reconstruction. In The General, a good-hearted train engineer Johnnie Gray (Keaton) runs afoul of a Yankee plot and is soon called into action when his beloved locomotive 'The General' is hijacked by spies with the girl of his dreams, Annabelle, on board. Johnnie pursuits it straight through enemy lines single-handedly, determined to win back his train, his girl, and his pride.Buster Keaton's films have such a graceful perfection, such an interlocking of story, character and episode that they unfold like music. But his genius has never found more perfect expression than in The General. The film boasts the most sustained passages of virtuoso slapstick genius Keaton ever shot, and an unflagging momentum. Dancing on a precipice, it achieves something close to perpetual motion. Requiring him to win back both a girl and a train (his two great loves), the plotting is choreographed with jaw-dropping skill and intricacy with jeopardy and stunts managed to split-second perfection. In these times when all risk is assumed by CGI effects, Keaton's squealing funny, exquisitely timed, death-defying leaps are all the more breathtaking, abundantly displaying his insouciant athleticism.While the jaw-plunging blend of physical dexterity, strength and bravery evident in Keaton's on screen performance is a constant marvel, the movie also throws light on Keaton's undervalued gifts as a filmmaker. The General is a master-class in comic direction, with Keaton's simple setups allowing him to find both big laughs and subtle, almost throwaway gags within the same frame. He also pulls off a series of remarkable tracking shots as he clambers across the moving train ? the editing fluidly pulling us from one set-piece to the next.Even after almost a century, Keaton's hurtling 1926 comedy never fails to get a crowd cheering - even a lone viewer will find his or her heart soaring at the pure goodness of Keaton's hero. The General's peerless mixture of exciting action and kinetic comedy remain one of moviedom's supreme pleasures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keaton is one of the very best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you explore the world of silent movies you not only expect only music playing but also a world where physicality makes up for dialogue. The General of 1926 is one of those where its lead actor Buster Keaton seems to communicate with us the viewer via stunts, by also using his stone wall facial expressions but also utilises his surroundings to bring us laughs, but also just a sense of awe in how he does these things. In a day when doing production on a big scale was difficult, The General succeeds in bringing us massive crashes, great little things here and there for Keaton to use to get us to smile and of course a fantastic use of slow moving trains(who knew trains going 10mph could be so fun).I went into watching the movie with high expectations; after all it seems everybody who see's this comes off with a sense of them seeing something amazing. The film for me was maybe not perfect in fact quite a bit from it but I did find the movie to be a great one and coming to that conclusion took me quite a little while. I finished it thinking "You know it was good but nothing like what people say about it", but then it came to me the day after seeing this that this is more than good, it is very good and a movie that I really liked. The reason that came to me was Keaton who to me now is the master of doing your own stunts and succeeding, Buster Keaton gets all my praise and he actually makes this rather dull at times plot a hundred times better. So what does that plot have to offer? ,well not an awful lot to be fair although it does give you a few thrills coupled with laughs here and there but never gut busting in my opinion. The story is set in the American civil war of the 19th century, we see Buster Keaton as a train engineer turned down by the Confederacy because he is just too important in what he is doing (but no one bothers to tell him that). Keaton's character of Johnnie Gray has trouble though, Union spies are coming and they plan to steal a train and intend to burn all the bridges back towards their lines. The story of course has much more to that but it really is the kind of movie you just have to watch yourself to see what happens because well for a film like this, a lot happens. Buster Keaton alongside Clyde Bruckman directs this and does a great job yet again, not only is Keaton a fine actor but at directing and even partly the writing too he is just one fine silent movie creator. I think his skills come out most with Bruckman also when he is doing the of course famous stunts he did himself, it is not only the biggest I enjoyed the most though such as the him sitting on the train wheels as they move, just fantastic. When Keaton runs around the train he is fantastic but at times he runs from the end of the carriages to the front and jumps and grabs onto things and just propels himself into the right place, how he never broke his entire body I will never know but the added speed of the movies of the day makes this even more beautiful to see. If you're coming to silent movies as a new viewer or if you consider yourself a connoisseur of the era then both can enjoy this, is it Keaton's best work? , well some will say yes and me myself actually say no for now. What really shows how good Keaton can be is the fact that this movie is considered one of the best silent movies ever and yet could maybe be outdone by some of his other work. That previous point proves to me not only is Keaton one of the finest actors and maybe even directors of the silent's, but also that he could travel forward in time and fit right in with the movies of today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite silent film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton's silent comedy classic "The General" (1926) is a film that went ignored for a long time. It wasn't until the 1960s that film buffs and film critics really started to appreciate it. Up to that point, it was always thought of as "just another one of those old Buster Keaton comedies". Nowadays, the film is obviously held in high regard and considered to be a classic.What is the story about? Well, it's about a train engineer named Johnnie Gray who loves his train (called The General) and his girlfriend named Annabelle. He tries to enlist for the Confederate army but his services are not accepted because he's thought to be important as a train engineer. Annabelle doesn't believe him and thinks he's a coward. But then one day, Union spies steal his train, and Johnnie sets out to get it back and pursues the train through enemy lines. He must rescue both of his loves.What makes this film so great, then? Well, it's in my own personal top 10 films of all time, and I would say I enjoy it mostly because of three things: 1) it's wildly funny, 2) endlessly entertaining, and 3) very inventive (especially for its time). And of course, Buster Keaton's stunts are superb, as they always are. There are also quite a few iconic shots in the film that have always stayed in my mind. The train on the bridge above the river... Or the shot of Buster sitting at the front of the moving train and knocking out one wood log with another wood log and thus, preventing the train from stopping. So awesome.10/10, a masterpiece. Highly recommended to anyone who's interested in film. The Blu-ray quality is excellent as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buster Keaton is a comedy genius and a legend. Most modern comedy films cower in his shadow. He brings his fast paced slapstick and wonderful comedy to life once again in The General. Playing a typical Buster Keaton underdog protagonist, Keaton tries to save the girl he loves by getting a locomotive and chasing some villains down the railway. The result is non stop, gut bursting comedy mayhem and also cinema's greatest train ride. It has a small dip half way through, but that's not enough to affect anything. It's impossible not to enjoy and jaw dropping slapstick fills the screen and Buster does various amazing stunts all by himself without doubles or special effects. The story is fairly straight forward but it's a good plot and the main character is very easy to root for. As well as the mind blowing comedy, there are also plenty of exciting chase sequences and a sense of tension.There really isn't anything else like it. It's one of the most accessible silent films ever and if it's your first silent movie it's a very good place to start. Almost all the gags are daring and clever, the acting is spot on and in general the film is a delightfully delirious slapstick showcase that's more insane than a Nicolas Cage freak out but in the best way imaginable. It never loses its charm or wit and despite now being 88 years old it barely seems to have aged. Overall, a very fun and likable silent movie which is one of the better movies of the 20s and definitely one of the greatest comedies of the 20th century. If you ever have nothing to do on a long train journey, watching The General would be a brilliant way to pass the time. A laugh a minute legend and a masterpiece.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absoulte Favorite Of Mine, Exceeds On All Levels.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton was one of the masters of cinema, not just of silent movies, but of movies in general, and as a result he made numerous classics during his prime years, among them include Seven Chances, The Navigator, The Cameraman, and this very movie that I am reviewing right now, The General. The General in my opinion, is Buster Keaton's best movie, and one of the greatest movies on the whole. When I first watched this movie, it absolutely, totally, and completely blew me away. I laughed at the hysterical scenes in the movie, as well as was amazed at the action sequences and the production values. This movie went really over budget back in the day, and when it was first released, it was a massive box office failure and it received almost universally negative reviews, as a result, Buster Keaton then got restricted to his movie making, and that in my opinion, is what destroyed his career, as he now could not make his own movies, he had to do what the studio gave him to do, and although some of those films were good, they weren't as great as his silent classics like this one.In The General, Buster Keaton plays an engineer who drives a train (the titular locomotive). He arrives in a town in Georgia to visit his girlfriend, when he founds out from his girlfriend's father and brother that The Civil War has begun. Upon seeing that the father and brother are going to enlist, Keaton decides to do so as well. He races to the front of the recruitment line, only to be rejected because he's more valuable to the South as an engineer, but the people who reject him don't tell him this, they just throw him out bluntly. When Keaton tells his girlfriend about this, she accuses him of lying and coldly rejects him. Some time later, trouble starts when Union spies hijack his train (and kidnapping his girlfriend in the process), and the stage is set for a climax. During the process, a lot of hilarity ensues. I have seen many of Buster Keaton's movies, and out of all of them, this one is his best, and it is one of my all time favorite movies. No kidding, The General exceeds success on all levels possible, it's a perfect movie.As a staple of Keaton's movies, there are numerous funny scenes in this movie. One classic one comes during the first chase sequence, one of Union spies asks their leader: "Why not stop and fight them?" Their leader replies with: "I'm afraid they have us greatly outnumbered." Then some time later, they discover that: "There's only one man in that engine!" And then they decide to go after him after seeing that they were being chased by just one man. Also, there is really impressive and big budget scene where a train crosses a burning bridge and falls into a river below. That scene along is what really drove the movie over budget. And even more interesting, is that just after the train falls in the river, they show some of the reactions of the Union Officers, and their reactions are 100% genuine, as they had no idea what was going to happen in that scene. And of course, there is always something new to discover in this movie each time it's watched (trust me, I've seen this movie countless times), and it keeps getting better each time I watch it.All in all, The General is one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen, and it is one of my all time favorites. This is a definite must see as far as your film education goes, at least once before you die, you need to see this movie, as while it was a flop upon it's initial release, it definitely earned it's spot as a classic overtime, if only Buster Keaton would have lived to see it. Along with Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton was definitely one of the greatest filmmakers of the silent movie era, and one of the greatest filmmakers who ever lived. Also check out some of his other films and projects that he made before he made this one, as those are worth seeing as well. On a side note, when I first saw this movie, I watched it with my mother and my sister, and they too both heavily enjoyed it. In short, everything positive that you have heard about this movie is nothing but the absolute truth, it's truly is a masterpiece of cinema, and the movie will prove that it is that when you see it.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest silent pictures ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest silent pictures ever.It's a film that's mostly made on a train. The name of the protagonist is "The General". Well, the protagonist is non other than the train itself. So "The General" is the name of the train and not of our hero Buster Keaton who is named as Johnnie Gray.The storyline is pretty simple, it's a lover's test to prove his love. He applies for a job in military during the civil war of 1860's and is rejected. His girlfriend thinks he is unfit. He must disprove this and win his lover. The train acts a protagonist and the binding force in their love story. It's the one that brings them together. How? Well, go watch the film and I am sure you will have a laugh out loud them. I recommend that it's a must watch and please do it with all your family together. It's a laugh riot and a meaningful one. There are layers to this, emotions, love and above all a cute silliness that can be embraced effortlessly. Buster Keaton performs all the stunts by himself and stands tall in each one of them. Considering the fact that this was made in 1926, the content is original and we have seen only films inspired by this and made many years later. So this is one of the first films made entirely on a vehicle and the trip is not just fun, it's funny, lovely and supremely wonderful.I loved this film and will watch it many times over and will pass on to the next generation too. A 5/5 for one of the greatest films made in the history. There are many that will be made, but this will be the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Me And Mordaunt Vs. The World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To watch "The General" is to be both awed and amused at what takes place. The consensus view is correct: This is an amazing movie.You know what's more amazing? Despite what most critics say, Buster Keaton made funnier, better films than this.Keaton, a lifelong railroad buff, is engineer Johnny Gray, captain of "The General," a locomotive which carries passengers and freight across the American South. When the Civil War breaks out, he tries to enlist and thus please his girl Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack), but the authorities deem him more useful running trains. When Union spies seize the General with an idea of using it to burn bridges and disrupt the Confederate supply line, it's up to Gray to save the day.New York Times reviewer Mordaunt Hall reviewed "The General" back in 1926 and expressed disappointment. "This is by no means so good as Mr. Keaton's previous efforts," he wrote. People cite Hall's review as a classic example of "what-do-critics-know" but the more I read, the more I agreed with him. "The fun is not exactly plentiful," he wrote, noting Keaton here was too much the acrobat, too little the clown.When I watched "The General," I felt disappointment, too. Like Hall's, it wasn't total; it's exciting and inventive and boasts some of the finest screen compositions I've ever seen. The technical expertise on display is astounding. It's just that the overall experience left me a bit flat.First, you have what Roger Ebert liked to call "the idiot plot." Gray tries to enlist and is rejected by the army because he's too valuable as a train engineer. Annabelle apparently never learns this, for she rejects him as a coward. "I don't want you to speak to me again until you're in uniform," she huffs.Either he's an idiot for not explaining the truth of the matter, or she's an idiot for preferring her lover be cannon fodder than a real asset to their cause. Anyway, Buster does manage to make this play later on: When he finally speaks to her, he is in uniform, an enemy uniform.The other main issue involves what Lincoln called "the slows." A lot of the story is literally trainwatching. Buster does some brave, amazing stuntwork and throws in some clever gags (later joined by Mack, who's no Sibil Seely but still quite game), but it's basically a lot of watching trains go by. The craft here is in the precision of the camera-work and the split-second timing, not so much the comedy. In fact, except for Buster himself, everyone plays it completely straight, probably because this is real history being presented. Compared to other Keaton comedies, it feels a bit strait-jacketed by that."The General" is still a solid thrill comedy with some amusing one- liners ("If you lose this war, don't blame me," Johnny yells after being rejected) and brilliant sight gags, like the fussy Annabelle's rejection of unattractive firewood while Buster struggles to stoke the engine.To me, that's enough for "The General" to be another good reason for loving Buster Keaton. I just can't understand it being the preeminent reason. Maybe critics can't really love a comedy for just making you laugh and laugh. I'm just glad Keaton made other movies at least as brilliant as "The General," and funnier, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stone-face Keaton - generally great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally speaking, guys like Buster Keaton don't exist anymore - and that's a sad thing. Nowadays comedies mostly rely on in-your-face humor and/or are satisfied with representing an unoriginal copy of what worked somewhere else or when someone else did it. Sit-coms repeat the same formula again and again until even the fans doubt why they are still tuning in. Back in the 1930s however Keaton was one of a kind: Director, writer, actor, stunt man, comedian in personal union, Keaton's masterpiece is "The General". A box office disaster, this silent epic was nevertheless his favorite, and deserves the respect it now gets.Buster Keaton's forte is that he plays his characters understated, subtle, as everyday men, who are determined however to pursue a personal goal. And of course our hero engineer Johnny Gray and his locomotive get more and more dragged into a maelstrom of events, where the actions he feels he has to do for his own good resonate far and wide, playing a major role in the American Civil War. "The General" is a slapstick feast, its scenes perfectly timed, all the way action packed, sometimes dangerously so - e.g. when Keaton is famously sitting on one of the coupling rods with the train moving, or when he ingeniously gets rid of obstacles in front of the track while moving towards them. The master of course does his own stunts, even doubled for other characters. Well, Keaton sure doesn't talk much, but as far as comedy is concerned this little stone-face guy is truly king.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On point with the detail...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film, I really appreciated the technique and the attention to detail that was applied. For example, in the beginning when the main character, Johnnie Gray is in the home of his love, Annabelle Lee, the camera cuts to her father, who upon hearing a sound opens his door at the same instance someone opens the front door. The camera shows this from Johnnie Gray's perspective and creates a mirror image as the two men move identically. Another example is when Johnnie Gray and Annabelle end up lost in the woods after their escape from the Union household where they find themselves face to face with a bear and then Annabelle suddenly steps into a bear trap. Having the bear appear helps the audience make the connection between how the character managed to stepped into a trap. Also in this scene, I appreciated how the following inter-title expressed sarcasm regarding their night spent in the woods.All together, I found the movie to be very quirky and likable while not necessarily a "laugh out loud" sort of film, it does exemplify the attention to detail needed to create a successful full length feature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was my first Buster Keaton film and my second silent film. As the first silent film I viewed, I came into this movie with much skepticism. I am a person that needs dialogue in a movie, I need color, and I need effects in order to really enjoy a movie. However, I was too distracted by the plot and slapstick to notice a lack of what would usually entertain me. Because there is no dialogue in silent films, the actors must work extra hard at their craft, and Buster Keaton's deadpan comedic acting is a sure thing to make any skeptic silent film viewer laugh. Despite the time period and lack of effects, I was very impressed with the lighting, especially in the nighttime scene. Keaton and Mack were clearly seen and there were no confusion as to what was going on. Just as the lighting impressed me, so did the fact that I did not notice the lack of dialogue. The background music helped to tell the story, following the actions of the trains and actors. The music helped to show just what the characters were thinking. Truly an American Classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generally well executed but somewhat lacking in fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton's "The General" is regarded as one of the greatest films of the silent era. In it, Keaton plays Johnnie Gray, a Confederate engineer whose beloved locomotive is stolen by Union spies. To make matters worse, his sweetheart Annabelle is also on board. Thus, Johnnie sets out to single-handedly rescue his two loves, even if it means going behind enemy lines.The threadbare storyline basically exists as an excuse to get Keaton to explore the possibilities inherent in a train chase. After all, it's Keaton's physical comedy &amp; stunts that give the film its reputation, not the story. That being said, I was less than impressed by Keaton's acting. There were some bits that I found amusing but little that I found particularly memorable.Having been initially released without an accompanying score there are numerous options in that department on home video. I watched the film with a score by the Alloy Orchestra. I'd say that it did the trick but it also made me wonder if there are any better scores out there. From a visual standpoint, though, the film is well done and actually exceeded my expectations.Ultimately, however, I guess that "The General" just wasn't to my taste. Being new to silent films, I approached it with an open mind but I was left somewhat disappointed. I wouldn't say that it's a bad movie but I wouldn't praise it in accordance with its reputation, either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great black and white classic based on a true story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be completely honest I could probably count the number of black and white films that I've watched on one hand. An extra thumb if I'm being generous. When I sat down to watch "The General" I was skeptical. A Civil War movie about a Southern railroad engineer has never been on my top list of movie plots. After giving it a sit down in front of the little big screen (my living room TV with a roku box and netflix) i was thoroughly blown away. The film, made in 1926, takes place during the start of the Civil War which had ended just sixty one years prior. When it debuted it was not received well by movie goers and critics. However, in retrospect, Keaton managed to show the human side of the Confederate cause through the story of the protagonist Johnnie Gray and his train "The General". Portraying a Southerner fighting for the Confederacy may have been off putting for movie goers from the 1920's, but was a brave choice none the less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The General is a great silent comedy. I would recommend this to anyone weather you enjoy silent films or have never seen one, this would be a great one to watch. There are some racial issues that you have to kind of ignore but the story is pretty exciting. Buster Keaton has some great physical comedy in this film. A lot of hilarious clumsiness and also some impressive stunts involving multiple trains. The comedy is very cartoonish with plans backfiring and a lot of happy accidents. Buster Keaton is one of the best actors of his time and he certainly proves that in the film. Again this is a great film to watch as your first silent Film or for anybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Significant elements in The General</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just finished watching the General. Although it is a silent film, there are many ques from the background music that demonstrate the moods that the characters can't say for themselves. It's introductory music is light with an accordion sound being the most predominant. This instrument plays well into the beginning scene and appropriately represents the bustle of life during the mid 1800s (Civil War period...just before) In the second scene of this film the protagonist Johnnie Gray learns of shots fired upon Ft. Sumter and with the strong encouragement of his girlfriend, is on his way to enlist. However, Johnnie is turned down and told he is more valuable to the South as an engineer. During this scene the music is still mostly accordion, but is slow and drawn out to represent the disappointment Johnnie feels for being unfit to serve the South. Another interesting piece of music is during the fourth scene; while Northern generals exit the train they are accompanied by a sample of quickly paced string instruments to advertise the stealth of their actions. As the music quickens the train is stolen and their plot is underway. Aside from the appropriate music accompaniments, the cinematography and the way the story was written is quite clever. There is a certain sense of sarcasm and wit put into the writing of each scene and general direction of the film. It can certainly be seen through the facial expressions and manor isms of the actors. As for the way each scene was shot and edited, I was surprised that the transition between scenes (although there aren't many) are not choppy like I had expected but rather fluid and smooth. I enjoy the contrast between the smooth changes in scenes paired with the busy/excited acting. Due to this enthusiastic style of acting, it seems as though The General has a stylized approach. I rate this silent film from 1927 a 7 out of 10. It was fairly enjoyable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The General" (1927) directed by Buster Keaton as a silent movie it concerns within care about a train that crosses the line of fire between Yankees and confederates during the Secession war. What is possible to remember, as circuit of the boiler above the tracks, it is the hundred of mingled possibilities for eluding the mythic adversary. With such an energy and visibly hard work, in burning coal or timber and putting away the train, as if it was a kind of household during the cleaning. It is in itself, also an outlook of a comic serial, where the engine driver doesn't smile anytime during the race or as a kind of running against timetable and only as looking for his own working task, as absurd it was. Keaton, in a double function as director and main character, is himself in it of course, but with a pathetic style of conduct as it was an animated double of the machine as device, like a dream of childhood. That never till now has losing for a while even his own attraction at the time, concerning his role in this original story within a stolen engine across forests, valleys and hills ; and charging of coal or timber its boiler, in such an acrobatic way of performing, which is in itself as sometimes even by the back, like an empty mannequin. Still, barely as a strength of his enigmatic function in this movie - like in two legs on two rails - seemingly pushing it in a given scene with a block of timber in his arms and hands, as it was the chief constable of the adventure. Can you hear me ? There is a fanatic on the track it seems, but he is a pacific human being who likes the daughter of a true general and he - as driver of the boiler -wants also crossing the artificial border cutting this region of the country, nowhere between both sides of the war. Finally, what does pretend him with this behavior ? Whether ending the conflict or if too his lunatic intervention seems to be whatsoever of the looking for what could be at that stage his own exhibitionist style, as though in confusing the normal strand of the status quo. However, blocking the way for other trains, because meanwhile the chaos installed by him on the railway as the main path for carrying out troops. Notwithstanding, he has been master of the railway there, which means that this young man is of course a kind of diversion or even manipulation from the war ground itself as an outfit of the civil war for impeaching its necessary supplies, carrying it out of the rail during his foolish runaway, pursuing or pursued during the most of the time that this story develops holding it on the screen. Also, during the scenes where his own transport of nothing more than himself as egotist human being and the pleasure for driving a boiler, if on his back he was not under surveillance by an exquisite cannon. This rhythm is the core of the story with a parallel working side, with a kind of ironic competitive incompetence in it and by him its chance in a mechanical failure - learning more about driving it before his rivals and so-called enemies -, in front or from the back of the machine and its equilibrium, as well balancing it for another trail. In which during much of the time the cannons are also for anything in the tension of the story and as well the main place of the boiler locomotive in it. Where he puts in the fire more timber at the place of coal for burning it and by which it produces the energy that he needs for finishing the job, without smiling as it was his character as Buster himself since then in scope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Buster Keaton Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This delightful Buster Keaton comedy is probably his best known film.In "The General," Keaton plays Johnnie Gray, engineer on the train that gives the film its name. Johnnie, as one of the title cards explains, has two loves: his train and his girl. When the Civil War comes to Marietta, GA, Johnnie does everything he can to be first in line to enlist. But when he's refused by the recruiters (they think he's more valuable to the Confederacy as a train engineer than as a soldier, but don't tell him that), he falls into disgrace with his true love and her family. Then his beloved train is stolen by a bunch of Yankees, and he's off to rescue her, rescuing his other love in the process and redeeming himself in the eyes of her and her father.What impresses most about "The General" now is the sheer size and scope of the film. 80% of the movie takes place on a moving train, and we're talking a real-life moving train here, not a model or set. The stunts Keaton plans for himself are life threatening, and it's thrilling to watch him pull them off with effortless and acrobatic aplomb.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First time of seeing on 22nd Feb 1979 The General with an organ soundtrack ran pretty ordinary, good but not really outstanding to me. Then I taped the Brownlow &amp; Gill cleaned up version off UK Channel 4 on 7th Oct 1987 with Carl Davis's clever orchestral music and there was no looking back. Suddenly it was Art, the 3rd best silent film I'd ever seen, behind City Lights and Broken Blossoms. It's wonderful what some TLC can do - no wonder this can now be seen as one of the best films ever made, is in the AFI's list and the Thames version is readily available on DVD.The story moves fluently on the lines between the Confederate and Union lines, with the ballet-like machinations of the opposing sides a wonder to watch. Keaton's comic inventiveness in this doesn't let up for a minute, chasing the Yankee's and later being chased back by them, playing about with great or titchy blocks of wood or violent water towers or errant bayonets. Keaton was accused in the press at the time of bad taste when the Union sniper got the bayonet in his back - how times have changed!An absolute classic for all reasonably normal people, if you don't like it you can't like silent movies but must like wasting your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buster Keaton is a well-known comedian. He may even rank up to Robin Williams, Mel Brooks and The Monty Python group. He has done many movies (most I have not seen) and most of them are pretty well-known and considered to be classics.But, the film is a silent comedy. Your liking of the film may depend on if you like silent films or not.For a silent film, it is a good one. The dialogue is brought up by a picture on screen with words on it. Of course, this would usually take a lot of time, so to save time, they don't show unnecessary dialogue. If you can guess what they are saying, then you don't have to read useless text.At times, the words are obvious. The film tells its story through expressions and actions, not words. What a smart move.However, if you are used to modern-day movies with lots of sound and talking, this one will seem outdated. I really started to get bored after a while, when watching this.The General will appeal to some, but not to all.Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The General contains every ingredient necessary for a quality film. Buster Keaton's The General is an action packed comedy about an train Engineer in the south during the civil war that decides to take on an entire army by himself. his drive towards this brash decision comes from the pain of rejection not only from the Southern army but also his girl friend for not being accepted by the army. The movie is filled with slapstick gags that you cant help but laugh at. i wish there could have been more dialogue written to get a more detailed look at what was going on in his head and around. I found myself confused at times and would have to guess on the plot line. Everyone loves a story with a happy ending right? this one has it. By unexpectedly overhearing the northern army's plans, the main character is able to warn the south of the attack and returned a hero. He was awarded for his noble efforts with the chance to enlist in the southern army and get the girl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Except for a few lightning flashes, explosions of cannon fire, and two brief glimpses of painted backdrops, The General is entirely free of special effects: no matte paintings, no process shots, no miniatures. When you see Buster Keaton climbing all over a locomotive as it rolls through the countryside, the train is real, the landscape is real, the motion of the train is real, and that really is Buster doing the climbing. Nor is the climbing made easier by cutting the whole scene up with editing. The camera, mounted on a second train running parallel to the first, sits well back and simply watches as Buster bounds from one end of the locomotive to the other, all in one smooth shot. Later, when a bridge gives way and a train drops fifty feet into a river, that's real, too.This is the great strength of The General. When critics and fans praise this picture they don't mean that it's the funniest comedy ever made, they mean it's one of the most beautiful and skillfully made films ever, in any genre, and that you don't have to laugh every five seconds to enjoy it.Only 78 minutes long, The General is comic and epic equally, its gags strung out upon a structure as simple as it is elegant: an outbound train chase followed by a return over the same track. The obstacles Buster encounters on the way out---most of them placed in his path by the Yankee spies who have stolen his train---are repeated during the return as Buster, now the pursued, tries variations on the same tricks the spies pulled on him. That the same gags work twice, and often better the second time, is surprising, and a source of pleasure in itself as you recognize and appreciate the new twists.Keaton's character, Johnnie Gray, a Confederate locomotive engineer during the Civil War, reflects exactly this blend of the comic and the epic. He's not a helpless, endearing bumbler: he's a man trying desperately to get his stolen train back. When he realizes that his girl was stolen with the train, he naturally assumes the responsibility of rescuing her, too. But then there is a third motive: learning, late in the film, that the Union army is planning an attack for the next day, he must get home to warn his own side. As he goes about this increasingly big job he's determined and intelligent. The trouble is that, through no fault of his own, things keep going wrong and he must keep scrambling to put them right. From these multiplying problems and his frantic efforts to find solutions blossom the gags, gracefully and endlessly, each one sharpened by the suspense of the basic situation.Keaton was one of the better silent actors, his face anything but stony or expressionless, his responses always well-judged, free of mugging or outsized emotions. In his struggles with immense locomotives, boxcars on the loose, fire, a cannon that seems to have it in for him, and, not least, a girlfriend who is not exactly cut out for adventure, he reacts almost but not quite with perfect seriousness, always leaving a little room for the comedy. Watch his face as he hides under the table, eavesdropping on the Union generals plotting their next moves: he's alert, worried about being discovered, alarmed at the talk he overhears, and finally astonished to see his girl brought in as a prisoner. All of this registers very clearly and believably, and nothing is lost to the silence of silent film: he's in a position where he has to keep quiet.The General was shot just sixty years after the end of the Civil War, which puts it closer in time to the period it depicts than it is to ours. It looks it. No other film, not even The Birth Of A Nation, has brought that war back to life so convincingly. It would be great on that account alone, even if it lacked its beautiful structure, elegant gags, and wonderful performance by Buster Keaton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real gem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, in order to fully appreciate this film, please find a mint condition print - they do exist, and are available even on budget DVD. If Keaton isn't employing motor-cranked cameras, then his camera operators were very patient and very good, because this film movies along at a steady frame rate to the point that the action appears as natural as in a sound film.Adding to this naturalism is the lighting - which almost looks like 'available light' photographic technique, but isn't - and the choice to let the actors just play people, rather than stereotypes. There are no heroes or villains in this war movie; sometimes a character is made too look a fool, and then again the same character acts heroically later on. And this of course includes Keaton's own character, a misunderstood - and at times naive - everyman, pressed to do remarkable things under remarkable circumstances.It should be noted that Keaton uses this kind of character development to pull off a remarkable piece of story construction - the story is actually an adventure-drama, but it is allowed to open up for wonderful bits of comedy - at the end, we're so happy for our feckless hero (who can't keep his sword blade mounted on its handle) that it is only afterward, on reflection, that we realize his mighty accomplishment, which includes winning the right to fight in proper uniform, may eventually lead to an early death as a soldier.Keaton, it should be noted, well understands this; and so the drama remains as an undertone to the comedic, just as, even in the most serious moments, laughter must break through.A real gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a film buff and a Keaton fan I have seen The General many times and I consider it to be one of the best films ever made. Considering its age (1927)it is as fresh today as it must have been on its release. So much has been written about it, and Keaton, it is difficult to enthuse without repetition, but anyone who hasn't seen it has a visual feast in store! The story is told logically with astonishing, faultless continuity. Photography, direction, acting are all impeccable. I never cease to be astonished by Keaton's amazing graceful stunts, mostly accomplished on a MOVING train. It took skill and courage to fall backwards onto the cowcatcher of a moving locomotive while holding a railway sleeper (tie) in his arms. And the ridiculous little figure sitting on the con rod as the train moves into the engine shed is my favourite piece of any film. I have recently updated my copy with a new remastered version on DVD including a new orchestrated sound track and tinting. I would strongly advise anybody interested in cinema to get themselves a copy and relish the experience... Definitely 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw a beautifully restored print of "The General" tonight, complete with live theatre-organ accompaniment, at the refurbished Elsinore Theatre in Salem, OR.Why do I mention the theatre? Just to make a point... Silent movies are best-enjoyed in the correct environment, with live-performed musical accompaniment. Those of you who have only been able to see this or other silents at home on your TV with pre-recorded music have seen only half the film. If you ever get a chance to see a silent film shown properly, DO IT! You will NOT regret it! Okay, off my soap-box... "The General" is simply a masterpiece! The timing and setup of the gags is superb, the story (inspired by an actual Civil War event) is believable and intelligent. Keaton made sure that everything looked and felt as realistic as possible, using photographs by Civil War photographer Matthew Brady, paintings, histories, everything he could get a hold of.Overall, most of the film is sort of a slow-motion chase, with plenty of funny gags along the way; despite the film's length, it never has a slow moment.Unlike most silent-era comics, Buster's acting was subtle and underplayed. While he's known as "The Great Stoneface", emotions show up through the apparently-still face. For example, there's the time when the men in Annabelle's family are rushing to enlist, Buster is left sitting there, interrupted from his attempts to romance her. After they leave to enlist, she gives him a withering "Well??" look, and you can easily read his quizzical look, even though there's almost no movement or gesture.I gave this classic a 10, only because I couldn't give it an 11.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the best action movies ever made. It is also on of the best comedies ever made. Featuring terrific cartoon-style gags to some really explosive action scenes and insane stunts this movie has it all. There is no sound of course, but the version I saw had a piano soundtrack that goes along with the on screen action. From calm to insanely frenetic it accentuates moments and essentially dialog isn't needed since the movie is simple to understand anyway.The movie also pokes terrific fun at the medium of film itself. For instance, in one scene the back wall to a train car falls off to reveal the bad guys in hot pursuit of the hero and heroine. The first part of the scene, before the wall falls looks like a simple theater set-up, but almost instantly transforms into something you can only see at the movie. Since this is an early film many of the gags might be missed by people, but if you watch it with a perspective of a 1920s era audience this film is an intense, explosive, huge-budget, high-octane fireworks, unrelenting thrill ride. Now it is pretty much a live action Tom and Jerry cartoon, but classics like this demand respect. And that is just what they will get. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves its reputation: a masterwork.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton's love of history, engineering and operatic displays of action are put to their finest use in his masterwork, The General. However unwelcoming the concept of an incredibly accurate historical movie about the civil war may seem, or a title which refers to an army rank, rest assured that The General is imbued throughout with a wonderful sense of fun, as with all Keaton. The pervasive irony running through The General is the fact that little Buster is helping fight the civil war just by happenstance - all he really wants to do is save his girlfriend. The appeal of The General may lie in its ability to take you back to what it would have been like in frontier America, its remarkable visual beauty (incredible cinematography), or possibly Keaton's trademark operatic stunts, the climax of this movie which is one of his most impressive (the famous bridge scene was the most expensive shot in all of silent cinema).But the thing which makes this and all Keaton films a joy to watch is the irrepressible charm and appeal of his onscreen persona. You just can't help liking little Buster, and rooting for him in all the troubles he happens to fall into. 5 stars from me - one of the all time greats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generally Speaking, Pure Silent-Era Excellence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent late-silent era film has Buster Keaton (in probably his finest role) starring as a train engineer during the U.S. Civil War in the South. Wanting to join the Confederacy, he is instead turned down because the government believes he is more valuable as an engineer. Soon Union spies steal the titled train and also kidnap Keaton's best girl (Marion Mack). Mack had thought Keaton was a coward for not getting into the military and the funny situations occur as a result. "The General" is a pure comedy. It has some subject matter that is not thought of as funny, but it still should not offend anyone who views it (unlike the over-rated "Birth of a Nation"). Overall Keaton's unique personality in silent movies and his amazing physical comedy prowess makes "The General" easily one of the top 10 films of the 1920s. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dazzling silent comedy, "The General" seems to set the standard for any movie chase scene that came afterward. There's a hint of "The Great Train Robbery," made nearly a quarter of a century earlier, but where the earlier film was experimental this demonstrates perfection. Buster Keaton is a railroad engineer in the Civil War South who is rejected by the draft board but finds himself chasing--or being chased--by Union soldiers who have stolen his train. The ongoing shenanigans are fresh and funny, the scenery is beautiful, and the action sequences are still impressive. Keaton is marvelously deadpan throughout. It only gets better when Marion Mack joins the chase, as the two lovers-in-waiting frustrate each other along the way. A cinematic must: this is why they make movies! 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Locomotive Chase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE GENERAL (United Artists, 1926), written and directed by Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman, is an acclaimed comedy masterpiece from the bygone silent era that is essentially a Civil War comedy, or, a comedy set during the Civil War reportedly based on the historic Andrews Raid. THE GENERAL isn't the military rank of Keaton's onscreen character, but actually one of the two loves of his life: his locomotive called The General; and his girlfriend, Annabelle Lee (Marian Mack).In a prologue that begins in Marietta, Georgia, in the year 1861, Johnnie Gray (Buster Keaton) is a train engineer who finds time to court Annabelle Lee (Marian Mack). While at her home, her brother (Frank Barnes) barges in with the news that Fort Sumpter has been attacked, thus the start of the war between the states. Annabelle's brother rushes out to enlist into the Army. Expecting Johnnie to enlist for the Southern cause, Annabelle becomes disappointed with him when she is told by her brother that Johnnie didn't even bother to go on line, but in reality, has tried to enlist and was turned down for service because he is believed more valuable as a railway engineer. But poor Johnnie hasn't even been told of his rejection. Spurning him a coward, Annabelle breaks off her engagement with Johnnie. A year later, Captain Anderson (Glen Cavender), a Northern spy, makes plans on disguising himself as a Southern civilian, and, along with his followers, seize a Confederate locomotive to head North in order to destroy all communication lines along the right of way. The Union seize The General, and Annabelle, who happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Being a witness to the abduction, the great chase begins when Johnnie pursues the enemy by taking another locomotive to rescue Annabelle, which takes him to enemy lines. After saving Annabelle and retrieving his own locomotive, the chase resumes in reverese when Johnnie finds himself being pursued by the enemy, later climaxed by a well staged gun battle with the Confederate Army by his side.What makes THE GENERAL so essentially remarkable is that it's a straight forward story based on fact, and listed among one of the greatest comedies of all time. Keaton takes actual occurrences and builds comic gags around it. While he and his co-star, Marian Mack, each play helpless individuals, both perform their roles seriously and succeed into making their characters both real and funny. Keaton's confused facial gestures are more than enough to make this a worthwhile ride of fun.THE GENERAL is full of memorable highlights, including Keaton's attempt to utilize a cannon to attack the enemy train ahead that slowly lowers itself into aiming directly at our hero; Keaton losing the use of his handcar and seizing a bicycle with a huge front wheel, and not going very far with it; and a tense moment where, while being pursued by the enemy, Keaton, who safely reaches the other side by riding his locomotive across a wooden bridge, gets off to set fire to it, with the fiercely Union general giving command to the train's engineer to proceed across the burning bridge, only to soon realize that it will not hold up under the crossing; among others. Reportedly filmed on location and not in a studio backlot, THE GENERAL captures the period flavor from the Civil War era, providing laughter in what would not be common place for comedy.Also seen in the supporting cast are Charles Smith as Annabelle's father; James Farley as Captain Thatcher; Frank Hagney as the Recruiting Officer; and Joe Keaton as a Confederate Officer.THE GENERAL, hailed as Buster Keaton's personal favorite of all his movies, which was not critically acclaimed at the time of its release, became one of 13 selected feature films shown on public television's 1971 presentation of THE SILENT YEARS, hosted by Orson Welles, with a copy print from the Paul Killiam collection and piano score by William P. Perry. Over the years, THE GENERAL has stood the test of time, winning new viewers of appreciation to this now Keaton masterpiece. Later distributed on video cassette by various distributors (and later DVD), THE GENERAL can be seen in either in black and white or with color tints, different time lengths (the majority being at 76 minutes), and with different music tracks, ranging from organ to orchestra l scores. However, the best way to see and really appreciate this production is to locate an old 1980s Blackhawk Video copy the William P. Perry piano score, the print with the score that is usually presented on SILENT SUNDAY NIGHTS on Turner Classic Movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>General Rapture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other viewers have pointed out this beautiful movie's visual, comedic, and dramatic strengths, so I'll just relate a particular moment. Keaton's character must keep the engine running at all costs, and he's furiously shoveling wood into the furnace. His girlfriend taps his shoulder, and idiotically hands him a tiny twig to feed it. He threatens, for a split second, to beat her senseless with it. Then he kisses her. Then he gets back to the immediate business of keeping the train going.Well, there you are. It's funny, it's tender, it's original, and I get teary thinking about it. Also note how visually sumptuous the movie is (as were a lot of late silents), like a series of Matthew Brady war photos in motion. Keaton never overdoes sentiment -- if anything, like his character, he shies away from it -- and yet it's an unusually heartfelt comedy, with the gravity of war and the sanctity of romance never very far beneath the surface.For what it's worth, the film wasn't that well reviewed at the time, and didn't perform very well at the box office. They had philistines then, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ladies and gentlemen,I write this as a fan of comedy and history. Today, our senses are so innundated with fast action, loud sounds, and exciting displays, we forget to sit back at relax.I find that "The General" is a great film. It may be hard for many of you to overcome it's shortcomings, being black and white instead of color, silent instead of full of sound and dialog, and a somewhat exaggerated acting style.But that is the beauty of this era. This film is a masterpiece that can be enjoyed if you can let go of modern day views. The jokes are great. The action is exciting. The stunts are real, as was the danger while performing them. Some of the Civil War battle re-enactments were the most ambitious of it's time. It has romance, drama, comedy, excitement. It is a well balanced movie, far beyond most that are made today.So, I encourage you. Take the time. Leave the shackles of the 21st century behind, and revisit our history in a way only history itself can do. You'll be happy you did.Sincerely, A Fan of Great Cinema</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A distant cousin of mine Marion Ross was a Sgt Maj for Andrew's Raiders, which is the event that the movie is based on. In the real story, the Yankee spies run out of fuel and water and are captured in Chattanooga TN. They were all tried as spies and convicted. Some of them were sentenced to hang, my cousin included. Needless to say I wanted to view the movie, to see how you could make a comedy out of a story which for some people was a tragedy.As I viewed the movie I found that the first part of it was historically correct from the point where the engineer (Buster Keaton) and passengers went into the train station for breakfast and the union spies stole the train. The General's conductor, William Fuller, gave chase on a handcar. Yonah, an engine he commandeered from an ironworks in the town of Toward. He had to abandon the Yonah at Kingston, the tireless Fuller pursued the raiders on foot to Adairsville, where he found another, more powerful engine, the Texas, sitting at a southbound siding. Since the General had already passed, Fuller had no time to turn the train around. Undaunted, he went after them with the Texas at full steam in reverse -- still going twice as fast as the General. The rest I have already told you about.I am not allowed to list my url but if you Google 'the great locomotive chase fplum' you can go to my website and read the full story (twice actually) as well as see pictures of Marion Ross, the monument to Andrew's Raiders at the Chattanooga National Cemetery, Marion's Medal of Honor (First Army Soldier to be awarded posthumous), and The General.However the movie departs from history when Buster starts tearing apart the rail car and stops for water (another fine Keaton stunt with the water hose) and they do not get captured. Thus the movie becomes entertaining and leaves the knowledge that those who died bravely were not dishonored in any way. This is my first serious viewing of Buster Keaton and I loved it and will attempt to view others. (I also got the Wal-Mart special of 2 Keaton movies and two Chaplin movies for $5.50, it's worth the money). Now I want to see Walt Disney's "The Great Locomotive Chase", which is a more historical version of those events.</fullReview>

The film has impressive cinematography and a score that is good at first, but becomes repetitive.The enlistment scene near the beginning was amusing. As was the "under the table" scene and the point were a group of Union soldiers desperately try to fix a part in the train tracks near the end. The film's battle scene was well-shot and amusing and the ending of the film was well-done.Where this film languishes is in the overly long stretch of scenes on the trains, which, while well-shot, become repetitive. I didn't find a lot of humor in the train scenes, which makes the train scenes seem mostly like a precursor to modern action films rather than comedy. Since a lot of the film is consumed by the repetitive train chases, I was left disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE GENERAL spends so much time depicting BUSTER KEATON on the rails that it should have been called "The Runaway Train". Filmed in Oregon, with all of the outdoor scenes photographed attractively in sepia-tone, it's regarded as one of Keaton's best works.His dexterity with physical comedy is never better paraded in a motion picture than it is here. He's climbing aboard the train from every conceivable angle as he tries to block the path of the pursuing Union Army who have stolen "The General" (his train) and aims to get the message to the Southern army of the Union plan of attack. It's a lavish production and obviously a lot of attention to detail was spent in giving THE GENERAL Grade-A production values.TCM is showing a pristine print of the film, complete with good background music, courtesy of The Alloy Orchestra. Frankly, I think all the train scenes became a little tedious after the first forty-five minutes with a lot of repetition dulling my interest in the outcome of the story.Summing up: Fans of Keaton will have a field day enjoying his bumbling character and all of his physical feats as he struggles to win the stolen train from the enemy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly impressive visuals but totally lacking in story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton's The General(1926) would not be made in this day and age, at least not with the use of a real moving locomotive. Keaton risked life and limb performing many amazing and dangerous practical stunts on and around the moving train that provided for a great spectacle but without a strong story and strong characters the film becomes little more than a series of spectacular but meaningless stunts. The real love affair of the picture is between Johnny Gray and his beloved locomotive, The General. The Annabelle character is so shallow and empty that it becomes impossible to believe that Johnny would care at all about winning back her affections. Indeed, Johnny cares far more about getting his train back from the Union Army than he does about winning back Annabelle but the human love story just left this reviewer feeling cold. It was rather surprising to see the film portray the Confederate Army as noble and righteous while portraying the Union Army as bumbling and clueless but the point of view lacked gravity and meaning as the grave circumstances behind the US Civil War were totally ignored. The simplistic "us vs. them" view of this momentous and tragic chapter of American History does a great disservice to the men, women and children on all sides who lost their homes and lives in the war. There is certainly a place for comedy in the horrors of war, as Chaplin brilliantly demonstrated in The Great Dictator(1940), but Keaton's failure to show any of the depth of the historic events of the time left me unsatisfied and a bit annoyed by the treatment of the US Civil War. I have a hard time understanding the near universal praise for The General(1926), to me the picture is akin to a modern film that has incredible action scenes but zero story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first silent film I've seen, so I'd like to write this review for people who are also new to the silent film genre.Also: this is my only review (so far) without a rating. The General is a film that made me question the relationship between the quality of a film and how much I enjoy it.On one hand, The General is a well made film. The direction is interesting and engaging, the stunts are impressive (what do you expect from Buster Keaton?) and the story was surprisingly well-written.But did I laugh? Yes. I didn't guffaw, but some points made me chuckle. However, that's just what I thought. If YOU love this film, then fair enough. If YOU hate it, I can also understand. I simply didn't like it because I couldn't really get involved and interested with what was happening. I know I said that the direction was "interesting and engaging" but that's purely on an analytical level.DO NOT WATCH THIS WITH OTHER PEOPLE, especially those who will take the psis out of it/you. When you are reminded that this is a film, you realise how cartoony it is and can't really buy into it. If you don't care about what other people think - and we're talking The Big Lebowski levels of care-free here - then give it a shot.I would recommend this to someone getting into silent films for the first time, especially if you don't care give a fcuk about anyone else and you're a real gangsta.

		<fullReview>"The General" is arguably Buster Keaton's greatest film. It is certainly a silent screen classic and was reportedly Keaton's personal favorite of all his films.In a nutshell, the story takes place during the American Civil War beginning in 1861. Johnny Gray (Keaton), an engineer for the Western &amp; Atlantic Rail Road has two loves in his life: his engine named "General" and his lady love Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack). The General is stolen by union spies led by Captain Anderson (Glen Cavender) with Annabelle aboard.Johnny gives chase by foot, hand car, bicycle and train. He rescues Annabelle, steals back "The General" and flees the union encampment after learning of their plans, in order to warn the south. A large battle ensues and..................................Being a Keaton movie, there are several memorable moments:- the crashing of the engine into the river;- the scene where Buster is sitting on the side of his engine when it starts up;- two instances at the water tower where just about everyone gets soaked;- the scene where the box car Buster has been towing and placed on a siding, rolls down the siding and appears in front of him;- the sequence with that sawed off cannon;- the picking up of extra firewood sequence;- removing rail ties from the track in front of the moving engine;- the scene where the engine is spinning its wheels and how Buster deals with it;- the unseen passing of the retreating southern army and the advancing northern army while stoking the fire in the engine;- the Rock River Bridge sequence; - Buster's broken saber as he "directs" the battle; and- the blowing up of the dam.There are also many funny pratfalls and other comedic situations too numerous to mention.Also appearing are Jim Farley as General Thatcher, Frederick Vroon as the Southern General, Charles Smith as Annabelle's father, Frank Barnes as her brother and Joe Keaton (Buster's father) as a Northern General.It's interesting that Keaton chose to have Marion Mack play her part as a bumbling helper in their escape. Witness the scene where she and Buster are putting wood on the fire.

IMDb lists five different running times ranging from 67 to 80 minutes. The version restored and released in KINO's "The Art of Buster Keaton" box set and upon which this review is based,is 75 minutes."The General" remains a classic of the silent or any other era. Keaton was never better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wednesday, July 22, 4pm, NCRD Performing Arts Center, Nehalem "Don't enlist him. He is more valuable to the South as an engineer." Johnnie Gray had two loves in his life; his engine, The General and his sweetheart, Annebelle Lee. When war breaks out between the states he dutifully tries to enlist, but is turned away. Union spies steal The General (with his girl aboard), forcing Johnnie to singlehandedly chase after them behind enemy lines in a daring rescue attempt.Based on a true story, The General (1927) is considered by many to be Buster Keaton's masterpiece. The General also lays claim to the single most costly special effect of the Silent Era. Keaton originally planned to film in Georgia using the actual General, but Confederate veterans objected to a comedy and production was moved to Cottage Grove Oregon. Using modified logging engines, Keaton is a sight to behold as he deftly clambers on and around the moving locomotives with stunning ease and agility, barely sixty years after the real events took place.NCRD Performing Arts Center presents Buster Keaton's The General (1927), the third of three silent films featuring live musical accompaniment performed by pianist Liz Cole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An endearing and consistently entertaining romp from Buster Keaton that flows seamlessly between exhilarating action, bonkers comedy and stunning on-location photography. As always, Keaton performs all his own stunts here and they never fail to impress and keep you riveted, without being overly dramatic while doing so. It was a flop when it came out back in the mid-20s, but has since been re-evaluated as one of the best silent comedies of all time, and rightly so. Of course, Keaton's deadpan style isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea, but The General uses every tool in the comic's arsenal and comes out shining as a result. Avoid public domain releases and seek out the restored Kino Lorber BluRay for the best possible experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyed "The General" and it was a quick 70 minutes. Buster Keaton, of course, is from another era, when motion pictures were more visual (before sound). They relied on sight gags and optical wizardry and "The General" succeeds in spades.Haven't really seen much of Buster Keaton but his stunt work was impressive, even if his deadpan brand of humor is an acquired taste. The film is very good but I would stop short of calling it one of the all-time greats, as the TCM host claimed. But the story moved at a good pace and was interesting and absorbing.

		<fullReview>The General (1926): Dir: Buster Keaton / Cast: Buster Keaton, Marion Mack, Glen Cavender, Jim Farley, Frederick Vroom: High profile silent film about one's personal perspective. Buster Keaton plays locomotive engineer Johnnie Gray who desires to join the Confederate army alongside his fianc's father and brother but he is refused when he becomes too important to his job. His fianc, Annabelle is misinformed and claims that she will not marry him until he is in uniform. A year passes and her father is wounded. She travels to see him but the enemy takes over the locomotive and takes her hostage. Gray gives chase and many hysterical physical sight jokes occur. Keaton is a brilliant physical comic, as seen in his clever Sherlock Jr. He meets all obstacles on the track while also trying to prevent the enemy from conquest any further. Keaton performs stunts that are far beyond normal and prevails to huge payoff. Unfortunately he is carrying the film by himself because other characters are a bore. Marion Mack as Annabelle is the standard damsel whose personality is shallow given her reasons for splitting with him in the first place. The villains are just targets for prat falls and never emerge as frightening or interesting. That aside, Keaton creates a film with action, including massive chase scenes and explosive production values that were led into a future that had forgotten how it all began. Score: 8 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best, one of the greatest movies ever, exciting, lyrical and very beautiful, with Keaton at his most likable; his role denies the reductive attempts of labeling the silent comedians' characters, the proposals of boiling them down to a recipe, to a walking clich. These characters, each more or less typical, express and bring forth, on the higher levels of the slapstick, a resourcefulness, a relish, a haughtiness, they have a semitone of life, and their comedies are of adventures (petty or highly unusual), not of silliness. They seem odd, but they succeed.Here, with a humorous epic, the American cinema reached the ineffable. It's authentically dreamlike, an accomplished dramatic comedy, one of the earliest movies of artistic ineffable in the American cinema, it also has the national sincerity (the added honesty which only results when the deepest inspirations are honored).Keaton's role required a consummate physical shape. The character is robust and tenacious.As known, the slapstick was also a comedy of objects, they symbolize the pestering, the annoying side of general experience, like the firewood boards and logs in this movie, and therefore an initial, or occasional, or fortuitous, or transient deficit of suppleness on the human side of the interaction; but it may also give the lead an opportunity to rise, to vanquish, it may elicit his malleability, he may fend for himself, he triumphs and prevails, in which case it becomes a challenge, so the meaning of the gags with objects, with things, changes with the character's nature; in this comedy, they express his nimbleness.If in the old comedies the objects are often leveled to the stochastic anonymousness, in this one they have an unusual rank in the evening scenes at the Northern headquarters (where the engineer, hungry and shivering and anxious, slinks in). The courageous engineer masters well his locomotive.The storyline's date is 1861-1862. Its epic breath is authentic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be my favourite Buster Keaton movie, and it is a great introduction to both silent films and BK films. The comedy is a common thread throughout, and action, romance, adventure (and probably patriotism for the Americans of the time) all branch out of it.The runtime is longer than other BK movies but I think it can actually be divided into two, where the shorter second half is the part after he returns to warn the townspeople of the enemy and the war scene. However, in movies of this kind, there is always a plan to show the poor and battered hero's luck turn for the better and without this, there wouldn't be an opportunity.If you think about it, nearly ALL movies of today that have an underdog protagonist theme can be said to follow the template of this movie. I am not claiming this was the first one of the kind, but I am sure it comes close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story looks very much distant to what the common audience would think of. It comfortably gets away with it by inserting those comedies and stunts. This is quite a feat because for its time since it would have really need quite a genius in designing dialog-less comedy to be crack laughs. Also, even they look relatively simple particularly due to the absence of sound and lack of color, the stunts look pretty much sophisticated and highly risky. Yet then again I couldn't really enjoy silent movies so I can't really score this movie high. The acting overall is actually nice. Buster Keaton earned my respect for the equally captivating comedy and action stunts. Marion Mack did enough in covering the angle for the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The General" is a silent comedy film in which we have an engineer who is trying really hard to get back his beloved who has been taken by Union spies. This drives him straight to the enemy lines from which he wants to get away and return to his allies. In this journey or adventure many things happen and he finds out many information about enemy that he wants to tell to his allies.I liked this movie because even though is's a silent movie it gives you to feel many emotions and makes you understand many things about love and the fight for it. Also I liked very much the interpretation of Buster Keaton who played as Johnnie Gray and he was simply outstanding and hilarious in many moments of the movie. Another great interpretation made by Marion Mack who played as Annabelle Lee.Finally I believe that "The General" wants to show us from another perspective the meaning of war and the fight for something important. This something is different from one person to another ant this is the beauty of each personality, that differs and every person is unique.</fullReview>

Also, Marion Mack was superb as Annabelle Lee and her relationship with Buster Keaton in the film felt genuine. Buster Keaton was a monumental figure in the history of American Cinema and movies like The General only back up that claim. this and other films prove how well of a film maker Keaton was. The making of this movie took an extensive amount of time including the most expensive stunt in history at the time but it did not go to waste with the good story and mood this film conveys to the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic example of Keaton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the story of a Southern train engineer during the American Civil war. It stars Buster Keaton as Johnny Grey and Marion Mack as his love interest, Annabelle Lee. Johnny has a beloved train, named the General, which was stolen from him during a plot by the Union Army. Johnny follows in pursuit to save both it and the woman he loves (who was aboard when the train was stolen). The movie follows his gallant effort to save his beau while foiling a secret Union plot to attack the Confederates.The General was rated the #18 most influential movie in American movie history by the American Film Institute because Keaton described it as his best work. He said this was so because he had complete control over all aspects of the making of the film with no figure head bosses looming over him or even distracting him. He was given a giant budget and a bunch of time then told to simply make a good movie. A very open format to display the genius of Keaton and it shows.Keaton did all of his own stunts in this movie and he should have died many times over during the filming. He was basically the Jackie Chan of his time.The movie is silent and b/w with some slow moments, but it is only 78 minutes long with a pleasant score in the background. A very easy watch.Keep an eye out for a ride on the side-rail, a bear, and one of the most amazing train crashes to ever be put on film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched a few Chaplin films but up until The General I hadn't been exposed to the genius that also was Buster Keaton. He used a similar style to Charlie Chaplin in that he uses slapstick humor but at the same time brings a great deal of heart to the films as well. The General takes a little bit to get going but when it finally does it's quite the entertaining flick.Keaton, although not as silly as Chaplin does employ a similar style of humor. Many flops and accidental trips occur throughout the film and for it being almost a 100 year old film I still found it funny. But a silent film cant be great without an equally entertaining score. And unlike Chaplin's films you don't have to read as many scene explanations. Most of the story is told by the absurd but equally hilarious action on screen. Film at that time was made purely to entertain and this film does just that. Keaton treats us with one of the most fun scenes of all time with the iconic train scene. Every time Keaton fell down or did something outright stupid was just as funny as the last.The subject matter doesn't really matter with this one. Even with it being a meaningful movie about the civil war, it almost pokes fun at the whole situation just as Dr. Strangelove did. And in the end you flat out cheer when Keaton's character gets the recognition that he deserves. Although I will always lean more towards Chaplin's films, The General entertains with the best of them and is one of the all-time classics.+Iconic train chase, pure entertainment +Keaton is full of laughs +Even with it being nearly 100 years old +Short and to the point..-..Just a bit of a slow start 8.8/10</fullReview>

The way this was filmed it allowed you to watch the film from buster Keaton's point of view! Also when it was day the film had a bronze tint to it but when it was night it had a purplish tint to it! I thought this was an interesting idea! you could tell that some modern day directors were influenced by this classic! It was a bit hard to follow the plot in certain points but it still was a good film! I feel that this is a classic piece of cinema history and film buffs that are interested in the history of film should view this one! It is not a comedy like some of Buster Keatons other films though. It is more of a drama film with some slapstick moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>General Buster Keaton!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"If you lose this war don't blame me."After not quite understanding all the hype with Buster Keaton in Sherlock Jr. I finally got to see it in his masterpiece, The General. This film really worked for me and the action engaged me in a way that I didn't feel worked all that well in his previous movie. I was only able to appreciate the technical aspects of Sherlock Jr. but didn't really care much for the story or the characters, but in The General I was hooked with Keaton's character and the action sequences really drew me into the story. There were some spectacular chases that were thrilling to watch and I was in disbelief that this film was directed nearly 90 years ago because it was beautifully shot and the effects looked believable. There was one scene where a train collapsed on a burning bridge that was gorgeously shot. Keaton not only had a talent for comedy, but he proved to be an action star as well. The General meshes these two genres together in an enriching manner allowing the audience to be laughing one moment and feeling thrilled the next. Based on true events that took place during the American Civil War, the screenplay was written by Clyde Bruckman and Buster Keaton. We are first introduced to the main protagonist, Johnny Gray (Buster Keaton) as a Southern railroad engineer. There are two things that he loves in life: his train engine (The General) and Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack). When the Civil War breaks out, Annabelle's father and brother enlist as soldiers for the Confederate army, so Johnny also feels he should do the same. The officials consider he is more useful as an engineer so they don't allow him to enlist. Annabelle believes Johnny is a coward and is lying to her about not being allowed to enlist so she breaks up with him. Johnny continues working as an engineer, but when Union spies steal his beloved train and kidnap Annabelle, who happened to be riding The General that day, he does what is in his power to catch up with the spies and save the two things he loves the most in life. The film thus becomes a thrilling cat and mouse chase across the Southern railroads. Buster Keaton proved his unique talents in The General through his comedic performance and physical ability by doing all the stunts on his own. There are several great action scenes in this film and Keaton does some acrobatic stunts proving he deserves to be considered as an action star as well. I had a great time with this film and was completely entertained throughout its 105 minute runtime. It's one of the best films that have combined action with comedy from the silent era, and very few contemporary films do it as well as Keaton did way back in 1926. I'm on board with Keaton acknowledging this is his best film and really can't understand how it was a flop when it came out because The General was genius film making. Now justice has been made and it is considered amongst the best films of the silent era. If you haven't had the chance to see this film, you should because it is a thrill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A silent, black and white film which has some laughs. 65%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being the major creative force in this movie (looking at Wikipedia's entry for this movie now, I seem him co-credited for roles such as director, producer, script writer and editing) Buster Keaton seems to humbly list himself in last position as far as the acting credits go, even though he is the lead actor in this movie.In this story Johnnie Gray (played by Buster) is a railway engineer (?um?'just' a train driver?) in America's South. It also happens to be set in the spring of 1861. For non-Americans, that date may not mean much, but no doubt most Americans would recognise it as the time when the American Civil War broke out (very early on in the movie, at the train station Johnnie pulls into, you do see two young black males carrying luggage?it certainly doesn't seem like the South is a Hellhole for black people?but then again, you don't see anymore blacks afterwards). When his love interest Annabelle Lee (played by Marion Mack) wonders when Johnnie will enlist to fight for the South after seeing her father and brother do so, he goes to great lengths to do so, to some comedic effect. Marion makes for a feminine and attractive co-star. Keaton himself makes for physical prowess and derring do in his performance.Being an ancient comedy (i.e. being in black and white and silent to boot), I think that the humour is no doubt dated for modern audiences (or at least adult ones), but I did chuckle more than once for its duration. E.g. when Johnnie contrives to be alone with Annabelle when there are two young boys inside the mansion with them (I have no idea who those two boys were meant to be?and it's also quite weird in how Johnnie and Annabelle first meet?it's by no means clear they are meant to be a'courtin'). The other scene which made me chuckle was when Annabelle takes it upon herself to do some sweeping on Johnnie's train (which is called "The general", hence the title) at a rather odd moment. A few seconds after that event, there's a bizarre moment between him and her. Anyway, the humour for the most part is of the "slapstick" variety.The Wikipedia entry for this movie mentions that there are different versions of this movie which have different running times. The version that I saw was screened on ABC1 (Australia) on 06/01/2014) at 1:50 a.m. Of course I PVRd it to watch later, as well as the cult Australian movie "Stone" which preceded it. Yet to see the Australian movie though?and I saw "The general" some weeks after I recorded it?and am writing this review weeks after seeing it too. Anyway, in case the following information helps identify which version of the movie that I saw, the running time from go to whoa is 75:30 minutes length. The score features a lot of piano solo music to it?I'm assuming some of the score references a funeral march piece one time, and I can definitely hear "The teddy bears' picnic" later on?it's played on a constant loop for a while and later on it is used to comedic effect at an apt moment. There is one scene where the advancing army of the North gets a jaunty score?which makes me wonder if this was a later version of the movie."The general" has a cast of 100s at times and the cinematography is nice at times?with shafts of light breaking into a forest. There's also a probably a good example of special effects 'magic' in one scene where you see a lightning flash. For one scene with a shot of a train on a high bridge, I did wonder if that was a model, but I could see figures moving inside of it, suggesting it was not a special effect.In favour of this movie is the good, easy to follow narrative structure and the way that the captions linger on the screen even when there is the occasional slab of text, making it less stressful to read the dialogue before it disappears.One thing of interest to note about this movie is the fact that in it, it's the South (as represented by Johnnie et.al) which is the 'hero' of the movie. This relates to my earlier query about whether the score for the advancing Union army was a later inclusion.This is my first Buster Keaton movie. As an Australian, I have to point out that having seen this movie now, I can definitely see the homage being paid to Keaton by the Australian comedian Frank Woodley (of "Lano and Woodley" fame?in fact, they made a sit-com together as well, "The adventures of Lano &amp; Woodley"). I was very impressed with his 2012 sit-c0m "Woodley" and found it funny and sweet. He leans on the kind of minimalist slapstick humour utilised by Keaton in this movie. In any case, I suppose I'm saying that if you are a fan of Keaton's work, I can recommend "Woodley" at least?his other work/TV shows are too foggy in my memory to recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buster Keaton at his Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truth be told, I'm more a Charlie Chaplin man than an acolyte of his famed slapstick counterpart Buster Keaton. But while The Tramp has an innocent naivety that can be admired, and a pathos that make his movies accessible to this day, Keaton has Chaplin beat when it comes to sheer physicality. The man was an unstoppable force; able to take collapsing debris, speeding trains and harsh pratfalls with the same stone face that has become his trademark. Even the most modernistic of viewers watching some of Keaton's famed set pieces will scratch their heads and wonder how a single man can do so much talented stunt work and live to the ripe old age of seventy.Buster Keaton plays Johnnie a locomotive engineer eager to fight for the south in the Civil War but can't because of his important job tending to The General, his beloved steam-engine. But when Union spies steal it to disrupt Southern train-lines, its up to dear old Johnnie to bring it back. He also must rescue his sweet Annabelle Lee (Mack) who has wondered into the mix and is abruptly kidnapped. It's a simple story that requires little setup or explanation but does require enough stunt work to make Jackie Chan think twice.Just like in Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928) and Sherlock Jr. (1924), Buster Keaton shows absolute fearlessness in the face of overwhelming odds both in the story and in front of a camera that doesn't give him a break. The camera-work is elaborate even by today's standards. Imagine what the audiences at the time were thinking when they first saw Keaton fearlessly hanging on to the front of a train grill, trying desperately to remove all obstacles in The General's way. At the time, The General was the most expensive film ever created, showcasing an exquisite burning bridge finale so astonishing that when it was shot the screech of the locomotive's boiler could have been heard for miles.If any beef is to be made with The General it's its run time. Don't get me wrong, 107 minutes goes by pretty swiftly when you're already a convert to the Order of Keaton and have accustomed yourself to silent movies in general. Yet for those watching Keaton's oeuvre for an Appreciation of Cinema class, The General may not be your best introduction to the clown prince of silent comedy and what was arguably the most experimental decades in the art of film.Only twenty-eight years prior to The General, the Lumiere Brothers showcased Train Arriving at Bombay Station (1898) one of the first films ever created. At the time, the camera's position adjacent to the station platform was enough to panic crowds who thought the train was going to burst through the screen and run them over. When 1926 came around, I doubt a single soul would be flinching at Bombay Station. The General on the other hand aptly creates the same kind of tension through masterful storytelling, brilliant stunt work and "real" special effects. Today, these techniques inform and elevate the film to the point of timelessness giving the viewer a strong sense of excitement while simultaneously filling the room with guffaws and laughter. Today we still view The General as a silent masterpiece; one of the few of its time. If there's a single silent film you should watch in this lifetime it would and should be The General.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy And Stunts And A Great Stone Face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Your film journey will not be complete until you've seen a Buster Keaton comedy. The Great Stoneface was---along with Gene Kelly and Bruce Lee---one of the best athletes in the history of the movies. He was a daring stuntman who would perform his own stunts AND those of other cast members. In The General (as in so many of his great silent comedies), Keaton was the auteur who wrote, directed, produced, edited and starred as Johnnie Gray. He probably served lunch and pulled focus too.The General is the story of a man and his train...and to a lesser extent, a man and his woman. When Annabelle (Marion Mack) rejects Johnnie for not being in the Confederate Army (which is only because they tell him he's too valuable as an engineer), he goes back to his first love. Along the way, he gets caught up the Civil War anyway and does what he can to thwart the North on a critical set of railroad tracks. Hilarity frequently ensues.The movie does have some ethical problems. When Annabelle ends up on Johnnie's train, they DO make a good team, but that doesn't stop him from getting abusive with her. He practically throttles her. Plus, the movie asks us to side not only with the South during the Civil War, but with the losing side. I don't back losers! You're lucky your calm resourcefulness is so charming and likable, Buster.The General is almost a Die Hard movie where one ordinary outnumbered man battles an irresistible force and he just keeps surviving. Better yet, Keaton comes up with some of the best physical comedy of all time, performing some of the greatest stunts you'll ever see on a moving train. Those must be at least 2 reasons the American Film Institute placed it 18th on their 2007 Top 100 list after not ranking it at all in 1998. They were onto something in '07. The General overcomes any criticisms. It's dynamite!If you dug this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the "Podcasts" section for our 25-minute General 'cast...and many others.

		<shortDescription>Buster Keaton's Magnum Opus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A roller-coaster ride of laughter that was a critical &amp; commercial failure during its time of release but is now counted amongst the greatest films ever made, The General is Buster Keaton's magnum opus &amp; even though I'll put at least three Charlie Chaplin films ahead of it as well as Keaton's own Sherlock Jr, there is no denying that this silent classic is one of the most influential works of its era.Set during the American Civil War, The General tells the story of a train engineer who loves his fianc as much as he loves his locomotive. When the war breaks out, he tries to enlist but is rejected because of his value as an engineer although he's not told this reason. But when the Union spies steal his locomotive &amp; kidnap his fianc, he travels into the enemy territory to rescue them both.Co-directed, co-produced co-written &amp; co-edited by Buster Keaton, the film presents the silent star at the top of his game and is inventive, creative &amp; very entertaining throughout its runtime. Keaton does a magnificent job in both front &amp; behind the camera, and some of the moments are absolutely jaw-dropping &amp; are sure to make many wonder how he was able to execute it so well.Keaton is also very well supported by the rest of the cast, humour is present in plenty &amp; Keaton's deadpan expressions make it all the more hilarious but there were also moments in the middle where the story felt a bit static. Camera-work is expertly done, editing makes many scenes stand out, music seamlessly integrates with the unfolding events &amp; its technical craftsmanship is in a league of its own.On an overall scale, The General is Buster Keaton's most accomplished work, both as an actor &amp; filmmaker, and even though I like Sherlock Jr. a tad more, I admire it all the more for what it does with its script &amp; how it does it. An incredibly amusing, highly entertaining &amp; immensely satisfying laughter-ride with its heart at the right place, this classic about love, locomotives &amp; laughs comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Stunts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The age old debate of whether you are a Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton fan, is still a popular discussion among movie fans, critics and students. For me I choose Keaton. No doubt Chaplin is funny, I just choose Keaton because in addition to his humor he is also doing amazingly, dangerous stunts. Growing up on Jackie Chan movies I've always found live stunts exciting and the stunts in The General are very compatible to today. These stunts add such suspense to the movie that you almost forget that it's a silent film, putting this film right up there with today's Hollywood blockbusters. Given the time period compared to today's safety and medical advancements, it's purely amazing that similar stunts were even considered in 1926 and thus I give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My general feeling about the film is that it was one of the greatest movies, hands down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was pretty good for an movie that at the time of its release was considered a flop. Buster Keaton's career reached its creative apex here, but since it fail, Keaton lost his independence as a film-maker. In later years, the movie gain such a cult following, that it became one of the best silent films of that era. Buster Keaton stars as Southern railroad engineer Johnny Gray during the Civil War. Not. He is a man with only two loves: the sweet Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack) and his trustworthy engine, the confederate train 'The General'. The film was made during the height of Southern Renaissance of 1920's, but the film can also be a bit disturbing when you think about it. With a name like Johnny Gray, his character represent the Southern every man, while his two loves interested represent the antebellum south. Let's remember, 1915's Birth of a Nation, was only filmed a decade earlier and the racism was at its height in 1920's. Keaton's best works are somewhat ruined by his patent endorsement of the racist conventions of the time when he isn't a racist. No wonder why this movie got mixed reviews at the time. Some people in the North, though it portray the South too heroically and made the North seem like the villains for trying to reunited the country. While people in the South, love the movie because of its historical romance about the "Lost Cause" of the Confederate States of America. This movie doesn't feed or show anything racism, but can make some viewers feel disturb in what the movie's message is trying to put out there. Anyways, the war office rejects him as he's too valuable as a trained engineer. His sweetie rejects him thinking he is a coward. Only when union soldiers stole his steal his engine, and inadvertently kidnap Annabelle to plans to use the train to supply its soldiers in a sneak attack against the Confederates does Johnny has the opportunity to prove his bravery. Buster Keaton is great in the role, as he was a fan of trains in real life. He nails the humor with inimitably deadpan takes. I would have love more facial expressions than sad stone-faced, but it wasn't needed. Marion Mack was spunky, and fun to have around in the adventure. I love the scene, where Johnny ask her to get more firewood for the train. The General is based on a real incident during the American Civil War when Andrew's Raiders, a posse of northern soldiers hijacked a confederate train and a lone southern engineer found himself fighting the lot of them alone. It became known as Great Locomotive Chase. Since this film is from the silent era, and most films had little or no record of the original music. There are only three scores that work for this film. The first one is music arranged and directed by Robert Israel. The second one is the Theatre organ score by Lee Erwin. In my opinion, the best one is the one composed by Carl Davis. I wish he could have done the same for all of Buster's films. Buster was one of the best, so he deserves the best! I think it fits, the epic scale and dramatic tone of the film. The film is more than a just a comedy and deserves more than just a comedy score. It's a matter of interpretation I guess. Besides, Carl Davis is one of the best silent film score composers and his work for Thames Silents was instrumental in the resurgance of interest in silent cinema. Since Buster did his own stunts; one of the most dangerous stunts happen when Johnny sits on one of the side rods, which connect the drivers of the locomotive. The train starts gently and gradually picks up speed as it enters a shed. The visual effect of the forlorn Buster as the motion of the side rod moves him gently up and down is very poignant. But in real life, it is nearly impossible for any engineer to start any train moving this precisely. If he had not accelerated by exactly the correct amount, the rods would have moved so fast as to send Buster flying, certainly injuring or killing him. Some people think this is the movie that the actor broke his neck in, no it was another movie Sherlock Holmes Jr. (1924) that it happen. Yes and he broke his neck in the film, without knowing it, doing an railroad scene. The water tower broke while he was standing underneath it. The water came out with such force, it broke Keaton's neck. He didn't even know it. It wasn't this film. This film does hold the most expensive scene in the history of silent movies. The famous scene in question is when a bridge collapses and the train Texas falls into a river. In 1956, the film entered the public domain due to the claimant's failure to renew its copyright registration so you can pretty much find this movie anywhere. There are two copies to know of. There is the original full length film at 105 minutes long very rare to find. Then there is the copy abridged around 80 minutes long. Some people have attempted to explain the difference is the speed as the cameraman's decision to run the reels faster or slower. I found out that in a side by side comparison, there are over 200 differences where I could find cuts in footage. So there has to be missing footage. I like the 80 minutes version more. The Allied Artist version has no score, so it's nearly unwatchable. The Kino version isn't that great as well. Depending on what version you get, you might have great restoration or really bad restoration. Overall: must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before Sullivan's Travels, there was The General.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge film buff, and I have great appreciation for silent films and I am always open to watching one at least once. But at the same time, I, like many people, prefer talkies to silent films and I tend to not be as entertained in terms of content. But this is one of the few exceptions. This and some of Charlie Chaplin's work are part of a small list of silent movies that I love re-watching. Let's look at the content of it: You have a periodically correct setting of the Civil War, complete with costumes, guns, resources, and trains. No expense has been spared in terms of visual entertainment, because during the 78 minute version I have, an epic chase scene between two trains unfolds, cannons are fired with cannonballs that seemingly explode on impact, and a burning bridge collapses as a train rides over it. The General is on par with many modern-day action and adventure movies in terms of eye candy that it offers. The story is solid too. You have Johnny Gray, an engineer who is denied the privilege to enlist in the Confederacy. When his train is stolen by the Union, he goes by himself to get it back and also save the girl he loves. He finds out about a surprise attack that the Union is planning, and now the pressure is on to warn his town of this attack. It's shot beautifully, not just as a silent movie but a movie in general, with many moving shots. I can think of only one other black and white movie with this much action and work put into it, and that would be Sullivan's Travels. There probably are others, but I don't think you'll find any other silent film with this much work put in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supreme Silent Adventure and Comic Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays, when one encounters some film scholars' opinions on this film, the majority occur highly enthusiastic. "An engaging story that combines edge-of-your-seat excitement, stunning conceived stunts and sight gags, spectacular set pieces, touching sentiment, and a rousing finale" (Steven D. Greydanus); "imaginative masterpiece" (Tim Dirks); a production where "one inspiration builds into another;" (Roger Ebert). Yes, the "Great Stone Face," the nickname that Buster Keaton was known under, still proves that his occupation was truly a comedian and an acrobat of exceptional talent.However, before Roger Ebert stated memorably "We don't laugh at Keaton, but identify with him," Keaton's great achievement had gone through true storms of doubts and irritations where both film scholars and the audiences were undergoing a 'catharsis of perception growths.' The infantile "Love, Locomotives and Laughs" (posters); the unjust "flop" (Variety); bizarre opinion of "fun is not exactly plentiful" (New York Times); aimless "neither straight comedy nor an altogether thrilling drama" (The Los Angeles Times), similarly to the story's hero Johnny Gray (Buster Keaton), needed a harsh test of getting ready to 'be lined' among the worthy ones...productions deserving the label 'classic.' But before I outline some facts about the movie, let me highlight one important reason for the above, the period the movie was filmed in.Although THE GENERAL is now considered one of the best films ever made (arguably the best film by Buster Keaton and the best silent comedy), it is not freed from the very period it was shot in. That is the whole background that does not work so powerfully elsewhere as here. The silent era not only saw its decline in the later 1920s but also achieved a very specific point of cinema's progress. The films combined various elements to amuse and entertain its audiences from the great love stories (and love idols, of course) on screen to action. Where did this action get a better shape if not in A RACE, A CHASE. Yes, the pioneer of that racing tension appeared to be Fred Niblo's BEN HUR, the most colossal silent movie of the time; however, the most authentic, appealing and absorbing for Americans appeared to be, at the time,...train chase. That is what we find in THE GENERAL in an outstanding manner (as Tim Dirks observes that Keaton's production is "undoubtedly the best train film ever made").Based on a story THE GREAT LOCOMOTIVE CHASE by William Pittenger, the movie shows the times of Civil War from an absolutely different perspective deprived of great drama but supplied with challenging adventure (Greydanus observes that as an "authentic period feel"). In that historical context as well as cinematic challenge, Keaton's film depicts the two train chases (the title General and Texas). Keaton and Bruckman take creative liberties with the literary source as well as people's imagination about the Civil War. The true focus of the movie is its hero, a Southern railway engineer (unlike the character in the book, which makes for the 'united' perception of American nation) who has "only two loves in his life" - the engine and the southern belle Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack). Once he is deprived of these two loves (when, actually, the symbolic union and harmony are in jeopardy), he is determined to recapture them. In the most unpredictable, creative, desperate, stunning moments with tension and comic reliefs, viewers experience the greatest adventures of the silent era. How can it be that love may ever be conquered in, most presumably, the happy ending for our hero and his 'heroines'? Tim Dirks points out that "THE GENERAL displays marvelous technical and structural perfection, playful comic inventiveness and realistic romance" as well as "fluid athleticism on the part of Keaton." Perhaps, those features are noticeable in more of his comedies but hardly is there any other of his films where they go in pairs so effectively and memorably as here. From the very first moments when Johnny visits his beloved Annabelle and the Fort Sumter tidings interrupt the peaceful and silent future visions to the climactic river gorge sequence, the viewer is involved in a symphony of emotions. Sometimes, Keaton shocks us with his "composure in the center of chaos" (Roger Ebert), sometimes, he provides sentimental feelings as a character who is truly in love, sometimes, he makes us laugh in the most ingenious manner with no 'out-of-date' ingredient resulting in laughable reactions.While the most spectacular sequence is the climactic end of chase with Texas falling into the gorge, the funniest sequence appears to be the 'hiding under the table' among the Northerners (where Annabelle is kept as 'a hostage'). Not only is it marked by the creative idea of an iris shot preferred by master of early spectacles D.W. Griffith (Roger Ebert nicely observes that aspect in his review) but also the emotional element of the whole sequence. It draws right parallels between the character's desperate situation and the viewers' comic reliefs (reliefs from tension, not drama).The final note must be made of the brilliant new music score by Robert Israel, Joe Hisaishi and their crew so finely incorporated into the scenes. That score made a tremendous impression on me when I was lucky to see it on the big screen recently.Keaton's supreme silent adventure and comic achievement stands out as a gem of cinema. With reference to Roger Ebert's words, THE GENERAL, like Buster Keaton, appears like a silent visitor to modern expectations of viewers and still holds power to amuse and entertain them in the most unpredictable manner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best work of Buster Keaton.He carries that same 'deadpan face' all through the movie and yet leave you laughing with amazement.The lead character is that of an engineer during the Civil war and the movie revolves around how the engineer guides his side, North, to victory with perseverance and rib-tickling humor. He sits on a chugging train, gets on and off a moving train without much difficulty, tosses a log of wood from a moving train onto another log of wood and both the logs make way for the train, and does all the feats that are unimaginable without a body-double in the present day. He enters the enemy territory, rescues his lover, displaces a railway track, watches the train collapse from a burning bridge, gathers men for the battle and even fights and kills opponents for his side- all these done in a way that looks hilarious to all age groups equally. And the background music, though on loop, goes well with each scenario and Buster Keaton's love for trains is brought out in this motion-picture masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buster's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 116 I have a habit of turning films into history lessons. So when I learned The General was a civil war- era film, I was pleasantly surprised. My favourite comedy ever is another war-based film, 'The Great Dictator'. So I was optimistic going into the movie.The General stars Buster Keaton, one of cinema's first stars, as a Southern engineer during the Civil War. He loves two things: Annabelle and his train, the titular General. After a quick, plot- establishing introduction, where we learn why Buster is in his position with Annabelle, the train gets rolling. Union spies steal the General and kidnap Annabelle, and the chase begins.It's a fun and interesting story, with excellent pacing and tension. I found myself laughing a fair bit, not hard but I was enjoying the film. It's not quite as funny or strange as Keaton's Sherlock Jr., but the plot and history makes it a better overall package.The dinner scene and the bear are really great, as well as the climatic battle on the bridge. It's grand, but almost seems too serious. I was reminded of All Quiet on the Western Front, and yes I know it came out later.Buster is great as the main character, always straight faced. The word 'deadpan' perfectly describes him. It's amazing he's 100 years older than me, he's truly a screen legend (and has one of the best cameos ever in Sunset Blvd).The General is a great film, mixing story, action and humour, into a perfect mixture to show as an introduction to silent film. A silent classic. 8.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keaton juggles comedy, suspense, historical fact in epic fashion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton ambitious The General is a panoramic epic of immense skill. Taking a back seat to the film's central character, the locomotive, Keaton tempers his slapstick in order to make the most out of one of the biggest props in film history. When war between the North and the South breaks out Johnnie Grey rushes to enlist but is deemed too important as a train engineer for duty at the front. Girlfriend and family interpret it as cowardice though and he becomes an outcast. When a group of Union infiltrators commandeer a train to destroy supply lines by blowing up bridges Grey doggedly pursues, first on foot, then hand car, finally by locomotive.Keaton delivers an abundant amount of laughs and acrobatics with a magnificent backdrop and constantly moving train amid the splendor of the wilderness as a stage. It is as thrilling as comic with epic compositions the likes of Griffith and Lean including one of a train on a bridge that to date is unsurpassed in film history.The General was a box office failure in its day perhaps due to the challenging hybrid Keaton's comedy and an accurately portrayed life and death civil war event posed. It clearly wasn't his funniest picture but it may have well been his best. He certainly felt that way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie demonstrates irony. Jonnie is in love with Annabelle but he wasn't able to enlist in the army so she wants nothing to do with him until he's in uniform. What she doesn't know is he's really telling the truth about not being aloud in the army, only he doesn't even know why. Since he's such a valuable engineer they don't want him in. He has 2 loves and after the general is taken he goes after it, only to realize his other love is on it too. What's so ironic about it I that he does more then the army he defeats the confederates by himself and gets the general and Annabelle back in one piece. He is rewarded by the army for what he's done. He wasn't supposed to have anything to do with the war but instead he's the hero in the end. At one point he even is sitting under the table listening to the confederates map out there next move.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buster Keaton's Timeless Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first Buster Keaton movie I've seen, and I found it to be interesting and funny. For me, it had a lot of laugh out loud moments. Even though it's almost a 100 years old and was set in a time in the mid-19th century, it is still very effective as a comedy. I think there are a number of factors that contribute to its timeless humor. One factor is the way Keaton's character was shown as an innocent, passive guy who keeps wandering into problems that he doesn't create, but has to do his best to fix things.What also contributes to the humor is his athletic ability that allows him to do his own stunts. Many of these are dangerous enough to keep the viewer's attention, cause tension, and get a good laugh when he survives. These stunts also helped to make the movie fast paced, not unlike many modern action movies.A third thing that I think contributes to the humor is Keaton's deadpan facial expressions. I suspect that the contrast between the things that are happening to him and his lack of reaction makes him seem even more passive and at the mercy of the situation. I think this adds to the humor.Another thing I noticed was that it seemed like Keaton was wearing makeup, especially lipstick. While actors today wear makeup, it's generally not as obvious unless the role calls for it to be. I think Keaton's makeup made the viewer pay more attention to him and his face, and ensured that the viewer saw how deadpan his expressions were.</fullReview>

'The General' was quite funny for the time period and it surprised me that now, almost 100 years after it was made, it still relates to people and provides real entertainment. Some parts of the film where a bit cheesy, however, I can only say this because today we are so accustomed to flawless Hollywood blockbuster movies that keep you on edge the entire time, yet for the time period, 'The General' was likely considered one of the great films of that era. Simple comedy provides great entertainment and the lead actor does a great job of playing a hapless aloof man who gets involved in a situation way over his head by simply being himself.

		<fullReview>The General, the story of Johnny Gray (Rebel) saving his love from the grasp of the Union army through a tangle of mistakes, triumphs, and misfortune, is purely simple yet entertaining. The plot is just as the movie shows, simple, and straight forward, North on the Railroad, then returning South on the railroad. Just like the tracks were straightforward so was the plot,yet it was entertaining and funny. Buster Keaton is to tribute for this. Through his many mishaps and shortcomings he keeps the crowd entertained through his facial expressions (or lack there of), and somehow always comes out on top despite not having the "skill sets" to accomplish each task. It is somewhat repetitive with obstacles showing up every few minutes, but the humor each time was new and the filmmakers made each situation unique. It was interesting to see the use of the locomotives, but it makes me curious to how they filmed the pursuit and how they created each scene with obstacles. Just as the simple title, "The General" is, so is the movie.</fullReview>

It's a great film! I'd say that the highlight of the film was seeing the scenes where Keaton is piloting the train. In these parts of the film, he begins such antics as running across the boiler, leaning back on the cow catcher, and hopping in and out of the cabin, all while the train's in motion. Everyone who's seen this movie loves to point out how dangerous most of the railway scenes are, but the way Keaton is jumping out and around the moving locomotives makes it see like harmless slapstick.

		<fullReview>The General is Buster Keaton's big-budget blockbuster. Well, big-budget by 1920s standards anyway, featuring the most expensive stunt of the silent era. And in truth it really was no blockbuster upon its initial release, faring rather badly at the box office and with the critics. Yet more than eighty years later the film is considered an all-time classic. The General is undoubtedly one of the benchmark films of its era. For anyone seeking an introduction to the silent era there could be few better places to start than with this film.The General has a very simple story which begins in the South in 1861. Keaton plays Johnny Gray, a train engineer who loves two things. There's his girl, Annabelle Lee. And his locomotive, the General. Of course a movie set in the South in 1861 is going to be a Civil War story. When the war breaks out Johnny tries to enlist in the Confederate army but is rejected as he is more valuable to the South as an engineer. Only nobody bothers to tell him why he has been rejected. And Annabelle, thinking him to be a coward unwilling to enlist, says she will have nothing to do with him until he is in uniform. Which leads to one of the film's most famous shots with brokenhearted Johnny, lost in his thoughts of Annabelle, going up and down on the coupling rods of his engine as it sets into motion.A year passes, the war rages, and Johnny still works as an engineer. And then Union spies steal his train, his General. And there is one prisoner on board when the spies make off with Johnny's beloved General, Johnny's beloved Annabelle. Initially Johnny doesn't know there's a prisoner. He doesn't even really know who took his train or why. He just knows he's got to get it back. And so the great chase begins, first on foot, soon on handcar and bicycle, and eventually on another locomotive, the Texas. Along the way there are plenty of mishaps, misunderstandings and misadventures, some great comedic moments. But this is not a straight comedy by any means, it is also a great action film as well. It all comes together quite wonderfully, brilliantly conceived and brilliantly executed throughout by the superb Keaton.In addition to being a brilliant actor and director Keaton may well be as talented a stunt man as films have ever known. In this film he makes it all look so easy. It's only afterwards when you think back on some of the things you've just seen him do that you realize how dangerous some of these stunts really were. Keaton was willing to put himself into positions where he was one slip away from certain doom. He did things no modern movie star would ever be allowed to do. The stunts had to be precise and they were. And for the gags to work Keaton's timing had to be impeccable and it was. There is not nearly as much of a slapstick feel to this film as there is in so many other silents. This film's laughs are much more subtle but no less effective. And moviegoers who know nothing but the talkies will find they don't even miss the words. Keaton can say as much with just a simple look as today's actors can with a full page of dialogue. No wild exaggerations or outlandish gestures necessary, Keaton stays composed and still gets his point across. The General showcases a great filmmaker at the height of his powers. It is of an era which has been largely forgotten but this landmark film endures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The General is one of Buster Keatons greatest films. The cinematography is really great coupled with outdoor shots from Oregon and really good direction and some of the best stunt work I'be seen makes this an action pack fast paced nonstop film. There is little setup the civil war stars Keaton tries to enlist but is refused and his girl won't talk till him until he is in uniform. The union steels his train and off we go for a fast paced ride. This movie moves fast with little let up in the action. The Battle scene is really well done and before you know it the film is over.Grade A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful Silent Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The General," directed by Buster Keaton, is a prime example of a comedy film from the silent era. The use of trains as a means of slapstick has never been so effective or well done than it is in "The General." The stunt work is a commendable feat especially when taking into account the limitations of movie production in the 1920's. The film is endlessly amusing as the humorous means of which our main character falls into the situation of not being able to enlist in the confederate army and eventually stops an assault from the North is unbelievably clever. Every scene has a moment that defines it as unquestionably funny and never is a moment dull throughout the film. The soundtrack is case of hit or miss however. For the most part the music follows the pace of the action and is generally relative to what is happening on screen but it is often repetitive and occasionally jarring. Overall "The General" never ceases to be an entertaining film and given the limitations of film making at the time one can only be impressed by what occurs on scree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buster Keaton: Comedic Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton is one of the greatest comedic actors of all time. Whether you're talking about just silent films or the entire lifespan of the Comedy genre his name should be in everyone's list of favorites. The General is without a doubt his "Mona Lisa" and it's quite the laugher. He assumes the role of Johnnie Gray, a lonesome train conductor who has his sights set on Anabelle, the southern beauty who mistakes him for a coward due to his rejection by the Confederate Army. On a mission to rescue her from kidnappers, Gray provides us with a bevy of laughs. Keaton's physical strength and stamina allow him to perform feats that actors today wouldn't even consider trying. He also brings a lovesick character to life who we can sympathize with and cheer for when he attempts to win the girl of his dreams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cinema is a technological entertainment medium, and since it first became a reality in the late 1800s, there have been many advances in the technology which makes it work. And it is a fact that every one of those advances re-educates us in the grammar of the moving picture, and re-defines our expectation of what we see on screen.The generation which is brought up on today's movies is going to be less prepared to watch images in 4:3 screen ratio, black and white, and possibly even 2 dimensions. So when we look back at monochrome images from the days of silent cinema, we must surely recognise their historic significance but otherwise reject them as falling far short of the standards we demand in the second decade of the 21st century.And then we watch The General, the 1926 film which is, in my view, Buster Keaton's finest hour. It is silent, it is black and white, and it is wonderful.Telling the story of the theft of a locomotive during the American civil war (subsequently retold in Disney's The Great Locomotive Chase), it filters the events through Keaton's lovelorn (and customarily stony faced) engineer Johnny Grey.Everything in this film works - the love story, the adventure, the suspense, Keaton's sublime characterisation (was there ever anyone else who could double take so effectively?), the photography, the breathtaking - and incredibly dangerous - gags and stunts, the set pieces. Even all these years, and technological advances, later, The General works because it is, put simply, a very, very good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buster Keaton - WOW!!! this is an amazing silent film. Funny and emotional, Buster Keaton had me laughing uncontrollably. He delivers an hysterical performance as the seemingly weak underdog who becomes the true hero. Like Charlie Chaplan, he is phenomenal at using his facial expressions and body language in such simple ways that are irresistibly funny. I found the music played a key role in provoking positive and negative emotions throughout the movie.During the long train chase both locomotives stopped many times to adjust the track. I am curious to know how much time was spent on these scenes? I look forward to watching some other films with Buster Keaton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just my second silent film, "The General" by buster Keaton was in my opinion very good. I just cant believe how easy the acting looks and its just hysterical. Being a silent film, all the actors have to do is just act like there lost and its just hilarious in my opinion, probably because of my lack of knowledge with silent films. I didn't like how almost the entire film they stayed on the train. The camera view never really left the train. I think if someone was to remake this movie now in the 20th century or if they haven't so already that it would be really good. I deffinantly recommend this film if your a fan of silent films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buster Keaton's, The General...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is possible that it is just my unexperienced and unfamiliar eye that couldn't quite grasp what everyone is raving over in Buster Keaton's film, The General. It could also be that the last silent film I saw was the outlandish and almost obnoxious Charlie Chaplin film, The Circus. I didn't find myself falling into the same comfortable humorous cycle with The General as I did with The Circus.There were few scenes where I'd find myself laughing at the bizarre spacial and gravitational situations but more so than not I was just hoping that they'd finally get off the damn train. I managed to become rather bored of the passing scenery and I began to expect what was to come next.It would be unfair not to comment on the impressive filming of this movie, the shots were pleasing in sequence and did something to change up the what I found to be dull plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great silent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The General" is one of only a handful of silent movies I have seen; the majority of which being Charlie Chaplin films. When I heard that "The General" was a comedy and a very good one at that, I expected it to be similar to the Chaplin films I had seen. However, what makes "The General" a great movie is the action/adventure aspect combined with funny situational comedy, opposed to the slapstick, physical comedy which Chaplin executes flawlessly. I found Keaton's slapstick in "The General" to be forced and redundant. Keaton's same sad-sack, dead-pan expression, after every physical gag, is the worst part of the film. The action and excitement of this film mixed in with situational comedy is what truly makes "The General" a very enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One could definitely see the production efforts were high in making this film in the 20s. It reminded me of "Speed" but in sepia and 80 years earlier. Buster Keaton does a great job on his stunts and is no doubt a protg of Chaplin's. The sound in the film is comical at times, yet understandable on why they did it (small drum rolls for the train sounds, sharp snare hits for gunshots, and a weird cymbal thing they were doing for the lightning storm during the escape). One of my main criticisms is that it was hard to get past thinking that Keaton was doing Chaplin, but so expressionless on his face. He even had the same white makeup on his face, dark eyeliner, and frizzled hair. But Keaton's had far more of a danger element and could be called an action movie as much as a comedy.</fullReview>

The Civil War adventure classic was made toward the end of the silent era. It is filled with hilarious sight gags,great timed stunt work,It is memorable for its strong storyline of a single, brave, but foolish Southern Confederate train engineer in pursuit of his passionately loved train "The General" and the woman he loves. His resourceful uses of machines and various objects (water tanks, a large piece of timber, a cowcatcher, a rolling artillery cannon on wheels, and unattached railroad cars)makes this a must see</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin may be a more popular name, but Busters got him beat. Keaton's portrayal of the awkward Johnny makes the whole movie absolutely lovable. The directing by Mr. Keaton made the chases and action that much more fun to watch. The story-line can only be described as dangerously entertaining. 'Stoneface' Keaton once again shows very little expression but what he lacks on his face, he makes up for with his body. It seems like in every other scene, Keaton is literally bending over backwards to make the shot funnier and better. I watched this movie for a film class and it was unanimously everyones favorite that semester. The Americans made the best comedies during the 20's while France was working on Art films and Germany was working on propaganda. I think this film is a great example of comedic tact that seems almost lost in the film companies of today. If you can find it, WATCH IT!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different Style of Comedy for the Silent Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first Buster Keaton film I had seen and was impressed by the different style of comedy he presents compared to other silent films I have seen. Buster Keaton brings athleticism, drama, romance, and suspense to the table with this film. I was pleasantly surprised with how Buster Keaton uses so much acrobatic moves during the movie. There was a point in the film when Keaton is part of a train chase. He has to run back and forth on top of the train to see where the bad guys are and to grab wood to keep the train moving. I thought this movie was interesting because it had so many genres of movies all in one. As the audience, you can tell when the movie was switching genres, especially to suspense; I felt there was a certain song that they used during each scene so you could tell. This did not have as much silly humor in it although it did have it's subtle comedic moments and it would be one I would recommend to someone else because it has a little bit of everything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buster Keaton is an interesting looking man, he is entertaining to watch even when he does nothing. His face is both expressive and emotionless. It adds another level to his dry reaction. This is a very good movie. It features breath taking stunt work and exciting action sequences. The comedy is also solid, though some bits tend to go on forever. The film gets off to a very slow start but thats just to help develop Keatons character. The only major complaint I have with this film was the soundtrack. Though it was probably just the version I watched the music selections seemed just randomly thrown together. Music selections just didn't seem to fit and took away from what was happening on screen. It just seemed like they took every classical piece that was in the public domain and put it in. Besides the soundtrack and some comedic bits that fall flat I would highly recommend this as a great starting point to anyone trying to get into Buster Keaton.</fullReview>

This movie is filled with some interesting shots ranging from the ones taken atop the moving train of the southern army retreating to the shot of the girl through the burnt hole in the tablecloth. Keaton plays his part well enough, there isn't much room for subtleties when acting in a movie without sound so every move is exaggerated. Keaton doesn't overdo it too much but it doesn't seem as effortless as when Chaplain does it. In the end these silent movies never cease to amaze me how well they can tell a story with less than a page worth of titles and this ones no different.</fullReview>

In the movie it starts off with two kids following johnny to this lady's house. we find out that this lady is one of the loves in his life and the other is his engine. while he was out the lady's house he finds out there is a war about to start. the lady who is Annabelle brother and father then go to enlist in the war. johnny ran there after the started walking and was the first online. when he try's to enlist they don't let him because they think he is to valuable to the south. after all this the girl didn't believe that he tried to enlist so she said she wont talk to him till hes in uniform. while johnny was driving the train he stop at one of the stops and the train gets robbed. Annabelle just so happened to be one the train that got robbed and so johnny starts chasing the train on foot. later after he makes it to the north said camp he hinds under the table where all the general's from the north meet and he hears there plan. he also then finds out that they have Annabelle and where they hind her. later that night he saves her.after this they then steal a train to get back to tell the south of the Norths plans.I find this all interesting because the only reason johnny even got to do this all is because they wouldn't let him enlist in the army. i also feel the that actor played there roles to a tee and made the movie come alive. They really made the story really realistic. I think for the time in which the movie was made they did a amazing job making the movie.I also would think in today's time they can improve on this movie more and make it even more realistic because our new technology.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A work of art. There's no modern-day parallel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton's stunts in "The General" are incredible. The action scenes really contrast the sterile, synthetic action in most of today's movies. Not to mention the continual, high level of excitement and involvement. The train scenes are extremely involving. Especially since it's pretty obvious that Keaton is actually risking his own safety/life in some of the stunts. ...You're really concerned for his safety. Keaton is an artist. The stunts alone are impressive, but what is really incredible is the way all of the motions and stunts completely involve the character's personality. It's really incredible to watch. A ton of money must have been put into the movie, as so much is destroyed. Loved the train crash. The movie a valuable experience, because there's not even a real possibility for a modern-day parallel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked The General. The movie is just hilarious. The whole train chase scenario was really great. I loved all of the physical humor used in the movie. My favorite aspect is how he has to constantly stop the train, get off, do something, and then get back on again. He has to do this over and over through the whole movie, it's great. I also really enjoyed Keaton's performance. It was the first of his movies that I'd seen and I thought that the way he acted in the film was really cool. He almost always seemed sad and always had a sort of stoic expression on his face. However, even though the changes in his expression and behavior were really subtle, you could still easily tell what sort of emotion he was portraying. You could tell his mood based on his physical behavior; for example, when he is confused he'll keep looking up and around himself, or when he's sad he just mopes around and acts lethargic. The story is good to. The whole time he's just trying to do the right thing and impress his girl, and up to the end he thinks that his efforts are for nothing. However, at the very end he is rewarded and his girlfriend gets to see him be victorious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starting off slow and sad, building excitement, and ending in a happy new place "The General" has a plot much like the vehicle it's centered around. The story of a southern civil war era engineer who singlehandedly foils a northern attack, this film is as enjoyable as it is rewarding. Keaton creates an exciting and suspenseful chase throughout the film, full of funny moments. The best are the interactions between Keaton and Mack. The two form a dysfunctional and comedic pair while they are escaping the north in a stolen train, but work well as romantic interests. Keaton's heroic actions against the North are creative and resourceful, and his fitting promotion at the end of the film leaves viewers feeling fulfilled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The General" was our June "Great Films at the Cathedral" movie. We choose films from either IMDb's 250 greatest or Roger Ebert's "Great Films" list -- usually our selections are on both.This film has been (except when it first came out) consistently rated as one of the best movies of all times.Playing time (75-105 min.) varies greatly among the many editions; B&amp;W, silent. Genre: action/romance/comedy. Buster Keaton stars, directs, and co-adapted the screen play from a book describing a real incident in the Civil War. Each edition of this film has different musical accompaniments (please read my comments about this before picking a version to see).Keaton, as "Johnny Gray," a southern railroad engineer, has two loves -- his locomotive, "The General" -- and the beautiful Annabelle Lee. War with the North breaks out and he tries to enlist but is declined because his civilian occupation is too valuable. Annabelle doesn't realize this and thinks he didn't want to and says she'll have nothing to do with him until she sees him in uniform.On one of Johnny's runs to Virginia, a small detachment of Union spies seize "The General" when Johnny is momentarily off the train and they hightail it to the Northern lines (unintentionally capturing Annabelle in the process). Johnny goes after them, trying to retrieve his beloved engine and, in the process, discovers he's also rescuing Annabelle.There are 2 chases, Johnny after his engine and, once he gets it, a chase back to Southern lines with the Yankees in hot pursuit in another engine.Keaton was an astonishingly athletic person (although he neither dresses, looks, or acts the part) and that has a great deal to do with his style of physical comedy. He performed all his own stunts, never using doubles, such as many times traversing on a running locomotive from cab to cowcatcher and back, and/or sitting on the cowcatcher holding a railroad tie while his engine is going down the tracks, using the tie to flip away obstacles the Yankees had dumped on the tracks trying to derail the locomotive he's using to chase them.Keaton is finally successful in bringing "The General" home -- and winning Annabelle.Roger Ebert says of this film: "Today I look at Keaton's works more often than any other silent films. They have such a graceful perfection, such a meshing of story, character and episode, that they unfold like music...." I've gone to the annual Kansas Silent Film Festival the last 5-7 years and soon learned to love most silent films -- the lack of spoken dialogue is quickly overlooked. I suspect that's because of the high quality of musical accompaniment our KSFF's films have -- I lose all awareness I'm hearing music and just let it drive my emotional reaction to each scene's actions and moods. In Topeka for our KSFF, we've been fortunate to have the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra provide music for some films while a great film organist, Marvin Faulwell, does so for others; they deliver a high art.The first version of this film that I saw had a piano accompaniment that tinkled along with VERY little seeming relevance to the events on the screen -- that really lowered my enjoyment of this movie. I'm sure neither Ebert nor the majority of IMDb high raters saw/heard that version.There are many different editions of this film on DVD; several have orchestras playing background. I bought a KINO (78 min.) version of "The General"; it has 3 optional soundtracks. I replayed much of the movie with the Thames Silent Film orchestra and also with the theater organist's accompaniment -- and MUCH preferred the latter, probably because he so quickly adapts the tempo and mood of the music to whatever action is on the screen whereas the orchestra is telling it's own story. Since different people have different tastes, some will prefer another choice. KINO's pictures were crystal clear.MORAL: The background music is ENORMOUSLY important to one's enjoyment and perception of a film. Choose wisely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the silent films have lost my attention, The General, written and directed by Clyde Bruckman and Buster Keaton, filmed in 1926 was a good movie. It starred Buster Keaton as Johnny Gray and Marion Mack as Annabelle Lee. I think the mannerisms of the characters, the screen shots and facial expressions kept my interest and had me chuckling through several parts. From the beginning scene where Johnny is on the front porch primping himself to see Annabelle to one of the train scenes where he is trying to put water in the engine for the steam, and as he pulls the lever the water pours out on to Annabelle with a force to the very end where he tried to romance Annabelle and got tired of saluting each person individually so he just kept moving his arm up and down in a continuous motion, imitating a salute. It had moments where I could actually picture a Carol Burnett skit. The themes of the film include the timing of it taking place during the Civil War, Romance, and Comedy. The cinematography of the film was well done with the variety of outdoor settings giving a very realistic and convincing. The filming outside allows for deep focus scenes such as being in the town, the train station or on the train. Johnny, the hero of the film, loves both the train and his Annabelle. When she is kidnapped he goes on a quest to save her. Even without the speaking parts, I believe the actors did a great job showing the story through their actions, facial expressions and movements.</fullReview>

I had never seen anything with him in it before, but now I would like to see more stuff with him in it. I liked this movie because it did a good job of bringing out the history during that time period. Also the cinematography was fantastic in this movie. Everything was done in real time so there were no miniatures or stunt doubles. The scene where the bridge explodes is amazing because they actually had to build a bridge and blow it up which is not something that would have happened today. Some of the other scenes are also brilliant if you just think about the fact that they were done in real time. The actors during this time period were outstanding and one had to be in order to make a good movie and Buster Keaton certainly did his job and did it well. I don't know if this was the most thrilling silent movie, but I still enjoyed it because it was funny and they tried to make it action packed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buster Keaton stars as Johnny Gray a Engineer in the Southern Railroad who loves Annabelle Lee. His Character is not allowed to join the southern army in the civil war because as an engineer he is valuable to the south. I never thought a Silent film would make me laugh and intrigue my mind as much as it did. Buster Keaton does a terrific job as he navigates the general back to safety and back to the south. The Sequences and Cuts in the film were so smooth you couldn't tell when a new scene stopped and another began. The stunts he also performed going from rail-car to rail-car while maintaining speed on the General were simply amazing and unheard of at that time. To learn that he did his own stunts is truly amazing because of the difficulty involved in doing them, any of which were spectacular if not dangerous. Keaton does a great job of being funny also, using everything around him at his disposal whether it be the wood he cuts up to fuel the train, or the things he does when he is off the train, he makes simple things so interesting. He also shows the courage of a man trying to get his train back and the unwillingness to give up and his will to prove everyone who doubted him on his way back to the south.</fullReview>

The shot at the end of the train falling in the water after Buster burned the bridge is extremely impressive for the time. The dynamic plot makes this movie a love story, action movie, and comedy. The whole time your hoping that he gets his uniform so he can finally be with his dream girl(love part). She gets kidnapped and needs to be rescued in a daring attempt by Buster(action part).

The story is easy to understand because there are many action scenes. Many instruments are performed to show the emotion of characters and help the audience to understand the feeling of scenes. For example, in the romantic scene when the main character went to help the lover, the piano was performs in the romantic tune. In addition, there are many jokes which are showed by the main character. These jokes make the movie more attractive because they entertain the audience by combining with many kinds of instruments in appropriate way. Moreover, the action scene that the main character chased the another army to help the lover was very excited ,and I like the ideas of both to obstruct each other during driving the train. However, I think the scene that there is the thunder should makes more scary and looks more real including to the sound of the thunder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Amazing Silent Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Amazing silent film! When I sat down to watch this film I had never heard of any of the actors featured. Within the first few minutes of the film, I was hooked. The love between Johnnie Gray played by Buster Keaton and Annabelle Lee played by Marion Mack was too sweet for words that he was even willing to enlist in the Civil War for her on the side of the south. When he was denied the chance to go to war because he was a valuable man for the railroad, then Annabelle Lee not wanting to see him ever again because she felt he was lying, through the facial expressions of Buster Keaton I was able to feel the pain he was feeling inside. i was surprised to find that this movie was a comedy because there were only a few parts I found funny. I have a new found interest in seeing more movies starring Buster Keaton because of the General!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The General</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that Buster Keaton starred in this film I expected it to be filled with physical comedy using the Civil War as a backdrop for a light hearted story. While this film was by no means a heavy drama there was a lot more action than I expected. I was very impressed by the stunts that Keaton performed throughout the film one in particular was when he was riding on the front of a moving train. The other aspects of this film that caught my eye were how elaborate and different the scenes were. At the start of the movie Buster and and Marion Mack were sitting in a living room and then a few moments later Buster's character is in a rural town square filled with other individuals and buildings, all seemingly realistic. The shots that incorporated the moving trains were stunning, they accurately displayed the speed that the train was moving and helped me to feel like I was a part of the action. I was surprised at the range all of the actors were capable of performing in. While the dialog was shown to the audience there were instances were facial expressions and body movements were all that were necessary. This movie was fabulous, there so many different genres and they were mixed in together so cohesively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining silent film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The General is a silent comedy which deals mostly with themes of determination, pride, and the motivation of love.I found the cinematography to be fluid and direct, with no shot lingering too long or too short. The train-chase scenes are particularly well cut, with nary a continuity error to be found. Michael Bays of the world, take note. The film chugs along at a steady pace much like The General itself, never spending too long on any one part.The film has wonderful period authenticity. Even in black and white, you can tell time went into crafting the wartime atmosphere.As with The Unknown, I found the stock score to be intrusive. I took my headphones off after twenty minutes and found the film to be much more enjoyable. The film stands on its visual merits alone and does not require musical accompaniment. Which is a compliment to the engaging screen presence of Keaton.Keaton plays perfectly the role of good-hearted goof, pioneering a screen persona that many comic actors have adapted since. He is not so much laugh-out-loud funny as he is a great vaudevillian performer in general. He is a physical wonder on screen, especially considering he didn't use a stunt double.The film is flamboyant and stylized, relying heavily on Looney Toons-style sight gags, with most of the plot devices acting simply as setups for Keaton to perform another slapstick routine, which, thankfully, he does wonderfully.Overall, I found The General to be a very tight production, with each shot carefully composed so that the viewer gets the maximum impact of whatever Keaton is doing at the moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarity and suspense at it's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clyde Bruckman and Buster Keaton's "The General" (1927) is said to be the greatest comedy ever made. The film is packed full of comedy, suspense and drama. The film takes place during The Civil War, which is what makes it more dramatic because it is a true event. This dramatic event is dressed up in hilarity and suspense and this really works. For example, the scene with the cannon. The cannon's wick slowly burns down as Johnny scrambles over the train, away to safety. In this scene the cannon is pointing straight at Johnny and seconds away from firing. The cannon becomes detached and at the last second the train turns and the cannon fires. This scene works because the intensity builds and Johnny is frantic but the cannon never does any harm in the end. The scenes with the train were very expensive for it's time but so successful and perhaps why the movie was especially comical. These scene were fast paced and the music was fast keeping the audience at the edge of their seats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The General was really different. Silent movies can be had to follow. This one wasn't bad. I thought it was amazing how they did all the train work. was it a certain amount of tracks or did they actually use real train tracks and have cameras follow them around? I wasn't really sure. The part where they are on the bridge and set fire to or blow it up was amazing to. This is something else I would like to know how they did? In the beginning I really did understand who was who or what they were doing but I eventually got it. It was amazing hoe they just pulled out the spikes that were keeping the train together and how many times this was done throughout the movie. Lighting changed when man went to save to woman and he snuck into her window at night. It was blue out and the lightening effect were really cool. overall not a bad movie for a silent one it was jumping around a lot but it wasn't bad. Megan H</fullReview>

Buster Keaton shows his comic inventiveness and passion for love. he and the cast pull off a tremendous job in this movie and i would recommend this movie to anyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now I know why it's called Keaton's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a fan of Keaton for just over a year now, but only today did i get around to watching the general. I'd heard so much about it and worried it wouldn't live upto the hype or the humour wouldn't translate. or i worried it would be the best i'll ever see and i should save it for a special occasion; today i finished my exams, special enough in my books.It is a brilliant film. not the high gag rate i was expecting if i am honest but this really is a case of quality over quantity. and the jokes are also very subtle (many are, anyway). i get the feeling multiple viewings will yield more and more laughs.Keaton's everyman characters tries to get back his train, and innocently in the process gets the girl and stops an enemy attack. it's very feel-good and also hilarious. I think my favourite scenes are on the train with Keaton and his Girl where she keeps doing things wrong, or they have miniature arguments- there's something inherently hilarious about a) in the midst of all the fighting etc, Keaton's girl picking up a broom and starting to sweep his train and b) Keaton's reaction of anger, turning to just a passionate hug. it's just done very beautifully basically, this is a great film- please, Keatonites, don't put it off, as i did, it's worth viewing now. and again, and again.also, i'm a sucker for happy endings- so that's nice</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an immensely enjoyable film that was far ahead of it's time when first released. The physical stunts still impress and Buster Keaton gives a memorable performance. His athletic ability rivals and possibly exceeds Chaplin. The film is also remarkably restrained for a silent film and Keaton never overacts to attract our sympathy. 'The General' is basically a straight Civil War action film with comedic elements. The humor arises naturally from the complicated stunts performed. The film is a trifle overlong and the climactic (MINOR SPOILERS) battle takes away the focus from Keaton. Still highly recommended.Overall 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A summary of all things great and gloomy of the Civil War.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton's silent epic The General is more than just one of the best silent films ever made, it is also a wonderful tribute and nostalgic look back to a fascinating era in this country when the states were divided and each side knew exactly what they wanted. In this instance, Keaton plays Johnnie Gray, a humble and simple-minded engineer whose life is occupied by two things, his train and his girl. In only a matter of minutes, he loses both and there is nothing left to do but start running and track them down.This is not necessarily a new concept for Keaton, but his ability to perform different stunts all the while entertaining the audience as well as moving the story along. Indeed, the plot moves as quickly and fluidly as the trains in the story, which seem almost a metaphor for the lifestyle most were living at a time when war was upon all the nation. As for the stunts, Keaton has some very good ones as well as other visual tricks he sneaks in that happen almost so suddenly, it's as if he didn't want you to notice them on their own. Nevertheless, they are there and multiple viewings may be necessary to capture all the richness of this story. And with Buster Keaton playing the lead, we empathize with him every step of the way. Despite his stone face, this only enhances the comedic steps of each pun and we like him even more. For anyone who loves history or the movies or both, The General is a splendid ride and one that should be taken more often than not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like old movies, but I have a confession to make. I don't watch silent movies. There are two exceptions to this rule. I watch Charlie Chaplin movies and I watch The General. I have yet to see another movie starring Buster Keaton, and I've decided, if he'd never made a movie besides The General, he'd still be a legend. Neither Buster Keaton nor Chaplin needed words to tell a heck of a story. In fact, even if The General did't have title cards to tell you what was going on, you'd still be able to figure it out.The plot is simple: Johnny Gray (played by Keaton) is an locomotive engineer in the South when the War of Northern Aggression, er, Civil War breaks out. His best gal, Annabelle Lee, snubs him when she mistakenly assumes he's a coward because he doesn't enlist (when in reality he's not allowed to enlist because he's more valuable as an engineer). What takes place over the next hour or so is a series of scenes in which Keaton bumbles his way into rescuing Annabelle from captors, foils a pack of Northern spies, and almost singlehandedly routes the Northern army. Most of the action takes place aboard the film's namesake, The General, Gray's locomotive.The complaint against silent films is that there just isn't enough there without words to keep a viewer interested. Normally I agree, but Keaton's comic timing combined with numerous chase scenes keeps the pace lively. Kids under 10 are usually the toughest critics. I've heard and read many folks say that when they sat down with their young children to watch this one when the movie ended, the kids were ready for a repeat viewing.One of my favorite gags of the movie comes when Gray tries to shoot a cannonball from a moving train in order to hit a train full of spies he's pursuing. With one misstep, he manages to aim the cannon directly at himself. It's hard to choose a favorite scene because one gag begets another throughout the running time of the movie, and at a time of 74 minutes, it's amazing how many funny bits Keaton packs in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond laughter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The weekday evening performance was sold out, the cinema full, and the faces in the audience predominantly young: the classics in the National Film Theatre's Buster Keaton season, thanks to widespread media coverage, had drawn interest from a general public beyond existing fans of the silent screen, and I'd hazard a guess that a fair number of those seated around me were coming to Keaton for the first time. My own Damascene conversion from mild scepticism to ardent advocacy having taken place all of a whole week earlier -- in the moment of laying eyes on his first self-directed short, 'The High Sign', to be precise -- I naturally fell prey to all the superiority of the old hand :-) But the audience reaction was a fascinating transition, and a true homage to the film. For as they began to be drawn in, they *stopped laughing*.Silent comedy, and Keaton's in particular, suffers from the slapstick label; the preconception is of custard-pies and prat-falls, of silly hats and floppy shoes, and exaggerated facial mugging. The people who had come to see "The General" had come with the expectation of pantomime humour and unkind gags, and in the opening scenes there were loud laughs at everything that could by any stretch be interpreted as 'funny'. Buster's character was clearly the butt and not the hero of the piece.The change was gradual. I was too much involved by the story myself to pinpoint the moment when the laughter turned to gasps, and then to cheers, as Keaton's dogged Johnnie Gray battled through one frustration or death-defying danger after another with grace, skill and the occasional gift of unprompted good luck. Long before the climactic stunt -- which drew forth a many-throated cry, including my own -- they were on his side, laughing with him and not at him, with affection for his awkwardness, with admiration for his achievements, and with applause for his ingenuity. By the final romantic coda, in which Johnnie finds a typically resourceful solution to the problem of embracing his girl and acknowledging his new responsibilities at the same time, the self-conscious guffaws of the opening scenes were gone as if they had never been: the roar of approbation almost raised the roof.For "The General" is nearly as much a straight adventure or tale of crossed lovers as it is a comedy; I'd seen flickering railway-related snippets of it myself previously, as a 'train film', which was about as misleading out of context. It's not the perfect melding of story and humour which I still dream to find in some film of Keaton's as yet unseen -- it spends too much of its length for my taste in chase sequences, with consequent repetition of this material (running out of wood, detaching vehicles, obstacles on the rails, diverting tracks), while conversely the battle scenes at the end seem somewhat unrelated -- but it caught me out of myself with all the thrills of a great drama and the tenderness of a wry romance.For long periods it is in fact more gripping than funny, and this is no loss. The watchers were caught up beyond laughter, into an exhilaration of engagement that had eyes sparkling with a buzz of applause. No need for condescension for the slapstick crudities of the good old days: the film has all the resource and surreality that are Keaton's trademark... and if Buster never cracks a grin then his audience most assuredly do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Toying With Trains.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have seen many exciting and funny scenes involving trains. There have been sword fights on roofs, box cars chopped up to provide wood for fuel as the train consumes itself, locomotives smashing into one another, leaps from bridges upon speeding trains, trains pursuing trains at high speed, men springing from open doors into the landscape, hijacked trains, hobos flung under the wheels, runaway trains with terrified convicts aboard, and wooden bridges collapsing under locomotives and sending both artifacts into the indifferent waters below.But this one seems to pull every trick out of the Handbook For Train Movies. And Buster Keaton is the central figure in all of it. He's the manager of the Confederate train called The General. The General is hijacked during the Civil War by Yankees intent on wreaking havoc behind enemy lines. His girl is taken hostage.Keaton pursues the Yankees and -- I got a little confused here because I was out of the room for a while -- somehow gets The General back, along with his girl friend, while the Yanks now seem to be chasing him in two other trains.There is a big battle at the end. Keaton is accidentally instrumental in the Confederate victory and is summarily promoted from civilian railroader to Lieutenant in the Army of the Confederate States of America.The movie is funny -- at times, very funny -- melodramatic, and exciting.In historical fact, the North had probably the most skilled railroad engineer in the country, as well as a standard gauge, a modern system of tracks and rolling stock; the South throughout the war was hampered by local whimsy regarding the distance between rails and the amount spent on upgrading a railroad system designed as much for unhurriedly shipping cash products like cotton as for zipping soldiers from point to point.None of those problems are evident here as the big-wheeled, bulging-smokestacked, cow-catcher locomotives haul their cars around curves and up and down mountains and over rivers. Many of the outdoor scenes were filmed in Oregon and there are some highly scenic vistas. Keaton is his energetic and stony-faced self.The beginning -- the set up -- is a little slow but, man, does it pick up the tempo towards the end. One of Keaton's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buster Keaton stars in this classic silent film, which he also helped write and direct, as Johnny Gray, engineer on the General, a train that runs the railroad throughout the South. When the Civil War moves into his territory, Johnny wishes to enlist along with his main squeeze's father and brother. However finds he cannot because they consider him more valuable to the South as an engineer aboard his train. Eventually, when Union soldiers, disguised as Confederates steal his General, Johnny takes off in pursuit after them and soon finds himself one man against an army of Union soldiers! With Buster Keaton involved in a silent era film, you know it's more than likely going to deliver the laughs and this does aplenty. Never does it fail to amuse even when it's slowly building up to its next big laugh. Plus this also has thrills, excitement, romance, and all the elements you could ever want in any action thriller all with a lead whose so funny and ingeniously entertaining that it's hard to take one's eyes off of him even when he's just sitting around doing nothing. His expressions and body language insure we always have a good idea of what's going through his mind and his heart at practically all times making this arguably one of the best films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is very unique in a lot of ways.Buster Keaton's particular style tends to contain a playfulness involving machinery and nature, and this film is not only no exception, it's more like the actualization of his oevre into an almost final, complete form.The key thing here is the trains. Keaton loves trains, and indeed this film has more trains than you can shake a stick at... not that you can really shake a stick at a train and expect something to happen, but you get the point. Anyways, not only does it have a lot of trains, it has a lot more trains than I think any other film (it definitely has more trains than any other film I've seen, that is). Furthermore, while I have seen other films involving train chases, I've very seldomly seen films involving trains chasing trains... and even the ones I have don't have as many.For that matter, this film seems almost Hollywoodesque in its train-chases and explosions. Lots of chases, lots of explosions, sounds like Ye Olde Hollywood Fare to me!, only it's like, way before that became typical Hollywood use and it's all tied together specifically by the great Keaton himself.Some people express a little dissatisfaction by the fact that Keaton takes the side of the South. I don't know particularly why he did that, but what strikes me about this film is how it also takes little pokes of parody at the great Birth of a Nation. Furthermore, his relationship with the girl in this case seems like a pretty good deconstruction of the ol' Southern Belle, and that's pretty funny too.I like this film slightly less than other of Keaton's films because it's epic. Actually, this makes this film technically at or above the level of Keaton's other films because of the sheer scale of it. I just like it less because it's slightly less Keaton, and he doesn't have nearly as much space to do what he possibly could. However, touches of his real hard-hitting humor still come through, like when he is sitting on the piston and the train starts to leave while he stares forlornly into space... I'm sure we can all recognize the feeling of just having to let ourselves be carried away by the world when it seems there's no hope for love.Thus, I give this film a 10 out of 10 rating for technical superiority, but 8 out of 10 reflects my personal ranking of it in comparison of other films of his I like. If you like this and haven't seen Sherlock Jr. yet, please see that one as it's my personal favorite.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

The showing at the beautiful Columbus Theatre in Providence was a benefit for the Rhode Island International Film Festival. So much has been written on this wondrous comedy of Keaton, it seems silly to add more except to say that the audience was bowled over by it and vociferous in its enthusiasm. The train chase sequences are inimitable and have never been duplicated even with greater technical resources at hand in later decades. Yes, the music was tremendous, but the ability of this silent treasure to generate such audience excitement today was truly gratifying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first Buster Keaton movie I've ever seen.It sounds like I picked a good one to start at considering how high this film usually ranks on lists among both silent pictures and talkies. Of course, I could not watch Buster Keaton without constantly drawing comparisons to Charlie Chaplin because the two are forever linked as rivals of the silent film era. Having seen several of Chaplin's films before viewing even one of Keaton's I have drawn two conclusions based on what I saw in "The General": 1) Chaplin's films are 'funnier'(meaning I laughed out loud more during them) than "The General" 2) "The General" is better than any of Chaplin's movies because it has a fluent storyline, great stunt work, and shows fresh new ideas and ingenuity in every frame. I liked "The General" a lot, but not for the reasons I expected. I was equal parts riveted and amused by every last minute of this movie. I sat fixed to the television watching the film unfold in progressive layers of creativity. Only after it ended did I realize how little I actually laughed out loud. And the few times I did often seemed to represent my disbelief at what I was seeing on screen. Maybe I missed something. Maybe I just don't 'get' Keaton's humor. Or maybe it's just that Keaton didn't play his roles up for big laughs, but instead drew what humor he could from acting how he might normally act in chaotic situations. I don't know.This movie was endlessly entertaining but not actually 'hilarious' in the traditional sense of the word. To me its not a great comedy so much as a wonderful silent picture (one of the best I've seen).my rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best silent picture ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton was the single most brilliant performer of the silent era. He even eclipsed the extremely talented Charlie Chaplin - who has more of a following. But, Keaton's stunts (he never used a double) and improvisational skill far exceeded anything Chaplin did while equaling Chaplin's penchant for subtlety, intimacy and humor. Keaton's ability to play a scene with the perfect facial expression (a talent especially critical in silent pictures) also surpassed Chaplin's classic eye-rolling and mustache wiggling. The General, which Keaton wrote and directed in addition to being the film's star, was an ambitious undertaking that showcased all of his abilities for creating empathy, tension, and zaniness in a way that - unlike virtually any other silent picture - holds up very well to most viewers even today. Keaton's secret lies in his capacity to tap in to timeless aspects of human experience. His style is sleek and melancholy without coming off as sentimental. He is sophisticated and his stunts strike the viewer today as jaw-dropping and completely modern. Perhaps too modern in this film - which was a financial flop in its day. Trying to infuse the War Between the States with humor did not play well with mainstream audiences in 1927. The General actually presented itself more effectively years later before audiences less affected by the times it depicts. The film is flawlessly exciting, poignant, funny and technically satisfying in every respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take it in the right spirit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading through the comments I am gob smacked at the pretentiousness of some of the reviewers who are looking for and finding things that were never there in the first place. 'The General' is a motion picture, Keaton made it to entertain, to tell a story, it is not an analysis of the futility of war or any such thing, and it should be taken as Keaton intended it to be, nothing more. The one thing this movie does prove was that Buster Keaton was one of the greatest film makers of all time, not just of silent movies, his films are among the few silent movies to stand the test of time and be as fresh as when they were first made. What happened to him after he went to MGM was nothing short of criminal, maltreated by a studio who took away his creative independence, then not knowing what to do with him put him in movies that wasted his incredible talents, it is a tragedy for Keaton , his fans and motion pictures. When watching this you wonder what he could have done had he been allowed to do what he wanted, after all, he was only 30 when he made 'The General', how much more did he have to give creatively, alas, we shall never know. The problem for 'The General', when it was made was that audiences were not so open minded, in the sense that once an actor or actress made a certain type of movie, they were expected to stick to making that type of movie, Keaton made slapstick comedies, so when 'The General' was made it was against type and people also found the humour too black, the first World War had been less than 10 years earlier and people being killed wasn't acceptable in a 'comedy'. But, back to my opinion of 'The General', it is, in my view, one of the most perfect films ever made, it captures the feeling of the time so well that you can almost believe it was made in the 1860's. even though we all know the moving camera hadn't been invented, but, you know what I mean. It is humourous, not meant to produce belly laughs, and the stunts are up to Keaton's usual excellent standards, there is hardly a pratfall in sight as they would be out of place. It is a film, that if you watch in the right frame of mind can sweep you along and it was over all too soon for me. The pace never drags and all the leads are excellent. This is a beautiful film in every sense, I haven't bothered with a synopsis as others have gone ahead of me with adequate descriptions of the plot. If you don't want to see it because it is 'black and white' or a 'silent' then all I can say is that it must be terrible to be that narrow minded and at the end of the day it is your loss. There are films that are 70 and 80 years old that are superior to many churned out today, and I'm not just talking about Keaton's movie, do yourself a favour and rent one out and this ain't a bad one to start with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mmm. Not bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Slight Spoilers** Not being bothered by the lack of a soundtrack, nor black and white, I rented this movie to watch and enjoy, especially since it comes of such high regard.I was disappointed that the movie, regarded as a comedy, did not give forth more laughs. Dont get me wrong: it's funny! It has hilarious moments, but it's not non-stop laughter. But the reason for that is one of The General's strengths. It has a thoroughly believable plot.Johnnie Gray is a steam-engine engineer who loves his girlfriend and his locomotive about the same. But the Civil War has come to that part of the South and they wont enlist him because they need engineers running locomotives since there aren't a lot of them going about. His girlfriend believes he's just a coward and tries to go by without seeing him until he's in uniform.But soon Union Soldiers kidnaps his girl and the locomotive and he has to go save both.Another thing that struck me was that this movie has a REAL sense of adventure a lot of movies want and lack. It's like a silent Indiana Jones without Nazis and wips and special effects. And they apparently did borrow ideas from this movie for Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Forget THE MUMMY RETURNS! This movie has REAL adventures without special effects. The only special effect is a laughable lightning bolt, but that's all.Trains get de-railed, bridges collapse, there's a battle at the end and a lot stunts that director, and writer, Buster Keaton did himself. It may not have the hype of Chaplin, but it's great.So, I was disappointed in the comedy aspect, but the movie in all has charm, adventure and love! I love this movie. I was TRULY satisfied at the end of it. Shame it's almost forgotten! It got remade, but I doubt the remake is any good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a non-stop laugher, but a great movie nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie garnered decided mixed reviews when it was released, and when one studies it in the context of Keaton's previous films, it is apparent why: this is a comedy only as a secondary consideration. As its primary consideration, the film tells a classic story from the American Civil War, gently sprinkling the gags throughout the telling, without letting them overcome a very serious plot. While not Keaton's greatest COMEDY (this reviewer would suggest several of Buster's short subjects for that distinction), it is undoubtedly his greatest PRODUCTION, with the values of cinematography, storytelling, acting and comedy balanced in near-perfect harmony for a truly memorable film, and one that the worldwide movie-making industry would be deeply impoverished by its loss, should it be forgotten.In summary: if you want to laugh out loud, a better Keaton film would be 'One Week', or 'The Boat', but if you want to see the height of artistic movie-making that can only be achieved when the star has complete control, you could not find a better comedy.I recently (Jan of 2005) watched this on TCM, and they had it set to a very dramatic music score. I was amazed to find that the movie works just as well as a drama; even the big slapstick laugh sequences in it take on a suspenseful tone when set to different music. I think this, as well as anything, illustrates why initial reactions to the film were mixed: it really does straddle the line between comedy and drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>According to the AFI 100 years, 100 comedies THE GENERAL is Buster greatest film. Taking place during the American Civil War, the General stars Buster Keaton as a little man who wants to be a Confederate soldier. Ironic for its time, I'm shocked that Buster made the hero character a southern confederate soldier and not a union soldier. While it must have been taken in good terms with the southern audience at its time ( along with Birth of a Nation ) I wonder how audiences in the North felt about Buster's film? Still, this is not a movie about war, it is a comedy about the little guy (Keaton) and his train. Like most of Chaplin films, he is the victim in an imperfect world. The comedy is found in Keaton's actions. This is his best comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do agree that "The General" should have been on the top 100 list. Buster Keaton is the icon of the successful comedy writer/director/actors in the 1920's. It just so happens that "The General" is a history lesson as well, and scholars at the time felt that this movie was about as authentic looking as a Matthew Brady photograph of the Civil War. It contains the most expensive stunt done up to that time-the locomotive plunging into the river (not a model). The movie was a labor of love from Keaton and crew and deserves to find a place in movie history long after other silents of the era have disintegrated. After viewing this movie, go on to "Our Relations" and the other fine(and perhaps funnier) movies that Keaton made, and discover the two-reelers, especially "Cops". But this one is special. It is right out of your history book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's little I can say about this movie that hasn't been said better elsewhere. Keaton is one of the great presences on the big screen and this, in addition to Steamboat Bill, Jr. and Sherlock Jr., is the ultimate testament to his genius. His inate ability to elicit sympathy without pandering and generate laughs from the audience are on full display in a fascinating plot with some gorgeous cinematography to boot. Since it is a Keaton film, by definition it has breathtaking stunts. Kino did such a wonderful job restoring this print that you would swear it was shot last year. It is truly a sight to behold. There's nothing like those old silver nitrate prints. In addition, it's been said that no one has ever caught the feel of the Civil War better than Keaton did in this film. Anyone who thinks that a movie made over 70 years ago can't be enjoyable for a reason other than nostalgia needs to see this film. Be warned, though - once you are initiated, Buster Keaton is addictive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How this movie could have been left out of the top 100 flicks of all time I will never know. I remember Keaton as a grumpy old man in the cinema of the 50's and 60's. It was only later when in college film school that I recogized his true genius. The General was one of the first silent movies that I was ever able to sit though long enough to fully appreciate the medium. It had everything, drama, comedy, action, romance. It was also pretty much true to the real event also. My favorite part is when Keaton has rescued the train and his girlfriend and they are escaping the federal troops in full pursuit. His girlfriend having run out of wood to stoke the engine hands him a twig. Keaton looks at the twig and thinks about hitting the girlfriend but instead hugs and kisses her. The other thing that I love about the movie is that there is not one second of wasted film, every scene has definite purpose and it holds your attention every minute. This is Keaton's masterpiece always.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although The General is widely considered a comedic masterpiece amongst critics, I found most of the slapstick humor to fall flat and sometimes completely out of place. The film had a much more action genre feel than of a comedy. It fails to keep a consistent comedic tone which I feel ultimately hurt the overall film. Buster Keaton's character seems to resemble more of a Clumsy Rambo than a comic hero.I also found Buster Keaton to be somewhat irritating. His dead pan expression made his performance feel stiff. Aside from his facial expressions, the rest of his performance was quite entertaining. Although The General fails comically, the overall film is entertaining. I would recommend this film to anyone wanting to broaden their horizons with film, but I would advise that it is somewhat forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Gray only has two loves in his life ? his train "The General" and Miss Annabelle Lee. When the Civil War breaks out, the Lee family's proud military history means that Gray must enlist to keep favour with Annabelle. However he is refused service on the grounds that his engineering role is more important and finds himself rejected by the Lee's. A year passes and the North plans to win the war by sending spies into the South to steal a train and make their way north, burning all the supply bridges behind them and clearing the way for a crushing assault. However they steal The General ? coincidently with Annabelle Lee still on board. Taking another engine but forgetting reinforcements, Gray sets out in pursuit.I was looking forward to this film for several reasons, one of which was the location I watched it. I spend a week in Ronda in Spain in the Hotel San Gabriel, which as well as being a wonderfully cool hotel also has a small projection room with 6 seats reclaimed from an old Spanish cinema that was destroyed in the seventies. The copy they had was not the greatest but it was more than satisfactory for viewing on a "big" screen. I settled to watch the film and found a solid plot that was well delivered in a film that, for the period and limitations, was impressive and clearly expensive. In this regard I enjoyed the film because it was fun spectacle and had a good story. The main problem I had with it was reports of how hilarious the film was, because I'm afraid I didn't see it ? and I have found other Keaton films very funny.It is amusing but not as inspired as I would have hoped and it certainly isn't consistently funny across the whole film. Instead it is rather more impressive in what it does and the risks it takes physically. Keaton takes to this really well and as usual his physical ability is impressive. His straight-faced performances aren't always to my taste I'll admit but he is still good and it suits his material. Support is generally good fun although they all are very much second fiddle. Mack isn't as beautiful as the character demands but I suppose I live in different times. The rest react well to the action and there aren't any weak spots that were that evident.Overall then, a classic piece of silent cinema that is worth seeing for that reason as well as the sheer spectacle of the affair. However those looking for laugh-a-minute stuff might find themselves a bit disappointed as I was, because personally I wasn't laughing anywhere near enough as I had hoped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atypical Keaton but solid film comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this is an excellent film, it has never grabbed me the way it has others. It's very professionally made with the editing a standout. It's greatest value for me is the forever lost vistas and landscapes of the unspoiled land we constantly see whizzing by in the background of most shots. I find it clever and amusing, but never really funny. The attempt to turn a serious historical event into a comic romp never quite works all the way for me.There are moments, however: The father sorting the mail and Buster's photo along with it, Buster's famous train engine piston ride, the shifting cannon and the sheer brilliance of the setup for its actual demolishing shot, the errant boxcar, and the hordes of retreating Southerners and advancing Northerners rushing by Keaton's train while he is blithely unaware - these are great moments, but not enough to sustain an entire film. Frankly, I get bored watching this. Keaton's pacing and rhythms and gag invention for his other features seem to be missing here. It's almost as if we're watching a "serious" comedy - if that is possible.Kino's print is sharp, clear and looks like it was made yesterday. There are sepia and blue tints throughout. The musical accompaniment is violin, piano, drums, flute.It is certainly a very good film and worth seeing - I just don't find it top of the line Keaton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The General is a good movie. There is absolutely nothing negative I can say about it. If you forgot for a moment that Buster Keaton has made other movies, than it would be great. There really is no glaring flaw in the General. Sure, the storyline revolves around getting the girl, like all other stories of the time. But if that's my biggest complaint, then the move must be pretty damn good, right? Well, it is. But the problem I have with the General is it isn't as good as other Keaton stuff not on the top #250 list. Keaton is a great director/actor, but I feel this movie simply does not capture his magic. My favorite Keaton movie, Sherlock Jr., just has this essence to it. I can't exactly describe it, but it entices you and doesn't let go. For instance, Sherlock Jr. has a memorable scene in which Keaton's character jumps (You heard right)through an old lady. Completely through, and without using digital effects. How it was done is a mystery, and that's what makes the movie so great. Sure, The General has its moments. The scene where Keaton lights the upwardly faced cannon, only to have it slowly inch towards him is great, but it doesn't do as much for me. Another complaint I have with the movie is the length. Good comedies know when to quit, before they get stale. Sherlock Jr. is only 44 minutes long and that's perfect. The movie ends just before the charm wears off. The General, howeer, is over 70. Most comedies today have trouble lasting 70 minutes, and they can use both verbal and sight gags to kill time. The General, being a silent film, must rely on 70 minutes of sight gags. Most of them a clever, but they get old. I found myself drifting away from the movie and into my own thoughts quite often during the feature (I saw this, by the way, at the Silent Movie Theatre in Los Angeles, one of two left in the world). If you are just getting into Keaton, see this first. If you're into Keaton, but have yet to see the General, don't be expected if you're disappointed. His other work is much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most satisfying of all movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has a grace and a sophistication that make most contemporary depictions of action and incident seem instantly dated. Keaton almost seems spiritually melded with the train as he climbs all over it, effortlessly inches it forward or backward; the staging and pacing of the action is so perfect in its flowing clarity as to be almost mystical. Keaton grasps the full potential and beauty of cinema space - such as the cannon that after the fuse is lit slips downward to aim towards Keaton himself rather than the pursued train, but then (depicted in a single perfectly coordinated shot) encounters a bend in the track as it goes off, and so hits its intended target anyway. Keaton hardly ever gives himself a close-up (really just a couple of shots), but when he does it underlines his almost surreal impassivity - it's almost impossible here to think of him having a voice or a rounded character - not because he's flat but because he's somehow transcendent. His philosophical remove resonates against the trickery-free, expansive handling of the action. The portrayal of the war scenes further suggests he could have been a great action or epic director. One of the most satisfying of all movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cinema has cherished its long-standing love affair with trains, and The General is perhaps the quintessential train movie. But it is first and foremost a Buster Keaton movie, and this is the forecaster of its continued value. Keaton is arguably the ultimate motion picture maker in the history of the movies; he relentlessly pursued comic perfection through his famous deadpan screen performances and his mechanical wizardry and technical expertise. The General is shockingly contemporary in portraying the romantic relationship between Keaton's Johnnie and Marion Mack's Annabelle Lee -- their interaction is brighter and more sophisticated than most late-20th century movies. The General is a wholly (and for Keaton fans, holy) satisfying film experience crammed with vibrant and hilarious visual gags. Everyone should share this film with a friend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just wrote a review for STEAMBOAT BILL, JR. and that makes this review VERY difficult, because I really can't decide which of these two films is better. To me, they are both nearly perfect and represent the best full-length material Keaton performed--at least when it comes to stunts and laughs. It's sad really, as just after these two triumphs came the sound era--and a seriously negative down-turn in Keaton's career, as MGM repeatedly gave him terrible material--pairing him with the brash and inappropriate humor of Jimmy Durante. This film is probably the best of his films when it comes to concept and consistency of the plot. And, for once, I have nothing critical to say about the film. No matter how many times I see it, it just seems perfect. This might just be my favorite silent comedy--period. It's that good. However, as this IS more plot-driven than most of his films, don't expect the rapid-fire laughs--there is a lot of set-up and story instead. This is NOT a complaint--just don't expect the pacing of his shorts--which, incidentally, you won't find in any of the full-length films.By the way, while all is practically perfect in every way about this film, this is NOT my favorite Keaton full-length film. While not as funny or filled with amazing stunts, OUR HOSPITALITY is an amazing film for its artistry. In addition to being the prettiest of his films, it also features among the best characterization for Keaton--with a full and rich plot. My advice is to see THE GENERAL and OUR HOSPITALITY and see two very different and probably equally great films from a master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Staggering silent genius that leaves you speechless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's odd that Keaton's most acclaimed film should in a sense be his least typical. If we have developed a cliched sense of the Keaton persona - the stony-faced, melancholy dreamer, defeated by modernity and women, lost in an anguished, surreal, yet modern space, successful only in his dreams - then you won't find much of that here. 'The General' is not only historically grounded, it is set in perhaps the defining moment in American history, when the nation tore itself apart over the idea of what America was. Buster is no loser here - he's only apparently cowardly to his prospective in-laws - we know why he doesn't fight, and he proves his quite extraordinary bravery, a lone defender of virtue against a gang of subversives, for which he is officially recognised. He even manages to master technology, driving his trains like they are go-karts, manipulating the complex railroad system to his own(subtly sexualised) end. The Beckett pseud won't find much here.Or won't he? This is a very strange Civil War picture, with a similar plot to 'Birth of a Nation', but none of the overheated ideology. In fact, Keaton's representation of this divisive bloodbath, where thousands of real bodies died or were maimed, which left generations of bitterness, is remarkable for its cool abstraction. Keaton gives us a Civil War with the history taken out. It is, of course, appropriate to our conception of him that Buster should be on the losing side, and it is this historical irony that undermines the film's heroics and happy ending - WE know that Buster is doing it all for nothing (well, I'm sure his fiancee wouldn't say it was nothing!); we may not see Sisyphus' boulder rolling down this time, but we know it will. In terms of the film, Keaton's being a Unionist or Confederate is arbitrary - there are no reasons given for the war, no historical background. Buster is not fighting for any particular ideal or culture; he has to prove himself, like knights of old, in action, before he can win the princess' hand.this emphasis on action, rather than context or analysis, is a radically new way of looking at history. The film consists of two movements, like a mathematical vector - in the first half, Buster chases a train; in the second, the train chases him. The film, like the country, is divided in two - if Buster's efforsts are ultimately pointless, than what of the war? To say there is no moral valency would be wrong - the North kidnap civilian women, the South don't, and ultimately will lose. But in Keaton's universe, everyone loses; every struggle is only for a Pyhrric victory, because in the end we will always be defeated, if only by death.The audacity of Keaton to stretch this minimalist conceit of action to an entire feature, in period dress, is breathtaking. Even more so is that the film is so thrilling; it reduces cinema to its component parts - the photographing of action, hunter and hunted - and asks why we need anything more. Action is so eloquent, explaining character, history, culture. There is something very moving, even humbling, about this abstract plot taking place in such beautiful, natural surroundings. You can almost touch the thick raindrops as Buster rescues Annabelle, or the trees as the train whizzes by. Is there any more resonant sequence in cinema than the one where Buster puts in heroic effort to get a cannon working to derail his enemies, only to leave it pointing at himself? 'Heroic' is the word David Thomson uses to describe this masterpiece, and you're kind of glad the wise Buster was alive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No film is perfect, but there are a few which come pretty close and The General is such a picture. There's not a doubt in my mind that this is Keaton's finest work. It is not his funniest, but it is certainly his most thrilling and beautiful.Orson Welles once claimed this film captured the look and feel of the American Civil War better than The Birth of a Nation (1915) or even the much loved Gone with the Wind (1939). I would have to concur. From the costumes to the sets, the whole movie reeks with authenticity. In a way, it makes it almost timeless, since the film doesn't feel dated like most other 1920s historical films which usually keep a touch of contemporary influence in the costumes and make-up (then again, this is the case with most historical pictures in general). Just as Buster himself wished, the picture is "so authentic it hurts".The action aspect of The General is the highlight for me. Those stunts Buster performs are just amazing. I've seen this film at least ten times, yet I never fail to gasp and marvel at the things Buster does on that moving locomotive. And no, unlike later films, Buster is not in front of a projection; he's actually on a moving train on-location. There's no way the folks up in Hollywood would let that happen today, and that's why this film is infinitely much more impressive than the CG infested action films we have nowadays.Another wonderful part of the film is the romance. The relationship between Johnnie (Buster) and Annabelle (Marion Mack) is earthy; they both get frustrated with each other, especially on Johnnie's end. The scene which best illustrates this relationship is when Johnnie gets annoyed at Annabelle and mockingly strangles her before planting a quick kiss on her mouth. It's both funny and sweet, undoubtedly the most romantic moment in all his work.I adore this film. It is my all-time favorite. If you call yourself a film buff but haven't seen this yet, then get your butt off the couch and rent it! It's among cinema's finest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The General is not a great comedy- it's just a great movie with a few funny parts thrown in. One of the reasons why this film received poor critical reception when it was released was because the critics were expecting a comedy, not some 100 minute-long epic movie about the civil war. Of course, like all Keaton movies the gags are great. My personal favorite comes right at the beginning, when the guy puts on his hat as though he is going to leave the building and the two children exit immediately, just before he shuts the door.The General wasn't really like some of the other silent films I have seen- it seems more like a modern talkie stripped of its sound. It never goes over-the-top like the pictures of Chaplin and Lloyd and even most of Keaton's other movies. It never tries too hard to remind the audience how good it is, which is just perfect. Whereas a good movie constantly reminds you of its quality, a great movie allows it to go unnoticed until after the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has it all - boy gets girl, some brilliant stunts only amplified by the fact that many of them were real, and an intriguing plot which is based on a true story of some Union soldiers who stole a train during the Civil War, hoping to destroy the supply lines for Confederate troops as they rode North.The movie is set during the Civil War and the legendary Buster Keaton is a man named Johnny Gray who, at the outset of the movie, we learn, has two loves - his girl Annabelle Smith (Marion Mack) and the train of which he is the engineer, "The General". He wants to enlist in the Confederate army but when the military learns what his career is, the recruiter tells him that he might be of more use remaining at that position. His loved one's family believes that he has shirked his responsibility to the Confederacy though. When his train is stolen by Union troops, he pursues it and in time, he finds Annabelle who had been kidnapped by northern troops and destroys the railway heading South in order to turn the tables on Union troops who had wanted to do the same thing to the Confederacy.The stunts are amazing and Gray's desire to prove himself to his girl and her skeptical family give him the determination to see his mission to a successful conclusion. The attempt by Union troops to sabotage the Confederacy and Gray's success in turning the tables on them make for a great plot and Keaton's stunts are amazing, from flipping one plank onto another to get it off the tracks to racing over moving train cars. His deadpan expression only underlines the precariousness of the stunts he does and it's hard not to grin from ear to ear as Gray goes on heedlessly.Really this is a wonderful movie. This is an action-comedy movie before there was such a film. There is even some romance to bookend the action that comprises the majority of the film. This is a movie that doesn't get old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1926?.. Amazing! Some of you may think that I exaggerate, but this movie is a cornerstone for human race; the beginning and a definition of "movie art".Buster Keaton uses the music so perfectly this level of "coding" can only be seen in Spielberg/Williams makes. It must also be the "father" of NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming). I can't even imagine the hard work behind the scenes that enabled him to synchronize the action, the music and actors involved in one scene. Please return back to the movie and watch the train chase.A bright gem that should never be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The General (1926)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"If you lose this war don't blame me."This is the story of a locomotive engineer who does everything in his power to save his beloved engine from the the spies who stole it. Little does he know that he would also end up saving the love of his life and win a major victory for his side, in the process.The movie starts with a innocent domestic scene which introduces the main characters: the boy, the girl and the engine (not necessarily in that order). Then the quiet day to day routine - of which we don't get to see a lot of - is abruptly interrupted by news of war. And from then on it's a non-stop race to the finish.This is a silent movie and it is difficult to describe it in the usual terms of image quality, actor's play, script, music and the like. It has been said that silent movies are a completely different species and that certainly is true. Most of the message is conveyed trough facial expressions and mimic, most of them exaggerated and often pushed to the limit, sometimes even more so than in theater, for example. And the need to express everything in this manner makes it difficult to take them seriously, most of the time, but I'll give it a try.The camera work is surprisingly good. For a movie of this era one would half expect a small room with a chair, a table, a tea tray and a bunch of characters talking about the weather, for an hour, which most definitely is not the case. The movie is extremely dynamic, there is a lot going on at any given moment and everything is filmed out in the open, with very few exceptions.The story is rather complex, maybe more complex than the standard silent movie would be and it needs a lot of cue cards to explain itself, which causes some scenes to become much too fragmented and frustrating, at times.The actors play their parts with enthusiasm, there is a lot of resolute gestures, a lot of firm hand shaking, the - one - girl in this movie is very sure of herself and of what she wants in her life and the extras look very convincing. And there is a whole lot of them.The sets are... big. Very big. There are a lot of innovations in this movie and Mr. Keaton is definitely one of the most daring actors, storytellers and directors in the history of cinema. I think he is also the inventor of the face palm, among other things, and he uses quite a few variations of it throughout the movie.The General. A great movie that will put a smile on anyone's face. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can honestly say that I loved this film and intend to see more with Buster Keaton. It was well thought out and fun to watch.The intro informs us that he has two loves, his train and a woman. The setting is in the Civil War and it was funny to watch him trying to enlist. They felt as though he would be more useful as an engineer than a soldier participating in the war. There is a confusion with his girlfriend and she tells him to not speak to her again until he is enlisted in the war.There is a lot of actions and stunts that Buster Keaton seems to have performed himself as the North is trying to steal his train.It was fun to watch and every minute was interesting. Something I definitely recommend and something that I would most certainly watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keaton's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton's acclaimed Civil War comedy, often ranked among the best films ever made, highlights all the virtues of a Keaton feature: beautiful photography; unique construction (being in this instance a mirror pair of equally inventive locomotive chases); daring stunts; and, of course, Keaton's always unexpected, perfectly timed humor. The film is also a convincing slice of antebellum Americana, with Buster stepping out of a Matthew Brady photograph to play a Confederate railroad engineer who rescues his beloved locomotive (and his almost-as-beloved girlfriend) from Union Army hijackers. The film is occasionally more thrilling than funny, but the thrills, at least, are honest: when the Rock River Bridge collapses under the Union train, nothing is faked. This is the most familiar of Keaton's classic comedies, and the frequency of revival (for a silent film) has had some adverse side effects: before the development of DVD technology most of then surviving prints were in pretty poor condition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buster Keaton is generally known for his comedy forays in the silent era, but this movie is a hybrid romance, comedy, and action movie. The plot is merely a vessel for the action and stunts, and for a movie that came out in 1926, I was impressed.In what was apparently real stunts, I watched Keaton jump from trains and inflict pain on the North. It's an interesting commentary too, on films from the South. With the film being in black and white, Union soldiers symbolically come out looking as the villains with their navy blue uniforms appearing black. The opposite is true as well, as the South's gray uniforms look white on the film stock, giving them an aura of righteousness.It was also an interesting theme that Keaton got all of his motivation from the girl that wanted him to enlist, and all his inspiration from his other love, The General. Both helped him mold himself into a soldier, and by the end it was all tied up with a nice bow. An enjoyable hour-and-a-half</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The General" is considered by many to be the best comedy of the silent film era. That's quite a reputation to live up to, but having now seen it I can readily see why it's thought of so highly, and say that it doesn't disappoint in the least. It's a totally one-of-a-kind film, and completely pleasurable and engrossing from start to finish. It's been said that it isn't properly a comedy, but I think once one starts watching it doesn't matter: the simple and human but methodical and intricate story of how Buster sets out singlehandedly to rescue the train and woman he loves is so absorbing that when the comedy (which is as musically times as the rest of the film and all hits home) stop we are too busy being thrilled by the stunts, coincidences, and stunning set pieces to notice, and when these stop we are too busy laughing to care.Perhaps eighty per cent of "The General's" hundred or so minutes consist of one train chasing after another on the tracks. It's no surprise this brings unity, but it's a unique achievement for Buster that even within that potentially monotonous framework nothing becomes repetitious and the tension never ceases. The film-making itself and the timing in these hugely complicated shots involving steam trains narrowly missing each other and countless other obstructions is so precise and flawless that it would be possible simply to ignore the rest of the film and marvel at that for the running time if one felt like it.Buster Keaton's brilliantly off-kilter and eccentric way of viewing the world -- creating hilarious gags both social and mechanical that seem woven from exactly the same cloth -- comes together with a relatable and admirable quest story with natural and highly sympathetic human interest, and some of the most technically pin-perfect execution imaginable to create an extraordinary mix of comedy and thrill that we can invest in too. It's definitely among the most memorable films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

Its sequences of sight gags, each topping the one before, is an incredible joy to behold. The film, however, was a box-office disaster on its original release.

		<shortDescription>Keaton's Finest Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a great introduction to Keaton. His acrobatics and deadpan expressions alone make this a must see. In this film, Keaton plays Johny Gray. It is based in the South at the start of the Civil War. Keaton is a railroad engineer and wants to enlist with the rebel army but is denied. He still becomes a hero to the South, and most importantly, his girl.The General was not an instant hit. In fact, it wasn't considered a classic until many years later. It is now considered to be one of the funniest movies of all time. It is a bit of comedy gold. Well written, great stunts, and even good effects(for 1926). It is widely considered to be Keaton's masterpiece although I think some of his shorter films are even better. The Camera Man, Steamboat Bill Jr., Cops are among the many that I recommend.But, for now, enjoy this classic comedy. I hope you will seek out other works by Keaton from his earlier years. He later lost creative control to MGM and his movies suffered the consequences. He also fell victim to alcoholism after a bitter divorce left him broke. His story is rather tragic. This is especially true since he didn't get proper recognition for his work until much later. If you enjoy this movie do yourself a favor and find other Keaton works. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Railroad Action Movie Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ironically, Buster Keaton's all-time favorite film comedy "The General" (1927) flopped at the box office during its initial release. Critics and audiences alike panned this superlative American Civil War saga. Forty years later critics hailed Keaton's film a masterpiece, and it ranks among the top ten on virtually every critical short list of silents. Unlike his closest rival Charles Chaplin, who ingratiated himself with audiences as the little "Tramp," Keaton remained aloof, never cracked a smile and acquired the nickname "The Great Stone Face." The fun of watching any Keaton film is the deadpan acrobat's titanic struggle to gain mastery over some form of machinery and adapt to the people around him. For example, in "Steamboat Bill, Jr," Buster must win the girl, reconcile both fathers, and master operating a steamboat in the midst of a cyclone. This theme recurs in his best films, including include "Our Hospitality" (1923), "The Navigator" (1924), "Sherlock Jr." (1924), "Steamboat Bill Jr." (1928), and "The Cameraman "(1928), More than any of these Keaton topped himself with "The General." Introverted railroad engineer Johnnie Gray (Buster Keaton) has two loves: a locomotive named 'The General" and Annabelle Lee (Marion Mac), his girlfriend. While visiting Annabelle, he learns that the Confederacy has fired on Fort Sumter. Annabelle's father and brother storm off to the recruiting station. Johnnie takes a short-cut to be first in line. Complications arise when Confederate officials refuse to enlist him. They judge Johnnie more valuable to the South as train engineer rather than a soldier. Repeatedly, Johnnie tries to enlist, and they finally give him the boot. When Annabelle's father and brother arrive, they urge Johnnie to join them, but he walks off. Johnnie is too ashamed to tell Annabelle the truth. She refuses to talk to him until he is in uniform.A year later, at a Union encampment north of Chattanooga, General Thatcher (Jim Farley) meets with his chief spy, Captain Anderson. Anderson (Glen Cavender) assures Thatcher he knows every foot of the Southern railroad between Marietta and Chattanooga, and he cannot fail on his mission with ten hand-picked men. They strike during dinner and hijack Johnnie's train. Worst, Annabelle is caught in the baggage car and Anderson's men take her hostage. Johnnie pursues them on foot, by hand-car, and later by bicycle, but he cannot catch them. He stumbles into another station and commandeers the locomotive called the 'Texas' and pursues Anderson with what he thinks is a train load of Confederate troops. He learns too late the troop train wasn't coupled to the locomotive. At one point, Johnnie hooks a flatcar with a mortar and tries to blast the Union spies ahead of him on 'The General.' Johnnie almost blows himself up. Anderson and his men don't stop because they believe Johnnie has them outnumbered.Eventually, Anderson realizes Johnnie is alone and Johnnie has to abandon the Texas. He gets lost in the woods during a thunderstorm and turns up like a drenched rat at a house where the Union Army is about to convene to discuss their plans. Johnnie sneaks into the house and raids dinner table. He avoids narrowly being caught by climbing underneath the table and eavesdrops on the Union plan to attack the Confederates. At the same time, he spots Annabelle who is being escorted into the house by two troops. After the Union officers conclude their meeting, Johnnie knocks out a guard, steals his uniform, finds Annabelle and they try to sneak through Union lines. Johnnie decides to steal his locomotive?the General?back and Anderson and his men pursue him in the 'Texas.' Johnnie manages to stay ahead of them long enough to burn the Rock River Bridge. When a Union train crosses the bridge, the structure buckles and train and trestle crash into the river. Johnnie discovers the Union officer he knocked unconscious in the cab of the General is General Thatcher. The Southern General awards Johnnie a commission as a lieutenant. Annabelle is as overjoyed as Johnnie until they have to pause in their kissing for him to salute an entire army of privates marching past him.Keaton's timing is impeccable throughout "The General." The scene where Johnnie loads the mortar on the flat car and the muzzle dips so that it is aimed at Johnnie while the fuse burns is hilarious. Miraculously, Johnnie's locomotive cruises off onto another set of tracks, while the mortar trundles along the original set and the cannon ball narrowly misses the Union spies on their train. Later, Anderson's men follow a switchback that takes them onto a towering trestle where they pause their locomotive and bombard Johnnie with railroad ties as his engine runs under the trestle.Keaton drew "The General" from a true-life Civil War incident where Union spies stole the eponymous locomotive. William A. Pittenger wrote a book about it entitled "Daring and Suffering: A History of the Great Railway Adventure." Tom Dardis quoted Keaton in his biography "Keaton: The Man Who Wouldn't Lie Down" as bragging, "No pains were spared to make the film as authentic as they possibly could." Keaton converted a tragedy into a comedy for the Confederacy. Keaton explained his reason for this decision: "You can always make villains out of the Northerners, but you cannot make a villain out of the South." Moreover, the stone-faced comic tried to use the authentic locomotive "The General" that had been housed in a Chattanooga railroad station. Originally, he had sought to shoot on the actual terrain, but he hated the scenery and wound up reenacting history in Oregon with 500 Oregon State Guardsmen impersonating Union and Confederate troops. Reportedly, the money shot of the collapsing bridge cost Keaton and company $42-thousand dollars.Keaton's "The General" dwarfs the widescreen 1956 Walt Disney produced release "The Great Locomotive Chase" with Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter and depicts the events from the Northern perspective. Indeed, "The General" is one of my all-time favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>perhaps the boldest, and maybe just the best, of all action comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The General provides the kind of blockbuster entertainment a lot of today's action-film fans don't know what they're missing and provides the kind of humor that's varied in physical prowess and ingenuity with timing and detail and deadpan expressionism. While Passion of Joan of Arc may make us bawl out in tears and City Lights and Sunrise marvel us with the joys of living, The General is just rollicking fun filmed to a perfection within its limitations. It might tell a slightly contrived love story (i.e. she'll only even speak to John if he is in a uniform despite a reasonable explanation why he's declined to fight at first), and some of its special effects sequences are near unbelievable, but Buster Keaton and collaborator Clyde Bruckman are so in control of their elements- of crowds, of the speed and intricacies and idiosyncrasies of the train, of Keaton in the midst of Civil War terror- that it's hard to see it as anything else but a classic of its time and beyond.Just the sheer physicality is incredible; watching Keaton put together these sequences, from the bits of him trying to load up a train with wood to getting onto another rail of tracks to dodge the other cars and just running around and then having the hundreds of soldiers running and fighting and in battle formation, is nearly overwhelming. The General is only 75 minutes but it feels epic and full of grandeur, and its got some hysterical set-pieces to boot (watching Keaton and his female lead getting out of a bear trap is enough to belly laugh and cringe at the same time) on top of its breakneck pacing. In a sense there isn't a whole lot of plot even as it tells a very carefully constructed story in the strictest action-movie sense of the word: a man in love with his engine and the girl of his dreams isn't allowed in the army, but nevertheless takes some kind of control over his "General" train car, and one night overhears of a plot to sabotage his Confederate buddies, which he'll stop in the most insane circumstances imaginable.The General provided me with two things consistently, and didn't let up for its entire running time: sheer cinematic prowess the likes of which is equable to the greatest and brawniest of silent pictures where you barely need a title card to keep things moving along (and of all things a train is a really clever vehicle, no pun intended, to keep the action and the story without any real lulls save for Keaton's pratfalls), and Keaton himself as a one-of-a-kind clown. He's not exactly always sweet and delightful in the sense that Chaplin is, but in his very downtrodden and almost serious way he's the best kind of comedian you could ask for in this environment. It's based on a true story, which adds to the appeal of the sort of frowning clown of action- one of the truly spectacular stunt-men even in just loading a gun or bringing out his blade- that Keaton is quintessential in being. And it goes without saying that by the time we get to that bridge blowing up it simply reveals itself as a towering HOW-did-they-do-THAT set piece you couldn't try and fake on a computer.Loaded with sublime craftsmanship and daring-do (and all on the "good-guy" side of the confederates!), the General is not one to miss. And anyone thinking that a silent film doesn't have the power to keep an audience dulled by empty-headed and soulless and trashy Hollywood entertainments need to look back at this. It's a need fulfilled to the Nth degree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read this as metaphor for the changing state of cinema.It came out the same year as the first major talkie, which certainly scared the bejesus out of Keaton.The railroad to the Civil War era is as the cinema to the early 20th century -- a frighteningly ubiquitous, revolutionary technology whose power was not fully grasped (think atomic technology to the mid-20th century). The real war here is between the silent stars and the synchronized sound revolution. The track is the linear stream of history and Keaton's train is pursued by its more youthful, vigorous counterpart. How does he fight its advance? sight gags, the way he's made his living. He chose to represent the south because even then he knew his was a dying art form, one that was eclipsed almost instantaneously. This film obviously had a huge budget, so studios still invested heavily in silent film, but Keaton knew what was coming.The score here is of interest too. It's not the kind of music you associate with comedy, certainly not what Chaplin used. Then I realized: Keaton is absolute deadpan, so in that light the music makes perfect sense -- it's deadpan too, just a dramatic observer of comic events, like Keaton himself, an observer of his own gags.Visually, it's remarkable, the motion of the camera, the balanced framing, the wonderful examination of nature fighting technology.There's something about Keaton too. He has that kinetic tension that allows a still face and form to enthrall, like Clint, Benicio, Brando. Really incredible to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hearing and reading the many positive things about Buster Keaton (including a discussion of Chaplin vs. Keaton in Bertolucci's Dreamers) was some of the reasons, the others of course because his films are classics, of why I has many desires to check his films but it was until this weekend that I finally bought The General Region 4 DVD. The version of that DVD is the one with 75 minutes only and the picture and the sound of it is quite good. Anyway, I saw it last night, quite late but I knew since the beginning that this film could keep me awake easily and it did that. Keaton is Johnnie Gray, a train engineer and s because of his work that he wasn't accepted in the Confederate Army. Is fun how actually this is good since Gray is not accepted because his actual job is quite important but of course Johnny doesn't know that so he can't tell anything when his girlfriend (Marion Mack) believe that he is a coward, thanks to what her father and bother said, and left him. The film is set during the Civil War and is just fantastic how Johnnie wants to help the Confederates but mostly because external factors. First he wants to join the army because of his girl and later he began to chase the ones that stole his locomotive and ends hearing the Union strategy. Both chases are amazing and hilarious thanks to the cleverness and the skills of Johnnie but also his luck have an important role (Buster Keaton is brilliant making many impressive scenes and later Marion Mack joins him and both delivers terrific scenes). The end is also magnificent and actually Johnnie was the hero, a very lucky hero, and of course he doesn't get any credit but he finally can join the army and return with his girl (actually Annabelle Lee was with him since he rescue her from the Union in other great coincidence) Is funny to think in the consequences that can bring that choice since I don't think Johnnie can have the same luck in every battle but who knows.Conclusion: The General is a classic of the silent film era so you should watch it at least once. As I write before I saw it last night, by myself, and today I showed it to my family and they enjoyed it a lot. I loved it and even it doesn't need more recommendations I still strongly recommend you this classic picture of Buster Keaton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's difficult enough to write comments for films around fifty years old but when were talking 'silent' there's another dimension of difficulty inasmuch as one is moving into a world of title cards and 26 frames per second. On the other hand a truly great film will suffer comparison with the best of later eras and so it is here. If one is new to Keaton, knowing only that he was a deadpan comedian who performed hilarious yet often dangerous stunts then this will be something of (in the words Oscar Hammerstein put into the mouth of the King Of Siam) a puzzlement; it boasts a more or less straightforward narrative in which engineer Keaton's train is stolen by Union troops during The War Between The States and he sets off in pursuit. Any gags occur naturally within this context rather than being contrived and the film is better for this. I doubt if I can add anything pertinent to previous comments so I'll content myself with reporting that I'm glad to have seen it at last.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The great train chase would perhaps be a better and more suiting title for this movie. The movie is for most part set in a train engine and involved the Buster Keaton in the pursuit of another stolen train by the Union army, during the American Civil War.You would think that a movie that's mostly set in a moving train engine would become tiresome after a while and jokes would start to repeat itself. But it's amazing all the stuff they came up with. What is it with Buster Keaton and trains? There also is one great long sequences involving a train in his earlier movie "Our Hospitality".It's a really creative comedy, with always some surprising unexpected insane moments in it. It's way more than just some other slapstick routines. The movie also obviously caused more than most other silent comedy, made during the same era. As a matter of fact the movie actually features the single most expensive shot of the entire silent movie era in it.Buster Keaton himself also once again performances all of his stunts. It aren't his biggest or most spectacular looking stunts but just as dangerous nevertheless.The story was fun and interesting, also since it's partly based on true events during the Civil War. There of course aren't that many Civil War comedies in general, so in that regard this movie already is an original one. The set back of the movie enhances the story, that of course however does not form the most important aspect of the movie.This was Buster Keaton's own personal favorite and it also really is one of his best movies!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buster Keaton, never heard of him. I only new Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, before i turned into a comic titles searcher. And guess, I would have missed some of the best works from the silent era."The General" is the best Silent movie, I have seen. Even if I remove the last 3 words from the previous sentence, it would be true.The Plot is known as "The Great Locomotive Chase". Keaton plays a railroad engineer and story is all about how he saves his side, without any help (with some help from his love), in the war. Keaton's less expressive face suits great to the subject.I enjoyed the background music. A commenter said it is repetitive. Yes, it is, but the action goes on steam engines throughout the movie and the music just felt like going with the engine.Fans of Chaplin and Laurel &amp; Hardy, will love Buster Keaton for sure. A Must watch movie.</fullReview>

It's always great to see him with a deadpan expression - and even a mop-top hairdo! - despite the craziness surrounding him while driving the train. But amidst it all, we understand that he has a solid, perfectly good reason for taking the locomotive down the railroad. Of course, even if he didn't it would still be a great movie. It's one that you just gotta love. They must have had fun filming it. And the best part (for me, at least) is: they filmed it here in Oregon!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The General is one of the funniest, exciting and most beautifully filmed movies I've ever seen. It never fails to make me smile (not to mention laugh out loud). Not only is it hilarious, it also has many amazing (especially for their time) action/stunt sequences - not only in technique and execution but also creativity. The General even manages to integrate these elements together seamlessly around a simple story about a boy, a girl, and a train. And some bad guys. And a civil war.One of the great things about The General is that it never sacrifices its characters or its story in favour of jokes or gags but rather all of the humour derives naturally from the characters and situations. I think this is part of the reason that The General is a timeless classic and will almost definitely continue to be one for the decades to come. The more familiar you are with the characters and the story, the more you adore them and the more deeply you appreciate the humour and beauty of the film.The General also contains a number of breathtaking stunts which alone make the film worth watching. They are all the more impressive given that The General was made in 1927, when special effects weren't really a reasonable option. And yet, Buster Keaton manages to pull them off seemingly effortlessly and miraculously without getting hurt. His skills were unparalleled (as far as I know) and yet he is always humble about them - he never stops to take a gratuitous (figurative) bow as many lesser performers most certainly would.I love all the Buster Keaton movies I've seen so far and The General manages to be perhaps my favourite one. Without a doubt, one of the greatest movies I've ever seen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As an Entertainment, As a Serious Work of the Cinematic Art, this one should be required viewing! Considered to be the Zenith of Silent Film making!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We were introduced to Mr. Keaton's great film in an episode of "SILENTS PLEASE", televised over the ABC Television during the 1959-60 season. Buster Keaton was sort of familiar to us, but that was from his latter day work on television. Also, his sound shorts from his days at Columbia Pictures had been shown as a part of the programing on the Three Stooges show on WGN TV Channel 9, hosted by the late Bob Bell as Andy Starr, caretaker of the mythical 'Odeon' Theatre.This did very little to provide one with the knowledge of or appreciation of just exactly what Buster Keaton meant to silent screen comedy, to the development of sound comedies and just as a true pioneer of the cinematic art, period.Just for the sake of argument, we'll assume that we all are familiar with Buster's silent comedy shorts. We still may not be very appreciative of his talents not just as a great silent clown (dubbed 'The Great Stone Face' by James Agee), but also his genius as a writer, director and even as a keen eyed cinematographer.In viewing the half hour excerpted portions of The General, we get a little idea of the film. We just presume that Keaton is an actor, who is doing a movie for a studio. That what actors do, work for studios and directors.Well, once we research a little and and bone up on the subject, we discover that the work during this period was his. He thought things out and did a lot of improvising on the sets. He often worked with the thinnest script, more like an outline. The General was created that way, after Buster read the story of THE GREAT LOCOMOTIVE CHASE*, all in one sitting on on evening at home.Once you see THE GENERAL in its entirety, from beginning to end, you'll surely agree. It's available and has been so for some time. Try to see it with an audience, either at one of those 'Art Houses' or at a revival theatre, such as Chicago's Music Box. Either way, you'll enjoy and appreciate it much more.Keaton as a director, brings so many seemingly far flung elements together and creates a complex, yet straight forward gem of a film. First of all, Keaton the actor,the 'Great Stone Face', brings his own unique view of the universe to the screen,played for laughs. (and you get plenty of them!)Next we have absolutely authentic looking sets and location shooting. The large number of actors and literally army of extras (culled from local Oregon National Guardsmen) are outfitted to the tee.But perhaps the greatest technical achievement is in the overall look of the production. Keaton and his cameraman have done such a great job, particularly with the battle scenes. The battle scenes, particularly the featuring the two armies confronting each other at the bridge, have been compared to Matthew Brady Civil War Photographs.As a closing thought, we should like to relate a little anecdote that sheds a little more light on both the film and its creator. When Buster was asked by some press guy, just why he contended that THE GENERAL was a better Civil War picture than GONE WITH THE WIND, he replied, "Because it's based on a true**story!" A notion to which we heartily concur! * Yep, the very same story that Walt Disney did in the 1950's, albeit as a straight, historical drama.** The actual General, the real locomotive, is on display and may be viewed (as the Wife,the kids,my Mother-in-Law and I did several years ago) in the 'Big Shanty' Museum, 2829 Cherokee Street Northwest, Kennesaw, Georgia 30144.Telephone(770)427-2117.

I'd recommend it to those even if they're wary of sitting down to watch a silent film. This Buster guy was pretty handsome back in his heyday... I especially love the part where two of the trains run into each other and break off the "cow catcher" or whatever it is. And then, when he sets the bridge on fire and tries to jump over the fire and misses the bridge completely and plummets into the river below. That park cracked me up. AND THEN of course when the military guy tells them that the bridge hasn't burned enough to stop them and they try to drive over it and it falls apart, and the whole train falls into the water!! ... hilarious. I've got to rent it now and see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>History Made Comedy- Keatons Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Old stone face (Buster Keaton) is never better than in this film. The way the comedy is done, you'd never suspect how much real history is done in this film. This raid by a group of Union Spys (Andrew's Raiders in real history) was actually done in Tennesee during the Civil War.Keaton's Confederate character Johnny is a composition of a couple of real people from this historic settings. His physical comedy performance in this film is priceless.Andrew's Raiders really did steal the locomotive (The General) &amp; tried to bring the engine North &amp; cut the wires &amp; the rail lines to try &amp; disrupt the Confederates Defense. Keaton's character is based partly on a real Southern railroad conductor who chased after the raiders. The Texas, the engine used in this film really was the engine used to pursue the GENERAL in the Civil War. Even though the GENERAL was sitting in a rail yard available in 1925 when this was being filmed, the railroad would not let Keaton use it. This made them use the Texas as a double for the General. They really do wreck the engine while filming one sequence, &amp; it sat on the lot where it was wrecked until WW 2 when it was salvaged for scrap iron. The Andrews Raiders were the first people Abe Lincoln awarded with the Congressional Metal of Honor. Big Shanty, Tennesee is where the engine was stolen. The actual raiders didn't actually get the engine to the Union lines. But a lot of what Keaton does with the stolen train as comedy was actually done seriously by the raiders. This is a very funny film &amp; the real history behind it makes it even more interesting to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Odyssey Review #019: The General</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>019: The General (1927) - released 2/5/1927, viewed 8/17/05.KEVIN: After much talk of the genius of Buster Keaton and his seminal masterpiece, we finally convinced our parents to watch The General with us, on the condition that they must be sucked in within the first 30 minutes. No problem. Many of the best gags in the film are in the first half hour, including the bits with the planks of wood, and Keaton's gut-busting deadpan double take to yet another bizarre mishap, which had all of us laughing. It didn't take long before both my folks were totally into the film. There were quite a few gags that I'd forgotten about, mostly stuff after the bridge collapses, like the gag with the faulty sword. Even so, looking back on the piece, I'd say that this is one of those movies where there's not a single wasted moment in the entire picture. From start to finish, it's perfect.DOUG: We watched Keaton's The General before in Film Expression class, and it is thanks to this that we have so many Keaton films on the agenda. Still, although The Navigator and Sherlock Jr. were excellent, they still don't quite measure up to Keaton's crowning achievement. We actually showed this movie to our parents, and they were impressed too (okay, Mom fell asleep, but Dad loved it). Dad's favorite part was also mine, the part where Keaton sits down in the conductor's seat to find an obstructing rail car that he just disposed of has miraculously reappeared, and then a moment later he sits down to find that the car has vanished once again. The subtle tics on his face at this moment are absolutely priceless. Not just the surprise, but the frustration of "why does this keep happening to me?" Another of my favorite scenes is when Keaton knocks an obstructing beam off the track with another beam. Mom was like, "I wonder how many takes that took," to which I responded, "You only get one." We recently were shown this film in our History of Silent Film class, and our textbook had a section comparing The General with Chaplin's Gold Rush (comparing Gold's circular style with General's linear style, contrasting their approaches to women, and so forth).Last film viewed: Metropolis (1927). Last film chronologically: The Kid Brother (1927). Next film viewed: College (1927). Next film chronologically: It (1927).The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive, chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible, starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through, year by year, one film at a time. We also write a short review for each and every film. In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>His Girl And His Engine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On my list of classic films to see in 2006, Buster Keaton's 'The General' was one of the top three. I had always heard great things about this film, so I went into my first viewing with quite some expectation- and I found 'The General' to be every bit the classic it is known as. Keaton's genius shaped a terrific, original feature-length comedy film that has stood the test of time brilliantly.In this Civil-War masterpiece, 'The Great Stone Face' Keaton's Johnny Gray is an engineer who cherishes but two things- his locomotive ('The General, hence the name of the picture) and his beautiful, but rather dumb girl, Annabelle Lee. The premise is simple yet inspired: Johnny is turned down for active service in the Civil War because he is deemed to be more valuable as an engineer. Annabelle isn't too impressed- she won't speak to him again unless he enlists. Down-hearted yet forever blank-faced Keaton finds himself soon battling to retain both his loves, when The General is stolen by Union spies with Annabelle on board. Ladies and gentleman, the chase is on! A lot of silent comedy isn't well-received today, yet the likes of Keaton and his contemporary Charlie Chaplin are still viewed as legends of the genre. I think it is because they both shaped out defining, lovable characters for themselves- Charlie's 'Little Tramp' and Keaton's embattled working-man. Like Charlie's tramp, Keaton's Johnny is an observer, misplaced in a world of mechanization and economy. Yet he's the unseen contributer who manages to influence society unknowingly and often single-handedly.This is filled with the terrific sight gags Keaton was famous for, with many gags involving him and Marion Mack (who plays Annabelle)as the mismatched couple. The fast-pacing Keaton maintains throughout is amazing-'The General' definitely proves silent films are not sleep-inducing! Keaton's little man is always challenged by machinery, so he has to keep up with it or fall behind. The amazing stunts and army sequences could rival any modern film for genius and sheer artistry. It looks beautiful- the cinematography is superb. 'The General' was apparently one of the most expensive silent films ever made, largely due to one terrific shot (I won't spoil it for you) that is the product of all Johnny's toil and effort.A film with a Civil-War setting was daring for Keaton to make at this time, with Griffith's 'The Birth Of A Nation'(1915) being successful a decade earlier yet still VERY controversial. Adding comedy to the tragedy of war seemed like a sure-fire way to make a flop in the 20's, and Keaton's film wasn't very well received for decades. It now regularly features in greatest film lists and is often at the top of greatest silent film lists- finally getting the recognition it deserves.Bravo, Keaton!10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughed so hard I cried</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First time I saw it was at "Ole Miss" when a talented young pianist set up the movie like the original silent films. He picked "mood music" to augment each major scene/action, such as romantic, frantic, racing, etc. We enjoyed it so much we insisted he do it again the following night and the theater was packed. Most of us from the first night were first in line, and it was just as funny. As the IMD reviewer commented, Keaton was at his best, which was way above anyone else. One thing a lot of folks don't know is that he did all his own stunts, and in the early days of filming, there were usually NO gimmicks. In this film he hung off the sides, back, and front of the locomotive, while it was speeding along a real track.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Keaton's all-time master piece, although its time wouldn't admit it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton had been fascinated with locomotives ever since he was a boy, and the recollections of an event that took place during the American Civil War in the summer of 1862 served the comedian with a great opportunity to do the role of an engineer on film. The event that inspired Keaton has been named "The Great Locomotive Chase," as it had volunteers from the Union Army taking command over a train, planning to do damage on the Western and Atlantic railroad. Predictably, Keaton's version also provides a love story, but first and foremost in order to give our hero a personal reason to expose himself to so much danger in the first place. Johnnie Gray, as Keaton is named in the film, does not prove to be particularly informed as to what this big war is about, being mostly concerned about his sweetheart Annabelle who is kidnapped, as well as his own train THE GENERAL. Commentators suspecting Keaton for having had political motivations when he chose to present himself as a Southerner in this film, do themselves a disservice; much like Charlie Chaplin and unlike Harold Lloyd, Keaton refused to let his character ever truly win a battle, even when the last frame seemed to have him relatively happy.Whichever side in the war Keaton's character supported, one can still sympathize with his personal situation as he desperately tries to rescue the girl and the train that matter so much to him in his life. Just as in his other great films but here with an unusually grandiose setting to showcase it, he survives every struggle just barely by adapting his characteristically mechanical handling of all objects that come in his way, rarely expressing any large degree of emotional involvement in the catastrophes that haunt him. The result is not only one of the greatest comedies of the silent era, but truly an outstanding achievement that transcends genres and eras. Being more character-driven than other Keaton-films such as THE NAVIGATOR and COLLEGE, and even more so his two-reelers, THE GENERAL may demand a bit more to tone into, which may explain why its contemporary critics were largely indifferent. To viewers anticipating the characteristic fast-paced prat-falls of Buster, this film may come off as a slight surprise, as the humor is more subtle, the scale of the gags increasing bit by bit throughout, until the incredible climax that turned out to become, reportedly, the most expensive shot of film in the entire silent era. Keaton, on his part, is given more opportunity to showcase his skills as an actor, which are easy to overlook in other, less character-driven films (though still very apparent to the acquainted).Due to its large costs (and possibly lukewarm reviews...) THE GENERAL was by and large considered a flop. It was nowhere as much immortalized in the minds of the public as Chaplin's THE GOLD RUSH or Lloyd's SAFETY LAST. However, Keaton insisted that this film was his masterpiece; and more than thirty years later, following the rediscovery of silent comedy in the 1960s, the vast majority of critics and audiences finally agreed. Newcomers of Keaton's magic may want to warm up with a short first like ONE WEEK or THE GOAT, but THE GENERAL remains a masterpiece; one of the most unforgettable films of all time.

		<fullReview>Numerous comments posted here discuss the details of this film, so I'll just post a few comments.I've watched this feature several times, and shown the video to friends (who tend to find it mesmerizing). The beauty of The General is in its ambitious mix: historical documentary, action-adventure film and slapstick comedy all rolled into one.Keaton's mostly clever physical gags never detract from the seriousness of the story. This is just a brilliant film. I've yet to see a Civil War picture that better captures the feel of that era with such haunting realism. A Brady photograph at 24 frames per second, as old as the War Between the States, yet the film is very well preserved. I've seen many films from the 1930s with less clarity.Of course this movie was a commercial bomb in 1927. When is true genius ever recognized in its own time?Fans of this movie can visit the real 1856 The General locomotive in Kennesaw, GA just NW of Atlanta. The steam engine was stolen from nearby Big Shanty station by Union spies just as is depicted in this film. Much later The General was rescued again after another fight, this time in a courtroom, when Georgia reclaimed The General from the State of Tennessee in 1972. Check out the southernmusuem.org website for more info on the museum housing The General. It's a great artifact of Civil War heritage.As is Keaton's masterpiece of the silent era. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though it runs only seventy-five minutes, it still seems remarkable that Buster Keaton's fertile imagination is built upon short, quick gags that pass by quickly--so quickly that it staggers the mind that anyone could come up with enough to flesh out seventy-five minutes. The gags themselves are gracefully athletic and consistently come unexpectedly, given Keaton's slight build and features that make him look old beyond his years. He plays a train engineer whose attempts to join the Confederate army are rebuffed (as are the affections of his beloved, believing him to be a coward) but who almost single-handedly manages to win a major battle by using his train to confound the Union army. There's great attention paid to detail--quite a bit is happening both in the foreground and the background of the frame--and the jokes are both laugh-out-loud funny and amusingly ironic; but Keaton's genius is his ability to isolate the individual within the crowd and draw out that individual's endearing strengths--his connection with each member of the audience is subtle but sublime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They made some great films before sound. Too bad they are treated as "quaint" by those who present them. Many of them deserve better.I love Buster Keaton, and I love "The General". Unfortunately, the only version of it I've seen on videotape has rinky-dink generic piano music for a sound track, with no attempt whatsoever to match the music to the action. But the thing about silent movies is that THEY WERE NOT SILENT! Even the smallest movie houses had a piano player who played along with them. Many of the big city houses had full orchestras, and the package they received from the studios often included not only the film itself, but a fully orchestrated musical score to be played along with it.Somebody, sometime, will make a mint by taking some of these old gems and doing them justice with good music, sound effects and spoken dialogue and offering them to TV. (If you pay attention, you'll see that the actors in many of the silents are actually saying the lines. A little judicious dubbing and you've got a "sound" movie.) Come on, one of you movie lovers in the business. Take a chance. I'd love to see "The General" with that kind of treatment, and I'll bet a lot of other people would too. </fullReview>

When war breaks out, he decides to enlist but is turned down because he is more valuable as an engineer. His girlfriend's father and brother believe him to be too afraid to enlist, and his girlfriend refuses to speak to him until he is in uniform. A year later, Gray is engineering his train, the General, which is then stolen by Northern spies and used to halt supplies to the South. Gray pursues the train by handcar, bicycle, and engine car, then after rescuing his girlfriend, who was on the train, the tables are reversed as the spies chase him Gray, on the General. Pretty innovative comedy, with great stuntwork by Keaton ( including knocking away the railroad tie with another ), and a good feeling all around. Keaton turns in an absolutely great performance with a great showing of slapstick, sympathy, and and romance. Rating 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? This movie is simply one of the greatest films ever produced. It is perfect, Keaton captures the Civil War in a way that no film, to this date, March 27th, 2000, has rivaled. Buster Keaton was a genius. He still is a genius. I say this because his style of comedy and his films will NEVER go out of style. They are so timeless and funny that if you pass them up because they are "old", you don't know what you're missing. I am a huge Buster Keaton fan myself, and have seen, (and own) almost every film he ever made! It's Funny, once I was turned on to the genius of Buster Keaton, I could never get through a Chaplin film. They just seemed so slow and boring -- so unoriginal compared to Keaton's, that I turned them off. If you come across a Keaton film in your local video store or library, don't pass it up. If you do, you don't know what your missing! Other great Keaton Films are, Sherlock Jr. (1924), Our Hospitality (1923), Seven Chances (1925), Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928), and Go West (1925), just to name a few! -Jonathan McDevitt, age 13 :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The pinnacle of Keaton's work!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>''The General'' clearly ranks at the top of Keaton's work in silent film. This movie is eerily beautiful, funny and evokes what may be film's closest version of what the Civil War was really like. By the way, the story is based in truth. Keaton did other solid work before and after ''The General.'' But this is his best. Check out the scene in which he's on the train...the water spout douses him with water and he looks into the sky to see if it's raining. Or when he throws the chunk of wood at the cannon. Very simple, very memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Johnnie Rides his Train Home Again ...Hurrah ... Hurrah .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton's "The General" is based on a famous episode of America's Civil War called "The Great Locomotive Chase", and whenever I think of the film there are three images that immediately come to my mind.Starting with the most famous one, there is this unforgettable sight of Johnnie Gray, the brave little engineer who couldn't enlist to the war because he was judged too valuable. Giving the impression that he didn't enlist out of fear, he's rejected by his love life Annabelle since she wouldn't marry a coward. That's for the context, the image comes right after. The rejected and inconsolable Johnnie sits on the locomotive's crossbar and doesn't notice the engine's movements. As "The General" starts moving, Johnnie is carried along and brought up and down in a series of poetic and harmonious arcs. It's a short moment but its memory in the History of Cinema is eternal, and if I ever had Top 10 greatest cinematic moments, I would include this one even though it doesn't feature any particular action.This iconic shot, probably the most defining of Keaton's career, illustrates the notion of loneliness in its most poetic force, something that creates a complete distance between you and the world that captures your soul and connects it to the unnoticeable movement of common banality. Johnnie is so sad that wherever the world goes, he wouldn't care. It's cinematic imagery at its best, and even most poignant to recall when you consider Buster Keaton's real-life discretion and solitude. It's like the soul of his comical genius speaking at this moment, he's calm, resigned, but nonetheless, he's still funny, but while we laugh, we share his sadness. But we laugh, because it's still a gag and the punch-line consists of him realizing he's getting into the tunnel carried by his train. As sad as he was, after all, he only lost one love of his life.This leads me to the second moment of the film, one that would surprise the readers, but it's significant because it establishes the two most important things in his life in such an explicit way, it wouldn't even have needed to be written.Indeed, it's perhaps one of the most famous definitions of a character. Johnnie Gray the Southern Civil engineer who has two loves in his life: "The General" his dear locomotive AND Annabelle. Buster Keaton merges these two realities in one fantastic scene occurring in Annabelle's house. After getting rid of the two kids who solemnly followed him, Johnnie shyly gives a rectangular gift to Annabelle, it's a framed picture of him in the middle with "The General" in the background. The locomotive is so big that the picture contains only the top of Johnnie's body, but it's all in his expression, stone-faced would say some, Keatonesque, I prefer. I still don't know what the funniest thing is: that he has the same deadpan expression in the picture than in the scene, that he thought it would please Annabelle or simply, its total randomness. I don't know, but I burst out laughing at that part.I laughed but there always was this frustrating hesitation when it came to Keaton's humor, unlike Chaplin, it's not a type of comedy straight-forwardly displayed. His face remains still and serene as if he never intended to make anyone laugh, which is funny already but with a sort of meta-referential dimension. Keaton tries to provoke some laughs in his direction yet he finds a way to remain above it, totally uncatchable lost somewhere between our perceptions and his intentions. The mystery of Buster Keaton adds to the fascination he inspires, and Johnnie Gray remains a mystery only defined by the two things he loves the most, and this parameter never changes. Indeed, Johnnie becomes a hero when his dear Locomotive is stolen, and what's more when Annabelle is accidentally taken by the Northern soldiers. Johnnie Gray doesn't fight for the South, but he's moved by his desire to take back what counts most in his life, if he's not a soldier, he's still one hell of a soldier.That leads us to my third favorite moment of the film, which had to be a stunt. If not the most spectacular one, it was dangerous and impressive enough to inspire the poster: Johnnie Gray sits on the Locomotive's cowcatcher grabbing all the railroad ties the enemy threw on the track, he can lift only one but then he finds another one on the track, he can't stop the train. With a perfect timing and gracious harmony, he hit the second tie with the one on his arms making both fall outside the track, without hurting him on the head. The scene is the equivalent of the falling wall in "Steamboat Bill Jr." and illustrates Buster Keaton's perfectionism and harmony in his approach to action. I was so impressed by that scene that I watched it three times in a row. It's a remarkable example of the level of perfectionism a true artist can reach if he's independent enough to take some risks without making an agent swallow a cigar, but which artist is not independent? This moment is also crucial to understand what an epic "The General" is, so exhilarating that I even hesitate to call it a comedy because I feel like the word diminishes it, but the film IS funny and it's one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments regarding its context and content , being able to provide excitement from a two-part chase between two trains until a spectacular and breath-taking climax is a credit to Keaton's inventiveness especially since it doesn't rely on special effects or use of stunt-men, everything is perfect AND flawless.The film didn't do quite well in the box-office, but I guess it shows how Keaton was ahead of its time. I, myself, even forgot I was watching an old movie and thought I was seeing a young Christopher Walken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buster Keaton's Best Movie, PERIOD!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie for people of all ages. I'm quite sure that there are some people who don't like silent movies, but this one is action-packed, and was the original movie that inspired the 1956 remake "The Great Locomotive Chase" by Walt Disney. But there is one thing that makes this movie unusual. Unlike most Civil War movies, which depict both sides of the conflict in the same way, the Union soldiers are depicted as the enemy, and the heroes are the Confederates, which makes "The General" a rare brand of cinema. They would never make a movie like this today, in the age of political correctness. Needless to say, Keaton's performance was excellent. Who also would have also guessed that this film could also be a good instructional film, about how to use a train to commit acts of sabotage?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Buster Keaton classic is probably better than you. Nothing against you, I'm sure you're a great person, but you'd have to be really, REALLY great to top this movie. Buster Keaton's finest, and one of my favorite movies, ever. The entire chase sequence is, at the very least, my favorite chase sequence of the first half of the 20th century. So inventive, so fun, so EXCITING.People that don't like this movie because "there's no talking" are lazy-brained, ADD-riddled goof balls. To those people, I say take a break from being a bonehead and appreciate this long-ago masterpiece.(And check out Sherlock Jr. too, while you're at it)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>General, The (1927) **** (out of 4) Buster Keaton plays a Southern engineer who has two loves in his life-- his train and his girlfriend Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack). When Union soldiers steal both of his loves, Keaton must jump aboard another train and give chase. This is without question one of the greatest films ever made and it's easy to look at it and see why it was one of the most expensive films ever made at its time. I wouldn't really say this film is a great comedy, although some list it as the greatest comedy ever made. I think the film works a lot better as a history piece of the times it reflects. Many Civil War buffs have called this the most realistic Civil War film and who am I to argue? The Civil War scenes are truly remarkable, especially the ending when the fighting finally breaks out. These battle scenes are the closest to capturing what Griffith did in The Birth of a Nation. I think the greatest thing about this film are the amazing stunts, which are incredible to this day and I might even say it contains the greatest stunt work of any film I've seen. Keaton was never scared of putting his life on the line and this is evident in one of the most famous scenes where he's riding in front of the train trying to remove large boards from the tracks. Another remarkable scene is near the end when the train tries to cross a bridge that is on fire. The film certainly has some nice laughs but these types of films were originally called "thrillers" and to me that's what this film is. This is a very thrilling picture from start to finish with one of the greatest and most exciting chases in film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The General (1927) was the film that defined the career of legendaryComedian/Director Buster Keaton. He took many risks (monetary andphysical) to get this movie made. During his day The General was both a critical and box office failure. Today however it is viewed as classic cinema and one of the greatest films of it's era. The story revolves around the life of a train engineer (played byKeaton) who is moved by his fellow Southerners to fight against the Union. Sadly he's rejected by the local militia, nut with his trusty locomotive "The General", Buster finds away to help the cause! He also has to balance outthe two loves in his life, his fiance and "The General". Can he find truelove and save the day?I found this film to be an outstanding work of art. The stunt andsecondary direction by Buster Keaton is outstanding. His work was veryinnovative and ahead of it's time. He risked his safety on many occasionsand the bridge stunt was the most expensive set piece during the silent era.Much maligned in it's day but today The General is looked upon as a truecinematic treasure.Highly recommended for silent movie fans and film history buffs.A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On Directing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director made some pivotal choices in the creation of this film which helped develop the theme to a great extent, including character development, use of linear narrative, and application of music for atmospheric effect. The theme I extracted was of heroism?the divine role each of us contributes in life is important no matter how small and insignificant we may think we are.In the beginning of the film, the viewer is introduced to a seemingly small and insignificant man played by Buster Keaton. He is a simple Atlantic railroad attendant who becomes motivated to join the Civil War effort in hopes to win the affection of his love-interest. Already, the director subconsciously alerts the viewer to the linear narrative format by developing this inciting incident. The rising action begins when his love-interest gets kidnapped by the South in attempts to aggravate the North. The character Keaton plays is a man of little or of no consequence. However ordinary he may seem, he is thrust into a heroic situation where he must become extraordinary in order to prove his chivalry.It was interesting to observe how the director chose as serious a topic as war to center the theme of heroism around and to then capture those events in a rather humorous light. Because of the fact that The General is a silent film, the director uses music as the primary mechanism for exploiting this humor as well as the other emotions in the film. Through the course of the entire film, a piano plays various melodies in an almost parlor-shop-like fashion. During happy or humorous sequences (i.e. Keaton riding on the train engine-spoke), the sounds evoked by the piano are primarily major, and even a bit bubbly. During distressing, climactic scenes (i.e. chase sequences on the trains), the piano work produces an atmosphere of tension; dissonant chords and minor key underpinnings. Because there is no vocal dialogue to get across emotion, the choice of piano music was a crucial directorial decision to get across the otherwise one-dimensional aspect of emotion (that would come through the acting and body language alone). Just as we see the protagonist developing and maturing in heroic type fashion, so to we see the musical score heroically developing through the various emotions and atmospheres shown through the film. Both protagonist and music seem insignificant through the course of their developments, but upon closer examination demonstrate their extreme importance in developing the theme even further.It was also interesting to observe this film from the perspective of a director of the 1920s. Considering the limited budget and the resources he was available to, the techniques and effects used to develop the story and theme were also highly effective: the fact that the film was silent, the film was grainy, and the effects were primitive (i.e. canons exploding; model of the train crashing) all conveyed the battle between what is considered significant and insignificant. By viewing standards today, these effects would be considered insignificant because of their mundane quality. Perhaps even the hero would be considered insignificant because he doesn't conform to the fast-paced action hero persona. If we view this film in context however, the choices used for this specific time period illustrate the man in a heroic light. If he hadn't acted the way he did, the girl may never have been rescued.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buster Has To Prove Himself......Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this a lot more on the second viewing, the first on DVD. It wasn't that the print was so much better as I just appreciated Buster Keaton's humor and physical prowess more today than I did back when I first saw this film. That, and I can never get enough trains on film!Keaton plays "Johnny Gray," a railroad engineer who signs up for the Confederate army when the Civil War breaks out. However, they reject because the South felt he could be far more valuable to their cause if he remained in his occupation than as a soldier. However, because his girlfriend wants him to sign up, and her brothers all did, she thinks he's a coward because he's not fighting for his kinfolk (obviously not knowing why they turned him down). So, things look bleak for our hero. (Note: true love never seems to be shown in these Keaton films. Buster always has to prove himself to these fickle women, who demand either heroes or tons of money from their men.)Anyway, Buster is chased down the tracks by the Northern army train for much of the film. He tries to hold them off and keep his own little train running....and rescue his girlfriend who was accidentally abducted by the enemy and is being held hostage in one of the cars. It's not as chaotic as I am making it sound, but it's fast-moving and entertaining film for most of the 75 minutes. To be honest, I can't see where it's a "masterpiece," as so many label it, but it's a good film. Maybe I still don't fully appreciate it. Now that I have it on DVD, I will be sure to watch it more times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, But Tedious At Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton starred in and directed this silent film about Johnny Gray (Keaton), an engineer who through a series of misadventures becomes a Confederate war hero during the US Civil War. For the most part this is a fun story, with some solid comedy and even a few suspenseful moments (and, surprisingly, not a bad battle scene thrown in near the end.) The early special effects were also pretty well done - particularly the scene where the Rock River Bridge collapses, and the Union train that was crossing it plunges into the river far below. The version I saw was also surprisingly well preserved, considering this was made in 1927. Marian Mack (as Anabelle Lee) made a good romantic match for Keaton as Annabelle, kidnapped by the Union Army, whom Johnny sets out to rescue. In the midst of his journey Johnny discovers secret Union battle plans that he needs to report, and the fun takes off from there.There are a few tedious moments to the story. The first train chase was fun, but once it had gone on for about five minutes I felt I had had enough and really wanted to get back to the story. Then, to get back, Johnny ends up in another train chase that was largely a repeat of the first. As I said, after the first five minutes or so of the first train chase, I found all that pretty slow going. But the story was entertaining and well acted and directed. Personally, I wouldn't call this a masterpiece of the silent era, but it's a good movie nonetheless.6/10</fullReview>

I think it's a lot better the General made me laugh quietly a couple of times. It's really repetitive, too. All the train scenes seemed the same.

		<shortDescription>A Silent Film Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The General is a silent comedy film inspired by the Great Locomotive Chase, which happened in 1862. Buster Keaton starred in the film and co- directed it with Clyde Bruckman.Marion Mack co-starred in it.The story was adapted by Al Boasberg, Bruckman, Keaton, Charles Henry Smith and Paul Girard Smith from the memoir The Great Locomotive Chase by William Pittenger. The adventure-epic classic made toward the end of the silent film era is now considered one of the greatest films ever made.Johnny Gray is a Southern railroad engineer who loves his train engine, almost as much as he loves Annabelle Lee. When the opening shots of the Civil War are fired at Fort Sumter, Johnny tries to enlist and he is deemed too useful as an engineer to be a soldier. All Johnny knows is that he's been rejected, and Annabelle, thinking him a coward, turns her back on him. When Northern spies steal the General and unwittingly Annabelle, the story switches from drama and romance to adventure mixed with Keaton's trademark deadpan humor as he uses every means possible to catch up to the General, thwart the Yankees, and rescue his darling Annabelle for starters. As always, Keaton performs his own stunts, combining his prodigious dexterity, impeccable comic timing, and expressive body language to convey more emotion than the stars of any of the talkies that were soon to dominate cinema.This silent film has such a graceful perfection, such a meshing of story, character and episode, that they unfold like music.It is the is the highlight of Keaton's career's tragicomic performances, featuring not just the awe-inspiring stunts that were his bread and butter, but also a level of fluidity only he and Chaplin attained at the top of their games.Also,she proves as endlessly clever and athletic as his screen surrogates and chock-full of hilarious sight gags,including bits of business that incorporate moving trains, cow-catchers,a bear, and a misbehaving cannon. Definitely,a silent masterpiece is enter-train-meant for all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, this movie was advertised to me on Netflix as a goofy movie. Now, there are enough sight gags and early cartoon-esque scenes in this film, but it also has an interesting storyline, romance, and danger. Buster Keaton does a real good job of playing an innocently clueless man to most of the things going on around him. One thing I did not understand about the film is why they did not ever explain to Johnnie (or anyone else for that matter) that he was rejected from the service for being an engineer, making him look bad to the town. Anyway I thought this was a pretty well choreographed film that was funny a la Three Stooges or old Mickey Mouse cartoons, nothing that special, but entertaining nonetheless. It is definitely worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The General</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very happy to have a watched my first great Sir Charlie Chaplin film, and then I was reminded of the magic created by Buster Keaton in the first film I saw him, Sherlock Junior, so I found this second film to watch. Basically Johnnie Gray (Keaton, also writing, directing and producing) is a railroad engineer who is love with his engine "The General, oh, and his girl Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack). The Civil War has come to America, and Johnnie wants to be the first of many to be recruited and fight, but he is turned away as being needed more on the railroad. Annabelle thinks he didn't even try, and won't speak to him until he is in a uniform, but he is her only hope when she ends up kidnapped by Union spies who also take The General. Johnnie has many mishaps, funny near miss accidents and unintentional avoiding of danger as he chases his engine in another, "The Texas", and he escapes death when the Union realise it's only one man chasing. During the night he sneaks into a house, which turns out to be where Annabelle is, and where the Unionists are hiding out, he even overhears their battle plan against the Confederates hiding under the dinner table. Dressed as a Union spy get-up, Johnnie and Annabelle get away in The General and speed away to warn of the plan, closely pursued by the Unionists. In the end, the battle does go ahead, but Johnnie, dressed in the Confederate's uniform saves the day, and is granted the honour of becoming a real soldier, and winning back Annabelle. Also starring Charles Henry Smith as Annabelle's Father, Frank Barnes as Annabelle's Brother, Glen Cavender as chief spy Captain Anderson, Jim Farley as General Thatcher, Frederick Vroom as Southern Confederate General, Frank Hagney as Confederate Recruiter, Joe Keaton as Union General and an unnoticeable Boris Karloff as Union General. Buster Keaton was number 21 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men. I will admit, there was a really, REALLY tiny bit of me saying that Sherlock Junior was better (which it is in my opinion), and that I don't agree this is Keaton's best film, but no matter. I thought this was a really funny film, Keaton makes a very endearing character and a story with not just good laughs, but actually some good moments of fun action, it is definitely a must see silent wartime comedy. Buster Keaton was number 21 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, the film was number 90 on The 100 Greatest Films, it was number 65 on The 100 Greatest War Films, it was number 18 100 Years, 100 Movies: 10th Anniversary Edition, and it was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs.

		<shortDescription>Keaton Raises The South Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fort Sumter has been fired upon, the Civil War has begun. All of the able bodied men of the South have rushed to defend the new flag of the stars and bars. But one man a railroad engineer taking his beloved engine, The General, every day on its run gets rejected for military service. Bad enough he's an outcast among the southern gallants, but his dear sweetheart Marion Mack has said she cannot love a man not in Confederate gray no matter the reason.So poor Buster Keaton goes back to The General and for the next year or so toils at his job while the war rages on. But a plan hatched by some Yankee spies brings Keaton right into the action. The northerners plan to steal a train and run it right up to their lines and wreck all the military contraband they can find. The definition of contraband is a rather broad one as we well know. But those lowdown dirty Yankees made a big mistake in stealing Buster's train.Undaunted he pursues and rescues Marion who was a passenger and the two of them set off in their own train doing all they can to foil the Yankees until the Confederate army can deal with them. The bulk of the film is a laugh filled riot where at various intervals, Buster is the pursuer and the pursued.I have a slightly different take on The General. Although I bow to Keaton's comic genius and the film after the trains start rolling moves at the pace of an Indiana Jones feature, the real marvel as far as I'm concerned is the creative use of special effects. Although Keaton did a lot of his own stunts in The General, the creative use of what have to be miniatures is something to behold. Otherwise a whole lot of railroad property would have been totaled for the making of The General.Best gag in the film is Keaton trying to use that cannon which he attaches to a flatcar on his train. Kind of hard to both steer the train and aim the cannon as he found out. Next best gag in the film is at the final battle where he deals with a Union sniper in a most interesting manner. The General is silent screen comedy at its very best. No better authority than Keaton's rival Charlie Chaplin said so. Who am I to argue?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>his finest moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Buster Keaton's The General was released in 1927, it was a summation of his cinematic and comedic genius. This film, a tightly choreographed gag from start to finish, was his most complete vision of the persona that he had brought to the screen over the course of ten years. Keaton, in The General, is the great screen buffon, the idiot-savant who bumbles from one scrape to the next using incredible ingenuity and skill to survive. His prop and his opponent is mechanized civilization symbolized in the train that is his great love. As a prop, the General affords an incredible variety of laughs, all choreographed with great skill by the master comedian. As a symbol the train becomes the opponent that he must control and all of his best gags feature his character's ineptitude around this piece of machinery. Of course it is the General that he ultimately save from a unsavory union plot, but it is how he handles it, the cannon, even the blocks of wood that are the essence of the film. Because he was such a great acrobat, Keaton imbues the film with an intensity from the moment the General is stolen right up through the battle at the river. The film is a landmark of cinema and a masterpiece of a style of comedy only required pure movement and the eye to bring across the essential comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest black and white movie that has ever been made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely the greatest black and white film ever made, not just by Buster Keaton(which is praise enough)but by anyone, including the works of the late great Charlie Chaplin. Its blend of comedy, drama and action make for a wonderful spectacle which should be watched by all. Also, Buster Keaton often said that this was his favourite film starring himself which is another accolade. It is well deserved of a 10 out of 10 and i recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uniquely Keaton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite simply, The General is a film that only Buster Keaton could make. But it's far more than a spectacle of gags, no matter how astounding they may be. Here you'll find a showcase of Keaton the director, the writer, the "stonefaced" actor, the legend. In arguably his most memorable film, he engages in comedy on a grand and (at the time) unprecedented scale, making this an essential for any true fan of comedy, and doubly essential for anyone who calls himself a silent movie buff. Chaplin might be better remembered today, but The General is a film that reminds me of the equal, if not greater, talents of Keaton. (9 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect chase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The General" is the perfect film. Even poor prints do little to diminish it's beauty,and seen in a good print it is a stunning film. The entire chase north by Keaton to regain his stolen train(The General of the title),and the efforts of the Union raiders to stop him,are mirrored in Keaton's return south after getting his train back,and his efforts to thwart the union army following him.Complimenting this are some of the best gags ever done with a train.The film was so far ahead of it's time that seen today,it seems less a silent,than a film that's lost it's soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Silent Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the film class at SLUH and for a movie made in 1927 I can say I laughed out loud at this one. In my opinion, the best silent comedy made (out of what I've seen) and one of the best silent movies overall. Buster Keaton, one of the best comedy actors of all time, is wonderful and anyone who likes movies, even ones without words, should see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my opinion is not typical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I yield to no one in my appreciation of Buster, but I think this is one of his more boring films. I don't understand why everyone thinks it's so great; I much prefer "Sherlock Jr.," "The Navigator", and "Steamboat Bill, Jr." Although the movie definitely has moments I like, the storyline moves slowly, it seems like the long shots of trains are endless, and the supporting characters aren't developed as well as they are in some of his other films. Also, I can't stand the way Buster took a true-life tale about the Union army and changed it to be about Confederates. (His explanation was that audiences would naturally root for the underdog, but it's kind of hard for me to be on the side of someone who is fighting to keep slavery legal.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK but vastly overrated, if you ask me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film as a result of trolling through the listings here at imdb looking for a great film I hadn't seen. I looked at 3 or 4 video stores before I found a copy to rent, brought it home, and, boy, was I disappointed.The film's OK, and I'm sure it was quite a spectacle for 1927, but part of the problem is that it's just too far back in time. It's probably worth viewing once just for the historical value of seeing an old silent movie, and if you looooooower your expectations you may really enjoy it; but for me, once is definitely all I could take.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the camera techniques and special effects are brilliant for their time. the plot is very good and really well thought through, unlike for example chaplin's movies that are just about the laughs. at times, though, even if it's only 1h15mins, it still gets a tad boring at certain points. the user rating here at imdb seems to be too high, but 'the general' is certainly a very interesting movie, and buster keaton is, no matter what the critics say, the thinking man's own comedian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK comedy for the 1920s, but not for now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie on the big screen in my hometown, with the idea that it was a very nice comedy .Actually, I only laughed once or twice during the entire 1h15 or so. The jokes were Charlie Chaplin like, with very simple humour. Most of the time , the main hero was behaving like a clown. This doesn't make me laugh at all. If you want to see really funny jokes about someone being clumsy, watch Tim Allen in Home Improvement! That's funny and clever. This film was just stupid.I guess people were a lot simpler back then, and jokes were cheaper. I couldn't connect to the film and the jokes because I have seen far better comedies.As for the story, it was interesting at first, but it dragged a lot in the train chase scenes.All in all, this movie is no masterpiece. It is pretty average, has not dated well, and is pretty forgettable.6/10 only for the entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The General</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was kind of disappointed by this movie. After watching a silent comedy in my History of American Cinema class I was looking forward to viewing this for homework. I felt like I couldn't get into this movie; being silent you really have to pay attention and I just couldn't seem to grasp what was going on. I came away from this without knowing a whole lot about the plot. While watching I had to continually rewind and re-watch. I don't think that this is by any means a bad movie, I am for one inexperienced in watching silent films and though I had a hard time with the storyline this movie had that classic, back to basic kind of comedy that had me laughing all the way through. All and all a great film for its time, I just wish I could of been a better viewer of it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was funny at times but to give it such a high rating is questionable. I would give it a 6.5. It was boring and predictable for the most part. Compared to Chaplin's movies like "Modern Times" it just doesn't compare. Maybe because he doesn't look like somebody from the South whereas Chaplin could always pass for the tramp. A stretch for a 7. -gg</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing but spectacle and slapstick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin and The Marx Brothers are legends, even today. Buster Keaton really isn't, and this movie is a good indicator of why. The General is the 1920s equivalent of a modern action movie. There's no substantial characterization or solid plot, just - as I said - a lot of spectacle and slapstick. And for whatever reason, Keaton just isn't as funny as Chaplin or Harpo. He's cute, and he makes good dumb faces, but after a while I get tired of watching him trip all over himself.Possibly the problem with the film is that it's repetitive; there's one giant train chase, a brief pause, and then another giant train chase with many gags virtually rehashed. After a while, I got tired of Keaton either hurling obstructions onto the train track, or removing them. The sheer number of extras and the detail in the production should impress even a modern viewer, but in the same way that vacuous summer movies impress. It's all glitz, and it ain't even that funny. Also, after seeing Gone With the Wind, Birth of a Nation, Gettysburg, Ride With the Devil, and now The General, I'm getting just a little tired of pro-Confederacy movies! I wouldn't mind if Hollywood balanced its Civil War perspective a bit, but strangely it favors the South a goodly 90% of the time - or so it seems. Nice as a curiosity, but that's all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supposed to be a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched the Circus 1928 and still it is tough for me to find this old comedy funny because i guess i am not used to it. I find the newer comedy today more funny then the silent films. I like to be able to hear the tone in peoples voices and how they present their tone of voice if it is sarcastic or if they really mean what they are saying. I like Adam Sandler because he really does a good job displaying that. I am not taking anything away from this movie because it was the best they could do back then. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes the silent comedy movies. There are some parts in the movie where i laughed but it was not comedy compared to what i am used to watching today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this may be a milestone in (comedy) film making. And yes, maybe this movie was indeed perceived as funny when it came out. But looking at it now, it seems rather dull, predictive, and -- well -- not funny. After having watched it, I am not sure anymore whether it even made me smile anywhere at all. But I am positive I never had to 'laugh out loud' as some other reviewers remark.And it definitely does not represent a critical comment on war. The Civil War only serves as a background and an excuse for the 'adventure'. If you want a truly critical statement from that period, I'd recommend 'All Quiet on the Western Front' (1930) instead.However, if you are not expecting a hilarious or brilliant comedy, you might still enjoy watching the movie. But you have been warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too boring even for my taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I think that comedy and horror are the hardest genres in cinema. Maybe that is because its very hard to amuse me, but still I think that comedies are always too idiotic to be good or they are just too boring to good. General belongs to the latter category. I dont think that a man simply fooling around is funny, no matter what the critics might say or no matter if that man happens to be Buster Keaton. The Civil War is just a frame, within Buster can do his so called acrobatic tricks. I like black and white films as well as silent movies, but also my tolerance has its limits, I cannot like a movie only because its said to be a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about boring - Good comedy should at least be plausible This tripe is completely unbelievable and juvenile If your a conservative uneducated fool who likes Abbott and Costello and the Three Stooges your sure to love this! :)The people who relish Keaton, Chaplin and WC Fields are the same conservative nuts who hate such great comedians as Harold Lloyd and Wheeler and Woolsey because of their liberal attitudes and realistic acting.You will find Keaton's best work in the early sound features he made for MGM during the year 1928-1932. (These are also the ones the conservatives will tell you not to watch but Don't LISTEN TO THEM!) Stay away from Keaton's silent pictures unless you enjoy listening to long sermons on Sunday!
