		<shortDescription>Silent chiller with great acting and an excellent premise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Hush' is a lot like 'The Strangers', except instead of strangers plural it's only one man, and instead of a husband and wife being terrorized it's a deaf and mute recluse. It's very tense and cleverly written bar a few cliché tropes that come with this kind of movie. It also has a minimal synth score, something I notice more and more horror movies are utilizing - 'You're Next', 'It Follows' - to give it an '80s classic slasher atmosphere. It's hard to even call it horror though as it offers far more thrills than actual scares. I was thoroughly satisfied watching this movie. It's constantly engaging, and that has a lot to do with the terrific performances of both the man and Maggie, and there are a few scenes that are genuinely depraved and chilling. It doesn't break any new ground, but following 'The Babadook' and 'It Follows', 'Hush' continues to reinspire the subtle, quiet corner of the genre and bodes well for the future of psychological thrillers. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rating a 9 because it cant be any less!! I remember watching the trailer of the movie and I thought maybe its just the trailer thats good, until....i Saw this movie today!!The actress who played the lead is so amazing as an actress and i hope to see more of her in the future!! Unlike other movies from this genre, it did not appear anything extra anywhere at all and felt more real. The serial killer as well was amazing played by the actor!I held on to my breath till the credits started rolling and I am still in that mood of the film created by it.The lighting, the cinematography, the acting, direction is just so right up to the mark! These kinda gems come only once in a while! I hope the team is reading this review someday :)Guys you did an AMAZING job and this has been one of the most perfect horror/thrillers I have recently watched! The kinda film that will always be remembered once you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Scary Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Hush was one of the best Horror movies I've seen in years. It reminded me of Wait Until Dark but with a deaf victim instead of a blind one. I really cared about the main character and all the actors did a fine job. I've been off work this week and have been catching up on all the movies on Netflix. Most of the time I don't expect much, especially from the direct to video movies. Every once in a while you come across a gem. This movie was very well photographed also. There are no scenes so dark that you can't figure out what is going on. I hate that in so many horror movies. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror movies without anything unbelievable in them like ghosts or monsters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Clever Take on the "Home Invasion" Sub-Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To make this short and sweet, all I need to say is watch this movie. Watch it with a big group of people.It takes a very simple plot and makes it into a very well-thought out horror movie. The opening scenes effectively establish Maddie's story to allow the audience to get to know and care for the character.Once the masked killer arrives, it begins as your typical cat-and-mouse game seen in every home invasion movie. The main character being deaf does allow a fresh spin on this game though. And without giving much away, the movie slowly begins to evolve into a very tense, fun ride. Not to mention the superb acting from Kate Siegel, given the fact that she was only able to use sign language and other resources as a form of communication. You wonder throughout the film what you would do in her shoes, and you may be surprised by the logic and resourcefulness of some of her decisions.There are several moments that would likely get an audience riled up, so grab a big group of friends and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Twist On A Formulaic Genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Flanagan is one for two in my books. His first big film was Absentia, which was a slow boring mess of a film. Interesting ideas, but nothing much else was going on in the film. His second output was a vast improvement, Oculus. Flanagan showed promise and improvement, which made me interested in seeing what else he had for future projects. Well, he has two films coming out in 2016 and I want to talk about Hush, his take on the home invasion sub-genre. Home invasion films have been done to death. Some are great (You're Next), some are tolerable (The Strangers) and some are downright terrible (When A Stranger Calls, 2006). So how does one make their home invasion film stand out from the rest? There has to be some twist on the story to make it memorable. You're Next was a great deconstruction of the genre itself and had the heroine be a survival specialist. The twist Hush brings us lies in the fact that our protagonist if completely deaf. The key element that makes or breaks this film is the sound design. I felt like the crew pulled it off and we have a solid thriller on our hands here. Maddie is a deaf author and she has secluded herself in a house in the woods to write her next book. Problems arise when someone outside her house decides to play a deadly game with Maddie and know she has to keep him out and escape alive. Again, this is a simple premise that is only made interesting by the fact that she is deaf and how the filmmakers decide to handle that aspect of the story. While the film does inevitably go down routine routes with the story, Flanagan does so with skill and finesse. Multiple times throughout the film we are in Maddie's shoes as Flanagan completely mutes the audio. We see the terror happening behind her, but we cannot hear it. He can be entering the house at any point and we will not know. Flanagan manages to seep the viewer in suspense throughout the whole film and while there are some gory and squeamish scenes, he doesn't rely on them. They feel real and earned. Looking back at the film there are multiple sequences where I was taken back or had a huge grin on my face with the ingenuity of it all. People will ultimately try to find inconsistencies with how the film handles the deaf aspect. I had maybe one issue myself, but can look past it for the benefit of the enjoyment I ultimately had because of the film. With a small cast of only four people and hardly any dialogue (maybe 15 minutes total?) Hush is a well crafted film that earns a viewing from anyone who likes this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie I've seen in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the reviews I think I watched a different movie. This movie was so bad that I had to join IMDb to leave this review. I know the home invasion movies require the characters to make stupid decisions but there has to be a limit to the stupidity. Also, crossbows aren't that hard to load, but if she can't load it she could always just stab the guy with a bolt during any one of the many opportunities she was given. Her boyfriend believed some guy with no badge and no uniform with a neck tattoo was a cop? Give me a break! She finally stabs him in the leg and runs away because why not leave the crazed maniac alive to come after you some more? She made so many bad decisions I was rooting for the douchiest home invading killer in movie history. I couldn't let other people get fooled by these reviews into thinking this was a good movie the way that I did.Avoid at all cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intensity at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Mike Flanagan has already proved himself on the horror genre many times before. Now however, he exceeds all of his previous work with Hush. A psychological horror thriller movie that is very entertaining. This movie is perfectly directed and amazingly written. The premise is nothing new but the execution is what makes it, special and as good as it is. Even though it is produced on a small budget and has a rather short running time, it still manages to keep us intrigued and at the edge of out seats. The ending is also very satisfying too. All the actors do a wonderful job here. The dark tone and the R rating is what helps this movie qualify as genuinely scary at times. It takes the familiar premise and the clichés that come with it, and makes something new out of it. And that's a very hard thing to do, but proved possible by M. Flanagan. I really enjoyed Hush, and while it isn't groundbreaking or anything (which it isn't even trying to be), it is still a fast paced, thrilling, scary and tense movie completed by very good performances and amazing directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hush was one of them random picks on Netflix. I'd never heard of it but I wanted a film with a shorter run time to watch one night so decided to give it a try. Hush is a basic story. The film follows Maddie (portrayed excellently by Kate Siegel) who is deaf and non verbal. She's a writer who lives alone in a very remote place. The film is only 1 hour &amp; 20 minutes so it gets pretty much straight to the point that she is going to be terrorized by an intruder. There is a few small jump scares along the way but the film's horror comes more from the tension and atmosphere it creates. At times the film plays out like a silent movie &amp; the atmosphere had me on the edge of my seat. It bubbles away nicely and I really started to like the main character and cared/hoped that she would survive. There isn't much else to say but if you like atmospheric thrillers then you will probably enjoy this. There's a few minutes build up at the beginning and then the rest of the film is basically all in one location leading up to a bloody finale.Well worth checking out. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Palpably Tense, Downright Captivating &amp; Endlessly Thrilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Palpably tense, downright captivating &amp; endlessly thrilling, Hush begins like a fresh breathe of life in the home-invasion slasher subgenre of horror, and had all the necessary ingredients to become a modern slasher masterpiece but, thanks to some poor decisions made by the filmmakers, it isn't one. And it really is a shame because there was so much up for grabs plus it did many things right too.The story of Hush follows a young, deaf &amp; mute writer who lives a solitary life in the woods and is working on her next book. But her quiet &amp; peaceful life is disrupted when a masked killer appears at her door and, after learning about her disability, takes advantage of the situation and torments her all night. But as this cat-n-mouse game nears its conclusion, our writer realises that there is only one way to end this ordeal.Co-written &amp; directed by Mike Flanagan, the home-invasion story that Hush packs in isn't new by any means but the decision to turn its protagonist deaf &amp; mute does add an interesting spin to it. Sure it may feel like a gimmick but in all honesty, it helps raise the stakes by an extent. Flanagan's direction is brilliant for the most part as he keeps the suspenseful vibe alive but when it was time to make some bold decisions, he chose to compromise.There were numerous things the director could've done differently that would've benefited this thriller immensely, and made the ride all the more engrossing. Some possible alternatives include, narrating the story like a silent thriller, using sound such as ambient noises but no dialogues, or never letting the killer take off his mask or eliminating the unnecessary exposition that ends up ruining few moments. It would've been a challenge but it also would've allowed some creativity to come into play.Kate Siegel, who co-wrote the screenplay with Flanagan, also plays our deaf &amp; mute protagonist and does a really good job at it. I don't know if Siegel playing a handicap woman has anything to do with it but her character is really likable and it isn't difficult to get behind her when things go south. The controlled camera-work, apt lighting &amp; fitting colour tones greatly enhance the tone n feel of the story, Editing never lets the tension seep out of the equation, and the background score does amplify its mood at times.On an overall scale, Hush had the opportunities to take its genre in a different direction and set a new bar for modern home-invasion thrillers in the process but it settles for much less than what it was capable of. The film is still a taut, compelling &amp; edge-of-the-seat experience that will satisfy majority of its viewers but due to a few shortcomings, which were totally avoidable, it just falls short of joining the ranks of the greatest examples of its genre. I actually enjoyed what this psychological horror had in store for me but I still can't stop picturing the masterpiece it just missed out on being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping intelligent slasher movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read a couple of bad reviews before watching this so I was a bit unsure. The slasher movie has been done to 'death' so I thought here we go again.This slasher movie is different not just because the main star is deaf and mute but also there are some changes to the normal 'Man in mask' routine but I won't spoil anything. Also the fact she is deaf really adds some scary moments to some scenes and allows the writers to really play with some great ideas (Breath on neck etc). The movie starts fairly slowly but once it gets going it does with a bang and never lets up with some great twists along the way and the acing is top notch from all the cast.Really enjoyed this movie and it was a breath of fresh air in a tired tired subject matter</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing on most animal lovers lips during this movie is 'does the cat die?' Fortunately for you guys, it doesn't.But this movie offers more than just a reasonably happy ending. It showcases the talent that is John Gallagher Jr - a rising star who needs to take on more bad guy roles as he absolutely smashed it out of the park in this movie. He gets every characteristic of his part across in the first few minutes on screen and once we are comfortable with that, he just goes on to emphasise each trait to reveal just how truly sick and twisted he is. We know this type of character, sure, we've seen it before, but John Gallagher Jr does something impressive here and stands out, even alongside husband and wife/director and star duo Mike Flanagan and Kate Siegel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could have been more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like films where masked attack people stranded in a house, and this movie started of quiet well, the same as others like it but with the added twist that the woman is deaf, however very quickly the mask is removed and the woman, in between her apple adverts she does through the movie, makes some strange decisions, but the 'killer' guy is so awful, he's not scary or clever, which would be fine but the movie tries so hard to make him both.I thought the movie would use the fact that the main woman is deaf, to tighten suspense and tension, apart from the opening twenty minutes, they don't really make as much of this as they could of, and most the movie is just a man outside a house, and then trying to break in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband had been asleep in front of the TV but once this got underway he was wide awake. It was a surprise as was not expecting something this good. When you wake up the next morning and are still going over the scenes then you know it was pretty darn good. The acting was great especially when no voice could be used by the main character. All the way through you are involved rooting for the heroine. It is not horror so people should not be put off by that. It is scary but not more than is needed to tell the story of a brave, determined young writer who uses her imagination to help defend herself. We watched it at bedtime but still were able to sleep. It is not suitable for children or teenagers though! I recommend it to people who love a good thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great take on a cliché "intruder type" horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was very VERY enjoyable from beginning to end. I was not expecting to like this movie as much as I did and I am a very opinionated about my horror movies. The movie had me on the edge of my seat the while time. I will try use as little spoilers as possible...The fact that the main character is deaf add such an interesting take on this kind of movie. The length of the movie was perfect. Was just long enough so you get to know the characters and what relation they have, and was not too long to where you are becoming eager for it to end. The violence was quite strong throughout, but not in an overwhelming or out of place kind of way.. It was not overly gory and it all fit very well with the premise of the movie.I haven't seen this type of movie this good in a long time and I will definitely recommend to others and be watching it again myself in the future!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Atmosphere and a Tense Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just finished watching Hush and even though I never write reviews, this film alone compelled me to start. The story was well written and paced well. It got started immediately and didn't let up throughout its run time. At no point did it feel like it dragged on and it kept me guessing although the ending is as one would predict, it was fun and unpredictable getting there. Both victim and assailant were more competent than most films have shown and I really liked the character development. The film was immersive in how it showed what the main character Maddie was thinking and and dealing with in her situation. A very great film that I would recommend to anyone wanting a new take on a slasher movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Hush' provides the viewer with a consistent stream of tension and suspense, as well as a surprising number of ideas and plot twists given the movie's relatively simple premise. What you'll also get out of this movie is a likable and resourceful protagonist and a sadistic and calculating villain. I will say that there are moments where the plot drags a bit, and that the ending requires a little suspension of disbelief, but it's still a satisfying movie that will have you holding your breath, and wondering what will happen next. I will defiantly check out Mr. Flanagan's other works in the future. My verdict is four out of five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hush is a must see movie that is as intriguing as it is suspenseful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hush is a must see movie even if suspense thrillers aren't usually your thing. It's not the type of big budget production that leaves you with a memorable logo or over-priced souvenir. No, it's the type of movie that leaves you with something else. It's the type of movie that has you screaming at the main character to "turn around!" or "don't move!" so loud and so fiercely that you rip your cotton spread in your bare hands (because grown-ups don't use blankies, right?). It's the type of movie that produces Moby Dick size waves of relief followed by pounding, quick-breathed panic in your chest. Hush is a remarkably well-done thriller, but it's also much more than that. It has a series of details that command your mind to think about it long after you've changed your spread and turned in for the night with all door, windows, and shutters closed. It's about a talented writer, with a disabling bout of writers block that wouldn't seem to go away. She'd even considered giving up on her second novel after coming up with seven different endings for it that seemed impossible to even begin choosing from. Shortly into the film, we learn she lives a life of seclusion, not only because of her location, a small home in the woods with one neighbor, but also because she has been deaf and mute since she'd been a teenager. She moved out to the woods to get away from the disorienting noise of the city where she could write in peace. As a writer, she mentioned that she had voices in her head, narrating every possible story line like a movie playing out in her mind. This is why she was such a great writer, but also why she couldn't decide on one ending for her second novel. Her writers block became the least of her worries when a malicious stranger showed up at her secluded home. I won't give out any spoilers, but I'll tell you this; the voices in her head that caused her frustration in not being able to finish her book is the very thing that may or may not have saved her. My thought throughout the film and at its close were that, if she survived, she would no longer be indecisive in telling a story. She would have a story alright. A story of how determination led to her self- preservation, gained through incomprehensible pain and suffering, or an untold story. A story of how just a few more seconds or a weapon that much closer or that one last chance would have saved her life if only she could've had it. Either way, it's still a great story.Caleb D.

		<shortDescription>Good movie but lacked a few things.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this a solid 7/10 rating because overall it's a good movie but it still lacked a few things to allow its full potential to be a great movie. First off, 2/3 actors (whom I've come to known over time) had very short roles: Samantha Sloyan (Grey's Anatomy), Michael Trucco (One Tree Hill - TV show), and John Gallagher Jr.(10 Cloverfied Lane). For Michael Trucco, his role was the shortest and seemed a bit pointless to me, and you'd think that considering the situation he faced in the film, he'd be better prepared and more smarter. The entire encounter between him and the masked man felt flat. For Kate Siegel's character - she played her role well, and in some scenes she reminds me a younger Angelina Jolie. Now getting into the actual movie review...Realistically, the movie doesn't explain why Maddie was targeted, not to mention targeted by someone who walks around carrying a bow &amp; arrow? If someone is truly trying to target and/or attack you, they'd have a gun or knife - some more common type of weapon. This was a typical guy who seemed to have nothing better to do, and chose to bother a deaf woman in the woods. And for what? Boredom? He had a bad day? This story line needed an explanation. To add to this, he (masked man) seemed to have procrastinated on truly killing Maddie (or trying to kill her hypothetically speaking). I wouldn't say this film is bad because it's not but it does miss key points that could've made this film much better (and maybe even a theatrical release instead of straight-to-DVD). I would recommend anyone to watching this if you're looking for something decent to watch. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK thriller with some interesting aspects.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let us start with the fact that this is not a horror movie. It's a thriller, with some interesting unusual aspects, as well as a few cringe-worthy flaws (in character logic, as the case always seems to be).So what makes this movie stand out and feel almost fresh? The obvious first is that our protagonist is deaf-mute. Not being an expert on deaf people, I still believe this was played quite consistently to the movie's credit. It is interesting to occupy the head space of someone missing such an important sense in a frightful situation.Another thing I noticed is the total lack of jump scares. There isn't a single jump-scare in the movie, which only further distances Hush from being a horror movie. In fact the usual creep factor as a whole is kept to a minimum. It quickly becomes a cat-and-mouse kind of battle of wits more than anything else, which I found a pleasant surprise, despite being more of a horror fanatic.The third curious thing is that from the get go it's made clear that the killer is very much human. We don't know what his motivations are, he's just out to kill and doesn't give much of a s*** about anything else but his upper hand. He doesn't have much of a plan and has to improvise, as does our protagonist to survive.I found the thrill in this movie to be more intellectual than primal. The gore is neither profuse nor lacking, it's there when it's needed. It's well shot, acted, directed and edited, considering the modest budget, and doesn't overstay its welcome. I'd recommend it for a rainy evening if you want to see the thriller genre try something new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>oh, this movie came so--SO--close to being something really, really special. as it was, hush (2016) was pretty darn good, and were it not for a poorly conceived fifteen minute stretch preceding the finale, it might have been a classic.this spare and intelligently put together slasher movie pits maddie, a deaf writer struggling to end her current novel, against a killer with no motive and an eternally built in element of surprise. maddie is a great character, plucky and resourceful, who never gives up despite what must be paralyzing fear, being so vulnerable. kate siegal plays her wonderfully; she also co-wrote the script! extra cool. the killer is way more menacing behind his mask, which he sheds much too quickly. and then he talks way too much. nonetheless, he and maddie engage in a very entertaining game of cat-and-mouse.everything is humming, just moving along with entertaining crackle, great dialogue, lovely camera (filmed in good ole alabama), and a great synth score from the newton brothers, until the movie runs off the road for a piece. suddenly, all the characters make a series of rash decisions that defy credulity, and which snapped me out of hush's stark hold for a stretch. to their credit, director mike flanagan and scripter siegal wrestle the car out of its' ditch and deliver an exciting--and satisfying--conclusion.one of my hopes was that the filmmakers would be clever about how they used sound, and they did not let me down. at times, we are drowned in suffocating silence, which reminds us how desperate maddie's situation is: literally, he could crash through a window or even a wall, and she would be none the wiser. she's mute which smartly removes a classic horror movie trope--screaming female victim. it restores some of her power lost by not hearing anything, depriving him of the pleasure of hearing her suffer. and then the volume gets turned up here and there, reinforcing to us how much maddie is missing: if only she could hear that, this would be all over! hush is a smart and feisty movie that presents us with a uniquely powerful final girl. the movie is filmed gorgeously, and definitely shows us what flanagan might do with a new halloween flick (which obviously had some influence on this one). i hope siegal remains with him as writing partner. there are far too few women in horror, and a writer who is also a talented actor would be a valuable talent in our genre. a siege movie, home invasion, cabin in the woods, slasher, hush is a great little flick, gently affecting, and perfect at 80 some-odd-minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creative and Effective Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hush (2016) *** (out of 4)Maddie (Kate Siegel) is a deaf writer who lives in a secluded house deep in the woods. She's currently struggling to find an ending to her latest novel but her world is turned upside down when a man (John Gallagher, Jr.) shows up outside her home trying to kill her.Mike Flanagan's HUSH is the perfect example of what you can do with nice performances, a good story and some creative directing. The film certainly has some flaws along the way but for the most part this is an extremely effective thriller that uses creativity over cheap CGI effects or obnoxious loud band noises to try and get scares.What impressed me the most was the simple storyline and how director Flanagan managed to use it to the perfect effect. The biggest issue for our female lead is that she can't hear the killer and the killer's best protection is that he can hear her. This here creates some great suspense because of scenes like where the killer is standing behind her knocking on a window but she can't tell that he's there. There are several scenes where the killer is right there making noise but our deaf person can't hear it and this just milks up the suspense.The film really makes you understand and feel what our lead character is going through. I say this because while it's obvious what it means to be deaf, this film manages to really let you see and feel the fear that the character would be going through in this situation. The director perfectly milks all of these scenes and the screenplay is also extremely effective because of the creative scenarios that our lead has to go through.Siegel is extremely effective in her part because she has to do so much without saying a single word. She's certainly very believable in her role and she certainly makes you believe she's a deaf woman. Gallagher, Jr. is also good in the role of the killer as he brings a certainly cold and clam nature to the role. The two work very well together and off one another.As I said, there are some flaws including one really bad dream-like sequence but for the most part this is one of the more creative thrillers in recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We didn't need dialogue. We had faces!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with the first major film from director Mike Flanagan, Absentia, and to an extent Oculus, the originality of a set-up isn't the most concerning thing. Everything for him comes down to storytelling, storytelling, g-ddamn visual storytelling. How are you going to set up your shots, get your actors to connect with the audience, to make sure that past the set up that he knows we've seen before - a man comes back after years being 'missing' but what he missing; two adults fight back against the demonic entity that took their parents; a woman who is deaf has to stop a home invader-killer - and make it CINEMATIC? I put the emphasis on that last word because many horror movies tend to forget that last part (the most awful and excruciating example being Unfriended, but I don't want to crap on Blumhouse getting something right here so I'll let that go for now). It can't just be the situation, and a director has to keep that in check when putting forward all of the dots together. This doesn't mean a movie like Hush is anything perfect - in fact it almost falls apart in the last five to ten minutes, and I wish they had used the fact that this protagonist is deaf a little more, at least as something dramatic that could be used against her (it does happen, just not enough) - but that's not the point I'm trying to make here.Why should you stop what you're doing and check this out on Netflix? Well, the larger question is why didn't this get a theatrical release? This is shot as something that really should be experienced in a theater, or at least in the dark with awesome sound and a bright, large screen. For lack of a better term, Flanagan's canvas is sharp as a tack, and as much as I can praise the cinematography (and I do), the writing from Flanagan and Siegel is what's sharpest of all.All of these actions that the characters take, whether it's Maddie or the killer, have to be written out and thought out. In this sense it's closer in scope to No Country for Old Men for major portions, with those set pieces where the characters face off, go from one part of the house to the other, and there's barely a word (if any at all, usually there isn't) in the space of five, ten, fifteen minutes at times. I felt in the grip of this film not because its concept was anything mind-blowing (though, for once in I don't know how long, it makes sense and is logical to be set in a rural environment surrounded by trees), but because I get caught up in what each figure, hero and villain, will do next, and the vulnerability of her position made me think what I would do in that position, deaf or not.Are there some contrivances? Sure. And in the time this evening since I've seen the film I've thought of some things that can be nitpicked or taken apart. It's not as complex as Absentia or as visually warped as Oculus. But for what Flanagan and his co-writer/star Katie Siegel set out to accomplish (she completely sells every moment she's given, every breath, every time she has to do things like pull back the bow and it doesn't quite get all the way repeatedly), and within their limitations they set for themselves, it's an awesome success. If you like (honest to goodness ie Halloween 78') slasher flicks, or when a home invasion movie has reasonably solid logic (note: this isn't The Purge in case you're wondering, there's no politics or any big questions like that) and just want to get completely scared out of your minds, this is the thing to watch right now, and Flagan is one of the dependable young filmmakers working in horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very effective horror chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well it's arrived, folks. The first truly effective horror film of the year (that I've had a chance to see anyway). I was drowsily browsing Netflix and came upon Hush, sporting a snazzy poster and a premise ripped straight from the vintage horror flicks I grew up with. Compelled to give it a shot, I was rewarded with a slick, atmospheric and sturdily made exercise in suspense. It's not often I feel true giddy tension while watching a thriller (even though most brashly guarantee it on the DVD cover), but this baby delivers in spades. It's funny because the storyline is identical to many movies of the past, and similar to countless more. The secret to success, obviously, is in the execution, and Hush is made with a caring love for a genre deeply ingrained in cinematic culture. Director Mike Flanagan clearly loves horror films, and seems to want to rise above the primordial crust, calcifying his effort with a steady hand and fresh direction that gives even the most knowing plot turns a dose of torque using simple tools: a killer soundtrack, whiplash inducing editing and...and.. What's the most important thing in any horror film? I've said it before and I'll keep saying it: atmosphere. The setting finds us in a dusky, desolate area, where a deaf novelist (Katy Siegel) toils in isolation, churning out the trimmings of her next book on a laptop, content in her loneliness yet on the verge of unease stirred by cabin fever, restlessness or something else. It's not long before the film lands the first punch of many: a masked, crossbow wielding serial killer (John Gallagher spits on his previous good guy image, both terrifying, unrecognizable and superb) begins to stalk her with methodical menace, watching from the inky shadows of her home's exterior while she cowers in terror. He catches on quick about her deafness and uses it against her, terrorizing her at every turn. Now, the film does use genre tropes to churn out its story, and anyone expecting something truly unique to pop out of the ether may be disappointed. But to those who yearn for solid, extremely well made horror entries to wade out of the muck and foretell the return to form of a genre that gets maybe two, three winners every year, can rejoice. This one comes up aces. Siegel is instantly likable and gorgeous to boot, giving her protagonist a resilience that is actually believable, which can't be said about every girl being pursued by a killer on screen. Gallagher is icky as the psycho, branded with certain idiosyncratic symbols of society which suggest that he's a jaded outcast driven to sickening extremes by the hand he's been dealt, given in to his dark impulses completely. For genre fans: this begs a watch and will likely be a highlight of the year. For casual viewers: fun, fun times and a vibe to get sucked in by. For non horror fans: just watch it anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just One Word... AMAZING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off let me start by saying I am in no way associated with this movie in any regards, so you can trust my review on this one. I recently saw this and i just have one word for it amazing. Loved it till the end credits came up , which by the way are pretty good the score i believe coming from Newton Brothers. But lets talk about the movie; Simply put its a home invasion movie but it has twist in the way of the main protagonist who is deaf and cant speak ( brilliantly acted by Kate Siegel, who also happens to be one of the co writers of this little gem along with Mike Flanagan the director) A mention also for John Gallagher Jr. who I thought portrayed the bad guy really well. The movie holds you till the very end, as its a continuous fight for survival, a fight for life and a will to live in-spite of the odds our main character suffers during her teen days, which as viewer we come to know once the movie is in its early part. Full credit to the writers and the editing team, as not even a single minute goes by without a strong screenplay.There are hardly any other characters in this movie, but they do their little bit too. Overall I would say if you are into the Home invasion kind of thriller/horrors like 'You Are Next' you will love this one. Highly Recommended, Enjoy...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Slasher/Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HushHush is a film about a mute/deaf who gets terrorized by a psychopath. I love how simplistic the story-line is, but at the same time I wish I understood why the villain was doing the things he was doing. I get the who "he just wants to watch the world burn." but why this girl, why now. Serious serial killers, like dance choreographers generally have a theme in mind.That being said John Gallagher Jr., who I know as the lovable Jim Harper from The Newsroom, plays the psychopath to point. He's crazy for sure but he hasn't lost all of his marbles which makes him a more believable character, I just wish there was some sort of reason to his madness. His character doesn't even have a name. I adore that in the writing.Speaking of writing, the film is not only stared by Kate Siegel but is also written by her as well. The director Mike Flanagan also helped write, but I'm glad to see the two together again. They worked on Oculus if you're wondering the connection. Back to Kate, she was wonderful. She didn't have many lines since her character is a mute. Sure the first few scenes are boring, but the movie jumps straight into terror early on and she has to act to entertain rather than leave it for the writing.Michael Trucco is also in the film. He'll always been Samuel Anders to me though from BSG. He plays a side character that is an important scene to develop John Gallagher Jr.'s character. Even though this cast is only 5 people I still think he did a good job as his character.Verdict: Watch at least once, don't buy. There is a persistent and fast paced feeling of dread throughout most of the movie with a few breather moments. Not many jump scares, but if you've seen any slasher film you know when they're going to happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The alternate to SCREAM ! A short but worthy thrill ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is without a doubt an excellent thriller ! There are so many films out there from big studios and small as well that try hard to push these indie horror films but they never deliver, so it was such a surprise when this short little film shocked me. The element of suspense was perfectly captured in the battle of a mute/deaf woman and her psychotic tormentor. The final girl moments are played out really well given this final girl does not have many advantages going for her, so the scene where she plays out the scenarios of her death over and over is pretty much what every other final has done to survive in all horror films. Filled with suspense and some actually bone chilling moments this makes for an excellent horror film, with a good actress and a clever take on an old tale.Wish there were more films like this out there. One only complaint, however, is the short running time ... when something is this entertaining one hopes for a longer joy ride.Final Grade A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly strong thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was utterly shocked by how much I enjoyed 'Hush'. At first, I was merely watching this due to the recommendation of a few friends (Shout out to Jalen, Shawn, and Grant), but then as I kept watching, the acting all on its own and the intensity of the scenes pulled me farther and farther in until I was unable to pull away from my screen. To reiterate; Maddie is a deaf and mute author. The film has moments of natural viewing where you see and hear everything as usual but it also goes into moments where you are forced to hear the environment exactly the way Maddie does. This immensely increased the intensity in some scenes as a loud environment was turned into a silence, causing the audience to hold their breath, or at least I did. To piggyback on this, with Maddie being deaf and her being the main character, the focus is then turned to the body language and overall the acting rather than the common babble of wordplay that is so often clichéd in horror/thriller films. With this being said, Kate Siegel knocks this performance out of the park without saying one word. Lastly, John Gallagher Jr. is phenomenal. Playing the villain in this role, he presents us with a diabolical cold-blooded killer who seems his sole purpose is to kill for sport. His antics and mannerisms are bone-chilling and with this role and '10 Cloverfield Lane' he has easily placed himself up there on a notable actor scale.Again, 'Hush' can be found on Netflix. I highly recommend this flick for the fans of cold, bone-chilling thriller/horror. The small ensemble cast takes this film and runs it home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A home alone deaf &amp; mute woman realises she's being played with by a psychopath. I was initially attracted to the terrifying realism of the trailer. The way the stalker sends the photo through to her Mac so she knows she's being watched - that is the behaviour of a psycho-stalker in 2016. That modern element was enough for me to know this film is going to be good. If you're looking for a genuinely good horror film with good acting and suspense I strongly suggest you watch this. Think about how many utterly awful horror films are out there - rest assured this isn't one of them.I can't really fault the film to be honest. I think most criticism is either clutching at straws or simply finding something to complain about for the sake of it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pure horror old style in your face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oculus (2013) directed by Mike Flanagan wasn't my cup of tea so I wasn't that eager to go watch his next flick Hush. Haven't seen any trailers or reviews I didn't know what to expect but what can I tell you, this is completely the opposite of Oculus.Even as it just has 5 people throughout this flick it just doesn't matter because it will get you by the throat. What an excellent horror this is, Oculus was a perfect example of the new style of horrors, not that scary at all and mostly about the supernatural but Hush is back to the old style horrors. It's suspenseful from the beginning until the ending. This shows that a simple story, a house invasion not being explained who exactly is the killer, I suppose it's her ex but later on his weapon you can see marks, is it the account of victims, I don't know and it doesn't matter at all. It starts rather simple with a girl cooking but quickly you will notice that she's a mute and that's exactly the strength of this flick. Once the home invasion starts you will have a few jump scenes but not only that, when the red stuff if is flowing it's done in a messy gory style. A great horror flick worth picking up. About the end you can have your doubts when you hear the police car but it didn't bother me at all, straight in your face pure horror, finally a excellent one.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3,5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heralds the arrival of the next (potential) master of horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will begin by mentioning that I am a big fan of Oculus. It is one of those horror movies which is very evenly paced and takes a potentially silly premise and turns it into some wonderful psychological horror. What I liked about Mike Flanagan's work was that he created characters we root for and want to make it out alive. He is not interested in making cookie cutter slashers where we want the killer to get creative. That is a good trait in a horror filmmaker and Flanagan is definitely very good.Hush touches upon a premise which is a personal favorite. The home invasion story, if done properly (The Strangers, Black Christmas, When a Stranger Calls, Halloween), can be very compelling. Add Hush to the list. It takes an overdone premise and adds twists in it which you do not see coming. The character of Maddie might seem like a cheap story device but Kate Siegel does a wonderful job of getting us on her side. At the same time, the dangerous but smug antagonist is essayed very well. We want to see Maddie live and the killer die a horrible, painful death. The amount of stupid decisions made by the protagonists is kept to a minimum and ultimately, it makes for really satisfying viewing.To conclude, Hush is a must watch if you like intelligent and visceral horror movies. You cannot help but think that you might just be watching the work of the next big thing in Horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hush" Will Keep You on the EDGE of Your Seat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched "Hush" on Netflix a couple nights ago. I wasn't expecting much at first, but what I saw blew me away.I'm a huge horror movie fan, but this film surpasses the genre. It contains one of those rare, psychological feels that gets under your skin, leaves you at the edge of your seat, and keeps you tense. There was never a dull moment in this movie. Every scene had something unnerving to offer.The film opens to a seemingly peaceful, comforting environment in the countryside. Deaf writer Maddie Young lives by herself in a small house with her cat, her Macbook, and a voice in her mind. All goes well until a stalker in a creepy white mask invades not only her home, but her life. The premise of this film I found to be very unique; a vulnerable deaf woman having to survive a psychopath who's armed with plenty of weaponry. It's almost as if you're Maddie herself, trying to find a solution with limited sources. What I really liked about this film is that it goes back and forth to her "deaf" point of view, which is how the audience can relate to her situation. Hush (2016) is overall one of the most TERRIFYING and SUSPENSEFUL movies I've seen in a long, long time. It's innovative and clever as well. In other words, it doesn't resort to cheap scares and too much gore. It tells a story with very limited dialogue. Great acting, setting, and a pulse-quickening tension.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely not an original film by any means of the imagination. Yet it still really, really works. Why? I'm not sure, but part of it is that the film doesn't take too many of the drastically stupid turns that these sorts of films do. I also think that it has a really inspiring arc for the lead character, and the emotional investment is greater than what the usual would be. I also think the film, while not being very original, still plays it a bit differently than the norm. You would expect a film like this to be mostly build-up, but it's not at all, sometimes to its detriment though. It gets to be a bit repetitive. The fact that the assailant also shows his face pretty early on is also sort of surprising. This isn't anything mind-blowing, but it's well-paced, very well-directed, very well-acted (Gallagher Jr. killing it once again after his wonderful turn in 10 Cloverfield Lane), and ultimately a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hush surprised me in that nearly every horror movie cliché was absent. While viewing this movie you will find that there were very few, if any, jump scares. However, that does not stop you from being on the edge of your seat for the entire runtime.Hush puts a great twist on the home invasion thriller. As you are in the IMDb review section you may already know the plot, but here is a brief review anyway: the film centers around a deaf writer (Kate Siegel) who lives in seclusion in order to focus on writing her new mystery novel. When a serial killer (John Gallagher Jr.) shows up at her house and traps her inside, she must find a way to thwart this mysterious masked individual. The decision of the writers to make the protagonist deaf was a very good one. It makes for some good scenes where you want to shake her and say "LOOK BEHIND YOU!!!" One thing that stood out to me in this film was the direction. The attention to detail regarding little sounds made in the background was very prevalent. If you know horror movies, than you know that creates a more jumpy environment. I wasn't the biggest fan of Mike Flanagan's earlier work, Oculus. I found the ending to be dark just for the sake of being dark, as opposed to an ending that fit the rest of the movie. However, that's not to say the direction wasn't great. Hush not only puts that direction to good use, it has a satisfying ending.Another thing that stood out to me was the acting of the two main players. Kate Siegel is definitely someone to look out for in the future. She is great at playing a deaf person, and also great at showing emotion without speaking. Her acting gets you to cheer for the character, which makes you rejoice every time she gets ahead of the villain in any way. However, the real standout in this movie is John Gallagher Jr. as the serial killer. He was great in 10 Cloverfield Lane, but he is even better in this, and that is saying something. From the beginning to the end, he really messes with your head and at times he even tricks you so badly that you start yelling in anger. But believe me, that is a great thing.The only complaint I have with this movie is that there is a dream sequence near the end that kind of ticked me off. Dream sequences have been proved not to work, (I'm looking at you Batman v Superman) and they do not in this one either. But besides that minor flaw, Hush transcends most other movies in ts genre, and leaves you looking out the window in fear. I give this movie a 9/10PS Watch this movie in the dark if you want the full experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The silence deafens my ears.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As high concept horror/home invasion movies go, this can be filed under 'why didn't anybody think of this before?'.And it's a wonderful concept. We have a woman whom has obviously just come out of a terrible relationship, and does what any sane person would do and seek solace in a cabin.......a nice cabin mind you........but in the woods.She has all her friends and family at hand via technology, and she just wants to concentrate on writing her next novel.And talking of novel, she just happens to be deaf, so already the tension has risen above your standard home invasion horror, because we automatically know that the killer could literally walk up behind her and kill her.But that wouldn't make for a very interesting film would it? anyone who is a fan of the horror genre knows that the killer likes to taunt his victim, the main victim that is, the other people in the film (in which there are very few) are offed before you can shout 'he's behind you!!', but that is the usual Cliché in this type of films.So it's a taut cat and mouse game between the victim and the victimiser, Gallagher jr is a formidable villain, and it makes the film that little bit more sadistic when he takes of his mask very early in the film and reveals himself to be, for want of a better word, a normal looking fellow.Siegel makes great use of the disability and adds an added depth to the film.There are a few very difficult to watch scenes, one of the kills is particularly gruesome and is borderline exploitation, and when you know the killer is in the house, and the film goes into 'deaf-mode', it almost becomes unbearable to watch.the film does have the traditional tropes of the heroine being a terrible shot and running one way when she should go the other way, but in this instance, it only adds to the fun of the film, which is nothing more than a well executed high concept b-movie.The ending is a bit of a letdown and screams of lazy writing syndrome, it's your old last ditch attempt to foil the killer, if the ending had been different than this one we see over and over again, this could have been something really special, rather than just being very good.It could start a trend in making disability based home invasion movies Night Vision: a blind voice actress is subjected to a night of terror by an unmasked assailant.Oxygen Tent: A COPD suffering architect is subject to a night of terror by a cigar smoking assailant.And don't get me started on Boxing Helena.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Selecting this movie on Netflix this evening the only thing I knew about it was the genre, which wasn't a very promising start. But in the first few moments - as Maddie is cooking herself dinner, overloading our senses with profound audio and visuals - I knew this was going to be something special.I'd go as far as saying that this is a genre re-defining movie.You'd think a trait as simple as deafness would have a relatively minor impact on the movie, but you'd be wrong: totally wrong. Maddie's deafness is what makes this movie totally unique in its genre as it adds an element which many of us likely have never considered having to worry about.The perspective changes throughout the movie to heighten tension and add to the already ominous atmosphere. Just when Maddie turns her back or closes the door, all of a sudden you go deaf too. You're drawn into the house and trapped alongside Maddie in sheer terror as you both struggle to ascertain where the assailant is; it's honestly petrifying.Of course, there are the regular genre clichés present: an unsuspecting friend shows up, several attempts at escaping are tried and failed, and there are many close-calls where the man almost gets in yet she just manages to close the door/window in time. But those clichés are often turned on their heads, such as when her escape attempt fails and her head is brutally smashed in, and then it's revealed to have only been a premonition.In the end, Maddie is able to use her weakness to her advantage as she disables the man by using her unbelievably powerful fire alarm to deafen him. I was glad to see her get the better of him, but I can't help but feel as though the ending would've been more fitting if she died on the floor with him then and there. I'm not sure where she found the energy to stand up, walk outside, and sit on the front porch for help to arrive - but that's one of very few gripes in an otherwise excellent movie.In short, if you enjoy horrors, yet - like me - you're tired of the same old crap: watch Hush. Frankly, it's great, and shows that there is still hope for the horror/thriller genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gimmick Horror Film That Doesn't Sustain Its Gimmick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Home invasion horror movies aren't even worth making anymore unless there's going to be a gimmick that sets them apart. In "Hush," the gimmick is the deafness of the protagonist, a young woman who lost her hearing to meningitis as a teenager and now lives in a secluded cabin in the woods (of course). The man who wants to kill her wants to kill her just because, and he enjoys terrorizing her first. Her deafness is portrayed as both a hindrance and an advantage. On the one hand, she can't hear her stalker but he can hear her; on the other hand, she's forced to think creatively and act in ways that her attacker isn't necessarily expecting.The film's set up is handled well. In an opening scene, we're almost overwhelmed by the snap, crackle, and pop of the heroine making dinner, sounds we would normally take for granted thundering at us over the soundtrack. This primes us to pay attention to aural cues throughout the rest of the movie, and indeed one finds himself cringing at each little squeak and rustle the protagonist makes as she runs and hides from place to place. At one point, she realizes the only way to beat this dude is to do the one thing he won't expect, and that's to fight back and kill him. And while I agreed wholeheartedly with this sentiment, I also found that the air goes out of the film a bit from that point forward. The filmmakers make such a point of establishing her deafness early on that I wish that condition had played more of a role in her actually triumphing over her attacker. But in the end, her deafness becomes beside the point and she deals with him much the same way as anyone would. It's refreshing to find a heroine in a horror film who doesn't act as a ninny, but by the end, gimmick aside, there wasn't much to distinguish "Hush" from any number of similar films. The film it most reminded me of in recent memory is "You're Next," which wasn't a great film either but did a better job of sustaining its gimmick premise all the way through the film."Hush" does have some nail biter moments though, and horror fans will probably want to check it out.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thought provoking and very scary horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is directed by "Oculus", "Absentia", and "Hush" director, Mike Flanagan. It was released right around the same time as his other upcoming film, "Before I Wake", so going into it i was hoping it wouldn't feel rushed or forced. It didn't. It turned out to be one of the most involving and personal horror films I've seen in awhile. This movie is a horror/thriller about the sort of home invasion of a late 20s, early 30s deaf and mute female living alone in a secluded house in a woodsy area. With only one neighbor somewhat close by, it was the perfect, yet typical setup for this type of movie. The movie began to follow all the typical tropes of the horror genre, like the protagonist doing all the wrong things and ultimately setting herself for a lonesome event, and taking care of the cell phone problem. about 20 minutes in, though, this movie began to really draw me in, slowly dropping my jaw as the tension and situations started to build to an ultimately terrifying climax. The actor chosen for the invader was perfect. John Gallagher Jr. Is a good actor who has recently taken on the horror genre, and i think it fits him well. He resembles so many of the kids i grew up with so it adds an even more realistic feel. What was really cool about this movie was how the main character, Maddie, fought so hard for survival. The movie flowed at a very appealing pace and though it was a shorter movie, it was packed with thrills. The violence was very realistic and it was ade to resemble what it would REALLY be like if this were to happen to someone. Maddie's attitude is sincere and shes the type of girl to make sure her attacker is dead and not just hit him over the head once and walk away. I really liked how the attacker was toying with her the whole movie, and i also really liked how the kills and violence seemed so personal, upsetting, and raw. Mike Flanagan is clearly a multiskilled director and clearly has a knack for the horror genre. This movie is dark, very creepy, intense, involving, intriguing, very scary, and yet, it has an ending that'll leave you happy and satisfied. This is a rare gem and clewrky one of the better home invasion movies to come along since "Youre Next".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I even talk about this movie a standing applause to Mike Flanagan and Kate Siegel for this movie! Wherever you are, if you're reading my comment, please let me know how I can contribute to help you make more movies as this one swept me off my feet, Totally!!! Right from the beginning to the very end until the titles rolled out, was intense tension and edge of the seat scenes. The lead actress did a brilliant job and so did everyone else. The location, camera work, background music, sound effects..everything was just top notch! This is exactly how a thriller movie should be made and those aspiring directors must learn from the way this movie was made. The script is also rare and well written. A deaf and mute girl in the woods, attacked by a stalker! Good God almighty!, they certainly made the best of this script. I would recommend this movie to anyone any day and also ensure I buy a Blue Ray print of its copy. To all those who like real thrillers, the likes of real home invasion, this is a MUST WATCH AT ANY COST! 10/10 and Pleeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaseeee Give me more of these!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A deaf/mute woman (played by Kate Siegel) is alone in a cabin in the woods, writing her novel. Then one night, a masked man with a crossbow appears, telling her (Siegel can read lips) he will kill her; but before he does, he will torture her, physically and mentally. Cutting off her power supply, Siegel has no way to call the police. Her nearest neighbors are nowhere to be found, and she cannot outrun the killer. She knows that eventually the killer will tire of this "game" and break into her house and finish her. With limited options available, Siegel creates a daring plan that will give her a chance ? albeit slim ? to survive.My most memorable, movie moment of "Hush" is the scene **SPOILER ALERT** when the killer stabs a neighbor in the neck, and toys with him as he bleeds out. The victim puts up a hell of a fight, but with the rapid loss of blood, the outcome is certain."Hush" is a good suspense/thriller movie that would have been so much better had it not been for the two shenanigans I am about to mention. Shenanigan #1) **SPOILER ALERT** when her female neighbor is banging on Siegel's door as she is being killed, Siegel doesn't feel the vibrations, even though she's only a few feet away. Shenanigan #2) the male neighbor I mentioned of in the previous paragraph was a complete idiot in his first interactions with the killer. Only after a million clues was dropped on his caveman head did he get what was happening, and even then he kept making one mistake after another. Perhaps it was best that he was killed so that the world wouldn't be infected by his genetic code that carries the stupid gene.Despite those shenanigans, I very much enjoyed "Hush"; rooting for Siegel to somehow find a way to survive, and wishing for the killer's death from the moment he appeared. Any movie that gets you involved like that is a good movie to watch.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hush is a beautifully executed psychological thriller. I questioned if I should turn it off when I was watching it only because I was alone and scared, but I don't think I could have turned it off if I really really wanted to. There is very little dialogue seeing as how the protagonist (Kate Siegel) is deaf. But what she lacks in words she makes up for in action as you stay in suspense the entire time you watch this movie. Not to mention the sadistic mindset of the antagonist (Jihn Gallagher Jr.) causing you to feel unbelievable angst. Unlike other "cat and mouse" movies, this one is intensely realistic and has all bases covered as far as keeping you in suspense and not letting you have any "oh give me a break" kind of thoughts. With that being said, I highly recommend it and hope this review was helpful..... Whatever you do, watch with a buddy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Strong Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A deaf writer (Kate Siegel) who retreated into the woods to live a solitary life must fight for her life in silence when a masked killer (John Gallagher) appears at her window.Stephen King tweeted about the film on April 20, 2016, saying, "How good is Hush? Up there with Halloween and, even more, Wait Until Dark. White knuckle time. On Netflix." Now, I don't necessarily always agree with King. He's a giant in horror, of course, but that doesn't mean taste can't vary. However, an endorsement from him never hurts and in this case I think he is right.Maybe this is not as good as "Halloween" (that seems outrageously bold), but the comparison with "Wait Until Dark" is perfect. While that film is a classic, in some ways this one goes an extra step -- the movie is not silent, but is very, very sparse on dialogue. That would be like "Wait Until Dark" being a radio drama.For "Hush", we have an excellent use of reflection, the smooth camera movements are great, and everyone involved makes this far better than the average horror film. In fact, while I would say horror on average is getting worse, this film allows me to believe it can get better. I just have one question... is the title a "Buffy" reference or what?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They committed to a simple choice here to create the (fun)house in which horror is going to play out for our delectation. The distraught victim who is all alone in the remote cottage is a deaf mute. A killer is skulking the perimeter and has all night to toy with her, prolonging the thrill of watching and teasing through windows that mirrors our own experience of having come to see. It shows viewers who slip in and out of sight, one and then a second viewer vying for control of this intermediate space, having to make imaginative choices.It's a potent scenario, one that was long coming perhaps. They keep it fairly safe overall, trying to avoid off notes more than imaginatively extending, making me wish for an energy like Hooper's. But the house is spacious, affording funhouse games of anticipated surprise. Knowing no one will be coming and agony must be suffered in silence helps to envelop. They secured a woman with a strong presence to anchor emotional torment. The killer isn't the usual hulking crazy but a next door creep who came out to play and probably has a 9 to 5 life somewhere close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything that falls under the Horror label has a reason for being frightening. Usually, it's derived from basic human fears which in most cases relate directly to survival instincts. Hush's main story line deals, obviously, with Home Invasion (following other titles like Panic Room and Strangers), but aside from that it deals with the loss of senses. Usually, as we've all seen and read in Horror films and stories, the sense of sight is the one focused on. This time - a film has set out to show us just how scary the loss of hearing could be, and has done a wonderful job!The story is quite simple. Maddie (Kate Siegel) is a deaf writer living on her own, with very little human interactions, mostly her friend and neighbour Sarah (Samantha Sloyan) and her sister Max (Emilia Graves, with whom she chats online). There are also references to an ex boyfriend by name of Craig. One night, out of nowhere, a killer (John Gallagher Jr.) arrives at her doorstep with the sole intention of toying with her, and finally killing her.The acting is very impressive, especially Gallagher as a profoundly creepy and unnerving killer, and Siegel as a deaf woman fighting for her life. However, the greatest feature is by far the direction (Mike Flanagan). The focus on certain sounds to emphasize Maddie's deafness, the cutting of all audio in certain scenes to show things from her point of view (or more appropriately hearing), the wonderful use of a single location in the project - all have added value making this good film great.Hush is not a masterpiece, especially because of the over-simplified plot and lack of any twists or actual turning points. A smarter story, with half the thought shown to given by Maddie to her books' endings, would have really made the film exquisite. However, even with the story as it is, Hush is suspenseful, authentic, relatable and on in all manners fun and rewarding. Very recommended.</fullReview>

I genuinely appreciated the fact that us watchers were able to experience life in her point of view. She did an amazing job of expressing her true emotions and feelings even though being what I would certainly call "challenged". Those challenges that she was faced with gave the story more meaning. You don't see movies, TV shows, or even books, that have such problematic details. This movie showed emotions in a less obvious way, a way that made me truly appreciate such a film. However there is a line to be drawn. The message was able to be found however it was simply too hard to be found. So for the dozens of people who don't tend to see the complex things that matter in life, or the moral, it made the film harder to understand or relate. As I watched the movie the other people tended to see not the moral, just what was there. So the greatest part of the movie was also its weakest link. However that doesn't take away from the fact that it's still incredible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel like most horror films are a hit and miss nowadays. Rarely do I see a horror film and think meh; usually it's love or hate. This film is on the love side. There are a lot of films I enjoy personally that are stripped of complication and layers. (Although I enjoy those as well. See: Inception) This film is a basic story of a writer who lives almost in complete isolation of any nearby help. A man who for an undisclosed reason, decides he would like to torment her and eventually kill her. The interesting twist for this film is that the lead actress, (Also the writer) Kate Siegel, is deaf. So entertainingly enough she has to keep an eye on the deranged man, John Gallagher Jr., while trying to escape him. Being the fact that the main character Maddie is a deaf mute, makes her acting all the more entertaining being that she mostly acts through complete physical emotion and very little verbal. Also noting that she and every other actor in this film do terrific jobs. There is slight more complexity to this film that adds a little more entertaining touch, but you'll just have to watch to find out. I very much enjoyed this film. I gave it a nine because honestly it was a great film just had little story.</fullReview>

It would have been great to have an ending where a police officer shows up to the house and finds four bodies with two of them lying next to each other and trying to figure out what the hell happened.

		<shortDescription>Mike Flanagan, a new master of horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Author Maddie Young (Kate Siegel) lives a life of utter isolation after losing her hearing via bacterial meningitis at age 13. She's retreated form society, living in seclusion, and existing in a completely silent world. But one night, that fragile world is shattered when the masked face of a psychotic, crossbow-wielding killer (John Gallagher, Jr.) appears in her window. Without another living soul for miles, and with no way to call for help, it appears that Maddie is at the killer's mercy, but he may have underestimated his prey. As this horrifying game of cat and mouse escalates to a breathless fever pitch, Maddie must push herself beyond her mental and physical limits in order to survive the night.My introduction to the works of writer and director Mike Flanagan came about in April of 2014 when I saw his independent horror thriller Oculus in theaters. I had a blast with that film. It was clever, it was creative, it was intense, and it dripped with dread, tension, and atmosphere. With Flanagan's Before I Wake getting pushed back several times due to Relativity Media's filing for bankruptcy, Netflix picked up Hush (his second collaboration with Blumhouse after Oculus) and released it worldwide on April 8th. With Hush, Mike Flanagan has now fully proved himself to be one of the new masters of horror, right up there with James Wan, Ti West, and Alexandre Aja among others.If this and Oculus are any indication, Mike Flanagan is masterful at creating chilling atmosphere and building up nerve-wracking tension. Very unexpectedly so, the horror starts quite early into the film and both the tension and suspense never let up. The scares Flanagan and co-writer/lead star Kate Siegel (husband and wife in real life) create are genuine, not false. Whereas many other modern horror films rely on cheap jump scares, CGI overload, and characters making dumb decisions for the sake of the plot to shock and frighten, Hush takes its time in conceiving true scares. The intense violence also gets pretty brutal and gory as the film goes on, but in a way that's not over-the-top but instead helps serve a purpose to the story and add to it.One of the biggest pros and surprises in any modern horror film is good characters. Hush focuses on only two. Let's first focus on Siegel's lead protagonist, Maddie, who finds herself in a game of cat and mouse with the villain and has to rely on her keen wit in order to survive his wrath. Aside from conversations she stages with a speaking variant of herself in her head, Maddie doesn't speak a single line of dialogue in the film and she still manages to be one of the most likable, resourceful, and whip-smart horror protagonists in years. This is a very physical performance that must have be incredibly hard to pull off, but luckily, Siegel knocks it out of the park, delivering a terrific lead performance and I sincerely hope she gets more work after this. She is wonderful (not to mention, so gorgeous).But as the old saying goes, the hero is only as good as the villain. Hush definitely doesn't disappoint in this area. As the psychotic killer stalking Maddie, John Gallagher, Jr. works wonders in this role. He scared the ever-living hell out of me with his performance. His character is motiveless and yet that trait the character has works surprisingly incredibly well for the film. He starts off wearing a mask and is already very menacing, but when he takes the mask off, he manages to become even more so. Gallagher delivers one of the most intense performances of the year and after this and 10 Cloverfield Lane, I'm very much looking forward to seeing what he has under his belt next.Flanagan and Siegel's screenplay is very cleverly written, trying to ground the series of events happening in reality with good results. Is it entirely realistic? Admittedly, not really. There are some occasional bothersome lapses in logic and common sense, but for the most part, it's believable enough for me to take what's going on seriously. Fresh off of replicating James Wan &amp; John R. Leonetti's visual style of The Conjuring for its prequel/spin-off Annabelle, D.P. James Kniest teams with Flanagan here and his work here is breathtaking. This is a very good-looking film and Kniest's smooth camera-work and perfect lighting add to the tense atmosphere Flanagan creates alongside the fantastic musical score composed by the Newton Brothers.In summary, if you want to see a good example of how the horror genre hasn't lost all of its dignity just yet, you should definitely check this out if you have the chance. It is well worth your time. With beautifully written characters, terrific performances, atmospheric cinematography and direction, and wonderfully built up tension, Hush comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hush" is a stellar example of how to create intense thriller with simple premise. It starts with a small cast and modest runtime, but it capitalizes on every chance to instill any available tension. The deaf main protagonist presents exactly this kind of opportunity to exploit the already volatile situation into uniquely compelling sequences.Kate Siegel as the hearing impaired heroine is trapped on her own house by a stalker. This is not the typical slasher with random scrabbling or plate tossing. It's a meticulously drawn condition with grave danger on every step. This might give the movie slightly slow pace, but Kate Siegel performs admirably as the lead.She works by gestures nearly the entire time, the movie sets this up pretty well with opening intro of her interacting with her neighbor. There are clear signs of panic as she goes through the night and her survival odd dwindles. It's also a clever way to present the perimeter around the house without the protagonist being too conveniently saved or stupid for the sake of plot.With a shorter than average runtime, "Hush" gives out the very essence of thriller movie, it's enjoyably riveting with carefully crafted condition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For his third film (after the extraordinary Absentia and the brilliant Oculus), director Mike Flanagan decided to leave the supernatural subjects aside in order to focus on a more realistic, but not less terrifying because of that, story. The result is Hush, a fascinating horror movie with an excellent screenplay, good performances and perfect direction. Co-screenwriters Flanagan and Kate Siegel (who was also the main actress) built a solid fusion of character and suspense, dedicated to impulse the story with each scene. Before watching Hush, I felt some distrust because of its "domestic invasion" sub-genus, one of the horror formulas I find the most monotonous and tiring. Fortunately, Flanagan and Siegel distilled the basic components of it in order to eliminate any unnecessary element, transmitting the simple but powerful fear of the hunter and the prey... but without sacrificing the ingenuity of a logical and well planned story. On the negative side, some small details of the screenplay could have been better polished, but that's widely compensated by the many pros this movie has to offer. By the way, the "disabled woman tormented at her home" concept evoke memories of the classic film Wait Until Dark, but Hush is very different on tone and atmosphere... more violent and more emotional at the same time, something which is complemented by the brilliant performances from Siegel and John Gallagher Jr. And even though Hush displays a bit of blood in some scenes, the most important thing is the personal drama, and not the special effects. Flanagan has always handled that formula during his brief but distinguished filmography. And even though I keep thinking that Absentia is his best film so far, Hush deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation, because its combination of suspense, psychological dread and sporadic violence captures the elegant simplicity of the horror which doesn't need unnecessary complications or happy endings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I didn't expected a lot from this title and I ended up loving it! I'm a fan of home invasion movies, so I said... "okay, let's give this one a try, it's short, and I will probably end up liking it". I was right, but I couldn't believe how good this was! First, the movie starts as the average home invasion film, but with all the twists and turns gives this genre a new fresh view, with the main character being deaf and mute. The question that was going through my mind through the whole movie is how her disability made her situation 10 times harder. If you can't speak or hear, and if you're at a life or death situation in a place where you can't even be heard or seen, you're probably a goner, but Hush dares the viewers to root and see how a seemingly harmless lead quickly evolves to an amazing heroine. Kudos to Kate Siegel for playing such a strong lead without saying a single word, I even believed she was deaf-mute in real life. John Gallager Jr. does a great job as the killer, he accomplishes to be, well... hated by the viewer. The movie doesn't let you breathe (literally!), kicking off strong and staying like that until the very end. It might not be super believable or realistic, but the truth is that "Hush" is a roller-coaster that will stop your heart and make you scream at your TV, that you won't even mind. One of the best horror movies of the last few years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not to be negative, but this movie's not really worth reviewing. So, I'll try and get through this as quickly as possible.This is yet another home invasion movie with only two slight twists: Our victim is a deaf mute and there's only one attacker.Not to spoil anything and I understood why he didn't, but there is one simple solution from the bad guy throughout this middle-of-the-woods serial killer/stalker tale. Anyone that sees this will know right away what he should do, even if we're supposed to be rooting for the deaf mute writer woman. This was frustrating.Additionally cringing, the movie is shot mostly in the dark. Yea! Realism! But, it's hard to watch for the most part.That all said, the woman, Discount Julia Roberts, actually did some fairly good acting and I believed her throughout. The villain was not fleshed out, but acceptable.Worth watching for free on Amazon or Netflix on a night when nothing else is on. Wasn't the worst movie I've seen, not even in this subgenre, but it did feel like a chore to get through.***Final thoughts: Not sure why this was made. It brought extremely little to the table and the ideas that were good weren't expanded on enough. I hope, at least, this will give Discount Julia Roberts more exposure since she wasn't half bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Deft Approach To The Slasher Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If an original horror film can achieve any chance of standing out in the genre, it needs to be, well, original. A unique premise or story-telling device to hook genre fans and non alike in. Hush delivers the torment and endurance through the perspective of a deaf-mute but mars them in an entertaining if fairly underwhelming home invasion formula.Entirely competent best describes the success of Hush. The expectancy to be so intrigued by the heroine's condition as to be distracted from the uneventful generic narrative is barely there, however. Writer and director Mike Flannigan had the opportunity to milk the concept dry and yet barely scratches the surface of her plight. The inability to hear and speak seems abundant in horror potential and yet sound and visual design is sparingly directed around it.Compare the Haneke's direction in both Funny Games, the extended scenes of pure silence are profuse in tangible tension. There are the expected cat-and-mouse hide-and-seek games found here but none of them are memorably distinct from any other slasher. The rare moments of directorial flourish are welcome such when the struggling thriller writer visualizes her methods of escape but only contrast with the bare realism of the overall tone. This is even more disappointing when Flannigan's Oculus engaged the story from every angle that wonderfully played on the suspense-fueled curiosity.A couple of reviews 'warned' not to expect a story and hopes were expecting another minimalist raw experience similar to Funny Games. The truth of the warnings were more so not to expect a notable story to be found in such an interesting hook. There's just little engagement to be found in both cat and mouse.That's not to critique the few actors present, lead Siegel delivers a great performance that does invoke both sympathy for inherent vulnerability and excitement in eventual bravado in survival. Opposite her, Gallagher Jr. does his best with a progressively underwhelming antagonist. Given we learn nothing of his character, it seems needless for him to be so chatty and casual when the premise naturally invites the silent stalker archetype of Myers and Voorhees. The initial introduction is strong but the film's intention to humanize him present his sieges as pathetic and then uninteresting.Going in blind to Hush was a satisfying surprise, a tense and enjoyable ride. Unfortunately, I didn't really go in blind as I had just recently seen another home invasion horror with a crossbow wielding masked maniac which overshadows this in aesthetic and pacing tremendously. Now it does seem unfair to compare films like this when they should stand on their own merits and with that, give Hush a watch sometime. It's good... but just don't watch You're Next around the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Tension and Horror, but Repetitive at Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hush follows a deaf and mute woman whose home is invaded by a mysterious murderer who decides to hold off killing her just to mess with her head. The plot is pretty interesting. It's a simple idea, and it tends to work. It's one of those movie that takes place completely in one place, specifically the woman's house. The horror aspect of it is really good at the beginning and end, but the middle is just okay. At first it was really creepy, especially because we had no idea who the murderer was due to his creepy mask. Unfortunately, he only wears it for the first fifteen-ish minutes, so throughout the rest of the movie he just wasn't nearly as creepy. The events that were used to build tension at first were good, but they got repetitive. There was one particular thing that was used about three times in the movie, and by the second or third time it was already wearing out it's welcome. It did switch it up at the end, so naturally it picked up, especially with the climax. The characters are pretty good. I didn't think that they were horribly stupid people either, especially the main female. In fact, I'd say that she was actually pretty smart. She thought of solutions that not even I had thought of. The murderer, on the other hand, could be a little inconsistent. He knew to do some things, yet time and time again he ran right into somewhat distractions the main character created for him. Otherwise, with the small cast it had I think that they were well-developed enough. Overall Hush is a solid horror movie. It's pretty suspenseful with some good characters, but it fails to provide new ways of scaring the audience around the halfway point, but it doesn't stay that way. In the end I would recommend this movie.</fullReview>

The character wasn't written poorly I don't think, rather she was made deaf simply to have a deaf protagonist because the movie would be more unoriginal than it already is without it. There are moments in this movie when the audio goes silent to emulate being in her shoes. This doesn't make me feel anything towards the character because I already know she's deaf and I definitely don't need to be reminded that she's deaf seeing as how the premise of the film is that she's deaf. You kind of don't care about her because the literally the only thing that you know about her is that she had meningitis which made her a deaf mute. I guess I'm insensitive for not caring what happens to her, but when writing a character I don't think the best way to sway your audience to feel bad for them is to give them an illness and basically scream in your face, "Look how vulnerable she is! Feel bad for the girl because she got sick when she was young! As you can see this makes such a huge difference in what happens in this film, but not really because we're really bad writers!". There's also a male character named Craig who isn't really explained other than a possible love interest, but it never goes anywhere. Her neighbor is killed off almost as soon as she's introduced. I feel as if having a character introduced just to kill them is absolutely pointless. The idea that she's in danger could have been conveyed in so many other ways rather than just having a character be created to be killed in front of her damn face without her seeing it. Using face time as a horror trope in movies past the year of 2012 is becoming extremely dry and old. We literally had an entire movie based on face time (yes I'm talking about Unfriended) and we all know how that movie turned out. The direction of this movie could have been done so well, but every single shot is on her computer or just basic boring shots of the characters. It seems to be very convenient that her phone was sitting on the counter for the villain to take, and also very convenient that the villain knew that she was going to call the police on her computer. For some reason, this woman does the absolute most ridiculous things to try to get the villain to leave like telling him that her boyfriend is coming home with lipstick on her glass door. The villain takes his mask off and this not only destroyed the small amount of creepiness he had going for him but also is the worst possible decision from his perspective. Why would he show his face when she said her boyfriend was coming home? He's just going to play around with her and only half attempt to murder this woman for the next 55 minutes so why even risk having his face shown if there's a chance her boyfriend would come home and see his face. What if he doesn't end up killing her? He'd get caught because she saw his face. I guess it just means that he HAS to get away with it now. Why bother with making sense when you can just make literally no sense at all. I guess everyone in this universe is just really really stupid. This movie is a contrived mess and proves that just because the main character has a disability doesn't mean that it's fresh or original in any sense. The same thing happened in that new Chucky movie and that was just as bad if not worse. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great idea that unfortunately fell short of what I expected. Both lead characters are made to purposefully fall short in their ability to outsmart one another by simply being mediocre at being the killer and the obvious survivor. So you're not so much glued in anticipation to the outcome, but more so find yourself waiting for the inevitable. The film loses its ability to scare you as the killer reveals himself too early, and when he does his face lessens what was already a non threatening mask. I didn't see any twists or turns and nothing made me feel surprised or shocked. Which was a shame as I felt the core of this movie was a fantastic idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main character is deaf, so it seems that they wrote this in to the film to make it different - but it doesn't. You have to know someone that is actually deaf/mute to realize that this story-line is by no way believable in the least.I won't put any spoilers, but every other chiller, thriller, horror film has made it into this film. Seems even viral video things have made it into this film. The scene setup, camera angles, lighting, ridiculous sound effects, everything has been done a million times in other movies.You have to ask why bad films/scripts keep getting the funding when there are so many good writers here in Southern California looking for that backing yet have a hard time getting it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has an intriguing idea and the acting by Kate Siegel is great. However, this doesn't save it from the typical Genre clichés and bad writing. Needless to say some of the most obvious movie flaws ever made. Here is one example:We see Maddie trying to load a crossbow several times during the movie, but she is just too weak and we see her fail multiple times. But then - all of a sudden - the crossbow is loaded and she is able to shoot it. And of course she hits the killer from a fair distant. And no, she is no crossbow expert and from what the movie is telling us, Maddie has never shot a weapon in her whole life before. Come on, this is just lazy writing!All in all, this movie is just your typical, hide-and-seek, cabin- in-the-woods, serial-killer movie with the exception that our heroine is deaf and can't speak.It is not worth it. Luckily, it's quite a short movie. I only rated it five stars because of Kate Siegel's great acting. I hope she gets to star in better movies in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hush (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Flanagan is a director to keep his eye on, especially with the long-delayed Before I Wake. His knack for taking familiar horror tropes and adding a little twist to them has allowed him to make some of the best psychological horror films of the past few years in Oculus, Absentia and now Hush. Hush takes the ever-popular home invasion trope and adds an interesting surprise to the plot: the main character is deaf. This makes for some incredibly intense sequences where someone who can hear could easily get out of the situation, and she has to rely only her sight and touch to survive the night. Even if the home invasion plot doesn't offer much new, there are some incredibly original sequences that arise due to her disability. Also, the intruder cut the lights to the house, so she can hardly use her eyesight to help her anyway. The deaf woman, Maddie, is an author, so she has to come up with several different endings to her books and decide on the right one. She does this several times in the movie when trying to figure out how to get out alive including one part that provides one of the best shocks in the movie. Mike Flanagan creates a home invasion thriller that distinguishes itself from the pack by being both original and brutally effective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the result of a bout of meningitis at the age of 13, author Maddie (Kate Siegel) is now unable to hear or speak. One evening, while struggling to write the ending to her latest book, she comes face-to-face with a psychopath (John Gallagher Jr.) armed with a knife and crossbow?I have to question the wisdom of an attractive deaf and mute woman opting to live alone in an isolated house in the middle of the woods without any form of self-protection: doing so makes her dumb in more ways than one. She's not alone in her idiocy, though, because the men in this film make equally bad decisions?choices that prove very costly indeed. The attacker frequently allows opportunities for his victims to gain the upper hand, despite supposedly being experienced at the killing game, while neighbour John (Michael Trucco), who comes looking for his missing girlfriend Sarah (Samantha Sloyan), clearly possesses the IQ of a potato: he actually believes that the bad guy is a cop, despite him looking more like a textbook criminal than a lawman (unshaven, wearing a hoodie and sporting a neck tattoo).Although directed with style by Mike Flanagan (Absentia, Oculus), and well acted by its limited cast, Hush is still plot-hole ridden, derivative dreck that delivers very little in the way of innovation, save for a single scene where Maddie uses her analytical writer's mind to run through the potential scenarios and come up with a plan. She opts to fight, which leads to the inevitable bloody showdown that, once again, offers nothing new to the home invasion genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely not a horror movie. If you're expecting serial killer torture porn, this ain't it. Very old school thriller genre. There's very little gore.It's pretty simple premise, the deaf mute aspect of it isn't used in any cliché way it merely adds to the perspective. In a weird way it sort of forces you into her shoes since there's almost no dialog everything is told through sound and cinematography. From a vocal perspective the tables are turned in that the killer does most of the talking, because he's fascinated by this woman who becomes his prey by mere happenstance but in fact she proves herself far more capable than you'd expect. If I could think of a movie that this most reminds me of it would be some combination of "The Collector" and "Panic room". I really can't think of anything to complain about. On a side note whoever came up with that credits theme. Wow after such an exhausting experience that was perfect just perfect.</fullReview>

Do they expect us to believe she didn't have a house alarm? Also, when she ran outside and tried to get away, that was crazy because she couldn't hear his foot steps which was obvious of course.. She ended up running back in the house because he was standing right there. The friends boyfriend gave all her personal information to a stranger. The guy didn't even look like a cop. Where was the cop car? Why couldn't he use his walkie talkie like all police have. He claimed someone called the cops and that is why he was there. How did he get there?It was so many questions.

		<fullReview>So this movie was on netflix. It's gotten quite the buzz, so I decided to give up some of my precious time to watch this. Not only is this a movie that makes you wish you could get that time back, but it is a movie that I can't understand as to why it's even worth your time in the first place. I almost passed out from this movie, and that's a rare occurrence for me. Now I'm not saying this is something that everyone will experience, or that it's the worst movie in existence. I wouldn't even consider this a movie to get mad about, but it is not something I would recommend. It seems like most critics like this movie because it's from the same director of oculus? Another critically acclaimed horror movie. I don't know. Try to fill me in. I bet many of you are rolling your eyes at me thinking to yourselves, "can you make a point already? Maybe explain the plot a little bit before we can buy into your opinion?" Well I'm gonna do that right now.*SPOILERS* So the movie reveals around this deaf girl. She can't hear anything, and unfortunately that is basically all her character is. Even when she got hurt she didn't scream or anything. Personally, that seemed really awkward as even deaf people can talk and make sound from their vocal cords even if they have never spoken a word in their live. The only other character to her character is that shes a writer who is looking for an idea after her first book is apparently the an amazing mystery novel. Now from that I can already think Ethan Hawkes character in sinister, and I'm already pulled out of the movie. There's a point in the movie where she calls her friend twice, and purposely hangs up on him, then when he calls, she decides not to do anything... it was just pointless and had absolutely no reason to be there. Then a guy in a mask kills the deaf main characters friend, but it was only meant for us to see it and not the deaf girl, because the deaf girl can't hear anything. It had absolutely no substance to it, and how was I even suppose to be expected to care. ANYWAYS. So later after the killer tries to get in, which he succeeds a few times by the way, we then get to the entire f**ing movie. "I'm trying to get in to murder you, but I can't because I was to slow. Oh well. I better go in another way, or to wait till she can open another entrance." I will admit it's OK maybe 2 times, but this movie cannot resist beating the dead horse a little more. The final so I guess at the end of the movie, the girl died after killing the bad guy? I wasn't quite sure, because I was falling asleep. If that's what happened, it's really shows that this movie has no substance. All I can remember is she stabbed the guy in the throat, called 911, and started falling asleep on the floor or something. I don't know. This movie has nothing in it that I like, or could possibly enjoy.Sorry to anyone who actually likes this movie, but I could not find a way to actually see why it was worth my time. In someways, I want it back. This movie has no substance to it, and I can't enjoy it because of that reason. This movie wants you to just give everything a pass. "Just don't think about it." A term I've heard way to often. Well if you're like me, your disagree with that statement entirely. Most movies are better the less you think about them. I'm sick and tired of having to sit threw movies like this where my brain cannot turn off because of how unoriginal and uninspired these movies are. Now I'm finished with my little ramble about a dumb movie with lack of substance. I can hope I have made my point a little clear that this movie is just bland and mediocre in my eyes. I'm not saying don't enjoy it, I'm saying I did not. That's that. 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about a home invasion. The main character is deaf and has to deal with an idiot intruder who has zero motive. She runs around aimlessly while he tries to get in. Although he has no problem randomly murdering people and trashing the main characters car, for some reason he refuses to break any windows, doors, or force entry at the household. He paces around outside for most of the movie.I have no idea why a deaf woman who is single would live in an isolated area alone, and not even lock her doors at night. Also if you are living in isolation in a forest you would have at least some weapon or alarm system with police notification and emergency power system. ESPECIALLY if you were deaf!!Upon realizing he has violent intentions she...instead of arming herself, grabs her lipstick and writes him notes on the window about her non existent boyfriend to try and scare the intruder.To sum it up this movie was filled with plot holes and lacked substance. There were tons of useless scenes that did not contribute to the plot at all. If you manage to sit through the whole thing you will come to realize that no plot ever does develop and no aspect of the movie was explained beyond the basic premise.2 out of ten, I bumped the rating from one since the movie had a short runtime. Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had very low expectations going in; the movie looked and sounded like typical genre fare but it proved me wrong by being a bit different. The characters were very well realized, for the most part, and the plot moved along well without seeming too contrived. I didn't find it scary or even particularly suspenseful, but it intrigued me from the get go.Apparently the story was written by a married couple who team up for movie making, and it was neat to discover that. Indeed, similar to Oculus (an earlier Flanagan/Siegel project), dull predictability took a vacation and was replaced with something truly unique. I can only guess that as the team continue improving, their films will grow into something special.While I would not call it a masterpiece by any means, I do consider it a cut above similar titles I've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I see this Maddie, I'm thinking she's begging to be killed living in an isolated house all by herself, and with no hearing. A normal person would live with other people, or get a dog, or get a gun, or hang some mirrors around (to reduce blind spots).When she tried to cock a crossbow but didn't have the strength to do so, her solution is to keep trying. A normal person would look for other solutions instead of repeating what didn't work.And when she was shot with a crossbow bolt, the first thing she does is pull out the bolt and bleed. Hmm.It'd be a more refreshing and surprising ending if the victim actually gets killed because of her stupidity.In horror movies, people always appear more dumb. Why is that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After very weak character development this movie becomes tense and interesting playing well off the concept of the protagonist's disability. Until, of course, ten or so minutes after the killer is introduced the movie completely forgets the deaf gimmick that makes it interesting in the first place.The first few minutes of the killer stalking are the best moments in the movie then it takes dive after dive in quality making you wonder when it's going to end so you can move on with your life. Luckily the movie is short and has a treat to reward you for your time in the moments before the final confrontation between the protagonist and killer.Even with the short run time this movie suffered from it's length, stumbling around to find the next thing to throw into the conflict to connect the beginning and ending. It would have been much better with only 40-50 minutes cutting down on some of the boring cat and mouse scenes which would allow them to write the characters as clever or at least not stupid. Removing the unnecessary additions to the story that play no role except to extend the play time would greatly enhance it as well.If you have an hour and a half to kill and want to be entertained for at least half of that time, then this movie is a good choice if you're a fan of thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Plot, Questionable Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason I really wanted to watch this film was the plot of it. Deaf mute woman is threatened, pursued and attacked by a crazy guy in an isolated cabin (my personal favorite in the house-invasion genre.) I had high hopes for the film and Flanagan's execution of it. I didn't much like Oculus but I was sure the plot alone would suffice and compensate for any shortcomings this movie may possess. I was wrong.Hush begins with an introduction to the protagonist, Maddie, a deaf mute writer. We are immediately assaulted with a barrage of evidence that Maddie is in a "complicated relationship" with some dude named Craig. We then come to know that her friend worries about her due to her isolated existence (the reasons for which are never truly explained.) While Maddie writes her novel, a man breaks into her house, steals her phone and stands around for long enough to hear half the conversation she has with said concerned friend on Facetime. He then walks out as if he owns the damn place. The panic begins soon after in the form of initial menacing images of Maddie in her lounge sent to her laptop by her stolen phone. Terror ensues. My main problem with this movie is just that; the man waltzes into her house, walks around, steals her phone and listens to her conversation with her friend? Like, damn, I know she's deaf but IS HE ALSO INVISIBLE? There are several scenes like that where the world is falling apart around our protagonist without her taking even the slightest bit of notice. One could argue that since she lost her ability to hear at the age of 13 instead of it being a birth defect, the fact that she doesn't notice a man standing literally 10 feet behind her is justifiable. But even so, for the sake of the movie, there is an immense number of cool things they could have done with her sensory defect. They could have used it to her advantage, shown how she gets the upper hand on the killer because of this problem or is just generally more aware with her other senses (vision, touch, olfactory even) and uses this to her advantage, the one thing the killer never sees coming. Instead the hearing loss is used to make her seem downright stupid in some scenes. Take a page from Al Pacino from Scent of a Woman, why don't you?The characters and the things they did made me yell. "Pick up that knife!" "Don't go outside!" "Turn the power back on somehow!" "Pick up that DAMN KNIFE!" There were a good many situations in which Maddie could have stabbed her killer. I counted at least 2. Furthermore, in the beginning of the movie, she tells the intruder that her boyfriend is coming. But that's never really the case in home invasion films, is it? (Jennifer Hills, anyone?) How interesting would it be if instead of relying on things the audience has seen a billion times before, the boyfriend actually did show up and affected the plot somehow? Despite this, it kept me watching and even though I was annoyed, I was eager to see how it would all turn out in the end. The finale is intense and gory. For a second, the audience really doesn't know which direction the ending might go. The issue I have with Hush is that it relies heavily on slasher film clichés. Single female, masked madman, best friend's murder, no phone/power, general stupidity of its characters, a lot of hiding and running. The one original thing the filmmakers had to offer, they forgot to utilize it to it's fullest extent. Hell, I even forgot she's deaf in some scenes! It seems more like a random fact than anything which may affect the plot of the film. Much like Oculus, the film had an interesting premise but the filmmakers had no idea what to do with it. It could have went so many ways but instead it chose to become a poorly executed mess of a slasher film lacking depth, substance or originality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, you're probably going to think this, "oh great, not the other deaf person bashing on this movie that isn't acted by a authentic Deaf person."Wrong. Normally, I LOATHE scary movies. But when this movie started showing up on my news feed on Facebook. It piped my curiosity because this movie have created a lot of heated discussion and frustration among the Deaf Community. They did not like how you guys hired the Hearing person as a Deaf character and there were misarticulation with several signs and so on. So I watched the Hush to see it for myself.I am impressed with how the story flows and there were defining moment in movie. I enjoyed it very much. I really liked how it was set up and how it ends. But why a man killed Sarah then decided to play game with a Deaf woman? Was he simply bored? Was he a serial killer? There has to be more to story about him because what was he doing in wood in first place. I know he has killed others but WHY he was there? I would really like to see more of his story.Now on to a Deaf lady. She became Deaf at age of 12 or something so that is understandable. But that doesn't matter to Deaf community because they will always bash on you guys until you find a Deaf actor to their fitting. You will have to understand from their perspective. But me? I think its because you have not be exposed to our culture. Everybody learns. And plus, it was only a small budget film that isn't showed in theaters. How could you be able to hire somebody that is Deaf when you don't even know where to start or find one? There were quite bit of exaggeration on being Deaf. Like reading the lips through window? Hell no, I will be too scared to even understand the killer no matter how good I am at lip reading. Feeling the air that killer spoke at end? HAHA, I think that it is going too far because we aren't superhuman. Like feeling vibration of man's footsteps is pretty good but okay... We all have to come up a way with what makes story good no matter how exaggerated it is because that's a movie. You did that. Good work on bringing movie to Netflix. Just keep in mind, you will not be able to please everybody but be open-minded to other people's opinion especially us, the Deaf Community.</fullReview>

It is the usual fare of 'the survival fight', but it does have some nuances that elevate it - I wont tell you what! The protagonist and antagonist are quite deliciously - whatever they need to be - evil, tough, stupid, etc..There were some obvious plot points that might irritate you if you try to make everything too realistic, but hey! this is a movie, so go ahead and enjoy it. That being said, there are some very very real moments too...! the movie does fall for some familiar tropes in the genre, but i was able to forgive them that. You will find yourself yelling at the main actor to do this or that; what more do you want! :) It is a film that will involve and engage you, but you have to let it.

		<fullReview>For some reason on IMDb, horror movies get a lot of hate and tend to be rated lower for whatever reason. This movie deserves at least a 7 average to be fair. It was truly a scary movie, however it was more suspense throughout than horror. The suspense was maintained constantly until the end of the movie, and the ending was really fantastic, job well done. It didn't become too silly or ridiculous like some people are saying, it was actually very reasonable and believable, not the type where you yell at the TV throughout; "you stupid person!" The only downside was that the movie was too dark at times to see anything, so at some points it was difficult to discern what was going on, but other than that it was wonderful!

		<shortDescription>Not Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This title is neither as grand or as terrible as the other reviews have stated. This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, though it certainly isn't the best either. It is true, there is no grand deeper plot than what is directly laid in front of you- a man messing with the woman in the house with plans to murder her. However, I don't see a need for any more info than that. I find it more chilling that the two main characters have no connection to each other whatsoever. It is a basic film, and the acting leaves a little to be desired, however, it's not a totally un-watchable film. The plot was enough to understand the situation, there just wasn't much more too it than that. It is definitely worth it if you're just looking for a short thriller that you don't have to give too much attention to, but will probably be disappointing if you're looking for something that you can totally and completely submerge yourself into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real piece of crap. How has this got a rating of 6.7?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The killer who is in the house already once and steals the phone decides to leave the house to send pictures and then stays outside until he is seen and then gets locked out. Now it seems he can smash a car window made of tempered glass but does not seem bright enough to break the house windows to gain access. The male neighbour who see's the writing on the door glass but seems clueless and puts his hands up because a stranger with no uniform or gun dressed in a hoodie shines a flashlight at him. No attempt to even make it realistic in any way. The woman keeps thinking about leaving the house but because the killer makes no attempt to break in she is safer to stay put and wait him out. So the whole movie is just totally implausible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is solid. For the genre, the sub-genre,.. Solid!For me, it's not about what it got right, it's what it didn't get wrong. The film didn't try to pack in a non-sensical twist. It didn't feel the need to treat the audience like 1-yr-olds, and spoon feed us back-stories, flashbacks, or too many characters. It's just a simple horror movie done well. Is it great? Maybe not. Perfect? Of course not. There's a couple of late scenes that don't work as well as the first hour, but they're not glaringly bad by any means. The only scene that I think could have been redone is when he enters the house.BUT, for the most part, this is simplistic yet shockingly effective horror. The right amount of gore.. Solid last hour scare factor.. Not trying to do too much.. Only 1 or 2 arguably unrealistic moments with literally hundreds of opportunities to do so. Solid performances from all involved. This could stay on the 2016 top-25 for quite a while, while I catch- up on '16. It MAY even hold a spot come next spring when I polish up the watchlist of near 100films like I do every year. Watched "We Are Still Here", a slightly above average, albeit scary horror film late last night. This was clearly better, and perhaps the best horror film I've watched since the Babadook. Kudo's to all involved - Especially the two leads. They really up'd the believability and scare factor with their strong performances, and the direction wasn't incompetent either. This might be worth owning. 72/100 You might like this if you liked:Eden Lake(a tad better or near even), or You're Next(not as good as this).I've read about everything negative on the home page board and the reviews and there's a common theme -nitpicking! From 'they should have made the whole film silent(yeah that woulda worked) to he shouldn't have removed his mask so early.. Get over it.. Nobody is offering up any better, also lesser known(or heck, mainstream as it gets)options either. Solid, horror, flick. . . Don't let the nitpickers scare you away from watching this scary movie. The film really uses the disability thing to its' advantage, and the slasher's back-story is just vague enough to leave some doors open for our own interpretation.Another reviewer calling the positive reviews fake - HUH!?!? I've been here 8 years bud. It's my 341rst review. This film is the polar opposite of "the Cabin in the Woods". It's not original, it's not funny, and it didn't do crap at the box office. BUT, it'll settle- out around the same IMDb score(7.0ish), and I actually much prefer this. There goes the useful %, so be it.Let me use the "Frantic" argument here - just because it doesn't feel the need to spoon-feed you information - Does Not make them plot-holes... Geesh. These detractors also missed some of the intricacies of the film. His statement that hinted at his motive, the moments of silence in the set-up, etc, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Deafening Silence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Are you tired of watching Horror movies where you have to sit through 90 minutes of ear bleeding screams from the mouths of the innocent? Then Hush is the home invasion horror for you. The film follows Maddie, a woman who became both deaf and mute at age 13 due to meningitis and crappy surgery for it, and that's all found out from the back cover of her own book she has written. She then fights for her life against a psychopathic killer who may or may not be a fan of AMC's The Walking Dead.The use of foreshadowing is great, from the smoke alarm to the alternative endings of Maddie's novels. Although obvious due to the majority of the films 15 minutes of dialogue being spent talking about the two, they are linked into the plot really well, especially the multiple endings. From the moment the multiple novel endings were mentioned I kept asking myself; "how many endings will this film have and which one will they go with?" The film had me hooked from the start to see the film through to the end.The films unique quality of Maddie's Disabilities made way for some greatly intense opportunities throughout the film. This quality gave the film a new avenue to take in order to frighten the audience and it took it. The tension of many scenes of the film are built around dramatic irony. The film is a horrific pantomime as you play a game of musical chairs with the edge of your seat through this noiseless nightmare.The two leads where great. Kate Siegel brought the emotion and brilliant physical acting in her non speaking role, while John Gallaghar Jr finally gets his moment to shine which he didn't quite get in 10 Clover field Lane. John Gallaghar Jr was fantastic as the psychopathic killer whose motive is never explained pulling off deranged and psychotic superbly well. These performances are important in keeping you interested and involved and are very much a well kept cog helping this machine work like clockwork.Mike Flanagan's Direction was grand and the films script is so simple but is also much more than a simple home invasion horror movie. The two coupled (pun intended) create a truly unique take on a done before sub genre. The high concept story is extremely easy to follow and the direction is perfect in creating tension and fear in those who behold this vision.I didn't really have many issues with this film. There is the matter of the obvious product placement. The start of this film feels more like a 20 minute Apple IPhone and IMac commercial due to the constant use of said products until John Gallaghar Jr has enough and starts nabbing them for himself. Also there really was no point in Maddie's ex which is literally forgotten about in the course of the film, but to be honest it was probably for the best. Also there is probably an explanation for this as there has been discussion about it, but I have no idea what the significance of the crossbows tallies are and the way in which it was done still baffles me but I am sure that in the magical world of the internet there is a perfectly good and well analysed explanation for this visual enigma code.Overall Hush the Netflix horror film is a good scare. The film is simple but effective, creating a gimmick and successfully utilising it to full effect. The film will have you on the edge of your seat warning the films protagonist as you talk or scream at the TV "HE'S BEHIND YOU!!!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's With The Hate?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look, I get it. Horror movies have been on a decline for a while now. Mainstream horror movies maybe get one jump out of me and a small squeal, but not much more (even the ones that have an R rating), because it's more about "shock" - using sounds and abrupt flashes of characters. But "Hush" wasn't all that bad. It didn't need to make you jump out of your chair to feel something. Yes, there are plot holes. Maddie (the main character) could have easily used the arrow without the crossbow. She also should've stabbed the killer with her knife, and picked up his knife so that he didn't have any weapons. But this a quick movie, at just over an hour. If you're looking to pee you pants, this isn't the movie for you. But if you're looking for a "short story" version of a movie that doesn't tangle you up with complex characters or unnecessary backstory - this movie will pass the time. Suspenseful and not too ridiculous. Could it have been better? Yes. But for just over an hour, don't expect flashy or complex.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Talk about a ride. Without giving anything away that you can't read in the blurb up top, she's a deaf woman being stalked by a psychotic man hellbent on terrorizing her and killing her. What gives this movie a fresh new spin is that she's deaf and there is very little dialogue in this movie. Though, until it's over you hardly notice because you are so on the edge of your seat through every moment that it's going on.You cannot help but place yourself in her shoes and imagine what you would do if you were being stalked in the middle of nowhere with no communication AND couldn't hear. There are some truly terrifying parts where even as a grown man I wanted to just close my eyes and not even look, because at some point, I needed to go to bed and didn't think I'd be able to after watching this movie.My recommendation would be one of two things, either watch it all by yourself in the dark or with a group of people who won't talk during the movie. I really feel like it would take you out of the experience to have side chatter during a thrilling game of cat and mouse as this is. Very well done. Horror/Thrillers don't get any better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing premise, terrible execution:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the trailers for this film I was excited to see it with my sister, who is new to the horror genre, expecting to give her and perhaps myself a fright, however, I was in for a different kind of shock. The premise here is incredible, a deaf writer alone in her house in the woods and a masked serial killer, unfortunately, the director hasn't taken advantage of this at all. The first ten minutes of the film and perhaps even the scene in which the protagonist's friend is stabbed to death are fine, but afterwards the film pretty much falls apart. In a horror film where a mysterious masked serial killer is the antagonist, you do NOT unmask the killer 5 minutes after he has been revealed ... I'm not sure what possessed the director to make this decision, but said serial killer also has a completely unimposing and unintimidating look and feel about him, to such an extent that I honestly believe the protagonist could have defeated him in a fist fight. The killer should have kept his mask on throughout the film, I thought this was obvious, but apparently not ... As well as this, I do highly question the mental capacity of both the protagonist and her friend's boyfriend who appears later in the film, realises who the killer is, and doesn't act. Although horror films do require some unrealistic decisions to be made, the extent to which the protagonist fails to do anything to aid herself in this film is appalling. Aside from that, I do have a list of improvements, some quite radical, which I believe would have made this a much better film: - All camera shots are filmed from inside the house to create a claustrophobic atmosphere. - The film is fully silent apart from a few sounds such as the protagonist's heartbeat in tense moments, the sound of the antagonist's crossbow firing and hitting targets, and the voices in the protagonist's head, but only at one point. - Near the end when the writer is sat down thinking through all possibilities, she imagines another version of herself in her mind talking her through everything, I think this scene should have been done differently, no visual representation but just a voice, a whispering voice. As the protagonist panics more and more, additional voices join in to her thinking and overlap to create a typhoon of inaudible hysteria. - The antagonist shouldn't be formally introduced until much later in the film, say ... 30 minutes in. Before this point the protagonist should continue going about her normal routines, but the killer should appear in the background, discreetly in the corner of the camera shot so that the audience notices him but the protagonist does not. - A tragic ending, in which the writer is brutally murdered, this is perhaps the most radical reform I've proposed, but to me, a happy ending is not befitting of a horror movie, at the end the killer should find the writer and kill her slowly, perhaps in a similar way to the way her friend was killed, but only one stabbing motion which penetrates deep into her abdomen. That would really crush our souls, and as a horror movie ... it would fulfill its purpose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why not make a horror film about a deaf girl that gets harassed by a complete stranger, only out to mess with her. There's the story in Hush. It actually is quite an interesting idea with a rethinking perspective but unfortunately it quickly destroys that and becomes boring. So, a deaf female author has moved out into the woods to live her life secluded from the rest of the world. She doesn't seem interested in dating and prefers to be alone. Suddenly a psychotic man armed with a crossbow arrives and starts to harass her. The director Mike Flanagan has a certain love for horror films and has directed a couple of them before.This type of film is actually usually pretty monotone and not very developing. But what other films do better than this one, is to at least tell us why things happen. A total stranger with a crossbow shows up, looking to kill and harass and we have absolutely no idea why. The deaf girl is established in an OK way. We get that she lives there. She Skypes with her friends and then rejects them to spend the night alone. But we barely know anymore than that.The thing that Hush does well is to use the fact that she is deaf. Computers, phones and alarms comes in handy because she can't hear a sound. That of course also results in a lot of scenes where he easily can surprise her and sneak up behind her. PRetty exciting. But if you remove all that then there's not much left to take with you besides a poor deaf girl in the forest. Couldn't they have tied the perpetrator in some way to the girl? Perhaps director Flanagan wants to show some sort of horror scenario for people living in the woods. You are never safe. Unfortunately I don't think that is the case here. I think he just wanted to make a horror film about a poor deaf girl. Could have been much better.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se</fullReview>

Neither have I been so attached to a character in a long time and was legitimately scared for her. Truthfully, a lot of what happened was just lucky but it was still an amazing experience and an incredible movie to watch. It's way more realistic than most horror movies as it's not based on the supernatural, which only made it better in my opinion.

Of coarse he has to wear the obligatory silly mask and despite killing others with no thought , he wants to play a game with this woman instead of just bumping her off. It's your typical Friday the 13th type psycho Slasher and nothing more. It's not terrible but it's not a film that will stay with you for too long either.

		<fullReview>There were two main glaring issues I had with this movie. The first and more important was the killer's motive. This should have been very easy, but instead he took his time for no reason at all. He had no problem killing her friends, so what was he thinking? Oooohhh a deaf chick don't see these too often better savor the moment... I mean really? The second and this could just be me but why on Earth would someone with that disability want to live all by her self in the secluded woods, it is like you are asking for something bad to happen to you.Besides those two issues what I found troubling was that there was little suspense throughout the movie. She was relatively "safe" inside her house for the time being to come up with a plan, while he just circled the house for I don't know how long. She just made it her mission to leave the house and get attacked.The one and only bright spot I give this movie is the acting as I feel both main actors did a very good job at bringing their characters to life.Out of a score of ten, I would rate it a 4 given that it does some things well but is nowhere near a great horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It sucks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is gonna be a long one, so hang tight. Right off the bat this movie sucks. It's so awful. It's literally the concept of The Strangers with a deaf person plastered onto it to make it seem unique, and best part yet? They went out of their way to avoid actually hiring a deaf actress/adviser or research anything about what it's like to be in the deaf community (outside of sign language or "vibrations"). I can write a freaking novel on all the issues that I have with this film, but I'll keep it short. And, let me point out, I've never gone out of my way to write a bad review for anything. 1) It lacks plot and depth, and the depth that is provided the writers couldn't even stick to. The whole "unique" idea to this girl is that she is deaf, yet capable of living on her own. It's pointed out in the beginning of the film that she can respond to vibrations, yet upon being right next to her friend screaming and banging on a door she doesn't react to those vibrations. HOWEVER, she does respond to vibrations created from tapping on a window. And, don't even get me started on the countless scenes wasted talking about her ex Craig, as if he was going to play a pivotal role in this film at all. 2) The countless upon countless times this broad could have been murdered. The killer's intent was to toy with her....yet all he did was one thing. The rest of it was him pacing for 80 minutes and then getting hurt. If this was in any way realistic she would have died at least twenty times, especially given the numerous idiotic ways she tried to escaped or especially the end. If she had AT LEAST died in the end I probably wouldn't even care. Oh, yeah you're already on the verge of bleeding out to death (the director clearly chose to point this out by her vision blurring and her appearing drowsy) but you got enough energy to stab a dude ONCE and then hobble off and then fight him again and then get choked out....but still survive? What, we gonna chop this up to adrenaline? Nah, and I'm only naming one real scene that had blatant evidence that this movie sucks, you'll encounter a lot more before you even get remotely close to this part. All in all, it's gratuitous to say that this movie is anything more than a waste of time.</fullReview>

This one was just worse because I didn't get the pleasure of seeing the main character die at the end. Other than that the acting was fine, but that doesn't save this movie one bit from being a bland story with no really "Thriller" moments that kept me on my feet.

		<fullReview>Hush is a "horror" movie that leans on the fact that the main character is deaf. This could have been great, if done properly. There is a scene at the outset with Maddie cooking, and it removes all the sound at point, putting us in her shoes as a deaf person. Pretty cool. Unfortunately, that is the best moment in the entire movie.Normally, when someone describes a movie as "dark", I assume they're referring to controversial subject matter. In this movie, being "dark" is quite literal, with large swaths of footage impossible to see.Some people get stabbed, beaten, etc., but it's hard to figure out who died because the movie was apparently shot in the photo development lab of a Walgreens.Acting is pretty sub par here, and the killer has all the dangerous charisma of a head of iceberg lettuce. It's never good when a horror movie has you on your hands and knees 20 minutes in saying "Just break the window and kill her already!"</fullReview>

Something similar has been done in a 70's thriller and as far as I remember it was utilized better into that movie than with this one.This was an indie thriller suffering from a bad script or poor execution of it,it had some good elements in the beginning but as a whole fell flat.Normally would give it a 3 or 4 but because of the overrating going with 1.You can check it out,but...I don't recommend it.

		<shortDescription>....basically "Vacancy" sans quality storytelling/plot....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all honesty this movie deserves a 5/10 for effort, 3/10 for the actual movie.1) This premise has been done to death, and in much more effective ways. At certain times the antagonist seems like he forgot the cameras were rolling and just stood there with a blank, bovine expression on his face, pretty indifferent. That mask he was wearing was similar to the one in "Vacancy" but IMHO looked a bit out of place, not frightening in the least.2) Very slow paced, even when it picks up. While the initial scenes make us anticipate a truly scary experience, it never arrives. Absolutely no explanation as to who the antagonist is or his motivations for stalking/attempting to murder the protagonist.In the movie "Vacancy" the audience is almost immediately informed as to why this is happening, hence there is considerably more sympathy and attachment to the characters than in this movie.3) They could have done with a well placed music score to set the mood, the camera work is actually quite good, but that's it. 4) All things considered, if there is absolutely nothing else to watch, check it out, if you want a quality movie of a similar nature, albeit done in a much better way, check out "Vacancy".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>kate seigel is the bomb. there are a few goofs; she's supposed to be deaf and mute, but there are some very subtle articulations that made it through editing. nothing that threatens suspension of disbelief too much, and does not detract from the suspense. this does not give anything away particularly but the killer's mask is only too creepy, far scarier than any menacing clown or hockey mask could ever be. there are unexpected turns of events.good casting, great performances, extremely well edited considering the near absence of dialogue--the pace and timing will not let you down. absolutely ten stars, a gem in its genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hush takes the home invasion/slasher concept we've seen a million time before, and adds a unique twist on it which enables for some heart-pounding and tense situations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hush is an exceptionally tense thriller that consists of a plot we've seen a million times before. However, it is presented with a refreshing twist that enables new situations of heart-pounding intensity to be demonstrated. The high level of suspense found in this movie is primarily achieved through to Flanagan's clever direction, and use of silence as a crucial horror element. Kate Siegel's fantastic performance also helps set the tense atmosphere, as her character's hearing disability pushes her to think outside the box and find clever ways to fend off the psychotic killer in her home. The good aspects in this movie greatly overshadow the negative, which there are only a few of. John Gallagher Jr.'s performance as the antagonist is only passable, as a more compelling villain could have brought an interesting layer to the movie's rather simplistic story. However, the movie is well aware that it's a simple, tense slasher film, and doesn't go out of its way to become anything more. This allows for more time to be spent on developing the intensity of the situations presented in the film. Overall, Hush is a solid film that any suspense/horror fan must see. Though it does have its few and minor flaws, the films direction and premise quickly overshadow them, as the viewer is drawn in for a familiar experience, that at the same time feels new and refreshing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you want a film to shout at in frustration, this is for you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have wanted this film to succeed. There is a basic structure to build a great thriller - a deaf single woman lives in the woods and a killer just arrives uninvited. Fantastic! However, there are just too many holes and unexplained sequences in the plot. You will either shout in frustration or to say "awesome" because you ain't got a clue.A plus point first - there are sequences that make you sit on edge because something bad is about to happen and it is not going to be nice. Whilst this is not unique, you certainly can't rely on a few scary sequences to make a good film.The bad points are many - you don't know why the assault should to take place, why the assailant takes so long to 'finish' the job. ... and there are more whys. If it was not daft, it would be quite original. I am disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hush is 'Censored'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So here's the thing. Hush is 'Censored'.That's it, unless you personally enjoy my writing/commentary ? your journey has come to an end. It's 'Censored'.Not because of the premise. The premise is decent. Missing one of our five senses is something we rarely think about and certainly would prefer not to. So the main chick is deaf. She's also a little 'censored'. Both of those are handicaps in their own right (though 'censored' is only a handicap if you're not hot enough to pull it off.... and she isn't, so... whatever). Typical trope: psycho, knife/crossbow (it doesn't matter so long as it's something that kills brutally) and an isolated maiden. More so because she can't hear. Blah, blah, blah ? who gives a 'censored'? The bad guy is marginally intimidating for all of three minutes, then shows his face and runs his mouth and loses all intimation factor. "Can you read my lips?"; maybe, if they weren't hanging open like a 'censored' flytrap and glistening with drool because you're a functional 'censored' who looks like he worships Eminem and sagged his pants at his uppity private school. Seriously, the clerk at my local 7-11 would beat this 'censored' 'censored' to death with his own femur. To the actor; you have a 'censored' face. You look like a 'censored'. I'm a 'censored' and upon seeing your face, instantly knew I would be able to 'censored' you up.Frankly, it kills the movie. And I know he's a 'censored' because no director in their right mind, even the 'censored' dumbest, would cast him as a bad guy. Which someone did, therein indicating he 'censored the meanest 'censored' this side of the Atlantic. Kid must do full 'cradle' ? 'censored' and 'censored'. There's no other way someone thought he would make a 'bad guy'... the 'censored' at Costco who you saw kicking a puppy, then darting off in his mom's Jetta blaring 'censored' rap... maybe, just maybe.I didn't even finish the movie from this point. Like, my shirt rode up a little high for my comfort while I was sitting there watching it and in the time it took me to tug it back down, I'd already arrived at ''censored'itville' for this flick.In summary; decent (the same way Trump is a 'decent' candidate for president) premise and horrible casting. Checking my balance at an ATM is more suspenseful than this 'censored' venture. To the director or writer, whatever: should have kept the mask on your boy. Bet he brushes with a Maxi-pad... 'censored' 'censored' face.Excuse the 'censored'; apparently IMDb believes in censorship, not honesty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hush is a decent horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Netflix horror film about a deaf writer being stalked by a killer won't see a cinema release. The film relied on sound a lot with the intense premise that the killer could simply stalk around the house without being heard by the protagonist. Kate Siegel stars as Maddie, a YA writer who hopes to find some peace and solace to writer her second novel. The voices in her head can't decide on an ending. Maddie's only company out in the woods is her cat and a neighbor trying to communicate her with broken sign language. The neighbor is the first victim of the derange killer who hunts down residents. John Gallagher Jr. who recently starred in 10 Cloverfield Lane plays the killer. He had a pretty spooky mask but they dispose of that a bit too early to inspire much horror.

		<fullReview>I watched this movie recently and was quite impressed with the performance of Kate Siegel. Samantha Sloyan, fresh from Grey's Anatomy, gave as well a credible, if not short-lived performance. The plot quickly moved from a benign beginning to a scary and terrifying situation. No motive was ever established for the ongoing acts of terror perpetrated by the "Man" played by John Gallagher Jr. The film also never explained the ongoing actions of the "Man" relative to gaining access to Maddie's house nor addressed the burning question: are windows in a house not made for breaking when someone outside really wants to get in.</fullReview>

Now if you're the type who can sit and watch a movie without arguing about the flaws and non-realism for a realistic movie then it won't matter.As far as home invasion thrillers go it's not bad but I've seen better and I spent most of the time wondering what the characters were doing. If you don't like supernatural horror movies and you don't think too much while watching a movie then it's probably great for you. Otherwise find another thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>home alone 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished watching this movie on Netflix. Quarter of the way through i started browsing what deals where available on wagjag,check my inbox and made my lunch. Came back to the movie and she was still running around inside the house then outside the house then inside the house....etc. The movie is about a lady who lost her hearing and speech, locked in mortal combat with a mime. Of course this person decided to live in the wilderness armed with kitchen knifes and smoke detectors without any self defense training. People in LA and NY are probably better suited for this type of home alone incident. Say she had herself a shotgun and disabled the mime then the movie would be over in say the first 20 minutes. Or maybe the mime broke the glass in the windows or door, the show would be over about the same time. Or if the boyfriend wonders why a undercover officer is walking around in the middle of nowhere, otherwise he would be in uniform. i skipped over the conversation between dumb and dumber. Whatever they discussed never made the movie more interesting, exciting or advanced the plot. It only used more film,time and patience. I read the back of the wasp repellent once, it says to wash out your eyes immediately and seek medical attention immediately and do not rub if spray in the eyes.Can't always believe what you read. Apparently this mime had superhuman eyes with a wasp's brain. There is another home alone movie with Jodie Foster. I am going back to watching home alone with joe pesci, its good because it never pretends to be serious and the bad guys are more convincing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect horror film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember in 2008 when 'The Strangers' came out, sitting in the theatre and just thinking how great of a concept this was. A killer/s with no apparent motive who are in complete control. It made for a very tense and affective horror movie. A planned sequel is still yet to be released. 'Hush' is a very similar movie, with an even more helpless victim, a deaf woman. Does it still work 8 years later? It does. The shock of a killer with the audacity to walk straight into the victim's house and stand watching her without her realising remains a very powerful thing to watch. Too many horror/thriller movies these days are trying to speed up the action (take the 'Friday the 13th' remake in 2009 for example where 'Jason' even runs) and are consequently losing the thing that makes horror great - tension. Look at the original 'Halloween' by John Carpenter, a studio would never let you make a horror film that slowly paced in this day and age, and yet 'Halloween' is considered one of the greatest horror films of all time.That's not to say 'Hush' is a slow film, it isn't. In fact I'd suggest the pacing was nearly perfect for what it was trying to achieve. Kate Siegel gives a great performance in the lead role. I genuinely liked her and cared for her character, another thing frequently found lacking in modern horror - likable characters. The thing I liked the most about the entire film though was the thought in the back of my mind that no character was safe, and there was nothing that couldn't happen. I had no idea whether I was in for a "happy" ending or not. I love that in a horror movie and if it isn't there, at least to some extent, I won't be having a good time. Altogether a very fine effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film started off quite well from the outset, with a nice setup. Having the main character be deaf is interesting, but unfortunately it doesn't pay off very well. There's not much buildup to the game of cat and mouse that makes up the bulk of the story and so the viewer is thrust into the action in a way that seriously lessens its impact. There are flashes of promise in the first ten or so minutes but after that it's a fairly clichéd survival horror that doesn't offer anything spectacular. Some fleeting moments of tension and shock make it worth a one time watch if you're curious, but don't go into it with high expectations.</fullReview>

He also talked like he was going to torture her by saying "I can get in anytime I want.." and "... you will wish you were dead", but his action shows otherwise.

		<shortDescription>A Very Amazing Take on an Overused and Dying Subgenre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've all seen an home-invasion thriller/horror. There are lots of bad ones but they're has been some good ones in recent years (You're Next was a great home-invasion film with a twist). Now this film is INCREDIBLE. It has superb acting (especially from Kate Siegel, she really blew me away, it shows you don't need dialogue to be a great actor), it has interesting sound design, it's greatly filmed and it was so suspenseful. I can't remember a last time where a horror film has kept me on the edge of my seat. Now many people are comparing this film to You're Next and The Strangers. Now while The Strangers and this film are technically more 'scary' than You're Next, I would say this movie is as great as them. A thing that really surprised me was how I was NEVER bored. It kept my attention all the way through, I really cared about the character and I was surprised on how they didn't hold back on the violence which is always a plus. There was a scene (which I won't spoil) that was so hard-to- watch that I covered my mouth. This movie could've defiantly be released in theaters and it's one you should watch with an audience or a group of friends. Make sure you turn up the volume and watch it on a dark scary night. Thrilling and scary, Hush is a winner for a modern horror classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was a decent enough flick. Some sequences kind of angered me because of some of the typical horror clichés. One thing I still don't get, and this is a SPOILER, is that, I'm guessing he manage to change the password on her computer via her phone, but doesn't changing a password require a password to change it? If that is indeed what happened, then that whole scene was just plain dumb. This film actually reminds me a little of Straw Dogs. Same general plot. I liked how she used her other senses to her advantage, which I imagined were heightened as a direct result of her being deaf. One more thing that has me confused (SPOILER) is that her friend at the beginning mentioned to her that she was 13 when she got sick. I can only assume that this ailment is what led to her becoming deaf. If that's the case, couldn't she speak if she wanted too? Oh well. Maybe I'm being too analytical; or just plain anal. Lol. Overall, a big fat OK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a very standard example of the home invasion thriller. If you love home invasion thrillers, you'll probably enjoy it but I felt like there were no surprises or twists to make it stand out from the many other films in this sub-genre. I was actually unpleasantly surprised because synopsis made me think that the main character would have a dark secret that would be revealed when she took sadistic revenge on the intruder. This was not the case. Despite a couple of moments of doubt, you never really doubt that the main character is going to fight her way to freedom and it doesn't really add to or change anything about that basic formula of an ordinary woman having to learn to fight back against her attacker so she can survive, covered in blood but triumphant. For someone new to this kind of film, A Lonely Place to Die (2011) is a much better, more exciting example.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not much new added to the "murderous psychopath terrorizes gal alone in the house" formula with the exception of one intriguing twist in "Hush". Kate Siegel's damsel in SERIOUS distress character of Maddie is both deaf and mute. But this is not to indicate that she is in any way fragile or weak. For we come to discover that Maddie is a flat-out TOTAL badass.Siegel (who co-wrote the script here with her husband Mike Flanagan, the film's Director) does a superb job with an extraordinarily demanding role across a number of fronts. And while the conclusion to "Hush" was fitting I suppose, I just thought it would be a bit cooler. More special.More...well...at the risk of being droll...resounding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thriller with serious flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this one pretty good, but it made you angry at how idiotic most of the characters were throughout.Basically some guy hates this woman enough to kill two other people and injure himself just to torment her to death. The only thing that made it different was that she was deaf and unable to talk.Spoiler? - he doesn't succeed in the end, but I knew that from the beginning.What bothered me was how unobservant this woman was. The guy was slamming her neighbor's head against the glass door repeatedly and none of the vibrations alerted her at all. She didn't even see him out of the corner of her eye when he was right outside the door. And the killer acted like he didn't realize she was deaf at first, but we learned very early in the story that he knew her and wanted her dead for some unknown reason.Then he took off his hideous mask and all the suspense went out of the story. Besides, we never did find out why he hated her so much. Or maybe I missed something, but none of it made sense.I won't go into all the stupid things everyone did because most movies like this depend on stupidity to work, but I will say one thing: If she had had a gun this movie would have been over in about 5 minutes.I guess we can't arm innocent victims or the bad guys would have too much trouble pushing them around. I just couldn't resist imagining her holding up a shotgun and watching the look on his face.Oh well... you know Hollywood. No reality or logic is allowed. ha ha.Anyway, not a bad movie, but it's hard to care for a victim as stupid as this one was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all i must say that I did enjoy the movie. I really liked the concept of our protagonist being deaf and having that as a character ark really elevated the movie. I also liked that the horror movie clinches such as jump scares where few to non existent. However. I thought the movie got quite repetitive after the 40 minute mark. I think it would have been loads better if the killer waited a bit longer to expose himself. The sequences when he walked around the house and she having no idea he was there was chilling! And they could have built on that longer. Like the scene where he guts our heroines' best friend loudly up against the glass door and she not hearing it. I found myself screaming at the TV trying to help! It was really well executed. If they would have focused more on that and let the killer toy with her some more instead of the last hour being confrontation and her trying to escape just to find herself crawling back into the house again i think that would have made for a more entertaining and intense film. Over all grade from me B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't one of the scariest horror movies I have ever watched. As a matter of fact this is more of a thriller. I however thought it was well done, especially since it goes away from most formulaic horror movie elements. Such as jump scares, with a movie like this I was expecting some jump scares. But it's like the director was like "No, that is so generic and it's getting old...Let's not do that". This is a home invasion horror movie where you don't know the killer's motives or why he does the things he does, except that he is a psychopath. The plot is about a psychopath that tries to invade a deaf and mute woman's home that is located in the and tries to play a game of cat and mouse with her instead of just going for the kill. So yeah, so aspects of this movie doesn't make much sense. Like why would a deaf and mute woman being doing the middle of the woods, even if she is a writer. I did like the way the deaf woman tried to use her wits to survive although she made few annoying decisions then and there. But when you are deaf and mute and crazy stuff is happening, you might not be able to think straight. The reason why this movie wasn't all that scary to me was because the killer came off more like a incompetent doofus than a menacing figure. I guess it's too give the deaf and mute girl a fighting chance, but the killer just seemed so weak. Your as an audience won't be on the edge because of what the killer will do next, but will be looking forward to what he is going to do next that will screw up his chances. Fear comes from the unknown and not having control, it doesn't really give off that vibe much in this movie. Overall this is more or a thriller than a horror movie and it's a decent one. I especially like the thought of how a amateur filmmaker could make a decent film, with the right acting and direction.6.8/10</fullReview>

You really care for her character and are rooting for her the entire time. John Gallagher Jr. is the best I've ever seen him. This is, hands down, his best performance. (granted, I've only seen three of his films.) He's very creepy and intimidating. Props to the director for making this simple premise so effective.

When Maddie looks down at the crossbow and sees the 13 marks was too much for me. I also liked the performances Kate Siegel never over does it and I really liked her. Also John Gallagher as the Man was really good. The 'hallucinations' are really creepy and worked for me. One of the only dislikes I had was with an ex-boyfriend character that made no sense to me. There are a few similar movies that I've seen compared to this movie which is OK. One that I've heard about few times is 1967s Wait Until Dark.</fullReview>

This review will also be a short one."Hush" is about a deaf authoress, who is left alone at her house. Someone takes advantage of this, a masked man, and starts to stalk her...This movie is directed by the same person who directed the movie "Oculus" starring Karen Gillan. This director is called Mike Flanagan. He did a really good job at directing the movie. Flanagan managed to create a tense full, good movie, with almost no dialogue. This is the thing that I found very interesting. Which is also a good part. He could keep me intrigued into the story. He also used some cool camera movements at times. The cinematography was also very good. The editing was good too. I didn't really pay attention to this part of the movie -I know, what a shame-, because I was more focused on the story. I will probably focus more on this in my second viewing. The make-up, though, was very good. This was a noticeable thing. The broken fingers of Maddie, when they got squished between the door. This scene was by the way also very gruesome to watch. This brings me to the next subject. The sound. This was a good thing, the editing of it, and the sound design. The soundtrack was sort of cliché. Something that I also like is the feel that they create, but I'll go on deeper on this in the last paragraph. A thing I might need to mention, is that I think that this was a very low-budget movie. I mention this, because this only makes the make-up, and sound more impressive.The acting was fine. Nothing superb, but fine. I was surprised of the cast. There were nearly any cast members, this is probably too because of the low budget. The actress of the main character, Kate Siegel, was good. The only issue I have with her, is that I felt like she wasn't always deaf, that there were moments that she actually heard something. This is of course something that's really hard to do, so I won't see it as something really bad. The good thing, though, was that you were routing for her. You didn't really get to know her character, but you were still invested in her. This is, ofcours, a good thing. The antagonist of the movie is played by John Gallagher Jr. He was good too. And again, without really knowing him, you "hated" his character. This was of course because you routed for the main character. The supporting cast was also fine. Nothing really special. The screenplay was also written by the director, but also by Kate Siegel, the actress of Maddie. Again prove that there wasn't a big budget. This was also a very well handled thing of the movie. The impressive thing is, is that the movie only contains a small amount of dialogue. But for the dialogue there was, it was good. The characters were also well created. The character of Maddie was one of a kind, because she couldn't speak, nor talk. This was,I think, one of the reasons why you rooted for her the most. The issue that I have with the antagonist is that he doesn't have a motive for wanting to scare Maddie. Well, more then scare her. A thing that they got right, is the feeling of the movie. You felt isolated, due to the Forest. There are of course the cliché jump scares, just not always at the moments you will expect. The main character is pretty smart too, this is a good thing. In most movies this is a very dumb thing. They also prove this by having these hallucinations, which were creative, and good. This gave a little twist, while I was thinking: 'Well that's stupid don't do that...oh'. Maddie does make some doubtable dissisions, but not very annoying things. A thing that was very good with Maddies character was that they made her a badass. They made her a independent woman, which also is a non-cliché thing.Overall this was a fun movie. This isn't a masterpiece, and it doesn't want to be it either. You'll just have to accept what the movie is and you'll enjoy it.7.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason why I didn't give it a 10 is that I HATE horror movies especially when it involves brutal killing, but I "watched" it with my husband (who's a sucker for them). I only watched the first maybe 15 minutes (when it was less tense), then I couldn't watch it anymore. Instead, I just listened. What I noticed was that there was less sound than most horror/thriller movies. Usually, music/sound takes over tense scenes and the music kinda tells you what's going to happen next, but not this one, which made it even more tense because you really have no idea what's gonna happen. Most of the time, I only remember hearing heavy breathing, footsteps, organic sounds produced by objects...etc...not much music/post sound effects (that I could remember). That played to the fact that the main character is deaf, which helped you care for her. It felt like YOU were in her shoes and you literally were terrified. My husband (who's a big fan of these movies) really enjoyed it. It was well made and the cast couldn't have been better. I'm still paranoid by it!</fullReview>
