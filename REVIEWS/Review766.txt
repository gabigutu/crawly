		<shortDescription>It wasn't that bad, people.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just wanted to comment on how completely ridiculous it is that grown people and older teenagers are commenting on how stupid, obnoxious, childish, un-funny, etc this movie was. I am a mother of 5 children, ages 12 to 2. My 3 daughters are 11 and two 9 year olds. They LOVED this movie and laughed their little butts off the whole time. Granted, there were MANY parts of the movie where I was bored to tears and I actually played a few games on my iPod touch I'd brought along...but AGAIN, this movie wasn't made FOR ME. IT WAS MADE FOR SMALL CHILDREN. And it really wasn't THAT bad. I mean, come on. We've all been watching Disney movies forever now, haven't we? Like you can't figure out who will die, who will win, who will lose, who will kiss whom, etc...in ANY Disney movie. Also, so she can't act?? Who cares? Because ALL of the Disney actors these days can't act. They are wooden and pathetic. BUT THE CHILDREN LIKE THEM. Stop being so judgmental about a movie that was geared towards 7 to 10 year old little girls, OK? It's just silly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It hits the mark for its target audience - young, preteen girls and those who love them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hope anyone who is the parent or is a relative of young girls will overlook the negative review comments from what appear to be adult men. I saw the movie today with my sister and her 8-year-old granddaughter. We all loved it and we laughed a lot. Anyone who has a young girl, fathers too, I think will enjoy this film. It's not going to win an Oscar for acting but it sure gets my vote for light entertainment. I liked the music from both Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift; they have different styles.I'm am puzzled at the number of men who are reviewing a movie that is designed for little girls. I selected a couple of the reviewers who gave the movie one star and looked up some of their other reviews. I one case, his favorite movie contained a lot of violence and bloodshed.At any rate, I give it an eight because it successfully did what it set out to do. That is to let a lot of little girls and their loved ones have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miley Cyrus is like a vermin in the Western World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, Really.The incredible lack of quality in this film is not only intensified by Miley Cyrus' lack of acting or singing skills, it is aggravated as the entire movie resolves around her own "inner struggle"(huh). She is incapable of delivering her lines with any sort of credibility or patience whatsoever and has to rely on being loud and intense in order to keep people's attention. That showcasts how her on-screen persona is similar to her on-stage persona: In order to hide her obvious flaws in talent, simply distracting the fandom (teenage girls usually between 6 and 13) with over exaggerated moves and expressions tends to do the trick. Some people might call that "Being relatable" or "Having a stage presence", I call that a plot to remain in the spotlight of 10 year old girls (All while failing at "overgrowing her character" by dating a 21 year old underwear model and uploading half naked pictures of herself in real life).Billy Ray Cyrus, on the other hand, is the complete opposite of his daughter. Instead of overstating every single line and facial expression, he barely manages to pull them off with disdain. I swear to you, his repertory of expressions and emotions is even smaller than the list of his musical hits. The screenplay is just what one would expect from a Disney Channel movie. You will not find a "Finding Nemo" or a "Wall-E" on this one, just a simple "sweet tale" about a character struggling while finding young love (Except that it fails at that too, given not only that the main characters do not last together for long and that on the show the Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana character changes boyfriends as fast as she changes tampons). The love interest is so disgustingly clichéd that you might just laugh at his fakeness. The jokes, as expected coming from a Hannah Montana movie, are simply not funny at all. In fact, the entire movie gets so lame and predictable that it becomes yet another proof of how -for everyone's sake- Disney Channel's writers are ought to commit suicide.Now on the music (Or lack thereof). The soundtrack is just what would be expected by Hannah Montana: songs filled with self-references and childish squabble. Although it meets its purpose of making small children happy, it is nothing more than that.The movie includes a ridiculous Macarena wannabe "dance song" which is so incredibly complex that not even her fandom will replicate it without a severe amount of effort (Were they actually expecting people to dance the Howdown whatever? It's not like its simple, or easy for that matter). Miley Cyrus and her dad are simply not talented at all in the musical arena. The only song worth saving from this whole mess is The Climb, which is actually deep and thought provoking. If you are not a tormented parent who is being absolutely threatened by his daughter to go see this film with her, I implore you for your own sake, take that money elsewhere and save yourself the nuisance. Because in the end that is the only thing this is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, this was a waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miley Stewart's (Miley Cyrus) life is out of balance. Taken under the wing of a gungho and glamorous publicist, Vita (Vanessa Williams), Miley's letting Hannah begin to dominate her life. When she keeps choosing Hannah over her commitments to family members?to say goodbye to Jackson (Jason Earles) as he leaves for college, to attend Lilly's (Emily Osment) long-anticipated sweet-16 party or her grandmother's birthday celebration?it is clear Miley's beginning to forget why the Hannah Montana secret was created in the first place.When Hannah Montana ends up in a paparazzi-captured fight with Tyra Banks over a pair of designer shoes, Miley's father (Billy Ray Cyrus) quietly takes control. Having attempted to reason with her to no avail, Robby Ray tricks Miley into thinking she's going to New York as Hannah to perform when he's really taking her from Los Angeles back home to Crowley Corners, Tennessee. Miley's double life becomes even more complicated when she returns to Crowley Corners.She discovers that a reporter has somehow managed to track Hannah Montana to her hometown and is asking lots of questions of the locals. She also meets up with an old childhood friend, Travis Brody (Lucas Till), and soon finds herself in her first serious romance. When Miley tries to impress Travis by telling him about her friend Hannah Montana, she suddenly finds her alter ego enlisted in a concert fundraiser to help save her hometown's pristine Crowley Meadows from developers. Once again, having taken on more than she can handle, Miley has to call on her best friend, Lilly, and ask her for help. When Lilly finally arrives in Crowley Corners pretending to be Hannah Montana, events really spin out of control. Hannah Montana 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK film I guess, a good conclusion to the series but there is still its weak flaws (SPOILERS!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With my laptop with me, my sister and me decided to watch THE HANNAH MONTANA MOVIE on you tube last night. Let me say I read a couple of reviews about this movie saying how poor the movie is but since I am fan, I figured it was worth a watch.I'm not saying the film's bad because it isn't. I have seen all the episodes of HANNAH MONTANA and I thought they were pretty funny and cool. But I think most of the people who wrote bad comments just watched the movie instead of switching over to Disney Channel and figuring what HM was all about. So yeah.OK lets start off with the good side...1) I can say this film did a good job bringing all the episodes and questions together pulling a great conclusion.2) This film was like a whole new side for HANNAH MONTANA. Because you just skip Malibu, and the regular irritating "audience laughs" we see and hear in the HM episodes and go beyond the series, exploring Miley's main hometown, where you she actually came from and the choices she has to make.3) The songs were top-notch my favourite ones were Hoedown Throwdown and Lets Get Crazy I also liked some of the touching songs as well like Crazier by Taylor Swift (it was good to see her in the movie!) Butterfly Fly Away and The Climb and they also deliver an important message too.4) It kept a levelled balance of everything; from the laughs to the moments. Because normally in the HM series you always get more off the funny parts rather than the real moving parts.5) It was good work from Disney! NOW THE BAD...1) It was good but not great. I mean it wasn't something new from Disney like bringing it to a whole new level. It just kept it's sort of material that I normally expect from it. Although I said it was a whole new side, it was still nothing special.2) The performances were average, I'm not seeing any energy being delivered. The end was a big moment in the movie but Cyrus sort of ruined that with her acting, causing it to not work as "dramatic". Sorry :( ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** 3) When Miley rips off her wig, she said she can still be Hannah if everybody keeps the secret. Sure its her beloved hometown, but there's got to be one bad person who wants all the fame and money and blow her secret.4) Jackson's alligator incident was careless and pointless. That has got to be very serious damage! For a normal human being, you could have needed brutal surgery and... well, the film sort of took it as a practical joke!? 5) Does Miley try to reveal she's Hannah Montana? To Travis, to that reporter guy she always says, "I saved Hannah Montana's life surfing and we're best friends!" Stupid! Yeah - there's more bads than goods! 6) Now everybody knows shes "best friends" with Hannah Montana, why dosen't anyone use their brain? There's lot of evidence, her face, that voice, those dance moves? Yet nobody had the right mind to figure out she is ACTUALLY Hannah Montana! 7) Bad reporter turn into good reporter and not blow Miley's secret? No, no, no! In real life any normal reporter would just blow her secret! 8) There wasn't much shock when Hannah revealed shes Miley. Also I found the ending quite confusing, she just takes off her wig, sings and the end!?9) Unrealistic! 10) One more thing... sometimes Miley sings like she's got a cold or something and I'll admit she can't dance! Sorry for saying but true!I have a few more bad comments but I'll just leave it there for now...OK I'm not trying to say HANNAH MONTANA THE MOVIE is a bad film (like I said!) But I say it's probably a mixed bag (despite the few extra bad points I made) Although it was VERY close to four, I'd, at the very least, give it a 5. (Just because I'm nice :P) OK movie overall. Not bad I guess :)*****/********** stars (5/10 stars) ~Kalendra</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate the show with a burning passion, but amazingly I hate the film more. When Disney is not making classic animated films they are shamelessly ripping off little girls with things like High School Musical, The Jonas Brothers, and the worst of them all Hannah Montana. Miley Cirus can't sing or act, but thanks to Disney she is a big star. Why is the show successful? It gives girls a leader who they want to be like. In front of them is a role model, but from behind the smoke and mirrors is just a rip off scam to get parents to cough up money. It has no charm, it has no soul, and the film makes that even more evident. The jokes are terrible, the film is extremely cliché, none of the actors can act, the songs make my ears bleed, and the plot is beyond idiotic. Every last character I hate. Nobody is likable. Miley is a bitch, her father is an awful actor, Miley's love interest is uninteresting, Miley's best friend is stupid, and everyone else I don't care at all about. The romance is like a stale piece of dry bread. You don't feel any emotion. In fact the whole entire movie is like that. It is stale, uninteresting, stupid, and soulless. It also throws in a F*CK YOU of an ending moral. I'm not going to spoil it, but simply put they made the worst moral I have ever seen. I mean you could have put a commercial for the Hannah Motana series at the end, and it would have the same exact thing as the moral. The music is also a thing to talk about with this movie. Let me say that it is the equivalent to hearing an innocent kitten getting slaughtered. There is few films that I have watched that have made me start crying in pain screaming for it to end. Congratualations movie because you have done it.0 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the idea of Hannah Montana as a movie was good, because it gave a chance for different types of audience to show what they think of it, and view it. so its for the young girls, and they probably love it, but if your not a female or under 12 years old you wont appreciate it. People are saying why rate it as a bad film because its not aimed at adults, well, if only 12 year old girls rated this film, it wouldn't be an accurate rating. Having people of all ages and backgrounds rate this film, shows an actual portrayal of the quality of the film. The girl has a good voice, but that doesn't make it a good film. personally i don't like her music either, but i can appreciate talent when i see it. unfortunately, the same doesn't go for the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, and I'm a guy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My sister paid me 10 bucks to watch this movie and I thought it would be the hardest ten bucks I ever made. Turns out I was wrong.I went into this movie having never seen the show and with the impression that it would be some lame kids movie. After all, all my friends trash talk the show and make fun of it saying you're gay if you watch it. I was kind of skeptical to watch it, but, turns out it was an awesome movie.The movie is full of witty humor, the music is actually catchy, and I'm not the kind of guy that cries at movies and TV shows but this movie almost had me crying. It hit an emotional spot in me that I didn't think I had.For being a Disney movie, I honestly am impressed at what they produced. Miley Cyrus is a really good actress and has a good voice. I may even have a crush on her.After seeing the movie I decided to watch a few episodes of the show. It's a different atmosphere than the movie but still has that same witty humor.All in all, this is a great movie for anybody, and if you don't want to admit to watching it or you don't want anyone to know you've seen it, watch it alone. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Cyrus, it tries way too hard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the father of a twean this was required, and frankly painful, viewing. This evaluation surprises me somewhat given that the Cyrus / Disney television program on which this mess is based is the least bad choice among Disney TV offering for this age group. In fact, in a weak moment, I might concede that Miley?s often genuine interactions with her father (despite his worse-than-a-mullet haircut) and plots centered around Miley?s moral shortcomings coming back to haunt her make the show somewhat substantial and entertaining. Had the movie simply offered up a twice extended episode of the show Disney would have had a fairly watchable movie. Unfortunately the movie reaches for schmaltz and to say something profound about one?s roots thereby subjecting us to a decided lack of warmth and humor, uninteresting supporting characters and absurd plot twists ending with the idea that a few thousand Tennesseans will keep Miley?s secret. It seemed painfully apparent to me that Cyrus has outgrown her alter ego and hoped this movie would spell the end of her. Unfortunately, Disney characters never really die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the series from when I was about 16 and I did enjoy it and I was wanting to see this film as I thought it would also be good, however when I have finally gotten around to watching it, its a total disappointment. The plot is empty and unrealistic. I highly doubt that thousands of people would never mention miley is in fact Hannah, and also the 'romance' in the film was pathetic, the boy miley was with (I can't even remember his name and I've just watched it) confused me as to why he was annoyed at her for not telling him that she was Hannah. The musical performances by Taylor Swift and fleetwood mac, although great, were pointless, it would have made more sense for them to appear at the end in the benefit concert. It would have been a decent end to the series as it did end it as it seems the main question of her being either miley of Hannah had been done, however the next series and finale just totally had no relation to the film which I find highly pointless. I liked Hannah Montana but the film was a let down. Only worth a watch if you're totally bored and it happens to be on TV when nothing else is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simple minds are easily amused I suppose. This movie went thought a hole a lot and ended up back where it started. First of all the tag line of the film "shes had the best of both worlds and now she has to pick just one", do you think she did? No, she tired to but 4000 something people told her to Hanna Montana AFTER she said she didn't want to do it any more and she agreed. Second poor Billy Ray, didn't get anything, why, was it to hard to give him a girlfriend in the TV show? Is that why Miley's selfishness brought his relationship to an end? And I may not watch the show very much, but the character of Miley was way out of character, she was never that spoiled. Among other things, such as her break-up with her best friend (which they got back together for no real reason other then the film needed it) to whatever messed up relationship she had with her boyfriend. I would recommend not seeing this unless your under the age of 10 and don't know what a plot is, parents, I'm sorry for those of your who must watch it with your young ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Piano Teeth brings her character (and ego) to the big screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about a film like this? Well, I'll pose this question to anyone who has seen the show. If Mr. Magoo barely has the legs for a six minute cartoon (and he also got his own movie) how in the WORLD can a one note concept like "Hannah Montana" sustain 100 minutes when it can barely do it in a twenty minute show? I would give you a plot summary but I can't because there is no story, I kid you not. This is more or less a series of lame slapstick scenes loosely tied together with a clichéd idea of an evil land developer who plans to level the hometown of Miley Stewart who just happens to be visiting when all this goes down.Where do I begin? Well, for starters the movie was shot in a very lousy way. The extreme close-ups dilute most of the slapstick action which in of itself is just as desperate as it is on the show. Also, we get one too many closeups of Miley Cyrus's face and thus, her distracting piano teeth. On top of all that, there are several shots done in slow motion for no apparent reason. I guess the filmmakers wanted to be "artsy".The cast is wasted and I do mean wasted! Barry Bostwick is useless in a throwaway role, Tyra Banks makes a complete fool of herself and the charming and talented Emily Osment is reduced to a recurring cameo despite her getting second billing.I'm a generous kind of guy, so I will give it this: the colors and film stock at least give it the big screen look it needs and that is a improvement over the tacky look of the show and I will admit I did get a few mild laughs overall.My consensus? This movie will thrill little girls and it is harmless but it's quite a chore for anyone older.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a FAMILY Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's sickening to read certain comments about this movie. Are you people seriously that delusional? This movie was aimed at pre-teens and younger! This movie was about being true to yourself, your friends, and keeping your family routes deeply intact, which it completely succeeded at. Miley Cyrus' and Billy Ray's performance definitely won't win them an Oscar but why should it matter? What was believable was the power they showed in having a strong, healthy, loving relationship with your parents and family, and to reach your dreams while staying grounded and staying true to who you are. Also, rather than showing a spoiled brat, she showed deep consideration for her father, family, and friends in this movie, which I can't say much for many kids today. Miley Stewart showed more consideration than some adults twice her age.Most of these comments are based on materialistic values, such as her voice, which is a selling point or her acting. Hello?? Anyway who cares about a good plot knows you have to have a good THEME, good moral value... which it did. I give this movie a ten out of ten for it's category.I was scared to watch this, and bought it for my little sister's for Christmas, because I have seen how Miley is now, if you ever watched the video for Party in the USA. She has her bra hanging out and wearing daisy dukes... that's not becoming. And it's because of people like you, who grade her on materialistic values that she's becoming like that. Ostracizing her for making her dreams a reality, she's sixteen turning seventeen! She shouldn't be in a rush to grow up, she has the rest of her life for that. My brother just turned sixteen and is now allowed to date. He acts his age at least... Miley is acting beyond her years and it's not her fault. I applaud her in this movie because she shows her age in it. It's targeted for family viewing and it appeals to a family based audience. Ya so what if her acting was over the top in some parts and Billy Ray's was a little under developed. If you go to school plays, they don't have much better acting skills, I'm pretty some of you who are commenting can't act any better than Billy Ray and your kids probably can't act as well, I'm pretty sure some don't even understand character development. Why should that matter? If you sit there and judge a movie based on how their performances match to those who win Emmy's, well of course they're going to fall short. It's a kids' film. If you don't agree then you're not a family oriented person and maybe should do the same as Hannah Montana/Miley Stewart did and go back to your roots, and find out what matters most.If you have children, definitely watch it with them. You will enjoy it as much as I have and if my little sisters' prevail me to watch it over and over, I'll do it. I'll even sing along. I rate it 10/10.</fullReview>

I would have expected 3.5 It's fluff, poorly done, with wooden "acting" and the certainty of purpose it seems only a teen could take seriously... and yet its target audience loves it.And, although I hate to make the comparison, exactly what redeeming features did Elvis or Beatles movies have? In retrospect, not much.I've been lucky enough to only be forced to watch one episode of the series, and from what I can tell the movie is just more of the same. If science ever discovers a cure for whatever it is that makes kids like this stuff, great... otherwise, this is typical and there will be more.I will just add that I personally found absolutely no trace of realism or usefulness in this entire movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannah Montana "The Movie": As Silly as They Come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot imagine how anyone in their right mind thought that "Hannah Montana" was a good idea for a movie. Just take the premise. Hannah Montana is really Miley Cyrus. But Miley Cyrus does not want the world to know that she is Hannah Montana, because if they find out then whatever is left of her private life will soon disappear. So Miley Cyrus puts on a blond wig and convinces everyone that she is really Hannah Montana. Are you following this? Apparently no one considered the possibility that Miley looks like Hannah Montana.But this film persists in this absurd fiction right until the end, which leads to one silly plot line after the other. To take just one example, this movie could have been better if the love story involving Miley Cyrus and Travis Brody (who is played by the likable Lucas Till) played out like any other love story put on film. There was no need to maintain this implausible fiction that Travis had no idea that Miley was Hannah. Also the break up was a contrived, cruel and tasteless joke to me, making Travis appear like a fool to anyone in the audience who has a properly functioning brain! The Miley-Travis love story makes the chic flick "A Walk to Remember" took like Oscar material. Another idiotic plot line involves this British paparazzi guy who is trying to discover Hannah Montana's secret identity which is not a secret at all. At the end, after everyone who attended the latest Hannah Montana concert discovers that Hanna is Miley, the British paparazzi decides to do the "right thing" by quitting his job instead of revealing the secret of Hannah Montana's true identity to his boss. Is the man nuts and in this economy? I suppose it never occurred to him that the people at the concert would tell their friends, relatives or whomever that Hannah is Miley until everyone who cared knew this so-called secret.The other thing that I object to in this film is the silly slapstick comedy which is really not funny at all. There is nothing funny about watching a loser catch Lilly and then let go of her so that she falls down an enormous skateboard ramp. The poor girl could have broken an arm or a leg. There was nothing funny about watching Tyra Banks and Miley Cyrus fight over shoes. The aggressive ferret was not funny. And I can name a number of other slapstick scenes that were not funny.In short, I really did not like "Hannah Montana." Sometimes it can be sweet and a couple times I laughed. But it was so predictable and no effort was made to writing a good script. The human beings in this movie were so lame that I saw them get upstaged by at least two animals (an ostrich and an alligator, which were the only truly likable characters in this film). My guess for why millions were spend making "Hannah Montana: The Movie" is that the producers thought that they already had a hit on their hands once Miley Cyrus agreed to star in their picture and sing some of her things -- and that, on this basis, writing a good script and recruiting a capable supporting cast were unnecessary. They might have been right, but this film is still trash. So if you are searching for a film for your children, I would recommend renting "Swiss Family Robinson" (1960), "Mary Poppins" (1964), "A Little Princess" (1995), or "Babe" (1995). "Hannah Montana" is nothing compared to those films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable, hypocritical, clichéd- not good I am afraid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit outright first, I do not like the show at all really, because I find it mainly unfunny and feel apart from two or three actors the acting is not good. So I wasn't expecting much when I saw Hannah Montana:The Movie out of curiosity, and while I do think it is a marginal improvement over the show, that isn't saying much.The scenery is sometimes very nice, but I felt the editing was choppy in places. I also don't really like the soundtrack that much. Butterfly Fly Away was sweet, but I do not like The Climb at all, mostly because the lyrics are really uninspired and Miley Cyrus's vocals were rather forced for my liking.What else didn't I like about the movie? Well, there was the clichéd plot line, with one too many predictable turns. There was a weak script, that tried to be funny or touching but failed, and a very dull romance. Then there is the message, for me this is one of the most hypocritical messages I have seen in a film in a long time. I can't say anything good about the acting or direction either. The direction is simplistic, while Miley Cyrus verges on painful to watch. Emily Osment tries her hardest, but is given literally nothing to do, while Billy Ray Cyrus should stick to singing than acting. And Barry Bostwick needn't have bothered really, he is a good actor, but with such a poorly written character he is wasted.Overall, it is a waste of time. By all means you can see it and like it, but to be honest I didn't think much of this. 2/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I mentioned in my Justin Bieber Never Say Never review I said that I was going to review Hannah Montana The Movie and see how that holds up. Well I can certainly say that... it doesn't.The film follows Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana played by the controversial actress Miley Cyrus as her father played by Billy Ray Cyrus takes her to go see her grandmother in Tennesse instead of going to New York for a concert because, get this, she got in a shoe fight with Tyra Banks! Now she has to choose between Miley and Hannah.Like Justin Bieber Never Say Never this has got to be one of the worst ideas ever created into film. Nothing about the show screamed MOVIE! so why did we need one. Granted it is not as long as the Justin Bieber movie but still feels like an eternity. The show if you are wondering is pretty bad to but not as bad as this movie. This is one that you have to steer clear of. My next review will be a very big surprise.Rated G.1hr 42min/102min.BOMB/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly a great movie worth recommending, but a pretty good one nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a brief note, I think the Hannah Montana show was OK. Aside from some pretty good songs, it's main lead was OK, but later became annoying and some of the story lines, although funny, were quite predictable. While this movie improved a bit on the show, it's still flawed. The story despite it's nice moments is hugely predictable, the direction is bland, the script is schmaltzy, and the dialog is cringe-worthy.Some of the characters are uninteresting, but the main lead played by Miley Cyrus is a vast improvement and is a much more likable character and her depth is well-developed. Even her relationships with her family especially her father was touching. Some of the songs were mediocre, but the two songs that were not only emotional, but catchy goes to "Butterfly Fly Away" and "The Climb" and I'm surprised to see that song won an award for Best Movie Song.Overall, not exactly a great movie worth recommending, but not exactly as terrible as the ratings on this website says it is. It does have it's problems, but it's touching songs makes this worth a view for kids and their families.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie? No.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched some Hannah Montana episodes (more than I'd like to admit) and they have decent comedy without being too over the top like most Disney shows tend to be. Of course, having my favorite singer Billy Ray in it makes it better. But this movie was something else. Music numbers rarely fit the movie and they aren't really good. I enjoyed Butterfly Fly Away and Back To Tennessee but that's about it. Also, some scenes just don't fit the movie. Like the one where little girl sees Miley taking off her wig and stuff. It's a bad try to ad artsy scene to the movie. Also, the plot is something you see in the show every couple of episodes. And don't even get me started with that ending! I'm sure none of them will tell about her secret to anyone! Yeehaw...!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK first of all lets get the hate out of the way. There are far too many jealous people out there that have given this movie a bad review/low rating for the simple fact that they are jealous of a young girl whom they do not know. Jealous because she is living her dream and doing it successfully and have a BLAST doing it while they sulk in their own pathetic lives. Get over yourselves and try to be positive for once.Most of all the negative ratings/reviews need to be removed because they make no sense whatsoever. Just reviews and ratings by jealous little girls and boys who have sad, miserable lives.Anyway, I saw this movie for what it was: Inspiration. I found the acting to be right on par for the type of movie this is and was sweetly surprised at some of the performances from Miley Cyrus as well as the supporting cast. I'll be honest in saying that at the start of the movie I was thinking it was going to be just like the TV show which is funny and simple. Well I was wrong in the best way.After the "hoo-haw" at the beginning, I was very pleased to see that they were taking it back "home" to Tennessee to live the country life again for a little while. I found that small town, country charm worked very well with this production and some of the scenes were downright hilarious.I don't know how other people rate their movies. Some base it on pure hatred and no intelligence. Others will rate a movie on acting alone or special effects or how loud it is. I rate a movie by how it makes me feel and at the end of this particular movie, I felt very warm and pleased. I was almost in tears. The ending of this movie is quite charming. I hope they make another one.I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to believe that it haven't been a long time since "Hannah Montana" was a huge phenomenon. While the juggernaut has lost some steam, it's really not many years ago since the franchise was huge and practically everywhere. While Disney has produced many series, none of them were as huge as "Hannah Montana". With the popularity, it wasn't strange that a movie was produced (actually two, if you count the concert movie) and released theatrically.Why exactly this franchise became such a phenomenon, is somewhat fascinating. There's obviously no wonder to say that it's a cynical and calculated product. But if we're discussing the quality of the TV show itself, it's definitively cheesy and dumb, but still harmless and watchable at times. There's no denial that the show was aimed specifically at a young audience. So where does it leaves the movie?"Hannah Montana The Movie" shall have praise for at least having (most of the time) a more mature and adult tone than the show. But the movie's obvious flaws makes it's purpose ambiguous. "Hannah Montana The Movie" isn't exactly horrific. That's not the problem of the film. It's cute and definitively watchable at times. But it's shifting tone and it's muddled message makes the film harder to shallow. The film really relies on a clichéd and worn-out plot-line about Miley finding back to herself by traveling back to her hometown after Hannah has taken over her life (a plot line that had already been used in some the show itself). The film really leads up to the point where Miley has to choose between her two worlds, but the ending really backs out and leaves the question really open (and ambiguous).The tone is really somewhat inconsistent. From having a quite frenetic opening, to a slower second act, the film becomes a sappy melodrama at the third act. Which really the movie didn't needed, since it worked better with a less sappier tone. The slapstick is, surprisingly, not grating, but besides that, "Hannah Montana The Movie" really doesn't rely on humor (not that the series was funny, but at least it didn't relied on slapstick humor). None of the acting is particularly special. The most likable star is Lucas Till as the love interest, who has presence and charisma. The songs are hit and miss as well. A few of them are catchy ("Let's Get Crazy", "Hoedown Throwdown", "Crazier", "Dreams"), but the rest are forgettable.A problem with the concept really is the portrayal of Miley Stewart herself. She's energetic and bubbly, but at times she can be an unlikeable and selfish brat. This movie is no exception. Of course a character doesn't need to be perfect, but Miley is indeed a flawed ans selfish character that repeats her mistakes. Really, it's somewhat odd that such a character became iconic.So at the end, "Hannah Montana The Movie" isn't exactly horrific. But with a more focused theme and tone, this movie would have been more acceptable. At the end, for all the flaws of the show has, it's still more harmless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, let me say I'm the same age as Billy Ray Cyrus and, although I never cared for the man after the atrocious "Achy Breaky Heart", once I discovered Hannah Montana on ABC Kids on Saturday morning, and even after trying out the show once when I was in a motel with all the cable channels, I actually liked him as an actor. And my opinion on his one hit song has improved over the years.But except for the music, I've found Miley Stewart and her friend Lily adorable. It would be nice if the ABC broadcast network could have shown us more than the one season, but that was enough for me to develop a taste for these characters. Sure, it's corny Disney fluff, but that's my kind of entertainment.Robby Ray has strong family values, and he's not going to put up with any more nonsense from his daughter. It's a good message, especially in a world where teenage girls walk all over their clueless sitcom fathers. Well, this sitcom father has had enough.Margo Martindale gives a fine performance, especially in one scene. She's not going to put up with her granddaughter thinking she's too good for small town life and the friends she has grown up with.We have the stock Disney villain in Barry Bostwick. But I saw him in "Spin City" and know he's better than this. And of course the tabloid reporter who is a villain in his own way, going out of his way attempting to discover Hannah's secret. He has bubbly teen daughters who are obsessed fans who he has put in a strict Catholic school, and they're good for a few laughs.And eventually the message gets through to Miley. But of course we have the standard deception story lines and the frantic switching back and forth between characters which I've seen done better, but it's still entertaining. I particularly liked seeing an attempt to make Lily pass as Hannah.There's not much here that I would call music, but there's a lot that I would. I have mixed feelings about Miley Stewart's attempt to mix rap with banjos. The banjos I like. And in a scene that embarrasses Miley, family and friends perform what I would call good country music. There are a couple of good country songs. Even Taylor Swift does something that passes for country. Then we have Rascal Flatts, who sound surprisingly country on their instruments, but I can't get past the fact that their atrocious vocals sound like 'N Sync.No one's winning awards for this. It's just fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i went into the cinema expecting to have made the greatest mistake of my cinema movie watching "career". i wasn't wrong. the truth is i have always been indifferent about the "Hanna Montana" brand. but seeing the poster of the movie alone tells the expected "weakness" of the movie. the movie is simply a children movie. extremely predictable and childish. it doesn't even deserve the "general" rating. its more of an Under 13 movie. but the surprising thing is that my friends enjoyed it. why? they were expecting something extremely terrible, but they found out it wasn't that bad. so if you want to watch it, adopt a similar mentality. you probably would like it. as far as i'm concerned, Hanna Montana doesn't have a quality musical voice (in fact, the other performer in the local fund raiser during the movie showed how floppy her vocals are). the story starts extremely childish, peaks around the middle (it was a little funny), but as it was seeming to be a decent movie, the end screws it all over!!! for heaven's sake, how can you tell me a whole neighborhood could not tell the difference between a girl with a blonde wig and one without it! then they make very fundamental mistakes. the there are also very unnecessary scenes (like were they were looking for Hanna during their meeting with the mayor, and running in and out of the hotel building). in summary, this movie is for children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannah Montana: The Movie (2009): Dir: Peter Chelsom / Cast: Miley Cyrus, Billy Ray Cyrus, Emily Osment, Jason Earles, Melora Hardin: Based on the popular TV series, the feature film focuses on the person behind the music. After being in the spotlight Hannah Montana spends two weeks in her home town where everything depends on people not knowing who she is when her wig is off. Rushed premise deteriorates into predictable storytelling. Directed by Peter Chelsom with some good musical numbers. Chelsom's trek record is spotted at best. Among his credits are Shall We Dance and The Mighty. Miley Cyrus pulls off the duo job of star and hometown girl. It is recycled material but her enthusiasm scores points. Billy Ray Cyrus plays her father who will find romance but no where does he find a way to make this guy interesting. There is even the guy whom Montana will find romance with whom will go through the motions until he realizes that he loved the real her. Give me a break already. Flat supporting roles by Emily Osment and Jason Earles. Melora Hardin makes an appearance as Billy Ray's romantic interest and one could imagine that she wishes to be on the set of The Office instead. The film examines Montana's roots while story never really takes off. In fact it is all geared as a bad promotion for a TV show that will be every bit as remembered as Lizzy Maguire in a few years.

		<fullReview>I've never seen the TV show, but I thought this movie was cute, but definitely aimed for young girls. It had more comedy then I expected and was amusing. Since it is Disney, of course it's going to be cheesy. Like why was Rascal Flatts in this and why did Taylor Swift make a 10 second appearance. I'm surprised Miley would even allow them to be in the film since they can sing and she's not much of a singer. And none of the songs were catchy except the Hoedown song. The songs in the film had substance similar to cotton candy, by that I mean no thought just silly fluff.FINAL VERDICT: Only for fans of the TV show.</fullReview>

It could have something to do with my younger cousins making me watch the show all the time, but either way I think she's great.

		<fullReview>The setting for this movie should have been Wisconsin, not Tennessee because there was more cheesy cliché's than you could count. I took my 12 year old daughter to this and have seen many movies with her including the Lizzie McGuire movie (which i found very entertaining) and this was just plain bad. There were a few funny moments but for the most part it was just bad rip offs of the 3 stooges type comedy like the brother getting caught in the revolving door while everyone was going in and out. I thought Disney had a chance to really make a point of never forgetting where your roots are remembering your family comes first but they sadly missed the boat on both accounts instead focusing weakly on how Hannah is more important than being true to yourself. A very disappointing movie though I'm sure the kids enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given that the entire Hannah Montana franchise is for kids and/or pre-teens, then I never actually have seen anything from it aside from the merchandise in stores. Then one day in 2015 they showed the movie on TV, and I decided to hang around to watch it as there was nothing else worthwhile watching.And I must say that I was quite surprised with it. The story was actually quite OK, keeping in mind the target audience. And Miley Cyrus actually performed quite well.Without being familiar with the TV series, then I can say that "Hannah Montana: The Movie" was a fun and entertaining movie that can be watched regardless of your age. Sugar-coated and predictable, yes, but still fun enough.As for the cast, well they were doing good jobs with their given roles and characters. The most familiar faces were Barry Bostwick and Vanessa Williams, who could, in my opinion, have been given more screen time.This movie did tear down some assumption-based opinions about the franchise for me, although I don't plan to watch the series just because the movie was better than anticipated.</fullReview>

It shows that lies can hurt the ones you love and the power of forgiveness. Miley Cyrus may be running amok right now but that doesn't take away from the fact that she is a gifted performer.(Just watch her appearances on SNL.) The soundtrack is great.

		<fullReview>Hannah Montana: The Movie is a film based on the TV series Hannah Montana, which is about a young girl named Miley Stewart who lives a double life. One as a normal teenage girl, the other as a talented, widely popular, world famous superstar, named Hannah Montana. The show is a low-budget, 20 minute show that is made by and featured on the Disney Channel. It is heavily aimed at young girls between the ages of 6-14.I saw the rating on IMDb (currently at 4.0) and got prepared to hate this movie... but I didn't. I didn't even find myself bored. Admittedly, although I'm not that old (turned 20 last month), I do not fill the bill to be in Hannah Monana's target audience (though I am watching the entire series). So I am judging it based on what this film is meant to be for young girls who are fans of the show.Many, many people complained that this movie was unrealistic, cliché, and predictable. Also about Miley Cyrus's acting, the music featured in the film, as well as its sense of humor.What the heck did you expect, and what more do you want?If anything, I was impressed! Perhaps partly because I went in with very low expectations, also because I only take it seriously in what I want for television made for children. Here's why: The concept of Miley Stewart's double life is explored, exposed and explained in ways that the creators could not have done on the show. The relationships between the characters are taken on a whole new level, whereas it's not only sweet and endearing, but also very simple and easy to understand for children. It is truly and simply a drama for kids.I think Hannah Montana presents a lot of good values for children, and I'm happy to say that if I had kids who wanted to watch this series again and again, I would have absolutely no problem with that. I have some reasons why...For one thing, as opposed to a lot of young female protagonists on television, while Miley Stewart may not be one of my favorites, I am absolutely, positively pleased that she is far from being a perfect girl. Miley is sweet and means well. She's relatively smart and knows how to get what she wants. She's also very talented and has made her way around Hollywood to be popular and loved by all*. HOWEVER! She can also be selfish, rude, shallow, unrealistic, and overbearing. In addition to that, although she may be down-to-earth most of the time, tends to struggle with this, due to her double life as a diva. Not only does this help her image become more attainable (as attainable as an superstar-in- disguise could be), but also gives young girls a good role model that teaches them that while you should be good and kind, being selfish, jealous, dorky, lazy, and so many other things is completely normal and a part of your life. Also that what defines your personality is how much you grow, and learning to admit your mistakes and apologize, rather than try to be perfect from the get-go, which is impossible.A recurring lesson in Hannah Montana: Family and friends are important. Always be there for each other, love one another unconditionally. Don't let boys stand between you and your friends, support your loved ones when they are dealing with difficult things, and, most importantly, listen to each other.More lessons that were put under the spotlight in this movie: Being honest with everybody is being honest with yourself, follow your dreams, nothing should come in the way of a true friendship. Find your home, and you'll always find your way back to it, so matter what.Unlike so many other western movies I've been watching that are for kids, this movie is filled with love. Fathers singing with and cuddling their daughters seems to be cliché, but is put here without a second thought. Communities showing support seems to be out of style, but Miley's family and town people are kind. I appreciate this movie bringing these things back to my screen. It may not be realistic, but it reminds me of being an innocent kid.Now, for the quality of the movie... I loved the directing. Yes, even the melodramatic revolving door scene, which I think was perfect, because it advanced the entire plot in about 1 minute and was very easy to understand without having to include any words at all.Miley's acting was NOT good... but who cares? Everybody else was average. I've seen much worse, and kids definitely don't care.The songs were perfectly fine. I suppose my only critique for the songs is that the "Hannah Montana" songs ("Let's Do This", "Let's Get Crazy", etc) fall completely flat. They are all just about dressing up and having fun. I suppose that while the Hollywood lifestyle is glamorized a little bit, the focus falls on Miley, not Hannah, which makes it tolerable.Featuring country pop songs from other artists (Rascal Flatts, Taylor Swift) as well as 12 brand new pop songs by Miley Cyrus, I thought the soundtrack fit the mood perfectly. Some of the maturity in this film can be found in beautiful songs, which are "The Climb" and "Butterfly Fly Away", respectively.I didn't enjoy the jokes... but I'm capable to stop thinking about myself for a moment and realize that it was perfect for kids.I will end this review by saying that Hannah Montana: The Movie is better than the 2013 animated Disney feature, Frozen, so all you folks who gave this a bad rating because it was "immature" or "uninteresting" can go to heck. Feel free to fight me at feel-free-to-fight-me@g-mail.com. (Without dashes.)*This is strictly based on how the show presents the character of Hannah Montana.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a chap living in Britain there is many films to watch and enjoy. I did not find enjoyment from the American hillbilly singing pile of rubbish called Hannah Montana. The plot sucked, the actors sucked and the entire movie sucked. I took my loving daughter, Steve to this film and I pulled her out of the cinema because it was that bad. Complete rubbish and I'd have a better time sipping at tea than watching this movie. I waisted my money on this crap and I even called my credit card company to remove the charge. Every so often I this movie comes along on Cable and I just turn it off so dear Steve could not drop IQ points by watching this rubbish. I recently purchased an Xbox 360 for personal use.

		<shortDescription>Very few movies are truly "realistic".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading all of the negative comments reminds me of all the people that I've watched other movies with. They spend the whole time "judging" the movie, looking for flaws and comparing the movie to other movies. I hate inviting them out to movies or inviting over when a bunch of us get together to watch a movie. They simply suck. They are absolutely no fun and typically ruin or complain about 99% of the movies they see. When you finally find a movie that they consider to be "realistic" or "great", it's the most bizarre abstract piece of crap that is truly only realistic in an alternate world that has no possibility of being reality. In the case of one of my kids who didn't like the movie for the sake of realism, she loves to watch those "reality TV" shows. Wow, yeah...those are "real". They are paid performers with a contract.This movie wasn't advertised as a "reality" show so it's not trying to be something that it isn't. Hannah Montana: The Movie, guess what, it's a MOVIE about Hannah Montana who ISN'T a REAL PERSON anyway. We all work with people that are completely different when they are away from the office or around another group. Does that mean that they aren't real or does it simply mean you don't know them enough? If you've watch the HM series on Disney, you have to realize that the movie can't be so dramatically different where the characters' personalities don't line up with the series that kids are familiar with. Keeping this in mind, Miley's performance, funny facial expressions, etc are typical of her character. I'm sure most of us that have reviewed the movie don't _truly_ know Miley at a personal level by being with her several days out of the week, days on end. It's hard to say whether or not the "Miley" portions of the movie are realistic or not. They might not be "realistic" based on who you are, but is your name in the credits? As a father of 5, the song "Butterfly" was extremely touching and her performance in "The Climb" was very very powerful. Listen to the song people! She is very dynamic her singing. You cannot tell me that she "cannot sing". Have you people ever watched American Idol! OMG.Her performance and singing in many parts of the movie were very well done. I'm sure most that commented on the movie are not in the business of acting AND singing AND playing an instrument on screen or in concert everyday. From my point of view, I will give Miley high marks for what she's accomplished and done in her young life. There's a huge difference when you have a movie actor who is playing the role of a "singer" in a movie and has no foundation in music or performing as a singer/song writer. At least Miley knows what it's like and has been exposed to what it takes to put on a _real life_ production concert in the _real world_. Unlike her concert movie, most of the performance related shots were simplified.There have been a lot of young singers/actors from Disney that have come and gone. If they don't have talent, they don't make it far once they are out from under Disney's wings. I completely agree with those comments, however; I don't believe this is one of those cases.Was the movie "an amazing" movie? No. Was it realistic, many parts were. My wife has met Rascal Flatts, she's performed at the Grand Ole Opre, she's met Taylor Swift and others. The "jam" session where they are just playing songs and singing on the porch, maybe it's not always a porch, but it happens a lot.What was wrong with it? As much as I like Billy Ray's song "Back to Tennessee", his acting ability is something that I will agree with EVERYONE who has said it is monotone and flat. But, if you've seen the HM series, he's right on target and definitely didn't redefine his character in this movie. :) What else? I agree with the person who commented about the reporter keeping his mouth shut or even someone in the "hometown" not blowing the whistle. But wait! Is this the first movie that I've ever seen in my entire life that didn't wrap up EVERY possible situation up? (not bashing the original commentator because the observation was good) Hopefully when Disney decides to retire Hannah Montana, the final movie (as much as most of you will hate it, I'm sure that all of you will end up watching it once :) ) could be triggered by the reporter or a "hometown" person leaking the information. Who cares, it's a kid's movie. I think most adults "expect" people to be back-stabbers or anticipate someone to ruin the moment. Why? Experience.For the target audience, they are young kids, they don't live every day of their young lives with their guard constantly up, waiting for someone to hurt them. It's still an ideal world out there for them with a lot of hope and good things.The movie is a very simple, funny at times, odd at times (Jackson's story line, with the DVD deleted scenes, makes sense. What happens to him -Alligator- is typical based on the series, so as odd as it is, it fits the "character") and has a few very touching moments.Watch the movie for what it is, a Disney movie. It's not The Titantic or Avatar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannah Montana the Movie ironically suffers from the popularity of its pop icon star, resulting in some prejudging from viewers who may be somewhat jaded by the Hannah Montana franchise. It's target audience, young girls, can see beyond that to what has made Hannah Montana such a phenomenal success - the incredible talent of Miley Cyrus and of course the music, which is this movie's other big selling point. There are so many memorable and notable songs, including one from Taylor Swift. As for the comedy, Jackson's (Jason Earls) sight gangs break up the monotony, and Miley herself has some entertaining comedic moments. It may seem a bit overused at times, but the movie's aim is not heavy drama. It succeeds as entertainment for its primary audience. Sure, there are some faults, but Hannah/Miley's revelation at the end and the incredible music are redeeming enough to warrant a high rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who complains about this movie's premise being "unrealistic" is not qualified to comment on it. Come on. It's a Disney movie! Was "Flubber" or "The Love Bug" realistic? This film is not high drama, looking for Oscar nominations. It doesn't pretend to be, or aspire to be. It's supposed to be fun, and it is. I am admittedly not the target demographic for this material, but it was cute, even so. And Miley Cyrus is beautiful, and has a lot of poise here. She sings well, even if she isn't Marnie Nixon. She doesn't pretend to be, and probably doesn't aspire to be. Her TV show, and by extension, this movie, is silly fluff, and there is nothing wrong with that. Chill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not "Citizen Cane." This is not "The Shawshank Redemption." This is not "Schindler's List." This is a Hannah Montana movie. It's an extension of the show. I don't disagree, really, with anything negative that anyone else posted. Poor acting, alleged plot, obnoxious kids, boring, overused story - but that's the show, too. If you (or your kids) like Hannah Montana, then they will like this movie. It's not for you, it's for them.I, for one, am cheering for the continued success of HM/MC. I would hate to think that Billy Ray Cyrus prostituted her childhood in a pathetic attempt to rescue his owned failed career with no success. I've always wanted to say that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit,I'm not a big Miley Cyrus fan.I personally do not think she is very talented,but it's enough for the targeted audience.This movie focuses on Miley Stewart(Cyrus),letting her alter ego Hannah Montana take control of her life and is sent back to Tennessee to her Grandma Ruby's farm. I'll admit,throughout various parts of the movie I was cringing at Miley's acting or singing.But I think this movie is a good movie for Hannah fans,and they will be satisified,especially that she is still Hannah,even after revealing her secret.The ending was poorly written,I'll say,though. Overall it's OK for children between ages 5-11.</fullReview>

I'm 16 years old, and i went and saw this movie, because i thought it looked alright and i was curious to see how it went. and i actually really liked it. i laughed at all the funny bits. and i even cried, not sure at what though, because their wasn't really any really sad scenes, but i was bawling my eyes out. i think it presented a lot of morals, and a lot of things about people trying to be someone there not for all the wrong reasons, like popularity or money. i really did enjoy this movie, and i recommend it to anyone looking for a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was this...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what happened when they were making this movie. The fact that someone actually allowed this to be screened and shown to the general public never ceases to amaze me. Right, first of all, Ms Miley Cyrus has no acting talent. None. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure she is a lovely young lady, I'm just saying that she should not be on screen. Ever. This was one of the flattest, most 2 dimensional acting performances I have ever seen. There is next to no character development at all in the movie. Miley, realising this, is forced to resort to using over-dramatic, rather unnecessary arm movements and yell a lot. The yelling makes you look at the screen at least. In stark contrast, Billy Ray Cyrus barely reacts at all to anything that is happening. He appears to almost fall asleep in about three different scenes. This wears off on the audience. I would have been in dreamland had it not been for my popcorn. It does not even occur to poor old Billy Ray to start yelling. Instead he uses hillbilly humour. Yay. Some of the minor characters and supporting actors/tresses at least try their best to amuse the audience, like the ever so grand Vanessa Williams, who almost always delivers the goods. Now, the music. Hannah Montana is supposed to be about a Pop superstar. For a Pop superstar, Miley Cyrus has a shockingly poor voice, although i assume most of you would know that from watching the delightful TV series. None of the songs in this part-musical have any sort of competence about them. Except for perhaps "The Climb," which at least provides some kind of thought provocation and meaning and is the only song worth playing a second time. But that is it.If you can ignore the obvious plot holes, like how an entire town fails to realise that a brunette and a brunette with a blonde wig are the same person, then at least you may be spared a bit of the torture and be able to make witty remarks and jokes throughout the film to your friends, who will no doubt be watching it with you. If you watch this film alone, you will go insane.Well done, Disney. You have successfully degenerated into low quality trash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a 25 years old grown man, with a settled up life, i just enjoyed and totally loved this movie. Why? Because i achieved something in my life, not what i always dreamed about, but something... and this movie made me think about what am i about to loose.. DREAMS! We always dream, and this girl just reminds about not loosing your morale, and always fight for something you always wanted.Bad acting you say? What? ... What? What did you expect? I just do not understand what people mean by "bad" acting! Like, i do, but not in this case. I'd never say that she was bad at her role, she did just awesome acting as a famous teenager. She was just great! The movie has a lot of family life involved, as well as friendship between two girls. Which gives it a "must see" for those who feel lonely.So anyway, if you are looking for an inspiring movie, it's the one for you.Commented by a simple man.When did you last talk to your parents, grandparents? Four months for me. Made me think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannah Comes Home</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The legion of fans that Hannah Montana has guaranteed a built in audience for the Disney Studio when they decided to take the show from the small to the big screen. All the people from the TV show are there with a few new additions, none of whom ever made it back to the small screen.Especially Lucas Till who was introduced as a new love interest for Miley Cyrus as Miley Stewart aka Hannah Montana. I really thought at some point they would bring him into the TV series, but I guess he didn't want to leave Tennessee.Which brings us to the film, the pressures of leading that double life get a bit too much for Miley/Hannah and her dad Billy Ray Cyrus decides that a trip to Tennessee might be just the thing especially as her maternal grandmother will be having a big birthday bash. Vicki Lawrence plays her paternal grandma on some episodes of the TV series, but the grandmother here is played nicely by Margo Martindale.The villain of the piece is developer Barry Bostwick who wants to put a strip mall and gut the small town of Crowley's Corners Tennessee. The local folks can't raise the money until a certain well known celebrity from the town lends a hand.If you read my review of the TV show it is one of the most ludicrously premised shows ever done. The relentless paparazzi would have tracked down Hannah's double life by the third episode in real life. However on the plus side as I also stated Miley Cyrus is a lovely young lady with a terrific singing talent and the film's biggest asset is just that.Not a great film, but Miley's fans will love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for its target audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miley Cyrus' hit Disney Channel TV show gets its cinematic movie adaptation in the form of 2009's Hannah Montana: The Movie. The plot is pretty simple and run-of-the-mill. Miley's pop star alter-ego Hannah Montana is taking over Miley's life far too much for her Dad's liking so he packs up and takes his daughter back home to Tennessee for some "Hannah Detox".I'm fully aware that this movie is aimed at a young audience and their families so I'll be reviewing it for entertainment value for families. In truth it's not as bad as the majority of critics make it out to be. In terms of fan value it's not all it could be. Miley's grandma isn't played by the same actress as in the show which could confuse some sharp-minded kids and raise questions.There are some pretty funny scenes in there though and the acting isn't as bad as I expected it to be. It's really all about the music though. Two of the released songs really stand out: The Climb and Hoedown Throwdown, the latter being used in a big dance scene, obviously using professional dancers but still a great scene.There are some cameos in there: Tyra Banks appears as herself at the beginning of the movie, Taylor Swift performs at a community event and Vanessa Williams (Ugly Betty's Wilhelmina Slater) plays Vita, Hannah's personal assistant.There are some better movies out there, but there are some that are much worse. Give it a shot.http://ukmore.tk/</fullReview>

But a 3 rating for this movie is retarded. you've got comedy, romance, good music, nice girls, Disney may be the devil but they do hire people who know how to do their job. the songs are good pop-rock'n'roll-country songs if you do know anything about music, who cares if they're written by the devil, they're good. anybody who has played in a rock band will agree with that. the movie is also good, nothing new but good, unless you hold a grudge against life. if you do, it's your own fault, get a better life, instead of vomiting your hate on hannah montana.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite surprised!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably one of the most memorable songs of 2009 was Miley Cyrus' hit 'The Climb' which was later covered by X Factor 2009 winner, Joe McElderry and was the official song to the Hannah Montana movie but was the movie really all that memorable? Miley Stewart (Miley Cyrus) is starting to forget who she really is because of being Hannah Montana (Miley Stewart's alter-ego) all of the time so to make sure she doesn't forget who she is and where she comes from, her father (Miley Cyrus' real-life father, Billy Ray Cyrus) decides to take her on a trip to visit Tennessee where she originally came from.The story is surprisingly pretty good and is actually quite entertaining for a family audience and it sends the usual squeaky-clean message that Disney usually sends with their movies about learning who you are. Apart from learning about her roots and where she came from, the movie also covers about growing up and dealing with Miley's first love along with juggling her super-secret life. The acting in the movie was above average and Miley Cyrus gave out a good performance sometimes but other times it got a little bad. Billy Ray Cyrus gave out a great performance as the father of the teen who is there to lend her a hand and give her advice. Also, Lucas Till who played Travis shouldn't go unnoticed either. The locations where the movie was shot were nice to the eye, such as the countryside and the farm and also the cast were just right for this movie.The songs were actually great and if you're a country fan, you would appreciate and love the songs in the movie. My particular favourites was Crazier by Taylor Swift and Back To Tennessee by Billy Ray Cyrus. I have only watched one episode of the show and there's one more thing I don't get and that is how nobody knew Hannah Montana is Miley Cyrus/Stewart and that kind of annoyed me. All she did was put on a blonde wig and that was it! If you look in the trailer or the movie poster, she looks exactly the same except for the hair colour, nothing else and yet absolutely no-one in the movie knew or guessed it was her. Still, that's only a little bit I found annoying from the movie. Fans of the show will adore the movie but non-fans may not appreciate it as much.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not at all bad I thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to start of by saying that this was not an all bad movie. I am a 20 year old male, and maybe like some of you I love to watch movies in all shapes, forms and colors. This movie has had a lot of complaint, on this forum as well as others. Well as many others have stated before me, its target audience is not adults! So if you don't get it, don't beat yourself up about it. Another complaint has been Mileys (and maybe others) acting in this movie. I can agree that on the show Hannah Montana they lack great acting (Except maybe Mitchel Musso and Mosies Arias). But in this movie the acting was nothing half bad. In fact I find the acting good. There isn't much to blame. I mean Miley Cyrus plays Miley Stewart, a character based on her and Billy Ray plays Robbie Ray who is also based on him. They play as themselves and no one is too much or to short on acting. The plot is decent enough simple for a children's movie but although not very original.It's a feel good film with good messenges about the ups and downs of things, and as the whole show it deals with "To follow your heart" and "Do the right thing". Might not be original, but messenges like it is needed, because although over exposed very few people follow the advice. I know watching Hannah Montana as a whole has changed me in many ways even though I always "hated" it all before I actually took time to watch it. I recommend the move to all ages and sexes but keep an open mind and think hard about what is said and you might come out wiser than before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hannah Montana: The Movie" had me firmly on its side?until the members of the country music trio Rascal Flatts showed up as, get this, three of Miley's relatives who lead the family in sing-alongs. It is the type of cheesy scene that, even if you like their music, makes you want to laugh?although not in a good way. From that point, this film, the big-screen adaptation of Disney's hugely-popular television show, had to do whatever it could to win me back. Fortunately, aside from a silly alligator attack and an all too sappy ending, it manages to mainly succeed. Much of the credit for this success can be directly attributed to its leading young lady, Miley Cyrus, who gives a spirited and charming performance. She is essentially playing herself in a role that she has been perfecting since 2006, so the chance of this film being her career-defining moment is slim but, regardless of how insignificant this performance will doubtlessly seem in the grand scheme of things, she deserves credit for making this film as good as it is.Read My Full Review Exclusively At: www.thecinemaview.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A TV phenomenon hits the big screen....and it's awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an 18 year old guy I'm probably not in the intended target audience for a film like Hannah Montana: The Movie, but I love Miley Cyrus (she's gotta be the most beautiful &amp; talented person to ever come out of the Disney Channel) and have enjoyed watching episodes of the TV series on Disney over the last few years, so there was no question as to whether or not I was going to see this. I wasn't sure how well it'd translate to the big screen but I have to say I was more than pleasantly surprised.Yes it's full of plot holes and inconsistencies. No the acting won't win anyone any Oscars. And yes it takes a bit of suspension of disbelief to get over the idea that people don't realise Miley is Hannah Montana just because she dons a blonde wig. But what this film is, is a light hearted, comedic adaption of the TV series that at its heart has a great message. It's full of laughs but also moments that can make viewers teary eyed and it's backed by some great music (if you were impressed by the songs in the movie then I recommend checking out the soundtrack album; full of great tunes and the best out of all the Hannah Montana CD's). It's different from the show just enough to be able to stand on its own and be viewed without having to have seen any episodes of the series beforehand, but it's also similar enough to appeal to long time fans while helping to set up and continue story lines seen in season 3.For fans used to seeing the action take place on small studio sets the film looks stunning, being filmed in both LA and Miley's birthplace Tennessee. All the locations were really well used and were made the most of, the only downside to this being that the next time you see the show the sets do look slightly pathetic in comparison. Apart from this though Hannah Montana: The Movie is a funny and entertaining film that can be enjoyed by all ages (and both genders). So just sit back, relax, put your critical snobbery to one side for 90 minutes and enjoy the show!</fullReview>

Im the movie Miley takes it too far when she tackles a famous model and misses her brothers graduation. She also almost forgets about her best friends birthday party. Because of this she must go and live back in her home town of Tennessee. At first she hates it but learns to enjoy when she finds her friend from way back when who she has a crush on. Unfortunately the pressure of her double life increases and something dramatic happens that could change her life forever. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a touching story.</fullReview>

The story-looks like it was written for a half hour series and feels a bit too stretched.But the screenplay was even worse-was supposed to be a musical comedy i think-does not hit the mark-was not impressed by humor at all.Humor in form of caricature of a character by mannerism may have worked on TV but in a commercial movie it fails miserably.Then the acting...except a few in the supporting cast acting was below ordinary and in case of the lead-terrible.Lines-again,changes in intonation is supposed to be subtle to have a lesser impact on actors and maximum impact on the audience-prolonged usage kills the joke and the joker making acting look poor.Having songs for 20-25 mins of the play time helps matters though.A couple of numbers are hum worthy.Must have been a made for TV movie with a small budget.We have seen the HSM franchise move from TV to the screens.Looks like this will have to move the other way around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this film is as bad as they get!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>as you cant give films 0 stars i gave it 1 but it's still god dam awful. Hannah Montana or Miley Cyrus is the hill billy of all hill billies and cant act or sing. its as simple as that. DON'T WATCH THIS FILM! its physically impossible to be a singer and normal for one she still has the same face and people will recognise her. also her voice is still the same and when she talks you would know its her and finally its just seriously unlikely. i can not stand her dad. HE MAKES ME ANGRY. no one in that film can act seriously i must have been a really cheap film to make because the actors wouldn't have wanted much money it looks like they just picked them up off the streets. they probably did it for free just to get on TV. REALLY POORLY MADE FILM?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie with Heart...Not Unflawed, but Not What Everyone Makes It Out To Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most hilarious part of reading all the negative reviews for this particular movie is that even though all these guys are trying to be with the cool kids and snark on Hannah Montana, clearly they all have sought out, paid money for, and watched this movie. Who's the joke really on, guys?Look, I'm a man in my mid-30s. I'm not embarrassed to say I watched this movie and that I enjoyed it. Don't get me wrong; I wasn't optimistic going into it. But "Hannah Montana: The Movie" surprised me with its emotional depth. Far from being just a silly kid's flick, there is actual heart to the story, and by the end of the movie--provided you get over your pretentiousness and whatever antipathy you have for Miley Cyrus, the actor--it's really easy to be caught up in what the characters are feeling and to really care about them.Is there silly stuff? Well, sure. This isn't a documentary about concert promotion, after all. It's a comedy meant to be accessible to all ages. Folks who were looking for "Hannah Montana: Buckets of Blood" are clearly going to be disappointed. If you expect the movie to answer existential theories or postulate about the meaning of life, then yeah, you're gonna leave somewhat empty-handed. My one gripe about the movie is that the credits should have rolled immediately after the performance of "The Climb." If the movie had stopped right there, it would have been perfect. I understand that they needed to leave an open ending to continue the TV series, but I thought the ending did sort of undermine the value that the rest of the movie until that point had been trying to illustrate: being true to oneself. Instead, after Miley has not only come to grips with who she is, but also with how her Hannah side is quite frankly destructive to her life, she is railroaded by the rest of the cast into keeping up the lie. The film's message had been pretty clear up until then: living a double life can never make you happy, and it's best to be honest. And suddenly, there's an about-face that says "hey, lying's OK, nay, it's the only way you can truly be happy." Were it my movie to edit, I would've left the movie to end at "The Climb," allowed the sleazy tabloid reporter to out Miley, only with Miley not caring, because she finally was OK with herself.Still and all, not a bad little film, and certainly not deserving of the bile that gets vomited on it here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A family movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Teen super star Hanna Montana takes her wig off and goes home to her home town of Crowley Corners in this movie. She finds her value reprioritized after spending her time with her family and childhood acquaintances. I've just watched this movie out of curiosity as all my family is way too grown up to be its intended target audiences, but I thought the movie was very good for its intended preteen audiences. It follows the Disney formula of wholesome family value, and pulls on the heart strings of young preteen girls of romance, fame, talent and success. Not to mention privilege of having great time shopping at an expensive Beverly Hills boutique. Hanna and Miley has it all, everything a young girl can hope and wish for, and this is what this movie is all about.You shouldn't watch this movie as anything more or you will be disappointed. I mean the entire purpose of Hanna Montana is to cater to this audience. Ordinary family movie done in extravagant way only Disney can sums up this ordinary but extraordinarily expensive movie.I'd have to mention that Lucas Till as Travis looked great in this movie.5/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>made for little girls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Listen people I am a hardcore movie critic and I scrutinize every aspect and every angle of every movie I watch. This movie is certainly not a masterpiece. However it was never made to be a masterpiece either. Just a Friday night fun movie for little girls who dream of a superstar life. That's it. Stop thinking beyond this point.I know the acting is awful and there is a lot of overacting involved but I guess it works for the audience it is meant to please. Hence people just clam down and stop being so judgmental. This is obviously not a movie for anyone beyond the age of 12 years. I bet 90% of all little girls who watched this movie would have tried the "pop it zig zag" dance. See, it's as simple as that.So if you have kids under the age of 12 go to the movie because they'll enjoy it. But take a PSP with you so that you can play it while your kids enjoy the movie. which they certainly will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My kids and I loved it.It was especially fun seeing them in a different local besides the California set.The country flair was great.While she juggles between her life as a superstar and a regular girl, it does get hectic for her and you do feel sorry for her. And her father, tells the girl that he likesthat he can't take time to have a relationship, because he needs to watch after his daughter. So watch it with your kids. Another family friendly movie.

I actually loved the songs however cliché some of them may seem. The story? I didn't think much of it, some plot holes were a little too big to ignore.

		<shortDescription>Not excruciatingly painful as we expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend Destiny texted me yesterday and asked if I wanted to see this movie. I was bored, and had nothing better to do, so I went. Upon arriving at the theater, I noticed about 84% of the audience was under 10/a parent with a child under 10. About 14% were teenagers (like us) and the other 2% were creepy middle aged people. That being said, I did not have high expectations.It opened with a stampede to a Hannah Montanna concert followed by Miley Cyrus and her little friend stealing a security cart. "Haha," we said. "How unfunny."The only characters we like were the creepy reporter guy and of course the hot cowboy.We could NOT stop laughing at the stereotypical way southern farms/families were presented. We live in a very rural part of Texas, and I live on a farm, but my whole family doesn't gather in the living room to sing.Also the cowboy's chicken coop was really awesome. It had an EGG for a door. AN EGG PEOPLE!Anyway, we give it 5/10 for some funny parts and the hot cowboy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I entered the theater that day, unknowing of the horrors that awaited me in the depths of movie hell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, i must say that was pretty damn awful. I'm sure all the 7 year old girls were mad that Miley's (I'm sorry, miley's-her name doesn't deserve to be capitalized)father was trying to stop her from being hannah montana, but all she was doing was being an obnoxious, self-centered, brat, and as far as i'm concerned, didn't deserve to even date that weird hick guy who she had the corny "love" scenes with. I was disgiusted with the way they attempted to somewhat villainize her father, although it gave the movie it's modern day Disney channel effect ("God daddy, why won't you let me be a bitch to everyone i've known and loved since birth??!!!! You're so mean to me!!!"). Also, Miley/Hannah (whoever the hell she is) can't act worth a damn. All she did was stand on stage, in the spotlight, and go on and on in her obnoxious, scratchy voice about how she can do what ever she wants, and how she's a freaking victim of something. That was the thing; she couldn't stop yelling in her annoying-as-hell scratchy hick voice, and it didn't get better worth a damn when she started "singing", if it can even be called that. Overall, a terrible movie. If you were going to see it tonight, spare yourself the expense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I'm not a Hannah Montana fan. I've never seen the TV series though I did know about the whole double life MileyisHannah plot twist. I went to the film with my sister who I thought would enjoy the music and humour. Neither of us was disappointed. I'll be brief with the plot description. Miley/Hannah's life has become too complicated so her Dad decides she needs to return to her roots. He tricks her into going back to Tennessee to visit her grandmother. There she learns a little about life, love and property development.The film has many positives. It is just the right length. Miley Cyrus has a good voice and is an entertainment natural who is likely to be appearing on our screens for a long time to come. The supporting cast are excellent. Okay Billy Ray can't act but kudos to Miley for giving her old man a job. The musical numbers and slapstick comedy are well done and Miley's experience from the TV series shines throughThere are no negatives to speak of. Any fan of the TV series won't be disappointed and it won't be an ordeal for any accompanying oldie.PS Wait for the end credits where you will see that Barry Bostwick is a pretty nifty dancer! PPS Surprised at all the negative comments on this site. It's Hannah Montana - The Movie. What were people expecting?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure its not Oscar worthy but hey I thought it was a nice film all about where you come from and that family is important NOT fame. The movie is based on the TV series of the same name. In the film version Miley Stewart's double life as a popstar named Hannah Montana takes over her life and she forgets the one thing thats important family. So her dad brings her back to Tennessee where she learns who she is as a ordinary teenager and not as her alter ego Hannah Montana. As she spends some quality time back in her old hometown she must choose who she wants to be Hannah or Miley?. The ending to this was awful but having said that I thought it was a nice film and Miley Cryus was great in it. The songs were great and the setting of Tennessee is outstanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great film for the whole family and when I watched it I loved it and it kept me very entertained. It had a lot of adventure a bit of comedy and the best music Miley Cyrus has produced. This film isn't perfect as it has the rude attitude and the hideous head move Miley does. What do you think you are doing Miley. Little girls who love you follow everything you do and they will say to their mums whatever and do a head move to them. Its wrong. This film would be really good without the usual Miley attitude.But there wasn't as much head moves/whatevers compared to the TV series.The positive side was she did pull off a great film and some great songs and a film which everyone will love. Miley Cyrus is very beautiful and has got a great future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect for the target audience...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Admittedly I'd only heard bits and pieces about the Hannah Montana franchise when I decided to pick it up on DVD to watch with the family, more out of curiosity than anything else. Of course Hannah Montana: The Movie runs like your typical Disney flick that originated on, or was made for, its television channel; that is, predictable and corny. However, as far as providing for the target audience is concerned, this film is spot on.Miley Cyrus provides an energetic performance, essentially taking on two roles as the title character and the girl behind the brand who wants to keep a normal existence while living it up as a celebrity. Hannah Montana faces a tough decision when she realises leading a secret double life is too much for her and those around her, and ultimately has to decide who she wants to be.Commenting on the cinematic qualities of any aspect of the film would be a pointless exercise considering the movie was made to keep a young, specific audience amused. At 18 I'm the youngest in a family of four, yet the film was fun, enjoyable and well worth a watch simply for the cameos from the likes of Tyra Banks (America's Next Top Model) and Taylor Swift alone. The soundtrack isn't great track after great track although there are some notable gems, including 'Hoedown Throwdown' and in particular 'The Climb', which in my opinion is a fantastic song. The setting of the film elevates the lead character's predicament while providing some beautiful visuals.In short, anyone considering watching this with youngsters or thinking about letting them see it should find that this is a light, family-friendly film that is nothing short of pleasant viewing, but not much more unless you're a young girl. And if you're not, like me...who are we to criticise it?8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie at my friends the day it came out. I couldn't wait to make fun of Hannah Montana at a farm. One sentence to sum up this whole movie? A stupid princess goes to a farm and falls in love with a farm boy where she has to give up one of her wonderful kingdoms to become a normal girl. So after an hour of this movie I couldn't help but stand up and leave. No thank you. This is the kind of movie that you'd rent with your friends and watch at 4 in the morning just to make fun of it all night. It's pretty amusing! Sadly I think it's the best acting Miley Cyrus has ever done. Pretty close. See for yourself... it's pretty hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannah Montana movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this movie was an obvious Disney advertisement opportunity, I loved it. It was refreshing to see a truerated G movie to take my girls to. My 15 year old even wanted to go and she's not a big Hannah Montana fan. The music was well placed and it was quite the concert event. Lots of country stars, action sequences, physical humor and pure, honest emotions in the acting. I'd watch it with my girls again. We love the CD soundtrack. I loved the fact that although there is a "love story" concept, it is not blown up as the main idea of the movie. The scenes showed a true depiction of how young teens should begin a relationship. Miley learns a good lesson and it's nice to watch how she arrives at her maturity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>its good for 4 year old's not 16</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to start of by saying that this was not an all bad movie. I am a 20 year old male, and maybe like some of you I love to watch movies in all shapes, forms and colors. This movie has had a lot of complaint, on this forum as well as others. Well as many others have stated before me, its target audience is not adults! So if you don't get it, don't beat yourself up about it. Another complaint has been Mileys (and maybe others) acting in this movie. I can agree that on the show Hannah Montana they lack great acting (Except maybe Mitchel Musso and Mosies Arias). But in this movie the acting was nothing half bad. In fact I find the acting good. There isn't much to blame. I mean Miley Cyrus plays Miley Stewart, a character based on her and Billy Ray plays Robbie Ray who is also based on him. They play as themselves and no one is too much or to short on acting. The plot is decent enough simple for a children's movie but although not very original.It's a feel good film with good messenges about the ups and downs of things, and as the whole show it deals with "To follow your heart" and "Do the right thing". Might not be original, but messenges like it is needed, because although over exposed very few people follow the advice. I know watching Hannah Montana as a whole has changed me in many ways even though I always "hated" it all before I actually took time to watch it. I recommend the move to all ages and sexes but keep an open mind and think hard about what is said and you might come out wiser than before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far better than people give credit for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people have already decided that Miley Cyrus is a spoiled brat who in a very short time has become a commercialized Disney diva, however, after seeing this film, I have to disagree. I found this film to be a real eye opener to Miley Cyrus herself. Yes, she has messed up in recent years, but then, she is only 16. Miley Cyrus and her character Miley Stewart are one in the same. This film does have the typical slapstick also seen in the television series. But this film lets the plot to go a little deeper than a half an hour show would allow. If you're a Miley Cynic, don't waste your time hating on this when you should have better things to do. If your a fan though, this will definitely not disappoint. Expect more than the television program can give.</fullReview>

To be fair I have to say that I didn't make it to the end, I ended up moving on to 17 Again after about half this films running time simply because my brain was full and my ability to deal with a bunch of insincere rich people trying to get in touch with what matters struck me as a hollow effort even if its well done.

It is almost a shame that wonderful Vanessa Williams agreed to even do this movie but I guess work is work. I doubt this movie will be remembered in five years. I do believe it is like the Lizzie McGuire movie of today. In two years most people won't even care. This script was very clichéd and slipshod. I did not find one bit of it convincing and if the songs were supposed to be the saving grace then that grace has run out. The music and the songs although most of them from Miley's actual albums although popular with the 8 to 14 crowd will be not considered quality compositions in the eyes of those that know true musical greatness. I would of preferred if she had written more original songs for this movie instead of recycling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I never liked Hannah Montana. Or at least I thought I didn't, and this is a problem that people have: many of them never saw the series or the movie, but they still say both are crap. It's a terrible habit and it's childish, but it happens. I went to see this movie with no expectations at all, it was just to see once and for all if it was as bad as I thought.Well I was wrong. I was surprised when I started laughing. I was surprised when I started to like Miley Stewart/Hannah a bit. I was surprised when I thought the songs were catchy. Didn't I hate Hannah Montana? Not so sure right now.I thought the acting was overall good. A little goofy sometimes, but hey, this movie is directed for children and teenagers, no one will care if the actors make a small mistake. Miley Cyrus is not a brilliant actress, but with a little extra work, she will get there.The story is interesting, it is about a teenager, Miley Stewart who is trying to life a double life. She lives as an ordinary college girl in her everyday life, but she is also Hannah Montana, one of the most famous pop stars in the world. But she's getting too obsessed with Hannah, so her father takes her to her hometown in Tennessee, to make her comeback to her true self. Of course people don't know she is Hannah Montana, as she wears a wig and makeup to cover her true identity. And this makes room to some of the funniest parts of the movie (for example when Miley has a date with a boy in a restaurant, but at the same time is invited to a party as Hannah, just a few blocks away. Then she runs from one place to the other in a rush, trying to be in two places at once, which obviously results in disaster.) Of one thing I'm sure: This movie doesn't deserve its current score (3,1/10). People have a terrible habit of either giving movies a 10/10 score when they like it, or 1/10 when they don't like it.This is not a brilliant movie, it's not the best Disney movie ever made, for sure. But it's still fun and entertaining, has a start, the development of the story and a pleasant ending.7/10- Sorry if I made any mistakes writing, English isn't my first language ;)</fullReview>

It also doesn't try to throw together crude jokes, or try to tone down being sickeningly sweet and I say BRAVO!! For the average movie goer to sit down and watch this movie they would find it laughably terrible but I will embrace anything that actually promotes sweetness and innocence because I had it as a child (usually with Disney films) and I want my kids to have it too. Does this make the movie good? NO! The movie still has to hold its own, have good characters, good story, and a movie like this just has to be fun! The silly slapstick comedy from the VERY cheesy show on Family Channel carries over into the film with even more heart. Some of the antics are actually laugh out loud funny. But certainly the emotion in the film is amped up and as with any great Disney movie there is an underlying moral message to learn from and Miley Cyrus is the phenomenon to pull it off.Much has been said about Miley Cyrus, good and bad. Regardless she has an enormous following. I also personally think she is very talented and has great charisma and it carries over into this film. I doubt that her role as Miley Stewart and Hannah Montana is probably not exactly a stretch from reality for her but she is still fun to watch. She is very down home and comfortable and fun to watch. She embraces her teenage awkwardness and has a great time on screen! Billy Ray Cyrus plays her Dad...hmmm weird...no big stretch there either. Billy Ray has that same down home quality that makes him fun to watch. I think the chemistry between him and Miley being real life daughter and father helps enormously for the two of them. Although I've only seen it in passing (I swear) I've noticed that Miley Stewart's brother in the show is overused, cheesy and annoying. Fortunately they toned him down to barely a passing cameo in the film for Jason Earles. Emily Osment also carries over from the TV cast as Miley's best friend. She is good in the part and is fun in her role but she certainly doesn't reach the level of Miley Cyrus and her personality doesn't quite carry the same weight. Lucas Till is Miley's love interest in the film. He is really quite excellent and while his character isn't stand out or get a lot of comedic moments he still is a good character and has great chemistry with Miley Cyrus. There is certainly a lot of other supporting characters and cameos and they all do a good job but ultimately the supporting cast does a lot of that...support the Cyrus' and none of them get the opportunity to stand out.I was actually surprised to see director Peter Chelsolm attached to directing this film. I would have expected a female director and someone with less experience to helm the film. Chelsolm has had a fair bit of experience and this film actually feels a little wishy washy for him. Still he tells a solid story and seems to work at making the film, story and characters a little less cheesy than the TV counterpart. I am almost sure that most adults won't be entertained by this movie but the cool thing about it is you can actually leave your kid watching this and be assured that its age appropriate and won't disappoint them. So while its not for everyone, it hits the demographic head on, its cute, and funny and showcases one of the pre-teens' biggest stars. Worth seeing if you like that kind of set up. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie (:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest i thought this movie was great. I've seen it twice all together and i found it funny and exciting to watch each time. Many of the people who dis this movie haven't even watched it to begin with! And that really annoys me. I know everyone is entitled to their opinion but u shouldn't judge movies before u watch. The plot is about a girl named Miley Stewart who lives a double life as world pop sensation Hannah Montana. Her dad Robbie Ray (billy Ray Cyrus) decides to take her back home to Tennesse because shes becoming more 'Hannah' and less 'Miley'. I recommend this for a family movie for all ages- and especially to those who like the DisneyChannel original show Hannah Montana. The music in this movie is also fantastic. It features the hit radio song "The Climb" and also the songs "Lets get crazy", "Hoedown Throwdown", "Crazier" (by Taylor Swift who is in the movie!!) and many more. I hope from what i've said u give Hannah Montana: The Movie a chance and see what u think about it (: Thankuuuuu xx</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute Disney movie, mostly cheesy but still fun to watch if you want to see what this "Hannah Montana" stuff is all about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miley Cyrus of course is Hannah Montana on stage and Miley Stewart in ordinary life. The blonde wig and the change of clothes disguise her identity as well as Clark Kent disguised Superman. You have to give some literary license.Billy Ray Cyrus of course is the dad, Robby Ray Stewart. And the best friend is Emily Osment as Lilly .The premise of the story is Miley is taking this Hannah Montana stuff too seriously and starting to neglect friends and family in her ordinary life. So, demanding a jet to take her to NYC for an appearance, instead she steps out from the Lear into a field in Tennessee, her home. Dad is determined to get her grounded again, before she can get back to her professional identity.So most of the movie is in Tennessee, with a lot of slapstick that for adults becomes tedious and predictable, but for youngsters is probably pretty funny. The big crisis is a development headed for their sleepy little community, and the townsfolks need to raise a lot of money to ward it off. So eventually the idea comes that a Hannah Montana concert could be their salvation.Through all this Miley has to juggle her two identities so that she can keep her secret, but in the end she puts her trust in the townpeople and her friends.Evaluating it strictly on technical merits and story it is not a great movie. But it is cute, and somewhat better than its current IMDb rating would suggest. For us it was a chance to get a glimpse of this Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana phenomenon, and it did that for us. She is a cute kid, and the duet sung with her dad near the end was for me a high point of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with Weldermommy. How sad does your life really have to be to sit on their computers and write a bad review for a movie that was aimed for children, what, 4-10? My 6 year old daughter loved the movie and as a mom, I thought it was cute. Nothing I would watch for myself, but I can sit with her and watch it, and even get a few laughs. Maybe her acting isn't developed to entertain an adult audience, but it sure entertained my daughter and just about all of the girls in her class. Or maybe she just didn't whip out her awesome acting skills because she wouldn't need them for this type of movie. If the movie was SO HORRIBLE to you, here's some advice- don't buy the DVD. Without your purchase, she'll still make more in an day than most of us make all year! My rating for this movie as an adult would probably be a 6 or 7, but I rated it a 10 for my daughter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that the bit about Hannah Montana not having a double life any more was upsetting because I thought there wasn't going to be a season 4 on TV. The bit about Miley singing her song to her dad was heartbreaking. I think some of the characters should have been in it for longer like Riiccccoo because he's very funny and was only in it for 2 minutes. I am glad that Hannah Montanta was wearing those yellow doctor marten boots as I have them as well! Just remember that Hannah Montana is aimed for children and not really for adults because my mum and dad took me and my mum liked seeing my reactions to it but my dad thought that it was better than the TV series but still not really that very good. I think the score should be higher more like 10 than 2. I LOVE Hannah Montana. Hannah Montana Rocks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one redeeming factor of the TV series was the humor. While it is clear Miley can't act her over the top acting does lend itself to humor. unfortunately that was almost completely absent from the script minus a few slapstick humor moments. The drama (of finding your self) that replaced this humor was lost in Miley's cheesy smiling and arm motions. Billy Ray on the other hand shows no emotion resulting in both of them missing the mark.The plot is predictable but so is every other Disney movie plot, what makes Disney movies great is the characters, characters you fall in love with and want to succeed. Miley/Hannah's character as well as Billy Rays characters fall dead. The story could be good, if you sympathized for miley/Hannah or Billy Ray but you don't, again because of the acting. In the show I always loved the side characters and felt they spiced the show (Jackson, Lily, Oliver, Rico), unfortunately you see them only briefly and all of the humor they usually bring is completely gone. Instead they are replaced by Miley's family and Travis(the love interest) which i felt made the movie boring and it dragged in parts.One upside to the movie is the music, if you like Hannah/Miley's music (which I admit to liking some songs) you will love the soundtrack and enjoy the concert parts in the movie.If you love Hannah Montana, and her music, I'm sure you'll love it. If you love the humor of the show or just want something to watch I'd skip this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fans for Miley Cyrus, so this film i absolutely must to watch it. I have watched it 3x. Maybe it's not the best film i have ever seen but it's the most pleasurable/satisfied film i have ever seen. I love Miley, she's great, charm, funny, natural, sexy, and have good voice. In this film Hannah Montana The Movie it's far better than the TV series. Hannah Montana The Movie it's funny (yeah maybe in some scene it's not funny). Drama is so powerful. Great acting by Miley Cyrus. This film is more serious and mature than the TV series. I really love many song in this film, The Climb, Dream, You'll Always Find Your Home, etc. This film always meaningful, it's have great quotes "Life is Climb, But The View is Good". So this film is very recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It delivered what it was supposed to</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came onto this board a couple of weeks before having just seen the movie about 20 minutes ago and I was really shocked at some of the hatred this movie had generated. I really just couldn't believe this move would be so bad it managed to score below 3 on the IMDb rating (though the majority of the ratings are from crusty old men).This movie, as overrated as it may be, is not actually anywhere near as bad as people make out. It leaps far beyond any other teen girl flick I have seen in the past 5 years. Hannah Montana: The Movie delivers what it should; which is an entertaining, funny and enjoyable teen flick for the girls and boys of 16 and under. People of rating this movie based on things it shouldn't be marked on. This movie is not an Oscar winning movie. It won't win the best awards for screen play, script and acting because it's not supposed to be that. This movie is supposed to be a "fun for the kids" type movie and that is exactly what it is; The story was well made, it contained moments of humour, the songs were catchy (example: Hoedown Throwdown), the acting was decent considering it's using a cast from a Disney show and the script and screenplay were spot on.If you are a girl/boy aged 16 and under and you don't like this movie: then you don't really like Hannah Montana. If you are a man/woman aged 20+ and you didn't like this movie: why the hell did you watch it anyway? Perhaps you walked into the wrong cinema screen or you were dragged to see it by your sons and daughters.This movie is amazing for the target audience it is aimed at, so don't expect to enjoy it if you're a grown man.</fullReview>

Most common thing Disney always looking for is that actress/actor must be good looking,must sing well,&amp; act.They are not perfect and great in acting,but they are enough for our children.Imagine kids life without Disney's animations &amp; music.I still found my childhood days every time i gone through any Disney product.This movie is good,perfect entertainer.Specially Miley sings very well.I loved howdown throwdown track.

		<shortDescription>It wasn't amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was great but not great, it dragged on and it was quite boring at times. Like at the end when she was talking about her 'Double life', it was really boring, it felt like it was over half of the movie. It's not something you'll remember, I don't even remember most of it, yet I remember most things in movies such as High School Musical and Camp Rock. It's quite funny at points, there's a British bloke who works for a magazine and he is in a disguise and goes into her dressing room tent thing and Hannah's helper or whatever knows who he is and she goes "Ozzy..." or something and then he takes it off and sits down and leaves his camera there and its recording then he leaves and Hannah and the woman start talking and the woman says something about a secret then when they leave the man goes in and gets the camera and finds out she has a secret. At the end when she pulls her wig off he takes a picture when she puts it back on and shes all "NO!" He's funny. The age its suitable for is round about - 9 to 0 year olds. Jokes, it's for probably 5+ because only little kids and young teenagers such as myself (11 years old here) really watch it, no offense if your an adult and watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent family values/Great message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was given low reviews by men way to old to catch the true and simple message of the movie. It was refreshing to get to see a G-rated movie with such great family values and life lessons. Yes, my 8 year old daughter loved it because of Hannah Montanah, but I did as well. It teaches a lesson that the simpler things in life like growing up in the rural south can be valued just as highly as a jet-setting career as a young pop-star. The acting wasn't as bad as some have mentioned. I have seen worse (George Strait in Pure Country). I do have a suggestion: all of you thirty-something males who took your daughters to see the movie, let them write the reviews. They probably have a lot more "family movie common sense" than you because their minds have not yet been polluted with the R rated violence/sex/drug action movies that you are so accustomed to watching. I hope Hollywood gets the message and produces more G rated movies like this one so that I can take my daughter and not have to worry about explaining the crude off-color jokes like in the "Incredibles" and the like. Thank God for movies like "Hannah Montanah". We need more of these and less smut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was so much fun and allowed me to escape (for a little while) the stresses of college life!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never write reviews, but I felt compelled to for this movie. First of all, I do not understand why people who dislike Hannah Montanna/Miley Cyrus would go see this movie. I am reading all of the negative comments and noticing the 1 Star ratings and am wondering why these people went to see this movie in the first place? Also, I am a college student who went to see this with my mom and my Grammy. We have sort of a tradition where we go see "cute, girly" movies together (Hairspray, Enchanted, 27 Dresses, Definitely Maybe and Maid of Honor were some of the ones we've seen in the theater together). Some of my favorite movies are The Prestige, A Beautiful Mind, Walk the Line, The Bourne Identity, and Fight Club, just so you know I'm not being totally biased reviewing this movie. In addition, I am not a fan of the show, but I've seen it a couple of times, just because all of the Hannah Monatanna hype made me curious. I thought the show's acting was cheesy and sometimes annoying, but I understand it's target audience is 10-14-year-olds. But this does not make me hate Hannah Montanna or think Miley Cyrus is stupid, annoying, lame, etc. I actually think Miley is fantastic--she's relatively clean, she's close to her family, she's passionate about what she does, and she has accomplished so much at just 16 years of age. Anyway, the previews for this movie looked different from the scenes of the lame sitcom on the Disney Channel. I was right--it was different! It had more of a Musical feel than the show did and Miley Cyrus' acting was LOADS better in the movie than on the TV show. Also, it was pretty funny! I also found it amusing that the lady who plays Jan from The Office--one of my favorite shows--was in it. Basically, this movie is so much fun and is really cute. If you're a Hannah Montanna or Miley Cyrus fan you'll LOVE the movie. If you hate Hannah Montanna, then why waste your time seeing this movie? If you're looking to see a movie that's fun, heart-felt, has a strikingly cute boy and has catchy music, then go see Hannah Montanna: The Movie!</fullReview>

I don't understand why Miley Cyrus generates so much hate, maybe i'm missing something but really all she has done is be successful. I watched this movie the other day and was pleasantly surprised by it. I have never watched Hannah Montana before so i'm not some crazed fan trying to persuade everyone to love Miley but i would just like to say that she is a talented young girl. You can't say she isn't. I may be wrong but i think people are jealous of her and try to make themselves feel better by slagging her off. Anyway, i personally enjoyed this movie. It's nothing original, but it was funny and entertaining and makes you feel good afterwards. Sometimes it's good watch a movie that doesn't require you to be an intellectual in order to understand and enjoy it.If you want to see a nice light hearted film then i recommend this movie, it's good! Please don't believe those over dramatic negative comments, the viewers who write them are either jealous or just very miserable people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The quest to ruin this movie is...amusing at best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can't help but notice the amount of people who are intentionally trying to bring the rating on this film here at IMDb down, not to mention the number of them who clearly never even watched the movie. This sort of trolling and rating fixing has become a serious problem on the site, most notably with the Dark Night/Godfather fiasco which led to the intentional reduction in the Godfather's rating by fans of the Dark Knight in order to raise it to number one. It's a shame really, but as with most things on the internet it's also unstoppable. Those with the time to waste and the willingness to waste it, will always prove themselves pathetic enough to ruin something others enjoy.As for the Hannah Montana movie itself is actually enjoyable if taken for what it is. It's intended to be a light hearted family film and it fills that role well. Cyrus herself is a treat to watch as is the rest of the cast, the music is catchy yet innocent enough to fit with the theme and the scenery is fantastic. It's also worth noting some excellent camera work and direction as well.If you enjoy stepping out of the norm, shutting out the negative and just relaxing with some innocent fun, check this out because you'll have a good time. If on the other hand your looking for serious drama or National Lampoon's type comedy, then I'd certainly recommend skipping this because it's just not for you. Even Nickelodeon tends to be raunchy when compared to Disney, especially when compared to something like Hannah Montana.And now, I have THX 1138 loaded up and ready to go so it's back to the depressing, thought filled, stressed out life I normally lead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well before I start, I just want to say that I am 18 years old and since I was a little kid I've never really liked Disney shows...I grew up watching Charmed, Buffy, Friends and the like so I didn't really expect to like this show but I did!So anyway, I went into the Movie theaters with a high expectation for this film since I liked the show I knew I'd definitely like the film too...I knew the plot was simple; she was starting to let the fame get into her head yadah-yadah-yadah but I didn't expect the movie to turn out that good...It had heart and the crew and actors knew exactly how to make the story interesting while giving us lessons in life that we could actually use.I guess the only reason why I gave this Movie a 7 is the ending, It was such a downer and I guess it just didn't satisfy me...like it left some lose ends and I really wanted to see what happened between Travis and Miley after the kiss and how the people in Crowley Corners treated her after they knew her "Hannah Secret" and also what happened to that reporter guy.Anyway, even with the horrible ending (( I'm sorry to those who liked it)) the movie was worth the watch from beginning to the middle part. I loved the scenes with Miley and her Dad, and also the scene about Lilly's Party...I guess could relate to it coz I had a best friend who was kinda better than me in someways...and It was really good that they showed how Miley treasured Lilly and how Lilly even though Miley did her wrong still went out of her way to help a friend...I think that was really touching!!! LoL so all in all...I recommend this film to those people who are young at heart and want to watch a good family film and even to those who just miss their hometown and such! this is really worth the watch!</fullReview>

And Miley (Hannah) was perfect acting like a brat when she arrived at Crowley Corners! The only scene in this movie that made me roll my eyes was the Hannah dinner and the date with whats-his-face and Miley. She didn't do good acting there. However, it wasn't the I-hate-this-movie-so-much-I'm-suing-Disney type of bad. I teared up when Miley was performing "The Climb" because it's such a beautiful song! I also like "Let's Get Crazy" and "Hoedown Throwdown", especially the latter one! So I give this movie a fantastic score of 9/10! Good job. Cyrus!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for what it is, and there's worse role models for girls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from seeing this with my nine-year-old daughter (who loved it). I'm actually not familiar with the TV show other than the basic concept. Yes, there's a lot of the standard sitcom plot twists, but the overall story and message is a good one, and there's lots of nice music and wholesome family stuff. Miley has genuine musical talent and has been a role model for my daughter learning to play the guitar and sing. Believe me, there's a lot worse role models for young girls out there; I'm glad there's someone like Miley Cyrus who shows her strong family relationship and that you have to work hard to get where you want to go.I saw it in a theater full of teenage girls who swooned every time Travis smiled. There's one brief scene where he has his shirt off and I thought they were going to have a hemorrhage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Hannah Montana: The Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My only exposure to the father-daughter make believe Disney World that Billy Ray and Miley Cyrus have gotten themselves into, as the reel father-daughter team up as Robby Ray and Miley Stewart, was the Hannah Montana.Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert Tour 3D. While I had enjoyed her performance with 3D gizmos, it didn't actually pique my interest enough to follow the adventures of Hannah Montana and her alter ego, which is some art imitate life imitate art kinda tween series, which has recently been green-lit for yet another season.In this other big screen dramatic outing, Miley and Billy Ray embark upon a journey back to their roots in Tennessee, well, more like the former being conned into making that trip back because she has turned out to be kind of a spoiled little brat, thinking that her Hannah Montana persona is the is-all and end-all, that bright camera flashes and screaming fans are forever, instead of the closer ties that bind.For a non-fan, this film is easy to follow and quite no-brainer. After all, it's a Disney production, and family friendly with good moral themes for (young) fans to be sublimely influenced, which serves the other purpose called profits from merchandising. So resentful little Miley has to get back in touch with nature, relatives, and have a go at a relatively adult romance who comes in the form of a strapping young cowboy, her childhood friend actually, Travis (Lucas Till), who's spending the summer working for her grandmother. And the romantic angle doesn't just open up to herself, but opportunities are abound for her single dad too.But seriously, romance or the lack thereof doesn't provide enough adversary for our pop singing sensation. That enemy comes in the form of Oswald Granger (Peter Gunn), a pesky paparazzi reporter who snoops around trying to unravel the mystery and dig up the dirt on Hannah Montana for an English tabloid, which will of course threaten her very existence! How diabolical is that! And Miley/Hannah's bitch-fight with Tyra Banks (which actually is a Xerox copy of what Isla Fisher did in Confessions of a Shopaholic) was that last straw which made dad Robby Ray pull the plug in order to save Miley's soul, since it's affecting her lyric writing, and her music.The plot then goes on a blah as the diabolical villain gets forgotten midway, and follows Detriot Metal City where the lead has to juggle his double life in a scene which calls for his presence at different locations. And add to that, there's a threat looming in her hometown of Crowley Corners where modern developers are just waiting to erect a shopping mall, which Hannah holds the key to preventing their rustic life from being rudely interrupted, so this calls for, what else, a fund-raising concert!Yes, it's engineered to allow Miley/Hannah to perform every now and then, which is just about the best thing in the film. As I had mentioned before, between the bubblegum pop lyrics that Hannah sings about, and the more meaningful and fun numbers Miley gets to stage, it's little surprise that I prefer Miley's performances a lot more than when she dons that blonde wig and pretends to have a lot more fun. And my personal favourites would be Miley's soulful duet with her Dad in Butterfly Fly Away, her heartfelt performance on stage during the finale, and anyone who disses Hoedown Throwdown really needs a head check. I'm not sure if the dance moves will catch on like the Macarena, but I'm sure fans out there are already perfecting that boogey already, which would fit right into mass line-dancing.I may not be and am still not a fan, but I'm quite convinced Miley Cyrus has what it takes, and charismatic enough to be the next big thing coming out of the Disney assembly line of manufactured stars. You go, girl, make that climb!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannah Montana: The Movie is the perfect movie if your looking for something light, entertaining and fun. Yes, some parts are a little cheesy (especially at the end when their telling her to carry on being Hannah Montana), but that is only to be expected seen as the films main audience is the younger generation, apart from that it is a good family movie with catchy songs (the Hoedown Throwdown anyone?)I liked the fact that they didn't make it like a 90 minute episode of the show, instead it provides a deeper plot and gives out good messages of remembering where you came from and remembering to be yourself. I was also very impressed with Miley Cyrus', Lucas Till's and Emily Osment's acting.Overall, I think it was a very good movie, the only reason I give it a 9/10 is because of the absence of Mitchell Musso aka Oliver, who is my favourite character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ladies and Gentlemen I was dragged to this movie by my wife. We took our two boys (6 and 3). I was expecting find a theater full of young girls and moms and that is what I found. Besides myself there was one other father. He sat in front of me and we exchanged the classic man head nod and look of "this is going to be horrible". We were completely wrong! This movie was excellent! You can have my Man Card. The story is predictable, but well told. The music was great. It was refreshing to go to a movie and not worry if the content would be safe for my kids. Good job Disney! Ms. Cyrus is truly a talented young lady, and seems to be turning in to a fine young actress. Billy Ray's part was great as well. Jason Earles was hilarious and underused. The kid is a comic genius, I hope someone in Hollywood picks this guy up and uses him to his potential. The movie is not a 10, but well worth time. It's like watching a country version of The Cosby Show. Take your Family!</fullReview>

Miley made the comment quote " it will end without the possibility of a sequel but a possibility of another season. I would love to do another season." so for those people who are saying she only did the movie because she wanted out need to get their stories straight. This movie was filmed over a year ago so what do you know. It is a great movie for kids and adults. If you have kids, you might understand it better. The acting is not bad at all, the storyline makes sense and the soundtrack is amazing, especially the hoedown throw down. There were little girls in the aisles of the movie theater doing it with the movie and it was cutest thing ever. I have even learned how to do it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I went to see this movie the day after opening day and i must say that i was surprised at how empty the theater was. Well back to the actual movie it seems that it was a small step up from the series on TV. The thing that really got my goat is that the bands just randomly knew how to play all of the songs especially when her seemingly brand new song at the end is just magically and perfectly learned by the band without even a minute of practice. I also learned that you can change in a revolving door without getting caught by others. However, this movie does earn its up part because it didn't just jump all over the place, and it actually looked like a movie.Final comment if you are in love with the show, chances are you will fall in love with the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For What It Was...A Very Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judge this movie for what it was...a movie written to appeal to adolescent and pre-teen girls. I took my 7-yo daughter and 5-yo son, and bottom line is they both loved it. I totally expected to use this movie to catch up on some sleep, but that didn't happen.The scenery and cinematography of the Tennessee countryside was beautiful. The music had a nice hook and was fun to listen to. Miley's initial "entitled, Hollywood child-star" snobbishness and sense of entitlement was totally believable, based on teen actors in Hollywood. But to me, (the most important element of the story) the "moral of the story" was by far the strongest and most import lesson to a very apropos audience..."Your actions and choices in life are much bigger than you." Sure...the humor was corny, elements of the story-line were totally implausible, and the realism of Miley's situations were tenuous at best. But all in all, it was a cute movie with a good message.Yes...I cried the last 20 minutes of the movie! :) Watch the movie to have a fun time with your daughters. Don't try to go Siskel and Ebert on this one...it won't work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last comment bemoaned old men being disparaging of young Miley. Well, as a 44 y/old with 2 daughters aged 8 and 4, they loved it and, in truth, so did I.Great fun, great music, good old-fashioned family entertainment - just what's required in these sobering times. Young Miley plays her part with great panache and makes each character distinctive - the Hannah songs, OK, so they're like a bad Avril Lavigne gig (isn't that an oxymoron?), but the country numbers are great - Taylor, Miley and those Rascall chaps. My 4 y/old has been chiming 'boom boom clap........boom de clap de clap' for the last 3 days - she loved it and thinks she's fab. And, again, as that 44 y/old male, I would be extremely hard hearted not to appreciate such great family fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think a few reviewers of this title need to get a grip on some anger issues. I went to this movie with two little girls. (the movies target audience) We all thought it was great. There is absolutely nothing offensive in this movie. It's cutesy and silly and everything it was meant to be. My little 7 year old smiled the whole time. The music is fun and upbeat. I hate to think that we live in such a cynical world that people can't have a little fun and relax. If you go to this movie by yourself and happen to be a bitter 45 year old man with a Siskel complex you might not enjoy it. On the other hand if your going with kids and you care what they think you'll love it! A good movie with a cute message. We all walked out of the theater singing and having fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie for KIDS.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I've read the reviews and decided to take my 4 year old anyway. The truth is, it's a great movie with a great message "No matter where you go in life, you can't forget where you are from." From an adult's point of view, it was mildly entertaining. If you can sit through the show, then the movie is okay. I personally don't mind Hannah Montana.My son loved it. He was a little too young to understand the "big issues" but still, it was Hannah Montana.As for the music, well, it is targeted at a younger level. It's really not bad if you can think on a child's level and realize that there is an odd phase for pre-teens when the little kiddie songs are too embarrassing to sing and the adult songs are well, usually a little TOO adult and under-edited.This movie is good, clean, fun for a family with younger children. If you are an adult looking for adult entertainment, then I suggest you try a movie made for an adult audience.For those leaving the bad reviews talking about how the music isn't likable as an adult, you need to get real. This movie wasn't made for adults. It was made for kids that enjoy watching Hannah Montana. End of story.Before leaving your comment, please stop and think like a child. If a child enjoys it, then the purpose of the movie is fulfilled.Again, this movie really isn't bad. I would have preferred to have seen more of the setting as shown in the television show and the characters in the show to play bigger roles, but overall, it was good.Added bonuses: Rascal Flatts is featured without being recognized in the movie as themselves, Miley sings as both Miley and Hannah, and Billy Ray sings too (plus he's just HOT).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People people people...Please stop thinking so hard about how to trash this film and it's cast, relax a bit and rethink why you are writing a review for this movie. This movie "is what it is." I have a belief that all of you writing negative reviews really have no reason for even having gone to see this film in the first place. Think about the premise of the film, a TV show targeting pre-teens and tweeners airing on the Disney channel...yes Disney...got it? OK, now stop your bashing and ask your pre-teen or tween daughter, sister, niece (etc) about the movie. Go to the movies and watch their little faces during the movie and ask them to tell you about it at the end. I watch new episodes of Hannah on Sundays with both my 9 and 7 year old daughters...and I'm a 37 year old man. Then I took them and my wife to see the movie. My reward and high praise for movies such as Hannah Montana comes from the look on their faces both during and after the film. They were smiling and clapping along with the songs. My daughter downloaded the videos for her Nintendo DS. Hey, even my wife loves "The Climb" sung by Miley Stewart, during the film. It has a good message for all ages.So stop your whining and bad mouthing of this film. Think about how many parents will be unjustly misled by your words and not take their kids to see the film. Because of you, children will be deprived of enjoying themselves and having a good time at the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of you may be saying "You're a hard drinkin, hard fightin', smokin', drinkin', tattooed son of a gun. 3 Stars? Have you gone soft?" I went in expecting the worst. I even took my friend's fiancée along, so I wouldn't seem like "Creepy old guy at the Hannah Montana." But you know what? I wound up enjoying myself with this cute little kids flick, as generally mindless as it maybe.Miley Cyrus plays Miley Stewart, who leads a double life as pop sensation Hannah Montana. Only a close knit crew of people know of the double life, and Miley must make the difficult choice of keeping Hannah in her life, or reserving herself to a normal life as Miley. Her father/manager Robbie Ray (Billy Ray Cyrus) ships her off to her hometown in Tennessee following celebrity shoe battle with Tyra Banks to get a dose of the real world, and there she learns to love life as not Hannah. Even finds time for a love life as Miley with farm hand Travis. After it comes out that Miley is "good friends" with Hannah, she's forced into the awkward situation of being with friends and family at the Hannah Montana benefit concert, put on to save her hometown from being bought up by greedy land developers.This movie combines all the best elements of an 80's sitcom, throws in the "Superman Complex", and rounds it all out with, good, wholesome family fun, that last part I can't, in good conscience, fully decry.Remember in "Family Ties" when Alex would get a date with one girl for 7pm, and another for 9pm, and then the girl at 9 had to reschedule for 7, so rather than call one off, he tries to manage both dates at the same time? Oh, and at the same restaurant? He'd have to pretend to smoke for one of them, so he could get 9 to sit in the smoking section. Yeah... it was marginally funny then. And got decreasingly funny when Kirk Cameron did it on "Growing Pains," then Joey Lawrence on "Blossom," then it got passed around "Family Matters," "Step by Step," "Boy Meets World," and countless other 80's and 90's sitcoms. Yeah, that's pretty much Hannah Montana. And the "Superman Complex?" - No one seems to realize that Superman looks exactly like Clark Kent without glasses. Likewise... no one seems to realize that Hannah Montana is a blonde Miley Stewart.The thing about Miley Cyrus, is that I'm rooting for her... she's got some great potential that has yet to be fully realized. I don't think she's a brightly burning star that will fizzle in a year when the Hannah Montana black hole collapses. That's not a slam against Hannah Montana, I just felt like running with the astronomy reference. And she does show a phenomenal screen presence that I would like to see continue on throughout for career. I hope she isn't hampered by the long arm of the Disney Channel. Think a female Shia Lebouf. Let's just hope she doesn't go on to ruin the 80's.The thing of it is... It's not made for people like me. You know, the over 14 crowd. And it's not made for critics. It's made for kids. We all had movies that we loved as kids, and looking back, we wonder why? Mighty Ducks? Anyone? That was our kids movie, and sticks with us to this day. I now realize it as a mediocre at best flick, but it holds a special place in my heart. And it will for kids these days (that makes me sound like a fogey). I can't fault these kids for that. I'm gonna let them have their movie.Look for fun cameos from Rascal Flatts and the very lovely and talented Taylor Swift. Barry Bostwick pops up in a funny little role. But in all seriousness... what would have made this film... is Billy Ray Cyrus singing his signature song, "Achy Breaky Heart." You picked up a guitar. You were in front of a mic. You couldn't do the "Achy Breaky?" Throw us older folks a little something.P.S. For those of you who don't know, I'm not as old as I make myself sound. I'm 23. But I am older than the target audience for this flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannah Montana: Entertaining Children's Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this movie with three of my nieces and a theater full of children, girls AND boys alike. I was expecting a horrible movie because I cannot stand the television show. I was pleasantly surprised. Though not perfect, Miley Cyrus's acting has improved A LOT. The story and plot was okay for the most part, even though the ending was disappointing to me. Though it may be deemed cliché by many, it was very entertaining and was very "cute." The Hannah/Miley of the show has certainly developed in character, growing from bratty to somewhat mature - at least, empathetic. The moral teaches empathy and caring about your family/friends. And, of course, there was a daughter/father bonding moment, which many people can relate to. These are lessons I definitely agree with! On the flip side, there is a lot of glitz and makeup applying which may lead girls to be prematurely interested in these things. But that's up to the parents to steer their children the right way and not let them grow up too fast. In the end, my nieces loved it, of course, and it was nice to be able to see a clean, family movie with them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannah Montana: The Movie is probably not for anyone who likes good clean, wholesome, funny and yes - cheesy family entertainment. But in a movie environment that seems to constantly churn out PG-13 to R rated stuff, "Hannah" seems to be proof that many of us rather like some clean, good ole fashioned fun and just a few songs thrown in to make the movie-viewing experience somewhat memorable. Our daughter, who happens to be 6yrs old, loved this movie and throughout it, tapped her foot and bobbed her head. Granted, she is a big Hannah fan, but she still enjoyed it. So did her Mom and Dad. Miley Stuart has a big conflict trying to be herself and Hannah at the same time. But Hannah seems to be winning the bigger, better, glitzier life over substance and down-to-earth deal. So her dad takes her back to her roots in Tennessee to see if her original home can bring some clarity to the situation. Along the way, she meets family, friends and a possible new love interest to bring herself to realize how much family, roots and being true to yourself can mean to you in the world. Yes, the movie is a little silly, but so much fun! Please do yourself and maybe your family a favor, GO see the movie. Let yourself go in with no reservations or pre-conceived notions that this movie need be an artistic and Oscar-worth film, which of course, it is not. But maybe you'll come away liking something feel-good and refreshingly enjoyable, unless you're not into that kind of thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, I've been a father now for 6 years to a magnificent son. He was adopted out some time ago, but still, I hold many parental elements: like the tolerance for children's' shows and movies. When I first watched the Hannah Montana show on TV, I liked it, strangely enough. Didn't think I would, but - hey, surprises rock, right? LoL. Anyway, I'd become so addicted to the show, that when I heard the movie was going to come out, I'll have to admit I was a little more than skeptical, though quite excited. In the theatre, I remembered thinking to myself that I hoped I'd not made a mistake by coming. Lots of television-to-movie shows I've seen have panned out very badly. When the movie started though, it was like I was watching a longer version of the show. Then, they threw in a little depth and drama, mixed it with the comedy, new characters and some new and old tunes. What came out of it, was truly a fun thing. I laughed my butt off in many occasions and just enjoyed myself immensely. Afterwards, I left feeling that my money had been spent in the right place. Only problem - not a big one, but still... you see a lot of Lilly, but not much (if at all) of her Lola alter-ego. I thought the purple, blue, whatever color she decides, hair was fun. Well, though the demographic is 6-14 year olds, I still had a good time. Definitely see this movie if you're in the mood for fun, if your in the demographical age or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know a lot of people are going to knock this movie, but I must say that I found it quite well done. If we accept the G rating and understand that this is a family friendly film, then look at the underlying issues developed through Miley's character, then we can see that this is one successful movie. First, yes this is geared towards kids; that's the fan base established by the show. But there are things thrown in to appeal to the adults who are accompanying their kids to the film. I took my nine year old daughter to this film (she barely slept last night she was so excited). I didn't have a lot of expectations for the film, just to entertain my daughter, but I found myself enjoying it with her. Without giving away too much of a spoiler, there is a touching scene between Miley and her father and my daughter and I shared a life moment when we whispered to each other during it. Being in a situation where I am raising three kids effectively alone, I identified with Billy Ray's character (especially now that I am considering dating). The slapstick comedy was fun, and I thought both the evil paparazzi character and the evil town developer character were underplayed enough to keep the focus on Miley's dilemma of choosing what she will do about her Hannah persona. This central dilemma, I felt, was very well done. Some reviewers seem to think that the film is either/or based. It is not. It is focused on how can we maintain a public persona while developing privately. I found that quite poignant, particularly after the hubbub over Miley's Anne Leibowitz photo (was that for Vanity Fair?). Can Miley find a way to grow up while maintaining her public persona? The fact that this fairly complex idea can be developed in a rated G movie whose built-in fan base is young girls and their parents is a good reflection on all those connected to it, and I believe they pull it off quite well. Even the old and stale be-in-two-places-at-once is pulled off effectively within this motif. I think Disney has turned out one of their best offerings ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't use words like "wholesome entertainment" or "family fun" to describe Hannah Montana the Movie. I'll be the first to admit it. Hanna Montana the Movie was a great movie.Miley Cyrus is not afraid to make a fool out of herself, and it's easy to see how millions of kids across the world absolutely adore her. The movie is simple and genuine, and although the story overall is predictable as expected, you've got to admit it's all entertaining. Of course you've got your obligatory dance number, and believe you me, the "Hoedown Throwdown" is catchy, and yes I learned it. Not since Mr. Cyrus' own "Achy Breaky Heart" has a line dance been so infectious. I challenge you to leave the theater without repeating "BOOM BOOM CLAP, BOOM CLAP" over and over again.The casting was great with supporting roles from Margo Martindale playing Hannah's sweet grandma, and Melora Hardin (the Office) playing Billy Ray's love interest. And the music wasn't bad either. Don't be ashamed. Have a good time and see Hannah Montana the Movie. You'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

I saw it on opening day and it was packed. The girls in the audience had their hands up in the air waving it back and forth during the Climb song. They clapped at the end. Overall, I actually enjoyed the movie as well.I've read some of the negative comments. Just to remind some people, this is a 'kids' movie. Its not Oscar material. Its been put together to give the Hanna Montana fans another way to see their favourite Disney princess. Take it for what it is. Don't hack it apart. Have you seen Demi Lavato? She couldn't act if her life depended on it. That grin is scary. But the kids love it. And isn't that whats important?

		<fullReview>Miley Cyrus. We all know the name, whether you love her or you hate her. Hannah Montana: The Movie wasn't anything Oscar worthy. But it's not Razzie worthy either. The fan base is 6-14 year old girls, and they reached that base real nicely. Cute, catchy songs, a cute boy, sticky situations, and of course a flashy wardrobe. I give props to Ms. Cyrus, she has definitely come a long way since early 2006. Her voice is honestly not bad, it's different and sounds pretty nice oftentimes. She is a mediocre actress, and in this film I think she stepped it up and impressed at least me. The plot line was nothing original, but I liked it. It was easy to follow and it grabs the attention of the girls within the age range. Job well done, it was enjoyable.So before you bash Miley, the music or the movie itself, remember who is it intended to please. In that case, it was great. I'm not ashamed to say that I'd sit through it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is great..no doubt miley rocks and that romantic song in the last end of movie was the best song ever sung by miley.it has many positive points..but i want to put some negative points..because m big fan i want improvement in MILEY .I AM AGAIN SAYING THAT THIS MOVIE ROCKSSSSSS...it was fun watching this movie but it could be great fun AND GREAT BLOCKBUSTER HIT if it includes the chemistry of Jackson + Rico + oliver and Lilly + miley would there.!!commo man no role for Jackson (he s the best actor and we want to c him to do weird things) no oliver role????..even no Roxy? and if character of Roby Ray act like a cool dude..(Roby ray's acting was good but in this movie it looks bit serious means not as cool as he really is..in the movie he seems he is full in tension.it will become best movie ifff roles given to Jackson/Rico/and cool dude oliver are increased up to some extent...and one more short coming in this movie is no masti like Roby ray style in the movie :(((( he must act like a cool dady instead of an professional dad.and one more thing the person cast opposite miley is good and cool guy but his voice is not cool.Good luck Roby Ray NEXT TIME GIVE SOME ROLES TO JACKSON ?OLIVER ? RICO ?THEY are good actors and capable to make ur movie all time hit..bingo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the summary clearly indicates, Hannah Montana is as of yet anyway, the single best movie I have ever seen and I dare say, a life changing experience.If I may, though I don't deem myself worthy of reviewing anything that contains or even refers to Hannah, her singing ability, as well as her acting, is so deep and profound, it really makes you reflect on your everyday life and what you can actually achieve with just a little bit of effort.I will be the first to predict the Cyrus family will conquer Hollywood and will constitute one of its foundations like the Baldwin legacy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Movies of the Year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many movies these days lack the humor and drama that an audience desires desperately at times. A few movies tend to bore and sometimes anger the viewers because of how horrible it can be. But "Hannah Montana: The Movie" does not disappoint. While I watched this movie, I noticed how focused I was in the movie and at times how much I was laughing at this movie because of its great epic humorous dialog. This movie is no let down at all. If you have any doubts of seeing this movie, your doubts are most likely wrong. The dialog is very original and well thought out. The story never lacks or drags. And it's great fun beginning to end and easily can be considered an American classic!!!! Wait, I change my mind, this movie sux sweaty monkey balls!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was a great kids movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would give it a 8 out of ten, but since people are such haters I had to give it a 10 to try an balance out the negativity. I watched this movie with my brother (18) and my little cousin (14) and I am 23. I have to say i loved it. It was touching, cute and funny (much like the show with a longer, better plot). I loved at the music sequences and how they naturally incorporated them, so that you get songs but its doesn't come off unnatural like in musicals. It is a Disney G rated film so yeah its not going to be edgy or Oscar material, but it was entertaining and i clapped after every performance, I cried at some moments, and laughed a lot (in large thanks to Earl). It was so good, but i like Hannah Montana the show. However, my brother thought it was good too and he just tagged a long and for my 14 year old cousin well, she couldn't stop talking about it (we both we super excited about the movie).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, who in their right mind would believe TWEENS would walk out of theaters? Don't believe that post, people - theaters were packed and given the weekend box office, the audience loved the movie, as did I. The cinemascore was an A.As for the other posters who gave this 1 star - read closely - did they actually see the movie? Most of them haven't and left reviews BEFORE the movie was released.Parents, this is a safe, fun, family film with a lot of heart and a surprising amount of emotion. Also has a great message about realizing what's truly important in life. Sure, it's a bit sugar coated and some of the gags are a little goofy, but it is, after all, a kids movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screened two days before opening. Good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans of the show, like myself, will love this movie. I was really excited to screen this at work and it was well worth it. Hannah Montana the Movie is a great, feel good movie. More of a Drama with funny parts than a full on comedy that works with great success.I am a huge fan of the show for it's over the top humor and outrageous antics, but the film had such a depth to it. It was done superbly!I was a little skeptical at the beginning when the Tyra Banks shoe fight happened thinking, "oh no, please don't let the movie just be like this." but it was great. The Tennessee family is so great, and the relationships with Miley's grandma is very nice to watch, as well as the one with Miley and her boy toy cowboy! LOLThe music in it was good too. Near the end of the show when Hannah/Miley sings with her dad it was very sweet and heart warming. Brought a little tear to my eye.Fans will love the show, and if you're not a fan looking for just a good movie, this one is. Just plain, good ol' fun. ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIKE COUNTRY MUSIC!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awesome movie!! Always have enjoyed the show and in all honesty wasn't looking forward to the movie.Foolishly I didn't think it would be as good as the show but I was pleasantly surprised.Miley Cyrus does a wonderful job portraying her Hannah persona and Miley persona exceptionally well.The emotion in the film was truly moving especially when she belts out the song "The Climb" and sings with her real life/on-screen father Billy Ray on "Butterfly Fly Away".The pratfalls were hilarious and the story/plot rang true with a positive message to be true to yourself don't lose yourself because you are left with nothing if you do.Just as the song states There's always gonna be another mountain I'm always gonna want to make it move.It's always gonna be an uphill battle sometimes I'm gonna have to lose.Life is indeed a climb and this film was as deep and profound as it can get.The ending no spoilers here will most assuredly satisfy any fan that is the only thing I will say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was at a multiplex and just finished watching the movie I went to see and being in the mood for a second feature i wandered into the movie next door. It turned out to be Hannah Montana: the Movie. I was very pleasantly surprised. The cinematography is fantastic. It's filmed in a beautiful location in Tennessee and many of the shots are just breathtaking. Disney put a lot of money into this production and it shows. The director is excellent. The songs are great. There's a really nice happy energy from the entire production. OK. The story is just a simple corny teen romantic comedy but musicals are not known for having great plots. There are obviously a lot of people writing comments here who just hate anything Hannah Montana but this is a movie that has a lot going for it. Anyone who likes Hannah Montana is going to love it and rightly so. Anyone who goes to the movie with any kind of a reasonable attitude is going to like it. Don't worry about the plot. Just sit back and enjoy the musical numbers, enjoy the incredible photography. This movie is going to make a lot of money because it's about happiness and it delivers happiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great family movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our family loved this movie and of a packed theater no one left early,in fact most stayed through the ending credits. Great music and family fun. There was nothing inappropriate in the whole movie so it is very kid friendly. That being said the adults in our family enjoyed it also.There was also some cameos from country stars such as Rascal Flatts and Taylor Swift. As parents of a 6 year old daughter we are happy to find family friendly movies. I do not understand why if this is not your type of movie why one would even bother to give a biased opinion on the movie. If your not attending this movie with kids then don't bother giving your opinion and try to ruin it for others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shockingly Good Family Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I, both in our 30s, were shocked at how satisfying this movie was. My daughters are big Hannah Montana fans, and my wife and I occasionally watch the show with them, so we were not expecting too much. As expected, there is a light, fluff storyline. However, it's intermingled with another, more mature storyline that could break a Daddy's heart. The acting is pretty good, too.Beyond that, this musical is packed with great songs. The girls liked the Hannah Montana songs, but I really appreciated the more mature, country songs that made up the other half of the soundtrack. Miley Cyrus is trying to make a career beyond her Hannah Montana image and I, for one, think she is going to succeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie; Ignore the haters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To anyone that likes Disney, Hannah Montana, Miley Cyrus, and some cheesy humor; this movie is perfect for you. The rating on this site is just bad because of all the haters out there that rate stuff they don't like a 1 out of 10 and it is really unfortunate that there are so many haters. It is a good movie and the 2 hours went by so fast. They story was great, the acting was just as it is in the show, and the new songs were wonderful and touching. My mother, 50, and myself, 21, were in a theatre filled with lots of girls and their mothers and everyone came out of the theatre talking about how good the movie was; I didn't hear a single complaint, it was that good :) Do yourself a favour and go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"HANNAH MONTANA: THE MOVIE" ? Walt Disney Pictures: The MoneyMaker --</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Per an advance preview, seen with mainly females of the Pre-Teen persuasion-- who seemed to get a big KICK out of the film:) It's not easy to make an effective story-based movie when the main goal seems to be to provide its audience with a series of CONCERT-type performances; but, this film actually SUCCEEDS at that. The story concerns a father (BILLY RAY CYRUS) who feels his performer daughter MILEY (a/k/a HANNAH MONTANA) is getting somewhat "FULL" of herself, &amp; he takes her back to the family home in Tennessee to try to help her become more "grounded". Helping out are various characters such as her Grandma (MARGO MARTINDALE) &amp; handsome farmhand (&amp; eventual love interest) Travis (LUCAS TILL) who prefers "real" people &amp; who has the motto "Life is a CLIMB" (which Miley eventually turns into a song). You have various characters from the TV show including her BFF Lilly (EMILY OSMENT), &amp; her brother Jackson (JASON EARLES) &amp; Oliver (MITCHELL MUSSO) for comedic purposes. It doesn't break any new ground (with the way Miley puts on a show to raise money needed to improve the town). But, it's got a GOOD "believable" cast &amp; story, a bunch of enjoyable &amp; well-done song numbers (especially "Hoedown"), &amp; it "WORKS"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great all around family entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie along with my girls ages 6, 7 &amp; 9. Great soundtrack, good message without being preachy. Miley is a very good actress along with dancer and singer. All of the characters from the TV show that you would expect to see along with several fun cameos. Good transition from the "Hannah Montana" TV show to the big screen and all the where did Miley come from?? questions answered. This movie is definitely worth taking the family to see, it DOES NOT seem like a rushed piece of fluff to make money, but a genuine, fun family film that has a very good message and pleasantly lots of laughs =)Excellent entertainment for movie goers of all ages that you don't have to cringe over when watching with your children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a skeptic I was not looking forward to it but the comedy delivered!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took my 11-year old daughter, who loves the show, but has tired of the music, to see it. I find the show quite funny as well. I was, however, not very confident at the chances of having a good time seeing the sitcom being brought to the big screen. I was wrong. The comedy bits were very well done. Any time Miley's brother Jackson was on the screen the audience was laughing out loud. He's a very funny physical actor. The young girls in the crowded theater were clapping and singing along with every song in the movie, and I was not disappointed with the soundtrack either. The story was old and obvious, and the dramatic parts dragged it down a bit. It still had a good message, and every time it seemed to lag with treacle they threw in a great comedic/slapstick scene that had the audience(and me)rolling.All-in-all the movie was worthy of a 7 out of 10. I had to give it a 10 just to balance out the haters that gave it 1 or 2 just to be idiots. No doubt, given the number of negative reviews cast (without comments to back up the rating), some anti-Miley website is behind this stupidity. This seems to be the computer age we live in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazingly Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie extremely good! I am in love with it. I am a huge Miley/Hannah fan, and I'm 16. Yes, SIXTEEN years old. She really isn't that bad people! This movie is funny, and a great story. Of course, if you aren't a Hannah fan, this movie is not for you. I think everyone should give it a chance. You will laugh a lot, and have a great time. Kids will love it of course. Miley has become such a great actress throughout time. She is really maturing. A lot of people are giving her crap because of little mistakes she makes, but everyone needs to remember, she is a TEENAGER! She's gonna do stupid things. But you cannot hold it against her. Anyways, this was a really good movie. It gave me chills, and i cried. Give it shot before knocking it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading some of the other reviews I would have to say that I am absolutely appalled. I have been a huge Hannah/Miley fan for quite some time and I was truly amazed at how well the entire production turned out to be. Miley Cyrus never seizes to amaze me with how put together she is. From working on the movie, to her award winning show, latest album, as well as still being your everyday 16-year-old girl, Miley is truly inspirational. While some may have poked fun and turned a cold shoulder when "explicit photos" leaked, I think they forgot to remember that she was just being HUMAN, and just as any other teenage girl she made a mistake. GET OVER IT PEOPLE!! In fact, what many are also forgetting to consider is what Miley truly stands for. She is a true role model for thousands, in fact millions, of girls across the world. A role model that is not afraid to show her fans what it means to be yourself and never let anyone get you down. So despite what some people may say about the plot of this movie or the acting, I am proud to say that I loved EVERY minute of it. So HATS OFF to you Miley and keep up the great work!!</fullReview>
