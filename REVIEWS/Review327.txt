		<shortDescription>Wonderful Experimental Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi (1983) is a film with no actors, no storyline, and no dialogue. The only things we see during the experimental documentary's 87 minutes are natural landscapes, images of cities, and real people going about their regular lives. Yet from the very beginning, when we see the title of the film appear in blood-red characters and hear the voice of a bass soloist chanting the title like an incantation, it is difficult not to be swept away in captivation.Filmed between 1977 and 1982, Reggio's film was noticed by directing great Francis Ford Coppola who eventually agreed to finance the project and give it chances for distribution. Minimalist composer Philip Glass was optioned to compose the score, and the result was, quite simply, astounding.Koyaanisqatsi is a collection of familiar images presented through tinted lenses (figuratively speaking). The experimental nature of the project can be seen in the reduced and augmented speeds of images, the use of carefully manipulated edits, and the use of Glass's score to create ambience. There are times when the film exhibits an almost surreal quality more indicative of a twisted, futuristic, dystopian sci-fi epic than of our mundane world.This is, however, what makes Koyaanisqatsi so successful. In presenting our world in a disquieting, unflattering light, the film forces us to ruminate on our place in the universe and the consequences of many of our actions. The film starts with serene, austere images of mountains, oceans, and forests, and the repetitiveness of Glass's score does not bore us nor call attention to itself, but simply washes over us, entrancing us and instilling a sense of tranquility.It is not long before the untainted images are replaced by nuclear power plants, highways, skyscrapers, rubble, fire and ash, and hoards of ant-like beings (humans, of course) scurrying through modern urbanity. Most times, humans are filmed at low-frame settings (making for faster speeds), and as a result, they seem frenzied, compulsively making their way through the cities in a manner that seems more conditioned than voluntary.Glass's score responds by heightening its tension and adding a semi-brutal nature to its repetitiveness. It is somewhat aversive, but at the same time exhibits a humorous and mocking quality. By cramming together so many images of humans behaving more like lab rats than higher, thinking beings and increasing the satirical nature of the score, the film invites us to consider just how depersonalized, mechanized, and out-of-control many aspects of our life are.The conclusion of the film contrasts against the blackly comic nature of the previous section by instilling a sense of mourning and warning. As such, there is undoubtedly a political and environmental component inherent in this film, but this is the aspect that is, in my mind, most often misunderstood. Many critics (mostly detractors) have interpreted Koyaanisqatsi as a call to action, an invective that demands that we atone for the rape-like pillaging the human race has thrusted upon the natural environment. Following from this, these critics claim that the film's message is that we would enjoy the planet more if we were not here at all, thus presenting a contradiction, since we would not be here to enjoy it.In my own personal view, the flaw here resides in viewing the film as a tirade and a call to action. I find Koyaanisqatsi very clearly to be not a cry for reform, but a demand for awareness and meditation. There is an inevitability in the actions of human beings and their disregard for the care of their surroundings, and the wonderful thing about this film is that it forces you to experience the consequences and at least take notice of what each of us is contributing. It does not let you get away with indifference and nonchalance.For me, however, the political component is less important than the stylistic component, which is one near and dear to my heart: the use of music to enhance the forcefulness of images. I acknowledge the fact that some will not be able to stand the repetitiveness of Philip Glass's score (and it is very repetitive at some points). But if one can consider the motive behind the repetition, the music ceases to be oppressive and becomes sublime and entrancing. The score adds impact to an already stunning array of unforgettable images, the details of which I will not go into, so that one may see the film with fresh eyes.I saw Koyaanisqatsi for the first time at a performance in which the visuals were projected onto a giant screen with the soundtrack being supplied by Glass and his ensemble, who had come for a live performance. I had barely made it in time, since I struggled to find a parking space and was drenched from running in the rain. The moment the film started, however, all of the accumulated tensions in my body completely dissipated. It was not at all a cerebral experience, but an instinctive one in which I enjoyed the images and sounds for their own sakes.When I left the performance, I was in a hypnotic daze, transfixed by what I had just seen. My initial impressions haven't changed to this day. I loved this film, and while the political and environmental concerns it addresses are important, what really makes this film for me is the instinctive, visceral power of its images and sounds. Koyaanisqatsi maroons its audience in an alternate version of reality that sheds disturbing light on our lives, and yet at the same time, it produces an unforgettable cinematic experience that is pervasively engrossing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Make no mistake -- you need to get into the right mood to properly enjoy this film. Try watching it with your cynical or populist friends and they'll pour scorn upon it. Don't try to convince others to 'get it' as they won't.The best thing to do is to turn off all of the lights, pump up the sound and absorb yourself in the spectacle that unfolds on the screen. If you do this, you'll experience one of the most breathtaking, moving and exciting pieces of art ever. There are few films that reach these heights -- 2001: A Space Odyssey is the only one that instantly comes to mind.Don't analyse it until it's finished. Talking through it will ruin it. I've found that the film works best on an emotional level so switch your brain off and just watch and listen. By the time it's finished, you'll feel like you've been on an exhausting and exhilarating journey that you'll want to take again not long afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A welcome assault on the senses, 'Koyaanisqatsi' is not for the impatient or nervous. You have to give it time because it is slightly dull in the very beginning, as the music and landscapes are fairly ordinary. Once it gets going, its really fascinating. Some gorgeous images, none generated by a computer I might add, and a soundtrack to match the intensity makes this a unique movie experience. I saw it on the big screen when it was first released, and it was MUCH better than on my not-that-big television.One of the things I also like about this movie is the fact that since there is no dialogue, it can be shown in any country in the world unchanged. We would all see it the exact same way. I like the idea of that very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of balance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godfrey Reggio's magnificent documentary "Koyaanitsqatsi" was an amazing experience when it first came out more than twenty years ago. Watching for a second time, this time in DVD format, one realizes how this movie makes the case that it must be seen in the big screen in order to get all the brilliant cinematography in its proper perspective. Even watching it in a 32 plasma screen, one realizes it pales in comparison when projected on a larger movie theater screen.The images that are presented in the film are just beyond belief. The fantastic music score by that genius, Phillip Glass, compliments and enhances our experience. This film will live forever in spite of some of the comments submitted to this forum, because it deals with universal themes that will stay with us on this planet while human life will exist. This was pioneer movie making that later on became main stream. The originality being in the way the director presents the different sections in the film with some unusual photography that, while imitated, remains the standard for comparison with any new so called latest technique and innovation.Kudos to Mr. Reggio, Mr. Glass and the people behind this gorgeous film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but without the constant barrage of dialogue...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Koyaanisqatis is an extremely unusual film, and by far one of the most unusual I have ever seen. It takes on the daunting task of portraying the history of the world until modern times (or the early 80s, at least) entirely without dialogue. It is a documentary of sorts, in that it is amazingly informative, but it is filmed like a Hollywood film. Expertly framed shots and flawlessly smooth camera movement and shot composition. There is an unbelievable amount of talent behind this film, both in the fascinating images that are presented and the mesmerizing score by Philip Glass. It is a very slow moving film, but it manages to keep your attention because, in many cases, it is just so interesting to see the things that are portrayed and the way that they are shown. This is the only film, for example, where you can see a shot of a 737 approaches directly toward the camera over a hot runway in a shot that is possibly over a minute long with no movement other than the sluggish lumbering of the massive plain.Godfrey Reggio takes Glass's score and places images over it that add to the sound and create an experience that is far greater than, as they say, the sum of its parts. The shots contain camera movement or lack movement, are sped up or slowed down, and have live sound or no live sound depending on the desired effect, and the end result is absolutely hypnotic.This is a wonderful cinematic experience for people of all ages, and possibly my favorite thing about this film and it's successors is that, because they have no dialogue, they can be shown in any country in the world and not have to worry about subtitles or even altered meanings. This is a film for humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic tour de force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It is up for the viewer to take for herself what Koyanisqaatsi means. For some people it's an environmental film, for some people it's an ode to technology, for some people it's a piece of sh-t, for other people it moves them deeply. It depends on who you ask" - Godfrey ReggioSo, Koyanisqaatsi. Boring junk to some, an involving masterpiece to others, and God knows what other adjective-noun combinations are out there (you can probably guess my opinion from the rating above). Most of these descriptions are fairly subjective, but it would definitely be wrong to regard Koyanisqaatsi as anti-cinema. It is anything but. Cinema, in its purest form, is a marriage of sound and visuals; everything else is just decoration. Dialogue? Storyline? Koyanisqaatsi harks back to an age when cinema was simply a filmed record of a situation. Was it not the Lumiere brothers who are generally regarded as the first pioneers of cinema? And is it not the case that their films comprised of nothing more than situations like a couple feeding their baby, workers leaving a factory, or the (in)famous Train Leaving A Station, which went down in folklore as causing people to flee the auditorium in panic thinking they were about to be hit by a train as it approached them on-screen? Koyanisqaatsi is cinema returning to its roots, to the days when the possibilities for film as an art form were wide open, free of commercial constraints and fickle audiences too narrow in scope to accept anything other than what they view as the given norm.In a way it's fairly irrelevant what Koyanasqaatsi meant to me on a personal level, though I might get to that later. What's important is what Koyanasqaatsi represents. It's an interesting attempt (and a successful one in my view) to illustrate how a narrative can be created simply by editing together seemingly loosely related scenes and images. It reminds me of another cinematic milestone, the Kuleshov experiment, in which two separate images where edited together to create a third meaning, and which helped establish what is now known as Russian montage (and speaking of the Russian montage tradition, anyone who has seen Vertov's The Man With The Movie Camera will no doubt find traces of it in Koyanisqaatsi and vice versa). Koyanisqaatsi takes it one step further, perhaps even to its logical conclusion, using editing to create a new meaning for the entire narrative as a whole. It works on a gut level and sparks an emotional response, in a way it demands a response, be it boredom, amazement... it really depends on the person (as illustrated by the Reggio quote above). As such it's an example of cinema at its most subjective.Coming back to the influence Man With A Movie Camera no doubt had on this film, I think what Godfrey Reggio has done here is take this specific style of film-making and turn it into what I, personally, view as a cinematic statement on humanity- and our technology's relationship with the environment around us. It's a pessimistic film, filled with Cold War anxiety (though it hasn't lost any of its relevance) - and in retrospect, I also found it reminiscent of an age when America still had a strong avantgarde movement in the shape of people like Reggio or Laurie Anderson (and in a way it's an interesting coincidence that 1983 also gave birth to another experimental documentary, Chris Marker's Sans Soleil, which is equally rich in scope and tackles the same philosophical issues, albeit from a slightly different angle).I really wonder if the western world could produce a film like this today, in an age where cinema audiences are more fickle than ever, demanding a cut every three seconds and some sort of "surprise twist" at the end, with hardly a niche left for the Godrey Reggios of this world. But in a way I suppose it doesn't really matter. Koyanisqaatsi, to me at least, is one of the richest cinematic experiences anyone could possibly hope to have, and I doubt I'll see a film which will move me quite like this for a long time to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most brilliant movies ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a stunningly beautiful movie. The music by Phillip Glass is just a work of pure genius. I can watch this movie again and again. The final sequence of the Hobi legend's judgment where the container falls from the sky is just unbelievable. How was it filmed? It's so amazing. If you have not seen this film watch it - again and again! This must be the only movie which in a powerful way, far better than, say, "Apocalypse Now", sums up why our current "civilization" might be heading for destruction. Moreover, "Koyaanisquatsi" "defamiliarizes" the world and humanity allowing the viewer to benefit from a "verfremdung" viewpoint. In other words, we learn so much about our own life and life in general by watching it from this entirely new viewpoint of "Koyannisqautsi", where fast motion is used extensively. What is mankind about? Why are we moving so fast? Towards what goal? What is nature? What is the driving force of nature? What is the pulse of the earth? What is our relation with ourselves, nature and other people and animals? Moreover, I think this movie is better than the sequel "Powaquatsi". Anyway, I cannot emphasize enough how brilliant "Koyaanisqatsi" is. Watch it! Watch it! Watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film communicates to you from the realm beyond words. If you want to muck up the purity of the experience by letting the infernal adjective machine stamp out labels and reactive prose poems through its 80 some minutes and afterward, you may not have been the ideal candidate to see this film. It begins with Russian Orthodox style basso profundo voices enunciating the title over images of petroglyphs, and then begins its journey: From the places beyond things, rock and sky, to the things we have girded ourselves in, cities. It is a wordless, feeling thing. Ten stars. Pity it wasn't an IMAX.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KOYAANISQATSI remains a profound statement over twenty years after its original release. the point then is the point now.one of the great things about this film is that while the intrusion of man is initially presented as profane and abhorrent, ultimately there is found a symmetry to the human experience that is as organic as anything found in the `natural' world. i used to be tempted to perceive humans as the only species on the plant that didn't fit, that threw everything out of balance, as it were. but over time it has become apparent that even the blight of man on earth is a naturally occurring phenomenon. the evolution of life is the destruction of life. the circle is unbroken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forced harmony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This should have been ideal for me. I am always on the lookout for transcendent vision, and second to the real journey is only the cinematic ritual. Herzog does it for me, Tarkovsky and his rituals about time inside time. And I firmly believe it has done quite a bit of harm to think the universe is telling some sort of story, it has misled us to devise arcs and expect story-answers, so I welcome any attempt that aspires to push against the boundaries of thought and narrative. That is always the essential ritual, only the tool that allows the dancer to submerge himself beyond thought and description, to where he can be one with dance that means itself.I will not deny the man the powerful dance of his images, or the dedicated craft, but the ending reveals him to be shallow in the reach and depth of his meditation (if you were on the fence before). And it matters that this narrows the world by so much, because a lot of people are coming to it for a worldview and willing to open up.His "life out of balance"(Koyaanisqatsi) is "a state of life that calls for another way of living".It is just small view to contrast natural 'purity' with the evils and violence of man-made technology. Worse, it is every bit as idealized and un-natural as seeking out panoramas of skies for their extraordinariness. You can suspect that the filmmakers had to sift through a lot of unexciting shots of nature until they could settle on images that were nature as they wanted it to be, more 'natural' than others.And passing that as spiritual vision narrows the world, because it forces harmony where actual nature has turbulence built into it, stochastic chaos, and that forces a story of something originally pure and stable -paradise- that we are separate from and uprooting, and this sort of religious thinking only further separates us from the natural world. It also ignores fundamental dynamics of the real thing.For one, "life out of balance" is the natural way, it is why everything exists in the first place; planets are in position, because universal space exploded in that first minute of creation. I wonder if he was blind to it in his own images of swirling clouds and sand-particles.Moreover, we are indeed, doing a lot of destructively rapid , short-sighted terraforming of our own next to nature's, and a lot of our contraptions break, but wouldn't it be much more agreeable to counterpoint that with some of the many wonderful advances we have made on the backs of failure? Being able to separate now poisonous from edible and medicinal plants, means people died in the discovery, brave and curious explorers.And this guy is just not a very curious explorer to me. He has traveled far and captured amazing things on tape. But, it seems as if all has to fit into that one image, instead of one image splintering to reveal a multitude of reflections. His craft reveals as much; it strives for controlled perfection, omniscience, monumental depiction, clean boundaries, in every bit the same way as Riefenstahl fought in her films to choreograph the world into her own image of idealized sensuality - confused for spiritual.It's no wonder Coppola was so smitten by this he put his name and money on it, a similarly over-zealous man enthralled (at one point) by 'mystical' nature.Both, by their overly zealous approach to freeze transcendence, reveal in a roundabout way the limitations of the human model criticized here: we are at odds with this being an imperfect , chaotic world, so when the film ends with footage of burning space rocket debris cascading from the skies, the notion is not acceptance of the inevitable end of things, but a cautionary lament: if only we lived another way, things wouldn't blow up in our face. And there is simply no such way to live, not without skiing on imbalance, which is why life is exciting in the first place.And we all have to live with the fact every single day. The energy world has to daily spend a large amount simply to make-up for turbulent energy loss, because that is nature's way.And isn't it just weird but so revealing at the same time, that human-attempted control over the elements is criticized, by filmmakers who used some of the best film technology had to offer, in order to manipulate the elements and even time itself to enhance impressions of natural purity?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly, completely, blown away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first went to see this film almost by accident. Some friends were going, &amp; it happened that Philip Glass was due to be in the cinema for an after-screening interview. I wasn't a huge fan of Philip Glass, I'd never heard of Koyaanisqatsi or Godfrey Reggio: but what the hell, I went along, expecting some sort of nicely-filmed but vaguely-boring worthy documentary.An hour &amp; a half later, I was - and I'm having to try very hard to find adjectives here - in fact I'm failing. It was The-Thing-That-You-Can't-Even-Tell-Someone-What-It-Is. Completely transfixed, transported, for 90 minutes of my life.This film has no dialogue. It has no actors, apart from everyone &amp; everything that Ron Fricke's camera touches. It has no plot, apart from just the simple, complex, unfolding story of the world.The truth is, of all the films that people feel have really made an impact on their lives - and you only need to read through this lengthy thread to see how many of those people there are - this is one of the hardest to communicate to someone who hasn't actually seen it. You can compare it, perhaps, to things they might have seen - but there aren't that many to compare to. It has a kind of poetry on a whole different level from, for example, Man with a Movie Camera. The only things that spring to mind for me are Orphee or Last Year at Marienbad, but these are completely different kinds of movie, and even people who don't like them might be totally taken apart by Koyaanisqatsi.Sure you could - rightly - use phrases like "breathtaking cinematography" or "unforgettable images". You could praise the music (which really opened my ears to Philip Glass). You could point out, as many have done, how the film made you look again at the world, &amp; at your own place in it. Or you could try to relay its "environmental" message - and there are people, especially those who take any implied criticism of our species' waste and cruelty as a kind of personal insult, who will not like that message.But none of these things would come close to capturing what makes this film so special. Like trying to explain "red" to someone who's never seen colours. You have to experience it. If possible in a cinema, sitting right down at the front, completely immersed in the screen and its images.I know I'll never forget the first time I saw it. You might not either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot claim to fully understand, or attempt to explain, all of the underlying "messages" this film might have about our world, but I was nonetheless moved and enraptured with having seen KOYAANISQATSI. From a purely visceral, aural, emotional, and possibly even physical standpoint this film creates a full plethora of sensations that affected me to the very core of my being. The cinematography and editing are absolutely superb, and the driving soundtrack by minimalist composer Philip Glass is unquestionable brilliance. Despite the thousands of images, movements and sequences the viewer is taken through during the film's 87 minute duration, so many will remain locked in your mind's eye when the credits have long faded away. It does take an incredibly open mind (in other words, it's "artsy-fartsy"), but it truly is a great cinematic accomplishment and a wonderfully moving experience. You don't have to "get it", just WATCH it! 9/10. Utterly MESMERIZING!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Koyaanisqatsi is a unique and thought-provoking film. It came out at about the same time as "My Dinner With Andre", another unique and thought-provoking film which used conversation as virtually the sole method of communicating. Whereas "My Dinner With Andre" consisted entirely of a conversation between two actors, and resulted in the formation of numerous local discussion groups by devotees, Koyaanisqatsi passed relatively unnoticed, perhaps because it used the opposite technique of relying only on images and music, with no dialogue whatsoever. I found both films fascinating.The first half of Koyaanisqatsi is of a world full of beauty. The most memorable images for me are time-lapse photography of clouds and their shadows moving across the canyon-country landscapes of the desert southwest. Anyone who has spent hours gazing into a fire or watching waves at the beach will find the photography mesmerizing - one of few film experiences that convey natural beauty almost as well as the reality itself.The second half of the film is an intentionally jarring contrast, starting with a depiction of mechanized destruction of the same beauty for human purposes, i.e. mining coal to produce electricity. The message soon becomes overwhelmingly plain: We are screwing the place up, and are immensely poorer for it. The sourpuss face of frustration and disgust on a woman vainly trying over and over again to light her cigarette with an empty lighter summed it up for me, although other viewers of any sensibility will find plenty of disturbing images from the second half of the film to identify with.As my friends and I left the theater (sadly, this is one of those films that loses some of its impact on the small screen) one remarked "It's been done. They've made the movie I wanted to make". Some of the commentators here have basically said that, while Koyaanisqatsi is undoubtedly a very good film, they didn't like the message; one referred to people who would enjoy the movie as misanthropes.While its opposite film, "My Dinner With Andre" was full of discussions about the unarguably wonderful meta-physical potential of sentient beings such as ourselves, and while I enjoyed it a great deal, the contrast between the two seemed to point out that we as a species really are rather full of ourselves at times. Whether one is inclined to agree, or just wishes to see a glimpse of another point of view, one cannot go wrong seeing Koyaanisqatsi. Like the Angel of Death silently pointing out to Ebaneezer Scrooge the error of his ways, this film's message IS unmistakable, and needs no words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The New Synthetic Pantheism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I make a practice of bending hard into a filmmaker's world. Nothing has ever been too pretentious for me. I find something good in even the most poorly conceived projects. I'm inclined to pure art. I play my Kronos Quartet CDs over and over.That said, this film breaks my patience. Sure, it has quite a few massively beautiful images. But they are of the type you find on inspirational posters. There's no presence. All the life is drained out of this and what we end up with is Brian Eno for the eyes. Space music to watch. Soft, soft softly.Now I suppose you can create some romantic anti-myth about the purity of nature among all these synthesizers and helicopter shots. I suppose you can create a myth about a mystical tribe of Indians who were attuned to nature before `technology' (read: ideas and art) came along. In those splendid days all was in balance. Soft, soft.I think I understand what this tries, and its superficially is what bothers me. If you are serious about spiritual vision, and ready to leave this coffee table movie, try `The Falls' which exploits no aboriginals, has a far deeper minimalist composer (Nyman) worries about technology and nature in a way that sticks, and uses the camera to give rather than take life. Quite long and meditative.`Man With a Movie Camera' is even less accessible narratively but far, far more cinematically poetic than this.Trivia: I think I know the Air Force pilot dwelled upon about midway through. He's actually a gentle, quite spiritual man who would never wear his inner peace on his sleeve like Reggio does in the DVD extras.Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

Every screen shot floods the senses with colours, movement and sound that make you see the world in a different light. A definite wake up call regarding the way we live our lives but also a celebration of the planet and the people in it. The visual techniques used (the speeding or slowing of the image, the close-ups, the pans) all add impact to what the film maker wants to show us. In a time where movies and video are mostly used as profit makers, this film takes the medium to a new level to bring to us a unique and insightful 90 minutes. Absolutely beautiful!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was trying to explain this movie to a group of people and I couldn't get the point across. I guess this is just one of those "you had to be there"s. Non-narrative, kaleidoscopic view of mid-80's America combines scenic and street scenes with sped-up images of everyday life, including vehicle and pedestrian traffic and manufacturing processes. The adjustment in speed lets us see things a little differently and maybe more perceptively. It doesn't sound like much but when it's perfectly wed to a unique musical score it rocks. Reminds me a little of the surfing movie Thicker Than Water in its inspired combination of image and sound. I watched this last night and now I'm watching it again today. Note: I thought that was the Challenger explosion at the end of this until I saw this movie was released 3 years before that. Pretty weird. A big 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For people that like the world as it is, this movie is an awful waste of time. But, if you took the time to perceive what Reggio tried to say with its great photography, you would like it as much is I am liking it now. Few other movies can play with your feelings using only some images and music. If you can appreciate the profound criticism to our disparate way of living, implicit in this movie, then a strong impulse of trying to make this world a little less crazier will fill your mind. Personally I always look for leaving the movie theater with something new that can be useful in life, and this movie can provide it. A great effort was invested when filming and editing this movie, and we have to appreciate the final product.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nice piece of cinema that doesn't need much explanation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is not very much to say about this film. The bulk of the work that was done is obviously the filtering of the archive material, because I don't think there is much original material in Koyaanisqatsi. 'Monsters of grace' (Philip Glass and Robert Wilson, 1998) had more interesting visual material (you will not find it on IMDb because it is an opera in 3D). The concept isn't very intellectual or ground-breaking: once you've got the idea (i.e. accelerating images of our world and the consequences of human behaviour) you only need to work it out, which doesn't require much intelligence or time (or even words in this case). Credit director Godfrey Reggio (Powaqqatsi, Naqoyqatsi) and cinematographer Ron Fricke (Chronos, Megalopolis). The sequel Powaqqatsi proves unfortunately that it can be done with even less (intellectual) work. It's a cinematic opera about exactly what you see and hear and it doesn't inflict a lot of discussion afterwards in contrast with e.g. '2001: A Space Odyssey'.But this all doesn't make it less interesting. Philip Glass (Candyman, The Truman Show) probably did the most fascinating work with the score. I won't explain what Glass' music is like, but I think I will not forget those tunes the rest of my life. Although others might think this is a universal film because it's mesmerizing or whatever, I don't think it's open to many explanations or interpretations. See for yourself. It's simply a nice piece of cinema that can probably stand the test of time and can be seen every ten years or so. But it is not a recommendation for everyone. I can't wait to see Naqoyqatsi: part three of this presumable trilogy. BTW, I still can't figure out what Coppola's got to do with this film.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A socio-political tour de force, and proof that life on Earth is indeed out of balance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are but dust and grime upon the face of the earth...When this visual opera of the senses was released, somehow I managed to miss it for all these years. Only now, have I been able to get a DVD and feast myself to one of the most mesmerizing documentaries I've seen. Now I can get to see the sequels...In the twenty-five years since its release, nothing much has fundamentally changed. The only real difference is that the scale of life out of balance has ballooned to the point where humanity has finally realized ? perhaps too late ? that we are indeed on the path to self-destruction unless radical steps are taken to change our ways. Some might argue that I'm too pessimistic and point to the Montreal protocol (it set the wheels in motion to stop using CFCs that were causing the depletion of the earth's ozone layer) as proof that we can pull together when danger is imminent.Perhaps true...but the problem is that many still don't think that life on earth ? not in the upper atmosphere ? is truly out of balance. This documentary takes us all back to what it was like all those years ago ? and, as you will see or have seen on your TV news programs today, it's now all that much worse...The metaphors abound, beginning with Earth, Air and Water as the three dominant and necessary conditions that permit life on this planet, then relentlessly but gradually, showing how humanity changes the very conditions that support balanced life. Mountains explode, fires consume, people increase and multiply together with the trappings humanity needs to keep consuming: traffic jams, food and automobile production, steel and glass monuments to Mammon ? surely a parody of Kubrick's images of the monolithic Sentinel in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) ? freeways that look like arteries with blood coursing through veins, images from space that show glowing cities which morph into electronic circuits for computers ? we've become the machines we've invented ? and, of course, the milling millions, moving through life as though they are the walking dead, oblivious to all except the self and self-gratification.It is at once a pretty picture and a damning one ? of particular note, the sequenced implosion of the abandoned Pruitt-Igoe housing complex in St Louis, designed, ironically, by the architect of the World Trade Center, Minoru Yamasaki.The music very sensibly doesn't belabour the use of the title; it's chanted only during the opening sequence and during the finale which, in my opinion, is the most stunning tracking shot I've seen yet as the camera follows the detritus from an exploding rocket (a Russian one, I think) plunging back to earth. For the rest of it, just sit back, let the music waft over and through you as you watch your future begin.This is a film that everybody should see at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More then a film - best seen on a big screen, in 1.33 aspect ratio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Koyaanisqatsi is a product of years of hard work on part of filmmakers and hundreds of years old Hopi prophecies. Watching Koyaanisqatsi with some knowledge of Hopi culture goes a long way towards truly enjoying this film.I have seen Koyaanisqatsi numerous times, every time on the big screen and I believe that seeing it in cropped 16:9 aspect ratio can't do it justice. Having said that, it is still better to see it even in 16:9 then not to see it at all. (although I would advise against watching it in 16:9 on a small screen TV).Koyaanisqatsi is a film with no dialog, actors or even a "story". However, to those familiar with concepts which are in the film, this work of art has a lot to offer.Hopi Indians believe that God (or "Massaw" as they call the creator) created four distinct races to develop four essential elements: earth, wind, water and fire. The first part of the film illustrates that, although beautiful imagery can easily distract us, in a good way, from noticing that pattern is followed.It is the white man that developed and is still developing what can be done with fire element: mining and excavation, arms, nuclear weapons, engines and power plants. In the process, all kinds of fuels are needed and consequences were foretold by Hopi prophecies - "If we dig precious things from the land, we will invite disaster".Without narration, dialog or acting, Koyaanisqatsi communicates very well dangers and pitfalls of careless modern development which is quickly surpassing our abilities to control it. In this respect the film could be seen as pessimistic, but I look at it more as an observation. Koyaanisqatsi is not a criticism of all modern technology, rather a look at, from a fresh perspective, of what we are doing to the world we inherited and seem to take for granted. It doesn't let us turn a blind eye to our race with ourselves in which essential earthly and human values are left behind. Even with the film being 25 yrs old, the freshness is preserved and is it's key element.Koyaanisqatsi is probably the most enjoyable and moving portrait of our planet and humankind and should definitely be a centerpiece of some time-and-space-floating time-capsule.For me, Koyaanisqatsi is one of only a few films which I consider works of art in the deepest sense.Unless you are into plots and action, you will not be disappointed by this film; in fact, this will be the fastest 100 minutes of your life and it could be the most enjoyable film you ever saw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Earth in flux and constant movement IS the story - a true trip and provocation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As soon as you hear that a film like Koyanisqatsi (or any of the 'Qatsi' movies, it's technically a trilogy) is no dialog, no 'story' in the fictional-character sense, and is driven by a marriage of landscapes (in the realms of deserts and mountains, and the modern urban sprawl) matched to Phillip Glass music, you'll know whether this sounds like something to watch. Some will not want to go anywhere near it. And yet this is one of those rare films, like many silent-era motion pictures, and Disney's Fantasia, that can be shown in any culture, anywhere in the world, and people don't have that element of communication keeping people apart or at a distance, or in need of translation. What is shown in Godfrey Reggio/Ron Fricke's Koyaanisqatsi (aka "Life Out of Balance") can be generally understood, at least if one follows the progression of one image to another - which, to not be snobbish, is kind of what filmmaking is essentially about - in giving the impression of what happens when one moves from the barren-natural world of mountains and deserted, rocky land, and that built upon by humans in cities.And what is there in cities but technology; we need energy to survive, and cities have to provide energy, and, for myself this is one of the main thrusts of the film, people in cities feed off of that energy. Reggio and cinematographer/writer/Fricke (the latter would go on to make films in a similar, visually-aural-driven range with Baraka and Samsara) are all about charting how things are breaking down, and yet constantly moving. They accomplish much of this visually by showing things in slow motion and fast motion; what you see sometimes today on YouTube or Vimeo of cameras being tested at the high-frame rates and the low F-stops - for camera people, think of getting a camera to 3 frames per second, and conversely at 3,000 frames per second, or something extreme like that - and you get the idea of the visual ambition here.It took years to make this film, and yet it was all driven by what is essentially in the documentary form - showing the world as it is. A documentary will be 'scripted' after the film has been sought out and shot. But the experiment here, what sets this film apart so much from other films in the world, documentary or otherwise, is how the filmmakers have to give any messages through the flow of visuals - and the music. Interestingly, Phillip Glass scored the film in twelve sections, and then the director heard this music and re-cut the film to fit the music. So it's like one has to fit with the other, and it goes without saying this is music as intense as you'll hear in a movie. It will sometimes go to a slow crawl, with the organ playing smoothly, and then other times, as the montages ramp up and people move about in the masses and through places and in cars and on the streets, the music is not so much setting the mood of the players as keeping in exact lock-step with what's on the screen. It's a rush.At first, I didn't know about the technological-focused scope of the film, and it opens with the shots of the mountains and deserted plains and so on, and I thought this would be it for the film - not bad in the slightest, but... is that it? But the transition into the sections on the cities, with it first seeing the urban decay and poverty in cities (I think it's New York, it's hard to mistake it at that period of the time in the late 70's and early 80's as anything else). Then, buildings come crashing down in demolition, which continues the notion, I think, of building things up only to have to crumble them down again when they're no longer good. And then, in the main chunks (and certainly what people will probably remember most from Koyaanisqatsi), the many, many people walking, driving, going through transit, playing video games (seeing Ms Pac-Man in fast-speed is a highlight), and also how things get moved along in factories like hot-dogs and jeans.The great thing about the film, if one meets it all halfway, is that it doesn't really hold your hand about anything. One person may take this as being a condemnation of how modern society operates in cities - and this is 35 years ago, one wonders how Reggio and Fricke see this all today, with people now not even looking forward as they walk or move but at their phones and laptops - or, on the other hand, a person may take this as an ode-to-joy, a symphony of technological breakthroughs and how people co-exist with one another (aside from the building collapses, there's no real violence depicted... well, aside from the MEGA violence that comes with nuclear blasts, which are I assume stock footage in part). There's no one interpretation with a film like this, or others like it like Baraka.For myself, I think it's a grand provocation of the human spirit and what we're capable of, about if we are taking things for granted. There's all this technology, and it's so easy to get around in cars and (in America, relatively) easy to navigate around from place to place. Yet there is in parts great poverty in areas people may not care always to look, especially when skylines go up high and people are successful. And the film ends on an aching, poetic note of a part of a rocket (or is it a spaceship) coming down in slow-motion, to that one Glass organ. I hope to return to this again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Koyaanisqatsi is what you would get if took the filler shots from numerous documentaries and smashed them together accompanied by some music. And yeah, that's me being somewhat harsh, but it's not much better than that, really. There's artistic flair to it and it does explore certain themes, but it's still more of a mood piece than anything else.Plus I have a problem with the aforementioned themes. The word 'koyaanisqatsi' comes from Hopi language and literally means "chaotic life". Essentially life in turmoil, life out of balance. And while the film makers have said that everyone is free to view the film as they wish, it's pretty clear that their own intentions were to portray the downsides of modern society, of human existence in general. Except I didn't get that from the film. The first part of the film of generic nature landscapes is extremely boring and ordinary. It's only after humans start to show up, and we start to see time lapses of industry and technology, that things get interesting.And yeah, the movie shows us behaving like ants. Mindless masses passing through gates of steel and pillowing smoke. But, if we are ants, we are ants that will eventually populate the stars. We achieve, we build, we evolve ourselves. To me the whole movie is a message of triumph, of small people coming together to achieve something. And thus, as the intended message starts to become clearer near the end of the film, I was left feeling betrayed and baffled.Koyaanisqatsi is not for everyone. It's very slow, requires patience to sit through and you kind of have to agree with its message to get the full experience. Personally I didn't care for it, but I've talked with people that absolutely loved it. And even I can appreciate its flair and attempt, to some extent. Check it out if you're looking for something with a lot of edge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two ways I can think of to review a movie: The first is to simply describe the movie, the second is to futilely try to analyze the movie.Neither of these options seemed to work on this film, but I was reminded of something: During the American tour for My Bloody Valentine's immensely influential album Loveless, the band experimented with their audiences' ability to sustain music played at high volumes. Critic Mark Kemp said of the tour, "After about thirty seconds the adrenaline set in, people are screaming and shaking their fists. After a minute you wonder what's going on. After another minute it's total confusion. The noise starts hurting. The noise continues. After three minutes you begin to take deep breaths. After four minutes, a calm takes over."

		<shortDescription>Life out of balance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the Hopi language, Koyaanisqatsi is a word that roughly translates as "crazy life," or "a life out of balance," or perhaps more appropriately, "a way of life that calls for another way of living." Incidentally, that's exactly what this film shows: no plot or story, just a document of the modern age of man, far out of balance from nature, which calls for human beings to adapt to their own constructs.This film doesn't offer any conventional story with any characters; it's purely an experience built from images and sound, to illicit thought and feeling in the viewers. Both the images and music are beautiful in their own ways: with Phillip Glass' epic, well-structured music score, the film takes on a palpable rhythm and mood that perfectly accentuates the gorgeous scenery. The film plays around a lot with time-lapse footage and slow-motion, which serve to show common cityscapes in an invoking new way. Altogether, the film is as hypnotic and mesmerizing as it is thought-provoking.This film was cobbled together from all kinds of footage filmed across the United States from 1975 to 1983, with a tight budget. Regardless, the filmmakers show superb prowess with their photography and editing skills. At least on a technical level, they've maximized their potential and tools to craft an audio/visual masterpiece, weaving the images and music to the themes implied with the term Koyaanisqatsi.As far as the content goes, like any piece of art, it's left to the viewer's interpretation. The most opaque of themes will revolve around civilization's progress, the depletion of nature, and the effects of technology and industrialization on the human race. There are times in the film where humanity seems triumphant, and other times where it feels like it's spinning out of control in a downward spiral of chaos and destruction (especially in one of the film's final shots, depicting an Atlas-Centaur rocket exploding; it's a sequence that's always hit me the hardest, given the combination of imagery, music, and the overall theme that human civilization rises so high, but will eventually crash and burn).Watching this film is not only a treat for the eyes and ears, but also a sobering, moving experience unlike any other. I believe it truly represents the best and worst of the human race in the modern age, and everybody should see it at least once in a lifetime.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Content: Perfect | Film: Perfect)</fullReview>

And the idea that the human part of this world is any less natural is bogus.I found that sitting and watching this movie was an exercise in frustration that no one around me was willing to even consider any other point of view.There is no doubt that this is an excellent example of pure cinema and music melded together and it was worthwhile even with the frustrations I experienced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I challenge anyone to watch this film and not get carried away by its cascading imagery and haunting soundtrack. Koyaanisqatsi breaks away from the confines of film convention in a way that many experimental directors in the years preceding failed to. Many compare this film to Dziga Vertov's The Man With A Movie Camera, a comparison which is not wholly unfair. But while Vertov's film flaunts the versatility of film and cinematic storytelling, Reggio's piece is more lamenting and emotional. Not that this mars the experience - many choose to watch it on a purely audiovisual level, which I would concede is a far more rewarding experience. Director Reggio and his photographer Fricke work flawlessly with musician Philip Glass to unite image and sound into a cinematic experience that is impossible to forget. Buildings collapse, traffic runs like rivers, the sun pulls light like a veil over cityscapes - Koyaanisqatsi is the ultimate in unconventional cinema and deserves to be seen by everyone.</fullReview>

The film has no dialogue, but a clear message is contained in a title that derides industrial life as unbalanced or morally corrupt and a soundtrack that manages to convey conflicting opinions and emotions in a way that words simply could not have. Glass's minimalist sound scape is perfectly matched to the subject matter - it evokes simultaneous feelings of respectful awe and of absolute terror. This is a film about directionless progress, about a rapid and unregulated increase in the rate and scale upon which human life is lived, and about man's violent conquest of moral and physical nature. Ellul must have been proud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe it was Godfrey Reggio, producer and director, who said that this film "celebrates" the awful beauty of the horrible Beast TECHNOLOGY, by hitting the viewer in the sensory solar plexus.These are stunning cinematic images, accompanied perfectly by the minimalist music composed by Philip Glass. Reggio said that if you fail to participate... by merely watching and listening, without forming any opinions, positive or negative, you cannot possibly begin to appreciate this film. He really doesn't care if you "love," or merely "like," or even "hate" it, but for God's Sake form SOME opinion! I watched this film for the first time in 2006 (24 years after it was released?). I think it is MORE relevant now than it must have been then... Truly prescient, it eerily predicts the horror and sadness evoked by the Challenger and Columbia Space Shuttle Disasters (both occurred after the film's release), and the terrorist attack of 11.Sep.2001.Watching and "particpating" in this film, seeing analogs of the transition of our lives from simple at-one-with-Nature into a technological milieu in which we are so immersed we can't even see it, much less recognize its beauty and horror... All this is fascinating, and upsetting in the extreme.And I will watch and listen to it again and again...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to films that make you think and those that are stylistically unique, I have to give this film a 10. I came across "Koyaanisqatsi" when I saw it for the first time at my Intro to Film class at FSU. It was the first film that the teacher shown in class as a test to see how each student interpreted the film's possible meaning. And, lucky enough that the class was in an auditorium classroom, we got a chance to see this breath-taking film on a very big screen.The theme of the film and the style is similar to Dziga Vertov's "A Man with a Movie Camera" (1929), yet the film retains a uniqueness of its meaning for the period of time in which it had been made. "Koyaanisqatsi" is perfect for a beginning film-goer, as a means of opening the viewer's eye to both motion pictures and to the world around us. Matched with the music composed by Philip Glass, the music and the visuals work together to bring about an experience that is both sensually mind-boggling and amazing. To be honest, the film should be on the list of the "Greatest Films Ever Made" list and on the top ten portion of such a list if ever. It is a must see for film directors and editors who look to see how image, sound and editing can be used to convey a story and invoke the thought process.This film gets a 10 out of 10 from me.it is a film that is able to open the human eye to the world around you.</fullReview>

Homage to The Four-Crown Princes of Hell.Stunning vistas of the elements in flux, from canyons to plains to forests to volcanoes to fields of kaleidoscopic color, to clouds and storms and the massive movements of the ocean.2. Infernal Machines.Cut to behemoth land-tilling machines, man-made industrial environments, expansive scenery of automobiles, planes, and space-age technological inventions. 3. The Herd.The teaming masses shuffling to and fro, set to insect-like speeds. The proles kept in perspective. Crowds and clusters of humanity, with a few individual shots of amusing foibles and locations.4. The Concrete Jungle.Skyscrapers, slums, implosions, construction and destruction, as well as beautiful shots of the metropolitan evening.5. End.A return to the hieroglyphs, which seems to signify a primal contemplation, a return to The Source.Koyaanisqatsi is certainly a Satanic meditation, which would prove beneficial after any interaction with the herd, a veritable "eye in the sky" - asserts the "larger picture", as it were. A LaVeyan recommendation, it is mostly comprised of time-lapse film, and the tenebrous music compliments it well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnificently photographed, the gliding and swooping shots really draw one into the picture, and the in and out of focus playing is fascinating at times. The music fits the images very well, and theme song is quite interesting. Because of these little virtues, the film possesses power both on a visual and audio scope, however it is hard to really get into the film, due to the absence of dialogue and characters. For this reason, the images and overlaying score contain little meaning, and since there is no linear plot to follow, there is nothing to grasp the viewer in the slower sequences with less powerful music. At the end, the film quotes a few phrases in the hope of justifying what it has shown. The quotes are thought provoking, but they fail to provide justifications for more than half the images in the film. So it is not quite a masterpiece, but as a unique experimental film it is interesting, and the cinematography tricks, using time lapse and other techniques, are impressive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out ranking it's sequels because of the beautiful cinematography by Ron Fricke, this one not only astounds the senses but it teaches a lesson to us all by only uttering one word that at face value means nothing, but once you've watch the film and that definition comes up it all starts to sink in.Some of my favorite shots were the rolling clouds, what looked to be Utah's Lake Powell, the trucking in shot of the fighter pilot standing in front of his plane, the comparison between urban developments and microchip construction and what appears to be footage of the fateful Columbia mission.It's a great ride and a great exposition of what's going on in our world. This one along with the two sequels has images that are just as shocking today as they were back in the early 80's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only thing stopping me from giving this movie a pure 10 is that it's "message", Life Out of Balance, jus really doesn't come across. In fact everyone I know seems to come away from this movie with a different understanding or story, which I think is awesome. Honestly ,the only thing that turned me off about this movie was the last minute of it. YES THE LAST MINUTE, in which the definition of Koyaanisqatsi is revealed and the lyrics are translated into a batch of soapboxing phrases. The DVD trailers for the sequels also took a lot away from my buzz, ignore those.So my advice is to watch this movie, but completely ignore whatever message Reggio is trying to convey here (it's really easy). So at the end when the word Koyaanisqatsi appears, stop the movie.Define your own story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Koyaanisqatsi is unlike anything else in cinema. The closest analogy one can come up with is a sort of live-action Fantasia. But in reality it is so much more. It is an audio-visual poem that is nearly flawless. It presents the reality of everyday life and of nature from entirely new perspectives, and with what is perhaps the most brilliant cinematographic work in history, manages to unfold a fantastic portrait of life out of balance. The cinematography is interwoven so intricately with the brilliant minimalism of Philip Glass that the soundtrack and the visuals seem to breathe together as an organic entity, each actualizing the other. The divisions of the DVD and the soundtrack are perfect delineations of the film's progression: in Organic, slow camera work draws through deserts and canyons constructed by years of wind and sand, showing the organic interplay of forces that characterises natural law. In Cloudscape, fast-motion cinematography shows the dances of clouds and waters, each merging and following the same patterns (here there are some of the most dazzling shots of the film). In Resource we are given a glimpse of human development based on these natural processes. In Vessels, the film moves into the human world, where it will stay for the remainder, showing the vessels that humans construct for themselves: cars, planes, skyscrapers, highways, city streets, and the movement of these vessels together. In Pruit Igoe we see the degradation of the vessel, abandoned buildings and broken windows, models of human wastefulness, the permanence of which is contrasted with the models of nature. This sequence ends with a spectacular series of demolition shots that show the destruction of what man has built to make room for what man will build. The film reaches its artistic climax in the massive twenty-minute segment, The Grid. In The Grid, fast-motion cinematography moves through city streets, production lines, malls, and forests of skyscrapers, presenting the cityscape as a gridwork through which human lives move along predestined lines, indifferent to the thousands of fellow travelers around them. This segment speeds up to near light-speed levels at the end, moving along roads and observing the lights of cars that speed by in a kaleidoscope vision that dazzles the mind. In the final chapter, Prophecies, the camera slows down to show the people who comprise the Grid, emphasizing their identity and simultaneous anonymity within the machine in which they are gears. It also shows those who the flow of energy through the grid has left behind, stranded. This scene is accompanied by beautiful choral work by Glass, prophecies from the HOpi Language. In the final scene of the film, a rocket ascends, into space, and like Icarus flying too close to the sun, explodes in a fireball, from which a descending piece of rubble is followed in its haunting fall back to earth, pivoting around some unseen gravity, in a ballet like dance that shows that the same balance that rules the deserts rules the world of man, and that life out of balance will inevitably fall to earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful,transcendental documentary - essential viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film about the affect of modernisation on both Earth and Humanity. What's different about Koyaanisqatsi (Hopi Indian for "Life Out Of Balance") is that it is done in a way that transcends western values. No reportage, no facts, no figures. no interviews with "experts".Instead Reggio takes us on a mystical journey, a meditation on the themes of mechanisation, consumerism, and the resultant spiritual damage.This isn't for people who aren't willing to engage their mind while watching. There's no spoon fed message, Reggio isn't trying to make an argument, backed up with filmic evidence. Instead he shows you a world that is removed from human perceptions of time and space, a vantage point that makes you look on civilisation as an ebbing and flowing pattern balancing precariously on supporting patterns of nature.The footage used in the film clearly represents years of work, some appears to be archival, such as the destruction of Pruitt-Igo, the B1 bomber tail fin ride, it all builds brilliantly and is often breathtaking or awe-inducing. Most of the footage is from the late seventies and early eighties, which further helps maintain the sense of dislocation.Philip Glass provides a mesmerising score that connects Hopi prophesies with the modern footage, in a way that isn't forced or pretensions.A unique and important film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****Spoiler Warning*****I first heard of this movie when I was a teenager, and saw it so long ago I barely remembered it--as I recall it was viewed as an arthouse film that was either cerebrally fascinating or so weird people couldn't know what to make of it. I saw it again recently and was able to appreciate it as an adult, but also see behind the facade.For it's time this movie was a major achievement, a multi-year project that combined fast/stop/slow motion film with a deeply moving synthesizer soundtrack. (How often do you hear those anymore?) The music remains still the best part of the film, but in most other aspects it either fails or is horribly dated.Like "2001" the meaning to the movie is not given, and left to the viewer to draw out. The movie consisted (to me) of three sections; A first primarily of nature footage showing rocks and wilderness. There's surprisingly little in the way of wildlife, just desert areas, probably an homage to the Hopi indians the title comes from. The second is archival/industrial/military footage of equipment and explosions and cities. The last is some pretty cool footage of stop and slow action scenes of traffic, crowds of people, and so on. It begins with a rocket taking off and ends with the same rocket exploding. (And no, it's not the Challenger, it's either a Delta III or a Centaur.)The images that had been fantastic twenty years ago seem tame today, especially after endless movies using film techniques far ahead of what this movie employed, and digital effects that didn't exist when filming started. As it is only a few scenes remain truly startling, several seem to have been done by amateur photographers--and considering how much is archival footage they probably were.What are we to make of this? The general consensus is an environmental theme, that we have created a technological and ordered world that will eventually destroy us--and being done in the Cold War pictures of atomic weapons figure prominently. What is surprising is what's left out, we don't have the images you would expect of pollution or man's inhumanity to his own kind, or even the opposite of love or happiness. (But lots of people staring uncomfortably at the camera.)We get a very elemental view of existence, that civilization itself is a life out of balance and our own technology is taking us over. (In one of the film's best sequences a grid like city merges into a Landsat image and then into a electron microscope shot of a computer chip, and they really do look the same.)What the film does not provide is an answer--just what is a life in harmony, how do we find or restore balance?Unfortunately I don't think even the film makers know, and we're left to wonder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Power of the Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been said by others about this film, so I will make this a short commentary on something I think few people meditate on after watching this very different piece of work. The critique of technology, man-made things vs. nature, the cynical view of civilization - all this is much discussed while people reflect on the impact this combination of images and music (created by director Godfrey Reggio, cinematographer Ron Fricke, and composer Philip Glass) had on them. What struck me the most about this film, however, is that in many ways it can be viewed as a celebration of the power of cinema to influence perspective. I saw this film in a Fine Arts Cultural Studies course at university, and I'm often very tired during that class. As a result, I slept through the first half of Koyaanisqatsi after seeing some of the beginning. Me sleeping through a movie is not an indicator that it's a bad film since I've dozed for the first halves of a number of movies I respect (it has to do with lack of sleep). After waking up, I paid attention to the rest of this very hypnotic film and found myself thinking about everything from theology to politics to anthropology.The main sequence I'd like to refer to is when we are looking at the city, sped up, slowed down, from high up, in the streets, the malls, etc. This film gives us an omniscient perspective on mankind and we find ourselves looking at people, structures, and locales in a very different light. As time is sped up, we find ourselves concentrating on patterns (cars, moving humans), which relates to the patterns in the music. Having us identify with the music is very important to the critical aspect of the film. The music sometimes has a wondrous feel, and we feel awe looking at the corresponding image (which is always so good it would be powerful on its own anyway). Other times, the music is ominous, and something so natural as people walking down the street, shown slowed down, arms itself with emotional impact totally different from what we would feel just being there, walking down the street ourselves. The three people I mentioned earlier truly did an amazing job with this movie, and depressing or not, it's a great way to remind yourself what an amazing artistic tool humanity has in film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>film-making as situational awareness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Koyaanisqati deserves much more positive appreciation these days. It is a very powerful and salient work of cinema. One simply can't describe this kind of film as "lacking dialog or plot". There are other ways to tell a story, rather than carrying a narrative with actors and dialog. 'Koyannisqati' was a project that was never designed with these elements. What it really is, can only be described by the rather snooty-sounding phrase "visual tone-poem". But this is very moot, once you're actually watching the movie and feel its highly-compelling power.Another common mis-assumption about the 'Koyannisqati' soundtrack is that it is one long, un-variegated music composition from start to finish. In fact, Phillip Glass composed several unique and distinct pieces of music for this film. The phases of the movie and the music weave and play off one another in a way which is completely mesmerizing and novel.At its core, Koyannisqati has a very fascinating technique behind it--the frame rate of the footage shot gradually, steadily increases from turgidly slow to frenzied hi-speed and as crashing climax. It's the cinema equivalent to the Beatles "A Day in the Life". I know of no other movie which attempted this previously; and to date I know of no other film which carried it off so successfully.So much for methodology. What is the purpose of the film? I think it is this: in 'Koyannisqati', you are shown your own culture as captured along a unique, downward visual transect--a dissection happening at an oblique angle, rather than a storyline; and what the camera observes forces you to re-adjust your own observations of what the world is really going through at this point in history. I will go so far as to state that no other work of cinema sums up modern culture as adroitly.Point blank: Koyaanisqati is at first, a bewildering--but finally a profoundly moving and memorable cinema experience. It breaks all the rules and completely achieves its ends. The sensitive and mature viewer will be thoroughly rewarded by giving this unusual work a chance--hopefully on the biggest widest home theater possible.It's a movie I personally am proud to own--and a soundtrack I frequently listen to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply put, this is the best film ever made. The swings of emotion one feels while watching Koyaanisqatsi are gargantuan. More than anything, by the end of the movie you feel like you have a better understanding of who we are, where we are and how we came to be here. Learning where we are going is the scary part. The sights and sounds portrayed in this film can fill your heart, and it can shatter your soul.This comparison made by some of the other users to 2001:A Space Odyssey. They're comparing the most genius pieces of film and sound up against a slow scripted piece of fiction. WE made Koyaanisqatsi Great! Us Humans. Comparing 2001 to Koyaanisqatsi is like putting Pee-Wee next to Brando, or Cheech next to Daniel-Day. Not to say Kubrick didn't have other great works(Dr.Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket).Koyaanisqatsi is more than a movie, it's evolution.It will evolve your mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Images, Open Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with most reviewers that "Koyaanisqatsi" offers mesmerizing and powerful images. All of them portray different aspects of life. However, is there an absolute message in "Koyaanisqatsi"? If so, what is it? In "Essence of Life", director Godfrey Reggio says that "Koyaanisqatsi" opens up the world for the audience. It invites them to experience the film instead of feeding them a message. I have to agree with him. This film is so open that our interpretations are very much based on our beliefs and experience."Koyaanisqatsi" put me into a snooze at one point (hence the deduction) but I do not think that the film is bad. It makes me aware of urbanization's strengths and potential problems. If we always live in a fast and self-centred lifestyle, in what ways do we damage the world? What are human beings in the midst of the urbanized and technology advanced world? I interpret "Koyaanisqatsi" as an alert to us. We are in danger of becoming robots, machines, and slaves for technology (parallel to "The Matrix"). Technology builds up our lives in many beneficial ways. What are the effects of our lives if technology rules our daily living?"Koyaanisqatsi" was produced in 1982. North Americans know much less about other parts of the world than today. The score draws me into the film. A person reiterates "Koyaanisqatsi" in the background early in the film. It sounds as if the world is crying in pain, or even dying. Consequently, I give it a high score.</fullReview>

Buy, as theme after theme rolled by, and score after score chimed through, I found myself moved and...well, awed by the powerful emotions stirred up. The thing I like about this movie was how it could be interpreted in many different ways. A warning, an ode to technology, or simply a beautiful mixture of image and sound. The only big problem I could find was that it was a tad long. It could have conveyed its meaning in a smaller area. I am not saying that any part of it was less important than any other part. I think all parts had meaning, but it extended beyond the average attention span. Still, a moving piece of film.</fullReview>

That doesn't mean it's not worth seeing - it is worth a look - but it's probably not worth owning.The film is a non-narrative piece showing the comparison of peaceful, tranquil scenes from mountains and other earthly sites and then comparing them to the huge concrete buildings man has built in cities along with the busy lifestyle of modern-day human beings. Scenes of mass transportation and crowded streets are shown in fast-forward time, audible sounds done the same. It emphasizes the rush-rush- rush of everything in modern-day life. That "out of balance" message was interesting to watch but grows tiresome quickly. The filmmakers point could have been made in half the time, not an hour-and-a-half of the same message with many scenes drawn out way too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Koyaanisqatsi" is a film meant to be experienced. It has no narrative or dialogue, just an 85 minute string of images with an accompaniment of music by Philip Glass. The main significance in the film seems to be the contrast between nature and civilization. There's an obvious environmental message at play, but the film is getting at something much more grand and cinematic as a whole. The ultimate cornerstone of "Koyaanisqatsi" is the cinematography and music. When the film focuses on nature at the beginning, the camera-work and music is majestic and slow, but when we cut to focus on civilization, it's chaotic and fast- paced. "Koyaanisqatsi" is a purely cinematic experience that never has a dull moment and ends on a high note.</fullReview>

But this is for people with more than a little ability at self examination. Without it, the movie makes little sense at all.Now many years later the images remain, stuck in my memory and while this makes a re-viewing of it less than ideal, the message remains. Sadly our human environment has not gotten better, it is worse. Man's inhumanity towards our fellow man has gone to the point where the examples offered by this film pale in comparison.

On that level, it is thought provoking. The editing on this movie is excellent. This is the first in a trilogy and in my opinion far better than the other two - but they are worth a watch too. It might be better for you to watch them in reverse order and then you'll appreciate each one getting better than the last!

		<fullReview>When I watch "Koyaanisqatsi," I don't want to breath. I don't want to blink. I want to see every frame, every change in its footage of clouds and traffic and bustling people. The intended meanings of Godfrey Reggio's film are suggested in its environmental imagery, in its focus on industrial civilization's high speed and large scale, and by the translation of the title: "life out of balance." But meanings, and the fact that the film's use of raw footage is more propagandistic than documentary, are of secondary concern. "Koyaanisqatsi" is a powerful work of art because is a pure sensory experience. Long cuts of sped-up landscapes and cityscapes are set to a Philip Glass score, and the effect is utterly mesmerizing. The first time I saw it, I only noticed at the end that my hands had been gripping the armrests. Comparing a film to a roller coaster is a clich, and in this case it doesn't do the film justice; I've been on roller coasters that have less effect on my adrenaline than "Koyaanisqatsi."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie ends with the definitions of Koyaanisqatsi (from the Hopi language), n. 1. crazy life. 2. life in turmoil. 3. life out of balance. 4. life disintegrating. 5. a state of life that calls for another way of living. Also the Translation of the Hopi Prophecies sung in the film. "If we dig precious things from the land, we will invite disaster.""Near the Day of Purification, there will be cobwebs spun back and forth in the sky.""A container of ashes might one day be thrown from the sky, which could burn the land and boil the oceans."This is an operatic meditation on the modern life. The Philip Glass music gets very hypnotic. I would prefer less of the urban landscape only because it's gets a little repetitive. However it was probably very compelling back in the day. Some of the more interesting scenes are the pilot standing in front of the fighter plane, the industrial press compressing a block of metal and the falling rocket debris. It is an unique movie experience that compels the viewers to think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is surely the best achievement of the time lapse technology. First movie of the Qatsi trilogy, Koyaanisqatsi is a beautiful and prophetic movie. Some segments are beautifuls (the trip in the Monument Valley), uglies (the factories beside the beach, the tractor destroying the fields, the destruction of Pruitt Igoe...) and propheticals (the time lapse shots of the city). This movie is one of my favorite picture of all time. Another important point of the movie : the music. The soundtrack composed by Philip Glass is one of the best OST never written (The Grid and Prophecies are awesome). Briefly, this film is a must watch. Some people will find it boring, some people will find it awesome. I'm the 2nd kind of people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Koyaanisqatsi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen some good feature length documentary films that have featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and a few good experimental films are included as well, so I was intrigued by this combination of the two genres, from director Godfrey Reggio and executive producer Francis Ford Coppola. The title is a Hopi Indian term for "life out of balance", the film has no dialogue whatsoever, including no voice-over narration, it is simply a visual concert of moving images, including many slowed down and sped up, with music to accompany the footage. The film does not have a traditionally structured plot, but the scenario is definite starting from what essentially the origins of Earth in the large scale deserted and beautiful landscapes moving into the world of industry and civilisation. We see various images throughout that tell the story of the world we live in, including the sight of cloud formations, ocean waves, a rocket being blasted into space, a quarry work site, factories and station, cityscapes and lights going on and off, sunrises and sunsets, people walking through their environments, traffic moving on all types of road, people working, machines producing various goods, convenience environments, leisure environments, and many more man-made elements in everyday life. The key message of the film is ultimately that life is out of balance, full of craziness, in turmoil, in some ways disintegrating and however you look at it there is always something that comes along to change the way to go on living, for good or for bad. The music by composer Phillip Glass is absolutely magnificent, sometimes deliberately repetitive to give the sense of routine in life, and the chanting of the title "Koyaanisqatsi" is intoxicating, the film using juxtaposing natural wonders with sometimes bleak man-made industry is cleverly done, it may ache your eyes slightly with footage speeding and slowing throughout, but overall it is a highly watchable and engaging experimental documentary. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Koyaanisqatsi contains and unreels some of the most breathtaking images ever committed to celluloid. Translated from the Hopi language, the title means 'life out of balance' and attempts - and very successfully - shows all of man's manifestations, usually in startling close-up but also often sped-up, juxtaposed against our own-made surroundings.Since Dziga Vertov's 1928 Russian experimental film "Man with a Movie Camera", a few pioneering directors have attempted to show familiar, and not so familiar surroundings in a new and refreshing way. But none so much as the collaboration here between Godfrey Reggio and contemporary composer Philip Glass.The images are always hypnotic, some unearthly beautiful and when it slowed to its climax, I was so disappointed it had finished. The comparisons between printed circuit boards to conveyor belt manufacturing to highly urbanised street scenes are magical and compulsive. Watch on the biggest screen you can and play the sound through a separate hi-fi or home cinema system.Glass' music follows and resonates with these streams of visuals - one is the other. With executive producers Francis Ford Copolla and George Lucas, both mega directors of their day, this project had some heavyweight backing.Koyaanisqatsi was followed by the not-quite-as-compulsive Powaqqatsi which has a different take on human activity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mesmerizing stream of photography, sans-narration, set to an unforgettable score. Breathtakingly composed, it's like a guided tour of a master photog's personal portfolio, with lingering still shots mingling beautifully with their moving brethren. High-shutter landscape panoramas, silencing animated time-lapses and fast paced long-exposure peeks at civilization effectively capture the wonderful beauty we take for granted every day. A fantastically matched, epic-scale soundtrack by Philip Glass bumps it up yet another level, providing backbone and structure where it's most desperately needed. Midway through the picture, I was surprised to realize that I was thinking more during this sequence of mildly-related compositions than I ever had during a more traditional film. It's a stunner, something I can throw on at any time, in the middle of any chapter, and enjoy without hesitation. Pure beauty that's even more impressive considering its age, it's worth adding to any HD library.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two words come to mind after watching Koyaanisqatsi; Hypnotic and Horrifying. Shots of normal people simply walking down the street were altered into a raw and eerie moment due to the slow motion. There are scenes and certain shots that will probably vanish from my memory (including a haunting shot of a pilot in front of his jet, slowly and methodically zooming in). Before watching the film I knew what I was getting in to, which may have helped, but I thought that 90 minutes may be too long but he film went by quicker than I thought it would've. I easily recommend this film and even if you don't end up liking it, it won't be wasted time. Koyaanisqatsi is the Fantasia of the modern world...a haunting world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A history of violence on nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godfrey Reggio's film uses only images and music to portray it's meaning. There is no dialogue, and no narrator occupies the films space. The juxtaposition of music and image create a message, which is a quite obvious environmental one. We are shown the natural world, and also the products of civilisation, the man-made world of industry. Philip Glass's rapturous score uses signifiers to exacerbate the meaning, and the opinion of the film maker. The sequences of natural spaces are imagined musically with delicate symphonies, passages of beauty. The unnatural world has bellicose strokes, dramatic and dark; occasionally lamentable.We are shown natural landscapes of America, its mountainous places littered with cavernous hallways cut through its heart. Aerial shots glide over pastures, deep valleys, mountain ranges. Cities shot in time- lapse, rise from the water, cities cutting into the sky, reflecting the moving clouds, but denying it's reality by distorting it, making it constructed. Cities at night, streams of light slither through the roads cutting into the buildings, towering. This is where the message of the film falters. I saw the similarities with the streaming lights of motor vehicles through a night time city, are much like the aerial shots that manoeuvre over the valleys sculpted by the movement of water, long since dried up. We are therefore seeing in nature its own self destruction.The city also becomes derelict, "left-for-dead". Once natural landscapes raped by construction, abandoned, useless, left for decay. People occupy only a short time in the film. We see crowds clogging the streets, hundreds of anonymous faces, public buildings see the scuffling of existential nothingness. Fire and nuclear explosions signal man's devoted exploration of destruction.The film is undeniably beautiful. Even the man-made edifices, that we are supposed to find repugnant in the context of the film, are often gorgeous. In one shot (the longest single shot in the film) we begin to see on the horizon a Boeing 747 moving slowly towards the camera, the plane ripples in the heat distortion emanating from the hot tarmac.The title is taken from the Hopi language, and is translated as meaning "life out of balance". So the meaning of the film is quite clear. Mans destruction of nature. As stated before, the meaning is dissipated by the beauty of each opposing image. But aside from this it is nice to watch. And the music alone is wonderful. It could be seen to be a history of violence on nature.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This poignant and magnificent documentary is one of the most fascinating and beautiful film ever made: Unlike many documentaries that came before this, "Koyaanisqatsi" doesn't use any kind of dialogue or narration to express the point of view of the director: Instead of that, we are only show several scenes from nature and every day life, with the excellent music of Phillip Glass as backdrop for all the beauty, horror and strangeness presented in this movie.At first, I thought this movie was somewhat tedious and weird, but now I could appreciate more the unique, fascinating nature of this movie, where no words are needed to express how great, and yet, how terrible is the reality of this planet. Also, unlike the narcissistic trash made by Terence Malick this movie has a real point (And also, It is not endless and tedious as the movies made by Malick) "Koyaanisqatsi" is a great documentary, and it was the beginning of an incredible trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You just have to see it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scariest thing about this film is that it was filmed 30 years ago. Things have gotten much worse in many of the areas about which legendary filmmaker Godfrey Reggio was concerned at that time. The film is a series of time lapse and extended shots of scenes of industrial overuse, of nature, of worn-out people, and of the industrial processes which make much of western society turn, among other things. To my way of thinking, the film is a critique of the forces which have led us to rely on many of the processes which we see in the picture and which leave people shown in the movie in the rush that they are in. I found it a piercing critique of our modern way of life.The shots of people are invariably of them hurrying en masse somewhere. There are some very (at least to me) moving shots of abandoned apartment buildings. The shots of Monument Valley in Utah are also very beautiful. The music by the legendary Phillip Glass is amazing. The combination of the time-lapse photography and Glass' score is moving. Because there is no speaking at all throughout the movie, it's hard to imagine the film without Glass' score. I saw this on my Mac, which is 14" wide and it was impressive. Seeing it on the big-screen would be mindblowing, I'm sure.I really can't recommend this film highly enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and Hypnotic Tale About an Unbalanced Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Koyaanisqatsi" is the first installment of a trilogy about life versus progress and associated things directed by the great Godfrey Reggio, without using words, dialogs and with no plot. This a documentary filled with beautiful images, sometimes impressively strange but very real, synchronized with the marvelous music composed by Philip Glass. Koyaanisqatsi is a Hopi Indian term that means "life out of balance" and what we see in this film is thousands of images of the world as we know it and throughout them we are invited to take a meditation about their meaning. In the first 15 minutes all we see is the real nature, trees, oceans, deserts, everything untouched by the human being, at peace, quiet. When bombs start to explode throwing away lots of dirt of a mine and a haunting truck appears that peaceful world seemed to change. And then technology appears, many good and bad things start to happen leaving our life less hard sometimes but totally out of balance, stressed, unfulfilled, empty, desperate. And all of that is captured by the director who uses slow motion images, fast images that resembles a video clip (Grace Jones and The Strokes used images from this film to include in their works), all presented beautifully and in great symmetry with Philip Glass's music.I'll leave these thoughts and opinions with you but whatever the view you'll have on this film is valid. The best thing you can do is just sit back, watch, enjoy and think about it. Reggio trained to be a monk and spent 14 years in complete silence and praying and when he finally left this condition he was able to make this wonderful film and its sequels, therefore, here's a man who understands that films don't necessary needs dialogs and a plot to show a message, and he's krafty enough to give that to audiences (of course, not if you consider the same audiences that enjoy slapstick comedies or action films, they'll probably hate this movie). And we must consider that besides Kubrick's experience in some chapters of "2001: A Space Odyssey" this is a pioneering experience back in the 1980's, telling something beyond narrative, almost wordless (the only voices you'll hear comes from the choir singing in Glass's musics and the word "Koyaanisqatsi" also presented in the music). It is very hypnotizing and incredible. And despite being made in 1982 (actually more longer considering that the project begun in 1977) it's not a dated film and it's very plausible for any generation.For those who enjoy new filmmaking experiences this is a must see and watch the sequels "Powaqqatsi" (1988) and "Naqoyqatsi" (2002) (which I also reviewed). I believe that Reggio and Glass should re-team for a fourth installment due to a common and recurring theme of our days that is well discussed: the global warming effects in our society caused by the evolution of societies and the technology. The director could go back to the same places he filmed in "Koyaanisqatsi" and other places too and show how things got worse and we as audience could make an comparison between society and different times, to have a new perspective on things and to proof (again) that evolution also comes to destroy mankind while we're still getting on our positive way, taking one step ahead and walking back another ten steps. At the end of the film there's the Hopi prophecy and one of the things it is said there is this: "If we dig precious things from the land, we will invite disaster. Near the Day of Purification, there will be cobwebs spun back and forth in the sky. A container of ashes might one day be thrown from the sky, which could burn the land and boil the oceans." How close are we of this scenario? 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, what can I say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm usually not a big fan of "arty" films, and while I consider myself environmentally thoughtful, I also detest being bombarded with long "eco-lectures".This film doesn't lecture, it doesn't preach, and it isn't pretentious. It just poses fascinating questions and really provokes some interesting questions.While we see plenty of nature and the opposite industrial expansion of man, especially early on, the film features no dialogue.There is no disembodied voice ranting about CO2 emissions, or strip mining. No voice actor is telling us to feel bad. We are left to judge for ourselves what we believe is acceptable use of the environment, and the film celebrates the achievements of man as much as it criticises them.The film travels through many different emotions as the scenes change. In some a sense of awe is given, in others we see daily scenes of life at much greater than normal speed. Watching countless people march to work and go home again at breakneck speed, and cars being infinitely assembled on a line raises so many questions I never usually pause to think of.What's the goal of humanity? Beyond cash, why do attend jobs as we do? Why does society exist as it does? One scene showed a homeless man struggling to count change in his hand, and as he sadly looked at the camera, I wondered how his life had become like that.Towards the end of the film, there is a strangely poignant moment as a broken rocket crumbles to Earth like a fiery meteor. Complemented by a soundtrack that fits perfectly, it seems to spiral downwards forever, a moment that inexplicably sends shivers down my spine.I highly recommend this film, it is intriguing even for it's unusual filmography. When you start musing about the themes it poses, it gets even better, and yet it manages to avoid telling you what to think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have become so used to films conforming to convention that it is difficult for us to take on board one which insists on not doing so.Koyaanisqatsi is an exercise in sensory input, a free-form essay in image and sound, a dialectic on pattern and repetition, or none of these things (or all of them). What it is not is a film with any kind of narrative flow in the conventional sense, whether fictional or documentary.It is obviously intended to carry a message, even if only by virtue of the title and its end credit translation. As Reggio suggests, it is up to the viewer what he takes from it. I didn't take any message as such (at least, none that I hadn't already taken from from elsewhere). But I was able to allow myself to be immersed in it - the often striking images, the insistent, textured music which complements and informs what you see.There are some people who will not be open to it (my father for one) but, if you think you could accept a film which comprises images, music, and no narrative, then it is worth a visit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>---pronounced: koh-yah-nees-kahtsi--- This is simply an amazing art film. Though many would agree that "Koyaanisqatsi" is a general resemblance of "2001: A Space Odyssey," the movie finds that same audience but conveys a chilling message while presenting beautiful and symbolic images about the world. Beautifully directed, and simply breathtaking, "Koyaanisqatsi" sucks you into our real world and depicts a very realistic yet haunting idea about where we're going and how we're getting there."Koyaanisqatsi" is about the world. Like Kubrick's classic "2001: A Space Odyssey," it has three sections: nature, humans, and technology. And while "2001.." uses actors and manipulated sets to present the message, "Koyaanisqatsi" plays like a documentary. It shows documented footage of everything it's trying to convey: from the birth of the earth (mountains and nature slowly moving, then moving into a rapid pace), to humans operating machines to help destroy nature, and finally technology being substituted for humans. Everything in the movie is real, which makes the message of it all the more creepy and realistic.The directing is without a doubt flawless. To endure 6 years making a film like this, and using genius camera effects to enhance the feeling of the message, is in my eyes true film-making. Godfrey Reggio, in his directorial debut, presents to the audience a visually stunning roller-coaster. His vision into the idea that "life is out of balance" is terrifyingly real and beautifully captured.Each scene in the movie is taken with such perfection and insight, such delicate reasoning and visual arousal, it almost seems surreal. The stunning score by Philip Glass (nominated later for the Score in "The Hours") is as chilling as the images shown. The creepy yet memorable theme of the chanting "koyaanisqatsi" phrase is both inventive and presentable. The editing has got to be one of the best ever put on the screen. Each scene juxtaposes the previous and next scene, and is carefully crafted to symbolize the transition between the three aforementioned segments.While featuring no dialogue and no characters, "Koyaanisqatsi" finds a way to communicate. Through vision. Our brains get manipulated by every single 'sentence' this movie visually speaks. From the bizarre beginning up to the shocking climax, "Koyaanisqatsi" speaks the truth. It shows us that humans and technology cannot live together to the extent at which we are growing into. It shows us that war is caused by humans and technology, and that we ruin the beautiful planet once inhabited by nature.The fact that the movie is chanted in the ancient extinct language Hopi only adds to the terror of humans forgetting their true origins and destroying what we once had. "Koyaanisqatsi" is definitely not a movie for everyone, since it follows absolutely no formula a typical Hollywood film would have. Reggio shows us that you can make a movie both unique and brilliant while suggesting an immensely deep idea about the world we all live in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was one of the most astounding films that this viewer has ever seen. With its breath taking scenes of the landscapes of Earth, to its hustle and bustle of traffic and normal people going about their daily lives. Its message is blared throughout, and obviously it shows that to get a message across, one doesn't have to speak to be heard.Francis ford Coppola himself made a cameo in this film and although this viewer didn't recognize him, upon researching the Internet Movie Database, or more commonly called "IMDb," under the trivia section of this movies main page it is referenced that he is seen going into the elevator which, as many great directors or in this case producers are prone to make themselves a part of the movie as a way of showing that they are normal people, and that making a movie of this magnitude doesn't "upstage" them in any way. This movie was filmed obviously in and objective manner, leaving no one human higher than another. It also points out how small we really are, and that we mean so little in this gigantic world. The symbolism used in this movie is altogether amazing in that humans are once compared to an assembly line of hot dogs, which is one of the humorous yet serious symbols issued to the viewer. The message, according to this viewer is simply this; continue to live as you would normally, creating weapons of mass destruction and chaos, and soon you will be living in what you destroy. The film's name is even subject to its message, the Hopi word "Koyaanisqatsi, which in English means "crazy life,"(IMDb) basically lays down the entire movie, so if you understand a Native American language then you already know what to expect from this film. This viewer would like to thank director Godfrey Reggio for creating this amazing masterpiece, and Mr. Francis Ford Coppola for producing this truly emotional movie, which in this viewers' opinion should be viewed by every single person so that its message can be heard by everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 30 Greatest Films Ever Made, Continued</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(part of 30 comments I'm writing on the 30 best films ever made. They are written in no specific order)The simplest and best thing about Koyaanisqatsi (Hopi dialect for "Chaos" or "Life out of Balance") is that there is not a single word spoken throughout the entire film. The critic Roger Ebert (of "Siskel and Ebert", also only critic to win Pulitzer prize for film criticism) wrote a bizarre review in which he only gave it three stars because of a bunch of opinions he believed Reggio held (like, "it would be better if there wasn't man at all") that he felt were silly. But these are opinions that couldn't possibly be expressed without words. Koyaanisqatsi is much simpler than that - it shows, through a series of images, a world before man, quiet, slow, and beautiful. Then modern times rushes in, an incredibly fast paced, crazy marathon of people that seem never to stop. I have to criticize Ebert again, who complains that if the film is trying to show a bad portrait of mankind, then why are the images of the cities beautiful as well. Reading this, one has to ask "But where, Roger, did you decide this film was trying to show a bad portrait of mankind? You're contradicting yourself." Yes, the destruction of nature is horrifying, but Reggio also allows us to look at some beautiful aspect of the cities too, like the reflection of the sky on the polished windows. There are numerous shots looking down on sprawling city streets at nighttime, sped up incredibly fast so you see cars shooting down the the road, briefly stopping at red lights where other cars fly by them, and start up and fly forward again. I am reminded of the old middle school videos taken from microscopes where you see little organisms shooting around pointlessly. Where, exactly, are they trying to get to? Koyaanisqatsi is not, as Ebert suggests, a film about how mankind is evil, but just simply a warning. The film shows us the past, and the present, and eventually the future, leaving us a warning that if we continue in the direction we are going, getting faster and faster, things must just explode, a Herzog like prediction that if we continue our rampage against nature, then it will destroy us to return to the beginning. Many of the images involve shots that are sped up or slowed down to show stunning beauty that we wouldn't be able to see with our own eyes. "Through God's eyes" we see the shadows of clouds painting the dusty landscapes, a "waterfall" of clouds that fall down the side of a mountain, a shot mounted on a car as it speeds down a highway, sped up nearly 20X as fast. And impossibly high shot flying over New York City. Numerous shots of buildings being demolished. A nuclear weapon being tested in a southwestern desert. A room of T.V.s exploding in slow motion. Bridges being demolished. Huge, foreboding telephone line towers making cage like cobwebs over the landscape. Even with some of the most beautiful images caught on camera, the film would be nothing without the score of the wonderful Phillip Glass, who here has written perhaps the best soundtrack of all time. The before man sequence is slow, repetitive, and beautiful, the invasion of man is jarringly horrifying, and will likely haunt you. The chorus of man strikes an ironic and satirical look on the city, which also boasts impossibly fast played up and down scales that would become Glass' trademark in later films. As we see the fate of mankind played out in the last shot, a chorus of low voices chants "Koyaanisqatsi!... Koyaanisqatsi!... Koyaanisqatsi!... Koyaanisqatsi!...""Life out of Balance!... Life out of Balance!... Life out of Balance!... Life out of Balance!..."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to see the film a few times before the immediate emotional impact wore off and I could articulate my impression. The impact of this film has reverberated through my psyche since 1983 and if I hadn't had a visionary experience in August of 1982 which was almost identical in format ( not in content ), I would have believed that I was the only one who perceived the advance of modern civilization in just this way. The film approximates the minds ability to extrapolate and organize an order out of a number of random and seemingly unrelated visions one might have perceived over a long period of time in one's life. It, to me, is more interesting and the plot line is more dynamic than any other movie I have ever witnessed other than Powaqqatsi ( which was done by the same people ). I own a copy of both films and watch them over and over without getting tired. Perhaps it is the lack of dialog that holds me inthralled vewing after vewing. I'm not sure. My own vision had no dialog either and I have reviewed it in my minds eye over and over again, also. Maybe language is just too ineffective. The films and my vision make it seem so. I have made no conclusive judgements and maybe that is just. I enjoy the visuals and the music much more than a conventional film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Koyaanisqatsi was a unique and brave step forward in creating a full length movie composed entirely of images synchronised to music. Since its release in 1983 the stop-frame techniques used in the film to create high speed images inspired many advertisers and music video directors to mimic its dramatic visual effects. The soundtrack which was composed by Phillip Glass is what really makes this movie such a unique and powerful collaboration . Tracks such as 'The Grid' and 'Pruit Igoe' add a constantly changing tempo to the movies dramatic images revealing a new and frightening perspective to mankind's conquest of his planet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beutiful photography, great music!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is beautifully photographed and the music is brilliant (Phillip Glass is one of the greatest composers of all time and possibly the greatest modern composer ever). However, I could have done without the tree-hugger propaganda. The producers seem to yearn for a return to the dark ages. They are anti-technology, anti-military and anti-progress. If it were up to them, we would have no cars, planes, oil, elcetricity, or nuclear power. It almost seems like an old Soviet propaganda film about the evils of Capitalism. But, if you can put aside the environmental ignorance, its a beautiful piece of artwork that will stimulate the senses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In some ways, this film is probably a victim of its own success - many of the visual techniques have been copied and developed to the point that they're little more than clichs. But in this film, they are not used as mere gimmicks - they are central to the film's messages.Despite the rather heavy-handed explanation at the end of the film of the meaning of 'Koyaanisqatsi' and the other Hopi phrases that are chanted, this is ultimately one of those films where the viewer is genuinely left to reach their own conclusions. For me, this film was about seeing a different perspective of the world to that which we usually experience. Through timelapse photography we see both the awesome power of nature and that of alienation - the subjection of man by his creations. Nature and technology both have an effortless grace in this film, whereas people, caught in the middle, are presented as being insignificant parts of a much larger system, and stumble around clumsily trying to fulfil their roles. At one point, Reggio draws a comparison between the layouts of cities and of circuit boards, as though people are equivalent to bits of information, flowing from A to B, guided by the system rather than by their own free will. But every so often we are reminded that we are individuals, and we can choose not to be a part of that system.'Beautiful' is not a word I would use to describe this movie, although there are many images that are spectacular to look at. By the end of it, the overall feeling I had was one of discomfort (compounded by the images of debris falling from the sky - at the time I saw it I didn't realise it was merely an unmanned satellite). Though it may be fairly one-sided, the picture this film paints is of humanity under threat from itself - not through conflict, but by a gradual corruption of the Earth.Still, that's only my interpretation, and another person might well take a completely different view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To only see Koyaanisqatsi 20 years after release is to be late to the party. Somehow I missed out on striking up a joint and watching/analysing it during my student days. There is much to admire from a detatched, generational-shift viewing of Koyaanisqatsi, not least its notable legacy of many types of film/camera techniques. It is a true precursor of the glossy pop promo, and a prototype for what has been realised through digital effects. It's stylistics have been copied a million times from the opening of 'Bedazzled' to the slow character zooms of Madonna's version of 'American Pie'.In that sense it loses some of the experiental qualities it would have had in 1983, when its use of time-lapse, slow tracking shots and other tricks had greater novelty value. Nevertheless, some of the sequences, particularly the 'tidal humanity' in the middle of the film possess great power.The aspect of eye candy aside, Koyaanisqatsi works on the level of revealing the systematic aspects of modern life. This may appear an utter truism, we all know how organised and systematic life is, but seeing it demonstrated in the flow of a bank of escalators, and then segueing that into a hot-dog production line reveals it anew.However, the film's rather facile corollary - that this is pretty much a bad thing and will all end in apocalyptic disaster is one I do not automatically follow. In some ways it becomes, unintentionally, a paean to the ability of humanity since the Enlightenment to organise, feed and transport itself.Okay, the Indian prophesies predict a 'Day of Purification', but the fact remains that after millenia of starvation, rampant disease and vulnerability to the elements we life in a life of unimaginable comfort to those ancient seers. The 'nature myth' is a pretty simplistic one, and juxtaposing beautiful mountain ranges and nuclear weapons is a process where the visual impact exceeds the depth of the idea: where these mountains not created by forces many times greater than our biggest nuclear devices? Kindly mother nature has demonstrated herself more than capable of extinguishing several eras of life on this planet. Her depiction as a terminal victim of human rapacious is quite wrong.In this Koyaanisqatsi is definitely not timeless, and a product of that period between early post-hippy environmental awareness and emerging Reagan-era paranoia of Mutually Assured Destruction. Nowadays our fears are more prosaic - we expect a nuke in our backyard, not the sky filled with them; we're lamenting the loss of specific species, not fearing the entire sky is going to burn up.Koyaanisqatsi is still beautiful and worth watching, but maybe the Indians got it wrong after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Else Is There To Say...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What else is there to say about KOYAANISQATSI, that has not been expounded on before. In the supplemental interviews on the DVD release the director, Godfrey Reggio, laments about the meaning on the film for what seems like hours. I'm glad that he is a thoughtful film-maker, who has back-stopped his theory for the film with deep insight and pseudo-religious thought. KOYAANISQATSI, when it was released, was a groundbreaking film that challenged the minds of those who saw it. Using the then fairly unproven technique of time-lapse photography, with no dialogue or narrative structure, the only voice in the production being the starkly minimalist score by Philip Glass, it changed the face of documentary art. It stands the test of time.The film begins with a natural setting: clouds dancing in the wind, a crane shot of waterfalls, sun drenched landscapes. It then moves to the world of technology. The interesting aspect is that due to the structure of the film, Reggio simply presents the similarities and differences between the two worlds. The overpass at night, with the cascading headlights resembles the waterfall from earlier in the film. There are many such examples of this, which serves to cement the theory that all this, nature and machine, exist in the same world. Static and dynamic. One does get the sense that Reggio has taken a more Liberal stance concerning conservation of the planet, but this is not heavy-handed or preaching. The final conclusions are left up to the viewer. Is KOYAANISQATSI simply an intellectual meditation in style? a deeply moral presentation of the world in which we live? A cautionary fable of modern life? Is it all of these thing or none of them? That is the wonderful aspect of this film; one can simply let the awe inspiring images wash over them, nothing more, and the film has still succeeded in its purpose. If one were to chose to deconstruct KOYAANISQATSI, fragment by fragment, one could, but every individual perception would be different. The film has no answers, it simply is. More schools should show this film to their students; it not only generates varied viewpoints, but also offers a glimpse of American film making that transcends the likes of THE MATRIX ten fold, with its thought provoking images and originality. 9/10. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life out of Balance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life out of BalanceAs Western Civilisation tears a path across Earth, it leaves the debris of its construction scattered over the surface of the planet. America's `purple mountained majesty' and `spacious skies' have fallen to strip mines and heavily patrolled air space. Biological evolution has become irrelevant, replaced by the manipulation of our environment and genetic modification. We are rapidly constructing a civilisation of destruction. We have raped the earth of her beauty and replaced it with towers of corporate power and industrial wastelands. We have dehumanised ourselves, disconnected of earth itself we lose all identity as human creatures and are now but the interchangeable parts of a global machine.It is the horror of what we have become that forms the core of Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi. By juxtaposing the cool tranquillity of nature against the frantic rat race of man, Reggio demonstrates to us just how far we are removed from our origins. Unlike the desert calm or rolling clouds, we are the violent actions of Earth. Volcanoes, we erupt upon the surface, creating havoc and destroying all that lie in our path. Reggio prompts us to ask ourselves why we are what we have become.Koyaanisqatsi, despite dating to 1983, is still highly relevant. It's timeless. It transcends the barriers of language, relying only upon images and music to transmit its message. The message is sometimes confused, hidden behind a faade of beauty, but it is in this faade that the message is found. The juxtaposition of nature's beauty against man's hideous creations is intended to reveal our true nature. Our awesome construction projects, the very indicator of our power, are ugly. The fabric of our society, the web we weave, is weak. Every inch we raise ourselves above what is considered base, is merely another inch for us to fall.Reggio's film is a cinematic masterpiece. Each shot is beautifully composed, offering us new perception into the world we spend our every waking moment in. However, it is in the manipulation of the images that the message is created. By under and over cranking the camera, Reggio changes not only our visual perception but also our relationship with time. He is able to isolate people on the crowded streets of New York and Los Angeles, slowing the rush of a nine to five existence. The sense of worthlessness is overwhelming, these individuals are lost amongst the masses, one of millions who crowd the streets. Yet for a few brief seconds this individual is bought to a near halt, immortalised on celluloid. It demonstrates the very banality of modern human existence. Humanity strives for immortality is some form or another, but in our very quest we have wrought our own destruction.Humanity's zenith has passed. In the final shot of the film, one which lasts several minutes, we watch a shuttle launch into space. Space exploration, man's greatest achievement, becomes a metaphor for its creator. As the craft rises above the earth it carries the hopes of a species. It is majestic, the pinnacle of technology, the culmination of 100 000 years of modern human existence. However, like man, the craft is doomed for failure. As the explosion tears the craft apart, so are the dreams of man strewn across the empty sky. The camera follows a piece of flaming debris as it falls to earth. This is our fate. As Lucifer fell from heaven, so must man fall from grace.The film attempts to illustrate the flaws of man. In our success lies our failure. It does not advocate any cause or lifestyle, it merely informs us of who we are and what we will become of our future should we continue as we are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for the unthoughtful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read through 60+ comments already online about this film, I won't bother to add to that verbiage. Instead, I'll describe the experience of first seeing it, which is still vivid in my memory.Koyaanisqatsi was shown at Radio City Music Hall when it was released, as part of the New York Film Festival. Once it was over, the sold out house made its way out onto the streets of midtown Manhattan, during busy evening traffic for the theater district. The audience had been transfixed by the film sufficiently that it had temporarily forgotten how to "behave" as pedestrians. Scores of people wandered off the sidewalks and into the streets, such that it snarled up traffic. Perhaps they were considering the intensity of city life as ephemera or illusion. And so, a cacophony of taxi horns filled the air, and the drivers rolled down their windows to curse and yell, trying to bring the crowd back to "reality". Which everyone was busy considering in unconventional ways. Memorable juxtaposition.Inexplicably, in the midst of it all, was a man from Bolivia with a llama. For some modest fee, you could have yourself photographed with the furry Andean ruminant. Completely cryptic, but somehow appropriate, and as sensible as anything else around and about at the time.Koyaanisqatsi was (and is) beautiful and thoughtful. About ways of life that can endure, and those which carry the seeds of their own destruction. Told in a non-narrative, non-verbal way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wondrous piece of art, however not timeless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is only fair to say that before I start this review I should introduce myself so as to show what standpoint I come from. I will see any movie. I can look at films as art and as interesting ways of killing two hours. A successful movie is one that I can remember long after I leave the theater, which for me is a huge stretch because my short-term memory has been killed by all the fast-paced editing we see everywhere today. To put it simply, after seeing Goldmember the only thing I remembered from that whole movie was the very beginning with the mock opening. And this was just as I got to the parking lot. I had heard only briefly of Koyaanisqatsi after seeing posters for Naqoyqatsi, the final part of the trilogy. Hearing all the hoopla about the first film being revolutionary and exciting, I went and got it. I took it home, saved myself an hour and a half of nothing to do and put it on. Someone had told me that this movie's praise in the early 80s came from the fact that no one had ever been exposed to shots like the ones in the film before. There were no long-form time lapse shots, no IMAX-like landscape views, no shots of random people staring at you for five minutes, and that alone is revolutionary. Indeed you are left to draw your own conclusions after you finish watching everything and that in itself is a dangerous idea. The cinematography is beautiful. Yes, you could find a lot of these shots on inspirational posters, but inspirational posters don't compare city grids to motherboards or the minor bustle of Grand Central Station during rush hour to the quiet stillness of nature. And finally, Koyaanisqatsi has no poorly-written one-liners. The DVD cover is enough to have photography majors in my school giggle with joy. The score for this movie, done by Philip Glass, is incredible. It can be said that it's aural poetry when combined with the images the music is put to. Glass, himself, said on the DVD that he would write music to fit exactly what he saw, and it's crystal clear what he going for in most senses. When there was a bustling crowd or a rushing flood of weiner dogs, Glass would be there to compliment the frenetic pace. It beats Madonna's "Ray of Light" video to the punch. Unfortunately what mostly gives this movie its downfall at this day and age is how outdated it is for its message. The music, though minimalist (barely) and symphonic, is electronic in parts and can sound like your average B-rated educational video. And look at the hair on those women. It must be the 80s. As a time capsule, this film works beautifully to ressurect images locked in our minds from that era of the late 70s, early 80s, but for us in the new century, the concept of the film spouting "Life without Balance" can be lost quite quickly. Being new to the films I couldn't help but hold my breath every minute as shot after shot revealed the basis of what would be parody after parody after parody in later years. Who knew "Vessels" by Philip Glass was what was being parodied by South Park, or how many times have we seen time lapse shots of cars on a freeway in terrible educational videos? So many things seem to have come from this movie it is astounding. If you've heard about this movie and have just a slight interest in seeing it, give yourself the time and patience to give it a shot. Not much will seem new to you, but if you let the engaging visuals and Glass' impressive score enter your senses, you'll find yourself entranced all the way to the credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this film in New York City many years ago. I knew nothing about the film, except that everyone was raving about it. I sat patiently in the darkness amid hauntingly beautiful music, waiting for a character to appear, for a word of dialogue or narration, anything...then I realized what the film-makers were up to...This film stars the planet Earth and everything in it!It went from incredible beauty, to the technological insanity that has become our daily lives, to the mournful tones of the end with scenes of self-destruction, which seem to present itself as a warning for us to mend our ways, with music ending the same way it began. The descriptions of the Hopi prophecies sent a chill through me as I read them for the first time, and I heard an audible gasp coming from the theatre's audience.A film with no characters, no cast, no dialogue, no narration, no storyline, and no plot. It doesn't need any of them. The visuals and music dance hand in hand with indescribable beauty.Now it is on DVD, and I can only echo the praises others have left for this film.Magnificent, highly recommended, and worthy of preservation for future generations. If you want to know what is meant by "cinematic art", this is a shining example.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The mid 1980s. A 13 inch TV. PBS shows Koyaanisqatsi. Beauty, energy, and raw truth overwhelm a mind lighting up. Amazement. Sound, light, matter and time unified. Yes.Koyaanisqatsi had a profound impact. The station only showed it one more time, then it vanished for over 15 years. The marketplace was flooded with Space Jam, Operation Dumbo Drop, and Jaws 3-D cassettes available 24 hours a day. Pauly Shore's body of work quickly found its way to DVD. Finally, in 2002, I was able to revisit this stunning work of art.United Airlines happened to go bankrupt this month. A news story showed some jets with the ugly grey and white modern paint job. Then they showed an old white UAL plane with the rainbow stripe and elegant black lettering. I hadn't thought of or realized how beautiful, innocent, and optimistic that design was until they were juxtaposed. It was joyous to see the same white planes slowly shimmering into view again in Koyaanisqatsi.I can see how Koyaanisqatsi and statements praising it would be painfully aggravating to rational, symbolic, left-brain perception. Luckily, the first viewing opened my "artist's eyes" and I found myself zapped into the timeless, mystical freedom of right-brain mode. I loved how they broke the rules of conventional cinematic narrative when they held and held and held that shot of the casino waitresses. The blond woman in the black car pausing before rolling up her window looked angelic. It is a great gift to be freed from the mind-forg'd manacles of language, a backward-looking substitute reality inherently limited by its dependence on pre-defined words. Translated into prose, Koyaanisqatsi would be a dismal, long-winded, empty failure and a torture to read. But as direct, unfiltered, unencoded, living reality, it transcends prose to become poetry. A miracle of light, nature, and humanity. The brilliant music, tied down so tightly with seemingly simple repetition, breaks free nonetheless with stunning power.I treasure Koyaanisqatsi, and am glad it lived up to (and often surpassed) my memories. After so much cultural change, it is an amazing artifact of America as it once was. Like Lumet's beautifully photographed "The Verdict", it captured details of a time now lost forever. I send my sincere thanks to the team who came together to make this special film and all those who brought it back on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Koyaanisqatsi has been OOP for years, even on video, until yesterday when FINALLY it was released on DVD. After checking four different stores, I finally found one that bothered to have a copy for sale on the release day, so I snapped it up and watched it in the dead of night.First, I have to say I'm a bit disappointed in the print quality of the DVD version - quite a few scenes show evident wear and tear on the print used. I have to keep reminding myself though, that this movie was made TWENTY years ago... the negative and master prints have certainly had quite an adventure during the past 2 decades. (If ever there was a perfect argument for film protection and preservation, Koyaanisqatsi is IT.)I'm also wondering about the aspect ratio. It seems incorrect at 1.85:1 - I could've sworn I've seen a version that was 2.35:1, but since it's been so long since I've actually seen the film, perhaps I'm mistaken. If however, this is not the full aspect ratio, then that's a ridiculous choice by the DVD makers - I mean, fans of a movie like this are the LAST people on earth who would be "scared off" by wide letterboxing, something the studios still seem to think consumers are terrified of.Ok, so how about the movie itself? Koyaanisqatsi came out the year I graduated from high school, and it was an extreme influence on me (and others - it's become quite legendary and has been name checked countless times everywhere from MST3K to The Simpsons). But after not seeing it for well over 10 years, how did it affect me last night?Hmm. Maybe for the very reason it's become such an icon, it was just a bit of a letdown. On a superficial level, I am AMAZED at how much has changed in just 20 years. Many things in the film are downright quaint now - the cars, the hairdos, the fashions, the huge old mainframe computers, Ms Pac-Man, billboard ads for Betamax players! And MAN, Times Square really was totally squalorous, wasn't it!?On a deeper level, one of the inadvertent profundities of Koyaanisqatsi is that, in watching it now, the relentless march of time is all too apparent. When compared to the mountains of Arizona or the layers of the Grand Canyon, everything we do as a civilization seems thoroughly disposable. 5000 years - big whoop.One thing that hasn't changed is our relentless consumption of the planet's natural resources, and that's only accelerated since the early 80's. We were all well aware of the risks we were taking with the environment back then and we knew we had some difficult choices to make. The decision of the majority since 1983? Buy a 12 mpg SUV, build a McMansion and participate in adding another billion people to the world's population. Good going.OK, I'll get off my soapbox and back on the subject at hand :-) Koyaanisqatsi is still quite marvelous to behold - one thing that I've built an appreciation for over the years is how important EDITING is, and Koyaanisqatsi is BRILLIANTLY edited. And last but certainly not least is the absolutely astonishing music by Philip Glass - it can stand alone from the film as a separate work of art. "The Grid" portion of the soundtrack is, in my mind, one of the towering achievements of 20th century music. (I can highly recommend the 1998 recording of the soundtrack which is even better than the version made for the film.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even better "live"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in my uni days and enjoyed it at lot. So I was excited to be able to see it again a couple of years ago in a "live" performance at the Sydney Opera House.The images were projected on a massive screen while the soundtrack was performed live by Phillip Glass and his ensemble.It was a superb performance and very moving emotionally - even more so than I recalled from seeing the movie. The soundtrack complements the images brilliantly and brings out the anger, sadness, frustration of modern life.Definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anxiously awaiting the DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film about 17 years ago. I rented the tape without knowing anything about it and watched it on a 19" Trinitron. Nonetheless I was floored by both the images and score (though I'm not a huge Phillip Glass fan). I rewatched the film 4 or 5 times within a few months (at least one of those times with the aid of a certain tobacco-like substance -- it was, after all, that kind of film!). Of course, that was 17 years ago. Although I still have a copy of the film on Beta (and a working Betamax), I've not watched it since.Now that I have a wide screen Hi-def TV and surround sound system I can hardly wait for the DVD release (9/19/02) though I must admit I wonder how well the film will have held up. As gorgeous as it was to look at and listen to, its message was more than a little heavy handed and a bit trite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll second the "Best Film Ever Made" comments. It's an extraordinary, shattering, mesmerizing, life-changing experience. And maybe all the people who are suggesting it as a kind of personality gauge are correct--I can't conceive of someone being bored, or even worse, offended, by the issues Reggio explores. "Koyaanisqatsi" uses the film medium--itself the result of a mechanized process--to comment on and, really, alter the way we perceive our world. If you call it propoganda, you're missing the point. And you're probably an oil executive, too. I can think of no other excuse to dislike this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching Koyaanisqatsi and its powerful images, fused with Phillip Glass's soundtrack, only made me fantasize how Lynch's DUNE might have looked using those elements. For some strange reason, Koya (for short) reminds me of Dune (and vice-versa) in that certain vistas as seen in Koya could have been used by Lynch (real landscapes, for instance, instead of those dreadful FX he settled for)Mr. Lynch, think what might have been if you had used Mr. Glass's music and Godfrey Reggio's camerawork.As for Koyaanisqatsi itself, can't wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We surely invite disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review describes the scenes in the film, some may regard these descriptions as 'spoilers'.Possibly the most underrated film of all time. Underrated because it is not at all like most other films. Most films have actors, dialogue, plot, people kissing and/or killing each other, so anyone who is closed-minded enough will probably not like Koyaanisqatsi, as it has none of these.It is a sequence of images- time-lapse, slow-motion, normal speed, stills, all set to a haunting Philip Glass score. The beginning of the film depicts scenes of great natural beauty and splendour and draws ingenious paralells between the motion of clouds and the motion of water, as well as striking views of Monument Valley, Utah, among others.The images gradually change in character as we see more and more of man's influence upon the natural environment, particularly how careless and destructive we are.The final part of the film concentrates on city scenes. Again, time-lapse is cleverly used to illustrate the movement of people, one is reminded of the movement of clouds and water at the start of the film, but people appear to move in a more futile and purposeless way. The grace and beauty of the water and clouds is completely lacking here.Individual people are shown in slow motion going about their lives. Those lives are made to appear worthless and in one case extremely moving, as a vagrant shuffles down the street inspecting his empty pockets. He appears to look into the camera (did he know it was there?) and the expression on his face is something I will never forget.The final scene indicates the failure of man's technology as the music reverts back to the opening theme. I won't spoil this scene as it makes a wonderfully powerful climax that words cannot convey.This IS the best film ever and it is worth every second. It conveys a powerful and somewhat depressing message that you won't be able to ignore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only film that really deserves to be called 'art'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film many years ago (against what I thought was my better judgment) on the recommendation of some 'arty/druggie' friends. Nothing could have prepared me for the experience of seeing this on a huge screen (incidentally, if you ever get the chance to see this on a decent sized cinema screen, cancel anything else to do it, even your own funeral!). Words cannot describe the powerful imagery of the pictures on the screen and the perfectly matched score. An undeniable masterpiece of monumental proportions, this has affected me more than any other film, piece of music or other art I have ever experienced. I sat there transfixed, never took my eyes off the screen and 'forgot' I was in the cinema, never saying a word to my friends around me- the same goes for all the other people there. At the end of the film, everyone sat there silent, in an almost trance like state, whilst the credits ran up. I have never matched that cinematic experience to this day, and doubt that I will again. I got it on video years ago, and whilst I've recently got a 52" TV and can now get something of the experience back, the pan and scan and poor quality sound track does a great dis-service to this film.HOWEVER- it seems the studio have finally sorted out the legal wrangles that have prevented it up to now, and are preparing to release this on DVD in September this year- not before time, this is without doubt (along with 2001 &amp; T2) the reason DVD's were invented- but be warned, its only really worth seeing at home in widescreen on a very large TV, with the volume turned up to neighbour(hood) annoying levels.Well, enough hyperbole, just go an see it/get it, or you've missed out on one of life's most intense experiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual and audio bombardment on the senses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This must have been the fastest 87 minutes of my life. I started this on my VCR and was sucked into this mesmerizing world of imagery and sound and before I knew it was over. This movie bombarded me with these visuals I could not take my eyes off.Philip Glass' soundtrack was engrossing if chaotic at times (but this complemented the scenes perfectly) and made the skyscrapers and apartment buildings seem like giants standing in a wilderness created by Man.The imagery of the highways at night filmed in timelapse were particularly striking because they seemed to resemble veins and arteries of a body that was very much alive. We are just a part of this enormous organism called Mother Earth, and we should respect that.The timelapse visuals of the city in the rainstorm were very good as well, it gave you an impression that while we think we have conquered the world there is always this tremendous force looming over us, but we just don't realize this every day.One more thing: I think the tie-in for the beginning and the end with the launch of the space vessel was fantastic. This shows our vulnerability when it comes to what we are doing every day. You have this incredibly complex machine, but when only one part of that machine breaks down the whole system goes down. That is something to think about (and was it me or was that piece of debris never going to hit the ground).And in this manner I can go on and on recalling my impressions on the visuals but that would take up too much space.I regret having seen this on the small screen. I do not know in what ratio this was shot (2.35, 1:85 or something else) but I expect this to be 20 times more impressive on the big screen. This is an eye-opener of the best kind.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have a barrel of fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an awesome movie, although I'm not quite sure I'd actually characterize it as a "Barrel of fun." However, there is a scene in the movie (Times Square, Manhattan, NYC) with a huge billboard of Colonel Sanders urging his customers to "Have a barrel of fun!" (i.e., a barrel of his Kentucky fried chicken). Down on the street, it doesn't look like any of the pedestrians appear to be having much fun at all though...this is only one of hundreds of amazing images &amp; ironic juxtapositions that make up the movie. I doubt if there's much in the way of original criticism that I can add that you can't already find in the external reviews and other user comments, but I would like to make 2 recommendations that are not already listed under the imdb.com recommendations: "Baraka" and "Powaqqatsi." These 2 films are also "documentaries" about the world we live in, and like "Koyaanisqatsi" they also have no "plot", no dialogue &amp; great soundtracks. If you like "Koyaanisqatsi" you'll like these films too!</fullReview>

Having only seen it once all those years ago, I still vividly remember many of the scenes and images. I suppose for some this film will lose its appeal in the light of similar experimental collages in film and even music video. But this one is perfect in my opinion. For some reason, this came up in conversation with one of those friends who brought the tape over, and ever since we've discussed it I can't wait to track it down and see it again.

		<fullReview>I have seen this film 3 times in its pan/scan format, having no access to laserdisc or unconventional film houses. Being a moderate fan of Philip Glass, I was utterly glued to this film each time. It reflects the power and majesty of our planet, revealing its beauty and reflecting the horrors and numbness of our devolution upon its surface. It depicts the vastness of nature and the vast loneliness of a humanity which struggles to cope with cities and buildings.This film should be watched by all with an eye for beauty, nature and truth. I have never before seen a more honest film, and I am greatly looking forward to the proposed war documentary of the same vein.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating visual documentary speaks volumes without words</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite possibly my favorite film ever, Koyaanisqatsi (a Hopi term meaning "life out of balance") is an amazing film. Featuring no dialogue but boasting a terrific score by Philip Glass, it documents the impact of technology on ourselves and the world around us.While the concept of a film with no dialogue might seem a little dull for more mainstream viewers, anyone willing to give this film a chance will most likely be surprised at how powerful and beautiful it is. The superior cinematography combined with Glass's music is an experience that begs to be seen with as large a screen and as few interruptions as possible.I usually find that few films can hold the same amount of interest on repeated viewings, but having no dialogue is Koyaanisqatsi's blessing. The pictures move by so quickly that there is always more to see, more to discover. If you allow yourself to become immersed in the film, it is almost like being in a trance. Glass's soundtrack is hypnotic; sometimes brooding, sometimes frenetic, sometimes even exasperating, but always appropriate.In short, no review can really do this film justice. Don't be put off by the title or the difficulty in finding this film. It's more than worth the effort. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mind-blowing experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS***I first saw Koyaanisqatsi this year in an unusual mode: Philip Glass, composer of the mighty score to this film, was touring with his ensemble, and actually performing the score, live on stage, in sync with the film which was being screened above the stage! - almost like the days of piano-accompanied silent films, one might say. It was in January this year at the Sydney Opera House. The lights went down, and the organ began a slow, funereal passage as the screen slowly panned across ancient South American Indian cave paintings. An impossibly deep bass vocalist on stage began chanting slowly, over and over, one word, the movie's title. Already, I was enthralled. As the movie progressed through slow motion pans over beautiful, untouched natural landscapes, the score swelled in power and majesty. Suddenly, an odd discordant note crept into the score, and we are confronted with the visual spectacle of hundreds of oil rigs pumping, giving visual body to the now-straining theme. The next three-quarters of the movie are in this vein, as we are treated a visual recording of the human takeover of every facet of the life on the planet. The images now, instead of being slowed down, are speeded up to a dizzying, frenetic pace - crowds in Grand Central Station, traffic on L.A. freeways, looking almost like a biological closeup of a human bloodstream, which is matched now by the rapid-fire arpeggiated score. Finally, the music returns to a slower, studied, uncertain theme, as we witness in incredible, close-up slow motion, the launch of a U.S. space probe. The camera follows the rocket from the launch pad up into the sky over several minutes, until it accidentally explodes - the explosion, even in slow motion, is so sudden, so frightening, I almost fell out of my seat. At that instant, the original, deep, sombre chanting theme returns, as the camera for the rest of the film, remorselessly follows the shards of the space vehicle spinning helplessly - still in slow motion - towards the sea, before ultimately returning to pan once again over the original cave paintings. Finally, the screen goes black, and the dictionary translation of the Hopi word Koyaanisqatsi appears - "life out of balance". The message is powerfully and unforgettably clear: despite our technology, despite our apparent mastery of the world around us, we in western culture aren't quite as smart as we think we are. This for me was a mind-blowing experience; I will see this movie again and again, but I will never forget the first night I saw it, performed live by the composer. Surely this film, with the possible exception of Fantasia, is the greatest combining of the arts of film and music ever attempted, and beggars subsequent cheap imitations like Naraka. You must see this film at least once in your life. It's awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Modern Day Silent Majestic Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film is a visual medium; words are not necessary to tell a story. Stanley Kubrick taught us that with his masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey. He proved that visuals is all that really matters in film to tell a story that will cause people to make their own conclusions while also trying to maintain the sense of the director's intent. Godfrey Reggio also proved this with his masterpiece Koyaanisqatsi. Both of these films, especially Koyaanisqatsi are a perfect example of a modern day `Silent Films'.Koyaanisqatsi is not a film in its traditional sense. There is no story, yet there is. I know it sounds ironic but let me explain. What is it that you see when you go see a movie? Images, montages of images put together to tell a story. Koyaanisqatsi is nothing but images put together to tell a story. Even though there is no dialogue what so ever, you somewhat understand what the film is trying to induce. The film begins with a painting of what seems to be Hopi paintings on a stone. This could represent the birth of mankind. Then the next image is a space shuttle thruster, the evolution of man evolving to the extent that he has passed the limits of the skies. The first half of the film are images of Mother Nature. Meaning oceans, landscapes, and so forth. The second half is modern day earth with it's technological advancements.You can see the images tell a story if you look closer. We begin with nature, no signs of humans or technology. It's a beautiful scenario. After the images of nature finish, the first thing we see is a tractor of some sort ejecting black smoke making it look intimidating and dangerous as it's own smoke slowly covers the entire frame. A beautiful yet fearful sight.Modern day life has never seemed so strange. As I saw Koyaanisqatsi I realized this was modern day. But the way Godfrey Reggio portrays it onscreen makes it appear as if we are in a different world. Images switch from playing in fast speed to slow motion, and vice versa.Accompanied to a beautiful score by Philip Glass adds even more beauty to the film. Glass is known for his offbeat style of music, by combining it with Reggio's bizarre style, it creates a masterpiece of film unlike no other. Koyaanisqatsi is not a film for everyone. It takes a certain type of audience to appreciate a film like this. This is film is a piece of art form, if you want a true definition of what people talk about when they say film is art, this is the best example you will ever find.There is so much to say about this film that I can't even think where to begin. All I can say that if there are any people out there that truly love film will appreciate Koyaanisqatsi. If you cannot appreciate what this film has to offer, then I don't think film is an area that can truly relate to you. Like I said before, this film is made specifically for certain types of people, its not for everyone. When a film of this caliber can make you laugh, smile, and evoke emotion, you know you've cared about it and it has meant something. Any filmmaker that can make this so through a montage of images is an absolute genius.</fullReview>

It is a totally non-verbal experience that demands an open mind to fully enjoy. It is an absolutely stunning assault on your senses. Godfrey Reggio and his crew fill the screen with glorious images of nature that dissolve into mechanistic cityscapes that eventually mutate into an unseemly but seamless combination of dehumanizing frenetics and organic symmetry that expose the insane quality of urban life and the expense the our planet pays in its wake. Phillip Glass's score is graceful and pulsating exactly where it needs to be. The music reaches the most dizzying climax of any musical work I've ever heard. It is also beautiful beyond words. This film richly rewards anybody who allow themself to be fully immersed by it.</fullReview>

Intrigued by the odd title (not to mention the absence of a cast list) I asked my father about it. His response was, "You should watch it." My father is a wise man.Many have commented on the film's pertinence as a criticism of our culture, the modern age, technology, etc.... but the aspect of the film that I enjoy most is the simple breathtaking images and music. I enjoy the music of Philip Glass and own several of his major works, but I have found none to touch his work on "Koyaanisqatsi" (including -- especially -- his score to the wan "Powaqqatsi" of which the less said, the better). Each viewing seems to uncover an image that I had forgotten or not noticed on a previous viewing.I would like at this point to champion a widescreen DVD release of this important film, which could at least attempt to approximate the experience of seeing this in a theater.

		<shortDescription>fascinating and brilliant visual statement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to the absence of a conventional plot, the story and message of this film are depicted through imagery, and it is perhaps the most visually engaging film I have ever seen. Reggio presents a thematic triptych of pure nature, 'evolution' and the rise and progress of modern man, and 'de-evolution' and the consequential ironic anti-progress. And he does so through an amazing work of visual poetry and a relentless and hypnotic (yet powerful) score by Philip Glass. There are no transitions or introductions, and the montage of images and music creates a consuming atmosphere through which a poignant concern for the modern world is expressed.My only regret for 'Koyaanisqatsi' is its virtual extinction in the film canon. It is rarely seen in cinemas and difficult to find. Although this makes each opportunity to behold it unique and special, its scarcity is too bad; it is a fantastic work that accomplishes a powerful statement through visual means and relies on the imagination and the senses to fully appreciate the realm that it evokes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, congratulations on finding this movie on the IMDb. I'm a horrible speller, myself, and I couldn't remember any cast names the first time I went looking for it. Someone else ended up finding it for me. I suck, I know.ANYHOW, I first saw this movie in a small, independent - now defunct, unfortunately - theatre a time ago. I'm not even sure if it's available on home video or DVD but I wouldn't recommend going that way unless you are very tiny; even then, make sure it's widescreen. This film is meant as a theatre experience and it is.The film is also a silent documentary. You're not going to find many of these because, frankly, it's a difficult idea to pull off. Koyaanisqatsi, however, succeeds. It's a pretty incredible piece of work. The message behind the documentary is a good one, the photography is beautifully done and the music is "supoib". That being said, it's obviously not a flick for everyone.I'll cite an example from my movie-going experience: the two other people that I saw it with thoroughly enjoyed it but on the way out I overheard a couple coffee house cats relating various forms of torture they'd rather have endured than have sat through the movie. Mostly eye-gouging type stuff, I believe. A couple people walked out during the movie too. The program actually had a warning that stated this was a ***silent documentary*** so I don't know exactly what they were expecting but I enjoyed the reactions nonetheless.It really is worth searching out. You can dig into the message of the movie as deeply as you want, or you can just sit back and appreciate the loveliness of what you're watching, or you can put your movie watching skills to the ultimate test and do both like some kind of renaissance person. Go see this one for the Gipper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, praise praise. This movie is pure breathtaking cinematography, a great film to watch with the volume off and a favorite album playing in the background (Not to knock Phillip Glass). I have seen this one countless times, though rarely sober. The last scene is one of the best ever shot. A missile explodes and the camera zooms in on the fireball moving ever forward finding a piece of shrapnel to focus on. It follows the spinning metal scrap as it falls and slowly stops burning, zooming continually closer and closer to it until you can see every detail. If you are tripping, you will swear the tiny metal scrap, which I believe is the very tip of the rocket, is actually the tin man from the wizard of OZ.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest non-narrative films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How do I begin reviewing a film with no plot, no characters, no dialogue, and no story whatsoever? Koyaanisquatsi doesn't have any of these, yet I consider it one of the most powerful films ever made. It begins by showing us beautiful images of barren landscapes in the American Midwest, landscape virtually untouched by humans. We admire the beauty, the stillness....the balance. Waves glide over rocks, clouds glide over hills, and everything is in harmony.The word Koyaanisquatsi is a word from the Hopi language, meaning "Life out of balance" or "a way of life that demands a new way of living". We witness this life out of balance as the film moves from these beautiful landscapes, to the urban settings of the city. It is here where the film becomes violent and jarring... even frightening. Through the use of extremely sped-up and slowed-down images we see our daily lives from a fourth dimension. A godlike perspective where we see the ugliness in our society, a society that has created machines and technology to make life easier and is now held captive by the technology we created. We are like robots, moving around in our world repeating the same actions day after day. Our food is made and processed by machines, our entertainment is provided by machines, our life revolves around technology and has made us helpless in a way.The feelings I had while watching these images are almost indescribable... sometimes it was disgust towards mankind, sometimes it was laughing on how much like insignificant insects we really are, sometimes it was grief for the images towards the end of the film when people are shown who cannot take the madness that this society is steeped in, we see a woman in the hospital who is recovering from attempting suicide, or another man who is being rounded up by the police during a nervous breakdown. But overall the general feeling was shock... even disbelief. After seeing our society in a new perspective it is impossible to think of mankind in the same way again. The final shot is almost like a warning to man, urging us to change our ways before it's too late.I should also note the music that accompanies the film. It is an amazing score by Phillip Glass (who scored Martin Scorsese's Kundun last year). The images and music go hand in hand to make the film rich with emotion and feeling. A truly enchanting (and sometimes haunting) score that is expertly matched with the editing as well. It is almost like watching an opera.It is almost guaranteed that this film will have you thinking, days, weeks, even months after watching it. The images are so common in our life that it is like a constant reminder. This film is truly remarkable and is a movie-going experience guaranteed to be unlike anything you have ever seen before. I can not recommend it enough, it will leave you with an amazing new outlook on mankind and what direction we're heading in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is hard to describe in words. It's quiet and soothing, yet sometimes extremely brainstorming; but always fascinating. The splendid images, in turns overflying the earth from above or digging in the frenzy of human life, are perfectly interlaced with Phillip Glass' hypnotizing soundtrack. The whole movie comes up as a no-destination flight over mind (us humans) and matter (the world we live in). A trip to engage in. Just let yourself go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmerizing synchronicity of music and visuals on Time and thereby it's counterpart: Eternity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pleasant and haunting at the same time, the powerful combination of music synchronized with visuals and the chant at the beginning makes the film an experience that could well induce a trance in sensitive, intuitive people that can lead to a realization that Time is not linear in an absolute sense, and that the 'experience' of Time is multi dimensional ? even leading to an experience of timelessness or Eternity.The film has universal symbolism about the contrast between raw, primordial nature that symbolizes the beginning of time for all practical purposes (creation), and technology ?that seemingly speeds up time as it approaches the end point of all technology ? which is destruction. I am surprised that no one mentions that it symbolizes Time Fractals (concept developed by Terence Kenna- the process of the ever increasing rate of change of events in temporal reality culminating in the Eschaton ) and thereby gives us an inkling of the counter-concept of Time/Temporal Reality - and that is: Eternity ( in which both the concepts of change and static fail to apply).Incidentally, Mckenna developed the Time Fractals concept and the theory from the study of 'I Ching', but also co-related it with the Native American/ Meso-American concept of Circular Time in the process of the cycles of Creation-Destruction.Eternity is not an infinitely long period of linear time, and therefore eternity cannot be conceived by reason, only fleetingly felt or glimpsed in intuitive, synthesis experience. Linear time is conceived by rational thought working on memory, that then extrapolates its generalizations to extend this conceived linearity which is appropriately limited only to one's lifetime and therefore it is a misconception to generalize it beyond the memory, beyond the personal experiences and the History of mankind.This does not mean that linear time is a total misconception. It is only in linear time (can also be called objective time) that the synchronization of all the living, sentient beings of a world and (by extension) of the universe can possibly take place. The point here is that to make a 'leap of logic' to extend the validity of linear time indefinitely to the past and the future is fallacious and misleading. Even logically it is inconceivable that time extends infinitely backwards into the past ? it brings up absurdities and paradoxes that cannot be cannot be resolved if we stick to a fixed conception of linear time that can be extended indefinitely into the past or future.One way of resolving this absurdity and paradox is to conceive of time as the rate of change of events taking place in the physical world, rather than stubbornly stick only to the notion of 'objective time as recorded by a clock' (a notion that has been 'hard programmed' into us by the standard science based educational system). Secondly, when we are in a synthesis, intuitive or imaginative mode of experience, these fixed notions of linear time are necessarily suspended for this mode of experience to be of any significance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. I remember how awestruck I was the first time I saw it. Godfrey Reggio and Ron Fricke created a new way to tell a complex story. Rather than a complicated plot and a lot of dialogue, they returned to the roots of cinema: the careful compositions of the silent era. The movie is basically a thesis, structured to set up their argument and point by point prove its validity. The opening fires of hell give way to the fires of a rocket launch. Humans, through their own technology, have created the seeds of their own destruction. Then nature is shown as it exists without human intervention. There are scenes of thick clouds rolling over mountains, juxtaposed with ocean waves. They show how nature is serene and consistent. And then there are scenes of man's attempts to change nature. High tension wire supports look like stiff human sentinels scarring the landscape.With breathtaking cinematography and clever time lapse sequences, we gradually see what a toll this human intervention has taken on humans themselves. The ending is a revelation (both literally and figuratively) and we are left with the Hopi Indian prophecies that frame the filmmakers' thesis.Besides the groundbreaking visual work, the other aspect of this film that works very well is the soundtrack by Philip Glass. His minimalist style was the perfect match for the story and enhances the emotional impact of the images. During the climactic sequence The Grid, the music and images create such sensory overload that I've seen many people turn away from the screen.I've seen in twice in theaters, once with Glass and a small band playing the music live. Those were incredible experiences. But I'm glad the movie has been given a decent DVD version so that I can enjoy it again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the great things about studying for a B.A. is the fact that half of what you are taught is shown through film. Everynow and then, you come across a name like Godfrey Reggio, and you are shown a film like Koyaanisqatsi. I've never seen anything like it.So how do you describe a film like Koyaanisqatsi which has no genre, narrative, characters, or dialogue, just pure aesthetic sound and vision. It can be summarized in one simple word....Art. To be more specific, it feels like a modern, live-action version of fantasia. It makes perfect use of all the elements of design and tops it with a phenomenal score by Phillip Glass, possibly the greatest electronic music in contemporary film.The word 'Koyaanisqatisi' itself means 'life in chaos'. One of the many things that the film tries to describe is the relationship between chaos and order in the human world. If you go watch Koyaanisqatsi, here are a few of the photographic wonders you will see: geological phenomenons, that make you feel like you are on another planet, machines and vehicles which move like living monsters of steel, highways which look like circuits on a computer chip, and millions of ordinary people like you and I bustling like insects. It is absolutely bizarre, but it truly does show you what a crazy world we live in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Genre: See summary. No plot, characters or story.My thoughts: So beautiful, so amazing and breathtaking. It has reminded many of us at how we are damaging the world and how we are making the population grow larger and spread. This film shows us beautifully untouched places in America (such as Monument Valley) and just clouds and a wide vast river and the like. Then, we have factories, cars, people and Koyaaniskatsi (meaning life out of balance, an unpredictable life)! I hope to you all (and to me) this has been an inspiration to be kinder to our environment. Perhaps we will be more sensible about this mess, lower everything down (without having to decrease the population). For those who haven't watched it yet, I have to warn you that if you do, you may be upset by all the devastating events and it may be a bore to you because there is no plot, as it is not like most films. You may feel entranced, like me. You may think of this film as a beastly way to spend 90 minutes, or what feels like a lifetime of beautiful and thought-provoking scenes that inspire you to make sure that the environment does not disappear altogether.Recommended to: People who think the world should be a better place, people who like documentaries or people who just wish to be enthralled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vanessa Ramos Neris JimenezKOYAANISQATSI World unbalanceThis film made us feel scared, the music by Phillip Glass played in the film made us feel scared and we didn't know what to expect, what was happening, but further on in the film the music changed to something somewhat relaxing. At this point, our feelings towards the film changed. This made us see that we have many things in this world that we don't take care of or appreciate, the different ways people live, different cultures, different behaviors that we don't see in everyday living. At one point in the film it seemed like people were out of control. The film showed moments of chaos and moments of peace, but it made us see things that we don't see everyday and things we do not know that are happening, but that may happen in the future.The film showed us how the world has been unbalanced for years. An example is how people back in the days in the 70's and 80's behaved and lived. It is not much different from how we live now. The whole film had no dialogue so we didn't understand what was going on. We were thinking we weren't able to understand and put into sense what the film was saying. The pictures the director Godfrey Reggio showed was enough to give us clues and help us figure out what the film was saying.</fullReview>

Godfrey Reggio's imagery and video collages orchestrate a mood of it's own - whatever you perceive it to be. Koyannisqatsi is artistic brilliance down to the smallest shot, also the tempo changes in the film and music give the film its own personality as a whole. The soundtrack from Phillip Glass is wonderful and deserves great recognition. I was listening to it for months after.

How they take you from the beautiful west (Monument Valley, Bryce Canyon Park, the Snake River in southern Utah) to the hustle &amp; bustle of man's doings in going to space, building, mining, and the chaotic to &amp; fro in the cities. And the use of speeded-up motion of the cars, people, and the music fit it perfectly. Then the slow-motion of moving people and the way the clouds &amp; water were sped up through time-lapse photography. Some of the scenes made you feel like you were in a plane right there, particularly when going over the many-colored fields and Monument Valley. A definite classic along with such as 1950's The Day the Earth Stood Still!!</fullReview>

Not only is the composition of every shot studding, but the details into patters of nature and human's chaotic lives, that Reggio allows the viewer to see, can be both beautiful and haunting. Along with music by Philip Glass, the simplicity of the films features is another strong aspect of the overall feeling.

Fifteen years in the making with special optics and magazines for the photography, Koyaanisqatsi is an absolute must see for any aspiring cinematography/ photography student or film lover with a passion for imagery. Koyaanisqatsi remains arguably the best of the trilogy (which took some thirty years to complete) for its metaphorical and philosophical content. The editing and construction of the film is remarkable and simply must be seen to be understood. The only caveat would be that this film requires active viewing. To observe it passively will almost certainly guarentee a mid- film slumber. It is not by any strech an "action" film. For those who enjoy the first five minutes, it will be riveting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to believe this movie is already over 20 years old. I remember seeing it on the big screen when it was first released. It was an unexpected experience to say the least. At the time, this movie left a strong impression on me, not simply a particular image or sequence, but rather the duality of the images and music. That duality is inherent throughout this movie; an observation made only on repeated viewing.There is the obvious nature vs technology duality. In parallel, this duality can be expressed as god-made vs man-made. There are the old world vs the new world, Hopi cave drawings vs high-tech cinematography and music (the movie we are watching), communication by drawing with coal and television commercials, ocean waves swelling and receding, cities rising and falling, deserts eroding, factories assembling cars and packaging massive amounts of food, insurpassable terrain, and numerous roads, cars, and airplanes, the slow tide of nature and the fastlane all taken for granted. And in the midst of these dual forces is man, a product of the natural world creating the technological world. It is rather like the yin and yang, yang the primary color at present. Technology has usurped first place in defining the world around us and nature is merely a prelude. We are defined by technological achievement rather than by our human nature. We are gradually defined by our creation, perhaps as god is defined by us. Yet echoes of nature pulse within the concrete fortresses of our technolgy. The roads are like arteries pumping red and white cells to and fro, the factories generate food to help us survive, we record our deeds on film for posterity (the very movie we are watching is a testament of sorts),and we aspire to break free of gravity's tethers reaching for whatever lies ahead.The director claims that this movie is meant to be a journey without making any value judgment. I believe we should take him at his word. Man is depicted becoming ruled by his own creation and neglecting, even destroying, his creator. It is never confirmed that this is a bad thing, but the implication is that balance between the natural and technological worlds is inevitable. Even the old world is fading, eroding away like the deserts, monument valley a cemetery of the ancient world. A day of judgment so to speak is in the making and technology will be forced to reckon with nature one way or another. People, despite their technological prowess will buckle under nature's creative supremacy and the inescapable cycle of creation and destruction. The Hopi's understood this cycle and predict an end to koyaanisqatsi. Of course, the Hopi are victims to the cycle themselves.Overall I like this movie. But, I think that Godfrey Reggio failed to create a balanced artistic statement. He says the movie is not an indictment of technology and I can see that he made an earnest effort to make a balanced statement. Nevertheless, the gut reaction when viewing this movie is "what, in god's name, have we done?" There is an element of misanthrope in this movie that is unmistakeable and largely responsible for the "environmentalist" interpretation of the movie so popular among many viewers. Mr. Reggio, in my opinion, didn't quite pull off what he intended. If he had, he wouldn't need to explain his meaning or his method in interviews and essays. You never heard Stanley Kubrick explaining 2001: A Space Odyssey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much has been commented about this movie without a plotline. I simply see it as a fine example of what art (cinema) is all about: the real meaning lies within the eyes of the beholder.I personally think that Koyaanisqatsi is as close to perfect as it gets.First there is the perfect marriage between photography and music. Just listen to the wonderful choir singing as the Boeing 747's emerge through the whiring summer heat captured by immaculate photography. Or check the wonderful synthesizer sounds to describe the skyscrapers with the clouds passing by filmed in time lapse photography. There you have it all: the human achievement and its fragility.Then there is the perfect balance of construction and destruction, nature and artificial environment.My idea of Koyaanisqatsi isn't "we humans are doing wrong", it is simply a wonderful cinematographic document of North America during the 1976-1983 period in all its beauty and ugliness.BTW: I am not sure which aspect ratio is correct. Judging by the grain and color contrast I am positive that some 16mm footage has been used which would of course be 1:1,33 (= 3:4). Maybe this footage has been reduced in height to fit into a wider aspect ratio. I have a copy of this movie in vhs in 1:1,33 and it looks fine to me. I'd appreciate any information regarding the correct aspect ratio of the theatrical 35mm prints.I saw Koyaanisqatsi twice in the cinema when it came out and probably a hundred times on vhs which I recorded from an airing on German tv in early 2000.Koyaanisqatsi: Cinema at its finest.</fullReview>

Initially Godfrey Reggio wanted no title for this film, because its message went beyond that of the english language. Ko.yaa.nis.katsi from the Hopi language, meaning crazy life, or life in turmoil. A life out of balance. To the impatient and plot expecting person, this movie is not for you. The film takes you on a journey through images of nature slowly consumed by technology. A remarkable score composed by the world renowned Philip Glass. This film was recently released on DVD, and contains an interview with Reggio which I feel should be viewed prior to watching the film.

		<fullReview>More of an experiment in visual poetry than an actual film, Koyaanisqatsi pairs dialog-free speeded-up images of people doing mundane stuff like moving through NYC's Grand Central Terminal with an overbearing lyric-free soundtrack. The Chipmunks-with-violins soundtrack and film-projector-stuck-on-wrong-speed visuals become bearable when the camera is focused on nature scenes (I'm assuming some of this was the Grand Canyon because these awe-of-nature visuals also include shots of the Grand Canyon). The unfair contrast of majestic helicopter-shots of natures with the artificially-frenetic ground-level shots of civilization, I believe were meant to suggest that nature rocks and civilization sucks. Of course, then there are the long, lingering, largely static shots of Untied Airways jets mirrored in heat-shimmer on the runway -- no idea if these were part of the pro-nature message or United product-placement or some other sub-text of the film. Personally, I'm squarely on the side of civilization in this debate; remember, bee stings, snake bites, malaria and dying of thirst are all natural. See anything by Hayao Miyazaki for a better take on environmentalism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with its sequels (Powaqqatsi and Naqoyqatsi) Koyaanisqatsi demands a little something from the viewer. Whatever weaknesses the film may have may be attributable to this aspect of its nature. What this film demands is an openness? a willingness to embrace something new (at the time of its release); something different.Occasionally subtitled "Life Out of Balance", Koyaanisqatsi is a cinematic montage of images set to a score by Philip Glass. There is no cast; no script; no dialog. Unfamiliar as I am with film history, I can only tentatively offer that this film may have pioneered (if not created) a new genre of film; a cinematic analog to the literary designation of "creative nonfiction". Aside from its own sequels, I am aware of only two other films in this genre (one of which was also directed by this film's director, Godfrey Reggio).As to whether or not this film is "good"? If forced to answer "yes" or "no", I would have to say "yes" (and pretty confidently). Given the opportunity for a more nuanced discussion, however, I would wax philosophical on the premise that we all seek different things in theater; that some prefer movies which are "deep" while others prefer only to be entertained. That even those who prefer depth (solely or as part of widely inclusive tastes) may, nonetheless, have problems with this film and its siblings. There are no guarantees, and, regardless of your bent, you may not be open to taking risks with your ticket price. If, however, you like depth, are open to a different form of cinematic communication, and are willing to risk a few bucks, then I wholeheartedly recommend Koyaanisqatsi (and the sequels).Having disclaimed myself nearly out of the game, I will now defend and (to the extent possible/necessary) explain what I know of this film.There is always a question about what makes for good art (and yes, I consider these films to be Art). Some seek stimulation of one sort or another; some merely insist that it be "beautiful"; others that it provide an intellectual challenge. There are many other schools of thought, including one which holds that, if you need to study and/or explain a film, then it's not worth the effort. For me, all three films (to varying degrees; I have my own preferences), are resounding successes, in that they not only include the aforementioned virtues, but do so in such a way as to transcend a mere summing of the parts. Again, this is my reaction we're talking about, and, while I feel strongly, I allow that others may hold contrasting views.If the film's format is not immediately familiar, there is nothing so jarringly foreign as to effect prolonged disorientation in the average viewer's mind. Once you "get into it", you really ought to be able to appreciate the beauty inherent in this film. If you process the media with which you are flooded (by whatever holistic means you may have at your disposal) you will find yourself mesmerized and soothed, while, at the same time, being challenged and possibly rent from your comfortable (if precarious) preconceptions about (what else?) "the meaning of life".Some of these images will gently haunt you for years. If the themes seem well-worn or even hackneyed, consider that this was not so much the case in 1983, and that subsequent treatments of this material may owe quite a bit to this work. It is unfortunate that the current arbiters of such weighty considerations seem to be, largely, radio talk show hosts, as they rarely present earnestly held beliefs, and even more rarely do so with anything remotely approximating a sublime or transcendent sensitivity.Some would suggest that Philip Glass' brand of minimalism can be "cold" or "sterile", which is lamentable, in my opinion, as it excludes so many possible manifestations of what constitutes acceptable beauty. Furthermore, his score is wholly appropriate to the film, in that it simultaneously provides a contrast for the lush images, while supporting and augmenting their already formidable intrinsic power.If I am to give in to cynicism, I might suggest that the film may be too serious for the modern viewer raised on the easily categorized, formulaic product of Hollywood and other movie-as-big-business epicenters. That is casts a critical and, perhaps, disapproving eye on aspects of Western Civilization, may also be a bit of a "turn-off" for some. Nonetheless, if you care about such things as the "nature of existence" or your "place in the world", then you owe it to yourself to feast on these sounds and images. Besides having pioneered a genre, this is an important film which provides a perspective not adequately serviced by straight documentaries or cryptic allegories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seem to be somewhat out of the norm here, but gotta say this was long, boring, and a little pretentious. A few nice images, not nearly enough intelligent stuff to fill the time. What can one say? Humans affect the environment. Choose some nice images of unspoiled environment. Intersperse some ugly images of human wastelands. Cut with some scenes of interesting people and urban scenes that provoke mixed responses. Color and composition competent but not special. Mix with droning Philip Glass music for Native American voice. That's all it is: no plot, no commentary, just images and chant.Not so bad that I did not watch it to the end. But at the end, not particularily memorable or influential. Few persistent images. Nothing that could not be done in half the time. Maybe I made the mistake of not chilling out and just drifting with it, or something. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are much better films out there that function as meditations on the flow of time and people and things. Some have plots, some mere hints of plots, and others none at all. The experience of viewing these films is akin to looking at a painting or contemplating the subtle changes in nature.Unfortunately, Koyaanisqatsi just does not quite make it. In places where it should allow the natural (and accidental) beauty of a subject to come through, it instead uses pointed repetition to preach a one-dimensional message. If it encounters an interesting subject it lingers on far too long. Please note that I have a lot of patience with meditative art, being a longtime fan of Wim Wenders, the composer Morton Feldman, and the painter Robert Ryman. I can handle art that explores deeper and deeper, examining the hidden and bringing to light details that no one ever has seen, often including the artist (see John Cage's works on the process of art as a process of exploration for both audience and author). But Koyaanisqatsi finds a scene of moderate interest and hammers on it until there is nothing left to see in it, and KEEPS ON GOING. So much for subtle variation.Overall, Koyaanisqatsi comes across as a spoof of minimalist excess. It's like the minimalist painting that REALLY IS just a white canvas. This mind-numbing effect is reinforced by the relentless music of neo-banalist Phil Glass. Meaningless harmonic structures, crudely stitched together, repeating over and over, proclaiming the composer's incompetence at every pseudo-cadence.This is maybe a good movie for pot-head hippies or maybe for teenagers trying to find some meaning in the many superficial contradictions in the world. Perhaps it can be a way to wean American youth away from too much Chuck Norris. But maybe it really isn't any better for them than Chuck Norris.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Godfrey Reggio started his career working with troubled youths in New Mexico. But he became famous with "Koyaanisqatsi", a documentary about humanity's disconnect from nature. It's not an easy movie to describe. There's no dialog, just images set to music. The first half shows various scenes of the natural world: landscapes, oceans, clouds, etc. Then comes the human world: people walk in every direction, drive in every direction, and consume like there's no tomorrow. Much of the action is sped up to stress this point. As Reggio put it, "We don't use technology; we LIVE it." Without a doubt, this documentary -- whose title means "life out of balance" in Hopi -- is one of the most mind-blowing and thought-provoking movies of all time. I can't really do justice to it by trying to explain it. You have to see it on your own. I'll now have to see Reggio's sequels "Powaqqatsi" and "Naqoyqatsi".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"the film is visually excellent in showing how stunning the world we live in is"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We looked at non verbal language through a music video (even though I don't like Chemical Brothers), an advert, an interactive flash animation and ended up with a movie. The movie was called:KOYAANISQATSI and was by Godfrey Reggio in 1984Our lecturer described it as being the most influential movie he's ever seen. It certainly wasn't like anything i'd seen before. Wikipedia defines it as a visual tone poem, which contains no dialogue or narration. I would call it a documentary. This isn't a surprise as I am a documentary photographer. Both the slow motion and time-lapse techniques felt familiar to me (although are not areas of expertise) and simply recorded where had been filmed and what the world can look at from each viewpoint. It was beautiful. It left me uplifted. A result that I don't think the director would have intended. With the name Koyaaniswatsi translated as"crazy life, life in turmoil, life out of balance, life disintegrating, a state of life that calls for another way of living"I am pretty sure he intended it to be a message of how man is destroying the planet we live on and how ugly and depressing the things that man does are. One major hurdle in the way of the director succeeding in this was the music. To me it made the film funny. It was amusing. Also the poor visual effects and almost ritual chanting of Koyaaniswatsi added to this sense of ridicule. Perhaps this is just a result of being 26 years old and I would certainly like to watch the other parts of the trilogy, especially the most recent one. Something that showed me that it was a worth while experience to see such a film was that it didn't seem like a full 1 hour 27 minutes long. It went quickly! I found myself tapping my feet to the quirky music and broadly smiling at the increasingly less than subtle look at mankind. It really was this lack of subtlety that made it difficult to take seriously. What is sure is that the film is visually excellent in showing how stunning the world we live in is. Quite perplexing, however, was that I found myself thinking the same about this "chaos" Reggio was trying to show. Man's influence on this world actually looked stunning too. Due to the lack of seriousness I gained it allowed the perspective to forget the destruction and think of man as animals. The things we do are like a bird building a nest. Like ants bombarding an area. These are things we, as humans, see as fascinating and beautiful. Not so, when we look at ourselves, as we are unable to see these activities any other way than "man made" and separated from nature. I suppose this results from our sense of greater intelligence and the things we do being so advanced. Probably true when you think about how we could create human beings, no not by reproduction, but by cloning. Whether you argue for against such an action it's difficult to stand back and see that what we would be doing would be nature, regardless of how we define ourselves as man, because we would be doing it. That was what this movie reminded me about and, although not what it was intended to do, means it is certainly better than many other movies we regard as good. The most influential movie I've ever watched? I wouldn't think so, but then I can't tell you what is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember the first time I saw this movie in 9th grade. My hippy English teacher showed this to the class and, as would be expected of students that age, most everyone had their head down after 15 minutes. I'll tell you this much, the movie is not going to start out punching you in the gut with exploding buildings (though the film hasn't forgotten that). It works like this: Way way way out in sprawling, pristine nature shots and moving inward towards human civilization with increasing pace throughout the film. At about 50 minutes into the film get ready to have your socks officially rocked off as Philip Glass' signature 'One-note symphony' music synchronizes with the time lapse shots of the living city at night. It truly becomes explosive at times with repeating chorus sitting on top of industry hard at work. The director does make a serious attempt at a profound message about the state of the world and the problems that surround us (the now familiar concept of cities looking like circuit boards)... but you can take that or leave that. If you like time lapse, watch this movie. Godfrey Reggio has the credit for directing this film but it's Ron Fricke's cinematography that sets this film apart from the other two -qatsi films that were to follow. Check out Ron's departure film Baraka if you liked what you found in Koyaanisqatsi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think I was going to like it. I don't generally like "cinematic"movies that consist mostly of mysterious images "Last Year atMarienbad" left me cold. I liked "2001," but not nearly as well as thecurrent IMAX "Space Station 3D," and so forth. And the fact that thismovie is relatively obscure and seems to have a cult followingmade me think it was only for film students, or people onpsychedelic drugs, or something.No so.The visual beauty of this film is overwhelming, and although manyof the shots are beautifully composed and would make nice stills,it is very much a _cinematic_ beauty. It also succeeds in engaging the left brain. Somehow the moviesmakes you ask questions. To be honest, in my case the questionsare mostly on a superficial level: "where DID he take that? WhereIS that landscape? Did those KNOW they were being photographed by what was obviously a very, very long lens? WhatIS that object?" Nevertheless it engaged you. And the pacing isvery good. The images are so rich and full of things to be seen that I constantly had the urge when each scene was over to press the"review" button to see whether I had really scene some detail.Much of the movie was photographed in either time-lapse,slow-motion, or with a very long lens. None of it looks gimmicky.About a third of the film consists mostly of scenes of naturalgrandeur: clouds, rock formations, landscapes, frequently intimelapse with shifting light. About a third is what might be termedcityscape and "animated people." Filmed mostly in New York, Ithink. A good deal in timelapse, giving the impression of the city asa sort of pulsing superorganism. But there is human scale here, too; there are many photographs ofindividual pedestrians, individual portraits, some downtown, somein slum areas, and these are the most difficult to describe of all.Heresy: the Philip Glass score is good, but I know that the biggestobstacle I am going to have to repeated viewings of this film is thescore. I believe that I want to watch it many times. Listening to it,though... well, once is enough... or at least want a year or two inbetween.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Koyaanisqatsi's connection to Hitchcock's North by northwest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I've got to say I loved this film. Its uniqueness impressed me through and through. The shared insight on the everyday invisibilities was mastered with great patience and style. Koyaanisqatsi is a ruthless and beautiful mirror for postmodern industrialized culture. It paints the infrastructural context of western everyday living in an enlightened and quite dispassionate manner. Koyaanisqatsi is an eye opener. It provokes people to see themselves as a part of a constructed whole constantly on a move, like ants in their nest, and puts forward a question whether this is the way people want to live?Part of Reggios genius is to give 'lifeless' things a face. Reggio faces the viewer with a machine or a system in which we operate in our daily lives. Part of his mastery is to use objectivity through altered time concept. This enables him to shows us the night traffic as a stream of energy flowing like digits in a computer. He dares to imply similarities on tube stairs and the sausage manufacturing line in a factory. His cameras find the awkwardest locations to put the build environment into a starring role. Later on I found an interesting connection, which diminishes the original value of Reggios's and Glasses work. I saw Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest again. The stylized framing of infrastructure and even the music score was directly ripped from Hitchcock's movie....or visa versa... Who's to say which one was first in the realm and time of ideas :)</fullReview>

The photography is great and the music doesn't sound dated even though this movie is over 20 years old. Still, I had seen Baraka first and thought it was a much better film than this one.

Rather, it makes these movements look more orderly, not chaotic. (I'm not saying how well or badly humans have done in general; I'm just commenting on this movie.) For example, time-lapse scenes of people walking through a station and of traffic in the city reminded me of films of blood cells moving through capillaries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie and it met my expectations, which were pretty high. I love Philip Glass as much as the next person, and didn't find the score dated. I do have to say though that it seems Reggio watched Werner Herzog's "Heart of Glass" (and to a smaller extent, "Where the Green Ants Dream") and said "I'd like to make a movie like that, just leaving out the dialogue parts". And so he did. The shots of clouds stop motion-seeming to flow like a river are directly lifted from the opening scenes of Heart of Glass. Also, choosing an extremely hypnotic minimalist composer in Philip Glass could be seen as similiar to Herzog's chose of Popul Vu. Of course, "Heart of Glass" came out 15 years earlier and new technology (and budget) have probably allowed Reggio to smooth out the images and make them more techically seamless (Herzog's camera shakes a bit when it zooms over a rocky island in the middle of the ocean, Reggio's is perfectly fluent), but overall they probably achieve the same level of mysticism. One thing though, Koyaanisquatsi is a bit topheavy, placing most of its best images in the first 30 minutes. I know this has to do with the slow destruction of civilization and the opening is meant to be more awesome while the other images of buildings, pollution and dated haircuts are meant to be more dismal, but it does negate the experience a small bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie for upper class white people who have decided they are on the same spiritual level as the Hopi Indians; people who sadly shake their heads when they see images of horizon-choking power lines but aren't ready to give up their electricity just yet. In the DVD interview, Reggio says his film can be interpreted multiple ways, including as an "ode to technology," but I don't believe him: the title, the chant, the definitions provided at the end, and the way the images are strung together make it quite clear that we're expected to view these scenes of human architecture and technology in a negative light. As a human, I'm insulted. I don't appreciate being told how chaotic, unfocused and meaningless my existence is through countless sped-up scenes of crowds and traffic. Just because our movements look strange or comical when seen from a God's-eye view is not a compelling enough reason, in my book, to condemn those movements as "out of balance" (whatever that means). It's the same mistake that most environmentally-obsessed persons make: forgetting that humans and their activities are themselves a PART of the natural world, not a cancerous growth upon it. To be fair, the scenery on display is captivating and relaxing. Maybe it's just the fact that I've lived closer to nature than most people (including probably Godrey Reggio) that makes me especially irked at the idea of someone expressing their oh-so-serious love of nature by watching some silly trance movie. As a matter of fact, I love nature. I also like electricity and running water, and no condescending director can guilt-trip me about that with polished, greeting card imagery and tedious music. The relationship of man to his environment is a complex subject that deserves a more intelligent treatment than this (such as Akira Kurosawa's wonderful "Derzu Uzala," for one example). 3/10.</fullReview>

If humans were to suddenly disappear and there was one piece of film that would sum up humanity, this would be it. Hauntingly remarkable if not slightly poignant insight into humanity and what we are, where we are going, where we came from. A timeless classic. This movie has no need for acting or talk or narration, just the music and images that some up a history of earth and what humans have done with this earth. Just breathtakingly beautiful, sends shivers up your spine watching it. This is a movie for the open minded person. Some people just don't get it, and for that I am truly sorry. This movie will open your mind, open your soul, and hopefully even change the way you look at life and the world. It will change your perception, and it did for me. Really words cannot describe this film, it just has to be experienced. If you are looking for an action flick or mindless entertainment, do not watch, watch this when you want to think. Earth processes are slow moving and are only noticeable after millions of years. Humans have only been here for a very short amount of time and look at what we have done.

Sorry guys, but this Philip Glass score is, to my ears, simply very poor, almost sloppy. And it never goes along with the visual narrative, it just plays like if it had nothing to do with the images shown, which I found very annoying. I think the guy had it 100% right in "Candyman", though. Not so here.Koyaanaqatsi is indeed a very interesting experience, and has of course gorgeous cinematography and stunning images (and an incredible name that I have to copy'n paste, LOL), but if you want the "real stuff", go for Fricke's more mature and deeply moving masterpiece, "Baraka".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a prime example of the importance, relevance and power of movies. Godfrey Reggio (director) and Philip Glass (music) collaborated in the first of three movies, which shows the perfect amalgamation of moving images and music (or sound). This movie is hard to describe, since there is no plot, no actors and no dialogue. The best thing to do when watching this movie... is just that. Watch the movie, listen to it and let it take you for a ride. The ride is well worth it. The images range from various nature scenes, time elapsed panoramic shots, modern living (buildings, cars, planes, trains, technology, cities, etc) and people. During this entire visual ride the music corresponds or complements the visuals incredibly well. The best thing, and the only instruction that is given to us, comes at the end of the movie in the form of a definition of the title. For the duration of the movie, we are sponges soaking up all that we see and hear. The ending is where we try to put all that we've seen and heard together, in the context of the definition. Whatever that maybe, it varies. I have seen this movie multiple times and each time I come away with something new.</fullReview>

When associated with humans in video, the music had the sort of manic activity one might associate with the Keystone Cops, but with oppressive overtones.

		<shortDescription>Exceedingly dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All who are considering checking out Koyaanisqatsi, be forewarned. The cigar-smoking friend who recommended it to you is full of it. People who laud this "film" as some kind of grand artistic accomplishment are not being honest with themselves. They are probably confusing intellectual awe of the project with actual enjoyment of the work. Indeed, that sort of confusion is depressingly prevalent in the "art world," and a source of endless satire and editorializing by people like me. Read on.Cinematography alone doesn't make an interesting film; it is one component of many that filmmakers can draw upon to create a meaningful and pleasing work. With absolutely no plot or screenplay, Koyaanisqatsi is not a "film." It is a seemingly arbitrary collection of admittedly masterful shots (if you can sit through them) by Ron Fricke, most of which are time lapsed or in slow motion, strung together with an exaggerated "artistic" flair. All of this is set to a static and uninspiring soundtrack by Phillip Glass, who seems content only to create music that is repetitive, void of dynamic contrast, aggravatingly "minimalist" in the worst ways, and informed by trite symphonic conventions. In a sense, Glass's work complements the film perfectly; neither the film nor the soundtrack go anywhere.To those who disagree, I ask: when you're settling down after dinner, and no one's around to impress, which would you rather watch, Koyaanisqatsi, or practically anything else? If cinematography is your thing, why not watch documentaries? A good documentary also has beautiful shots, but with actual substance as well. You can call Koyaanisqatsi "creative" all day, but are there actually people who would rather watch this tedious art school riff-raff than a quality nature or industry documentary? I'm not denying that through Koyaanisqatsi, Godrey Reggio attempts to make some kind of meaningful statement, obscure and direction-less as the results are. I'm not speaking to Reggio's ill-conceived intentions. I -am- attesting that ultimately, not only did Koyaanisqatsi provide me the most boring 87 minutes I've ever experienced, but it managed to communicate almost nothing to me except a not-so-subtle undercurrent of unapologetic pretentiousness, even more apparent in Reggio's inflated retrospective interviews that come with the 2002 DVD re-release (he insists that he "originally didn't want a name for the movie, but an image," because "why have a word for something unnameable?").The failings of Koyaanisqatsi bring to mind a certain album put together by composer Steve Reich. After an involved study of African drum rhythms, Reich sought to record an album exploring the hidden rhythms that can emerge from juxtaposing ever-shifting rhythmic patterns. What resulted was an album of only drums and endlessly repeating tuned percussion. That's right, the same marimba patterns and a bunch of drums with nearly the same timbres beating to the same monotonous beat. At the same monotonous tempo. For a whole hour. This "album," which fails to stimulate on the level of Muzak, is called Drumming. Like Koyanisqatsi, it is a casualty of the worst excesses of "minimalism." And much like Koyaanisqatsi and its singular championing of cinematography, Drumming is an attempt to elevate one isolated element of the medium (here rhythm) to the exclusion of all others. I'm always alarmed by the sheer volume of people who even consider the term "creative" to describe such a sobering lack of ambition. Don't believe me? Read the Amazon reviews for Drumming and be astonished at the ridiculous praise heaped upon it. One reviewer deems it a "masterpiece of contemporary music" and exalts in how "fascinating" this background music is. Another claims it would have been more rewarding were it LONGER.If, when I'm sitting through an album or film, I feel that I'd much rather be watching TV (and I hardly ever watch TV), is it too much to not rate the work SEVEN POINT NINE STARS? Alas, some people clad in beatnik hats prefer not to think about that. Such is the way with Koyaanisqatsi and its potheaded, would-be cult following. If you're the type to spend all your free time in coffeehouses whining about the establishment, then by all means grab copies for yourself and each of your friends. Otherwise, steer clear of this nonsense film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This waste of film has to be the biggest insult to the name of cinema. What was the director thinking? Stringing together cheap stock videos (that's the impression it gave me, anyway...) combined with dull, skull-scratchingly horrible sound (I'm not calling this music)? It's not even so-bad-it's-fun. Just plain boring.Why do people even think about giving this a +10 vote? Oooohh look! A series of unrelated images supposedly telling us how bad technology/mankind is killing the world! Big whoop. If you ever managed to feel any emotion during this movie, tap your skull. you may have dropped something on the road. No seriously, if you want deep social commentaries about the environment, dig gems such as Mononoke-Hime, the Plague Dogs and whatnot. Showing me cityscapes in fast motion doesn't move me. And neither does some baritone dude dreadfully chanting the title in the background.Just because this film doesn't follow conventional storytelling methods, doesn't mean it should be praised as an "original work of art". No. It's a dull, boring piece of trash, and a waste of 86 minutes of my life. Art blows. I'd rather watch a cheap action flick starring Hulk Hogan, probably expressing deeper messages than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, from the Hopi word meaning "life out of balance," opens with spectacular images of the natural world, accompanied by a spellbinding Phillip Glass soundtrack, before taking us to images of our polluted and out-of-balance existence. It is mean to shock us into the reality that we are despoiling nature.How dare we disrupt this pristine picture with out huge trucks, miles of electrical cable, dams, highways, and, ultimately, our weapons of mass destruction? Don't we realize that nature, in it's natural state, is perfection? But, it is those pesky humans that spoil the perfect vision. We inhabit the world. That doesn't men destroying it, but there are things that are necessary like highways and electrical transmission lines. It may not be perfect, and we may need to do a better job of protecting the environment, but it still would be nothing of concern if we were not here to enjoy it. You know, if a tree falls in the forest, and there is no one to hear it, does it make a sound? So, put some hash in your peace pipe and enjoy the film for it is a beautiful thing. But, we humans, are beautiful things also.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember I used to like Philip Glass, until I noticed that you could listen to his music for hours on end, without the mind being engaged at all, making it a superior sort of muzak. This film is more of the same. If you are not already aware that people sometimes look funny when shown speeded up, then you may learn something from this film, though I think this was already a cliche in the days of the Keystone Kops. The photography is good, but in the style of minimalism, it cuts away as soon as there is any danger of the film getting interesting. I left the cinema with a new appreciation for the sights of the real world around me, like someone emerging after a long prison sentence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every commment you read here is made by people with extremely poor taste. This "movie" is nothing more than two hours of dreadful cinematography and way-beyond-dreadful music. It's nearly impossible to sit through unless you are handicapped and can't get to your wheelchair. Some people say their least favorite movie is "eye of the beholder" or "da hip hop witch" or maybe "replicant." I understand those people, but they are incorrect. Koyaanisqatsi makes those movies seem like Raiders of the Lost Ark. If you don't believe me, rent it from your local public library (don't pay money for it at blockbuster; you'd kick yourself if you did).Yes, there IS a message in it. This is it: humanity is overwhelming the world and destroying it as a result. There. Some people might think that this "thoughtful message" might be a redeeming feature of the film, but really the only thing that could ever redeem this movie is if they released a "special edition" where Jackie Chan and Harrison Ford team up to take down the creators of the original. Words really cannot describe how awful of a piece of work this really is. I'm giving it a 1 out of 10. But really I'd give it a 1 out of 1 billion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cinematography, not fond of music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Koyaanisqatsi is supposed to be an amazing film. Granted, the film has some fantastic cinematography. It begins with shots of clouds moving across the sky, creating shadows on the desert and making shadows on canyon walls. There is great openness and majesty about it all, in this world devoid of man. But then after all of this majesty of nature, a tractor appears and the cacophonous music sets in (hmm... I wonder if man is supposed to be bad in this film), and a building blows and smoke envelops the camera and tractor. We then watch evil man putting up power lines in the beautiful desert that we just got done watching. We then watch factories, explosions, expressways, and man's overtaking of nature, which point is seen particularly strongly in a shot where a giant moon is eclipsed by a tall building. The film has this one idea: that nature is glorious and wonderful, but American civilization is destroying it and creating Koyaanisqatsi, life out of balance. The greatness of nature is contrasted with the mess that man creates. The Hopi word, koyaanisqatsi, is used to make us think of a simpler, unspoiled time. I'm sorry, but no. We are cued by the title to think of the men on the expressways and in the streets moving about in their busy little lives as in a big, pointless mess. We are supposed to be horrified by the explosions, but I found them showing how grand, powerful and full of potential man is. Man can create great things. I found the expressways and people moving about in fast-action photography to actually be a tribute to how great and how orderly man is, not how much of a mess he is. The scene in which there are hot dogs on a conveyor belt that is juxtaposed with a very similar scene of people going up escalators seemed to be stupid. Godfrey Reggio has created this glorious film and people do great things, yet we are no more important and have no more meaning than the hot dogs? I don't think so. The capacity for greatness that man possesses is awesome when you think about it. This film suggests that nature would be better off without man. How stupid! To go back to nature is not a solution for the crazy lives for people in L.A. and Manhattan. The expressways are what make it manageable to live in those places. One more note: I heard a joke once that applies to this movie. Knock knock. Who's there? Phillip Glass. Phillip Glass who? Knock knock. Who's there? Phillip Glass. Phillip Glass who? Knock knock. Who's there? Phillip Glass. Phillip Glass who? You get the idea. The music is just plain annoying. Overall, Koyaanisqatsi is a beautiful film with annoying music and a na?ve message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Motion Picture ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not much to suggest that this illustration of the motion picture is perhaps more of a lie than even nature would allow.Though there are fancy pictures,these instances of what is purported to be nature is not very and the very pictures themselves provide only and I repeat they provide only the opportunity for the purveyors of this instance of reality the ability to use this means as an ability to put forth some such argument of one kind or another.It would seem too that reality wishes to rule the roost as man indeed is the baddest of them all but with one reservation and that this picture is not serious.This motion picture places the technology of these days as a influence and indeed its influence is more of a turn off then this review is capable of providing.The aggression exemplified with speeding colors and the timing coupled with Nature Vs. Mankind are such an unfriendly mingling as to deny life as natural and time as having an eternal spirit.The place that all this occupies is that this is a personal affront or attack on what is life and what is reality.This is what has happened to the wider community,it has become a target of the predatory practices of the 20th century with its accompanying lifeless dogma.This film is very much like ab opportunity,in that it bears false witness to a conceit as to value,and it as well provides only the mis-directed accusation that its that,that is the problem when in fact the problem resides in this a un-natural presentation.This is a personal attack which is made to suggest otherwise by the appearance rather than as it might be in nature.This film does not meet criteria for a legitimate look at but a purpose is had to exact revenge using the technology as a means to achieve what it appears to accomplish.This bastardly technology is a curse upon life and has brought suffering to the larger community providing only that this walk is not upon the gaze of our heavenly father but as a false witness to the heart of the human kind.Its ambitions are of a calculation that are mitigated like the murderer with a paramount importance given to timing.It seems that this presentation took some six years which allows for the crime to be more serious than one of emotion and which a predatory charge of conspiracy would be more appropriate.This unsentimental and ruthless presentation is lacking in humor or pathos and allows only the fires of hell to be represented,when he opposite is spoken you will know the difference.I quote from The King James Version,Book of Exodus 2,3 And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked,and,behold,the bush burned with fire,and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said,I will now turn aside,and see this great sight,why the bush is not burnt.And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see,God called unto him out of the midst of the bush,and said,Moses, Moses.And he said,Here Am I.And he said,Draw not nigh hither:put off thy shoes from thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.Morover he said,I am the God of thy father,the God of Abraham,the God of Isaac,and the God of Jacob.And Moses hid his face;for he was afraid to look upon God.Verses 2 through 6.I would suggest that though this be but entertainment it may not qualify as entertaining at all,this film is illustrative of a purpose had by its interests whose wish is to empower us as its agent in an attempt to commit an act of aggression against the wider community.There is this point to understand,that you are being sequestered to join there way of seeing so as to complete the ulterior purpose had by this A Real Motion Picture ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the most pointless and annoying movie I've ever 'tried' to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so it tells you from the beginning that there's no plot. That it's just a documentary of short videos 'supposedly' taken by professionals. As there is thus nothing to 'spoil' and starting off on such a clean and honest slate, you would expect nothing could be bad right? Wrong.In reality. What you're watching a just hundreds and hundreds of time- lapse videos with the most irritating, the most obnoxiously loud and headache inducing chanting/orchestra piano/idontevenknowwhat music looping in the background. This music/chanting lasts for a good 50 of the 80 minutes (maybe even longer) and is so teeth-grindingly bad that it actually reminded me of similar film-styled brainwashing videos that are repeatedly played over and over.The story behind me watching something so abstract and out-my-zone was that my room-mates wanted to watch this and it was on Free-to-air as the final movie in a 13-part series of humanitarian movies that had been shown over almost a fortnight. They said that the previous movies had been interesting and that this was supposed to 'ice' the proverbial cake.I think I watched about 35 minutes before I realised that all I was going to see was time-lapse after time-lapse and hear the same loud chanting throughout the whole movie, with only minor changes every 10 or so minutes. If I wanted to watch time-lapses of cities and people moving quickly through busy streets, and old machinery moving up and down I could have simply gone over to Youtube.I have no idea why the ratings for this are so high. Maybe back in its day it was a breakthrough in filmography and directing but at the end of 2013, it's just a headache inducting movie full of fast moving scenes with the most obnoxious background music you will ever hear in your life. If anything really this movie just plays like something that anyone could create in Windows Movie Maker by stitching a bunch of time- lapses together and then looping a song all the way through the movie.1/10</fullReview>

The beauty of the photography, albeit that it was created without computer enhancement, was insufficient to offset the overall lack of dramatic tension. The photographic techniques (e.g., fast frame, time lapse) that may have been unusual or original when the film was made are today commonplace. Glass is not our favorite composer of film scores. His score here is hammeringly repetitive repetitive repetitive. We wondered what John Williams or Badalamenti or Poledouris or Barry would have done to accompany these images.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most pretentious, manipulative pieces of dreck I've ever seen. The filmmakers simply place various images in a certain order, which has a pretty compelling overall effect--and unlike (apparently) everyone else, I don't think that's a good thing. What this movie is good for, potentially, is as an example of how well you can present an argument, and manipulate/distort ideas, without using words. It should also make apparent the difficulty that lies in trying to counter such tacit arguments (which is where the danger is, in my opinion). As such, it might be worth watching in a film theory/crit class, or in a rhetoric class. But outside such spaces, I wouldn't subject anyone to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I admit going to the store and actually paying $30 bucks for this movie, and also it's sequel, Powaqqatsi. That was my major mistake. Considering that I watched with an extremely positive atittude, it was amazing that I would come out of my room extremly mad that I payed a dime for this movie.Let me make this clear: it has no plot whatsoever. It has no lines, it has no entertainment factor involved. The fact is, its a bad movie. It opens with landscapes that will bore you to death, and a slow progressive chord music score that will bore you to tears. Out of no where comes human kind, I would guess to screw everything up in the world (I'm not real sure, no clear message is ever made.) Then the viewer is subjected to watch extreme speed traffic shots for a extremly long time. They are forced to analyze traffic patterns, I would guess, or pick their noses, till the movie moves on.More boring shots take place, and finally, we see the shuttle Challenger taking off and exploding (I'm not making this up.) Might I remind you that this is in EXTREMLY bad taste. This disaster should not be put in movies to entertain people. Then, we are forced to watch a peice of debris fall from the sky for about five minutes (I swear I'm not kidding) till the end of the movie.I'm surprised that I watched this whole movie, it was that bad. Of course I didn't watch it's sequel. I sold both movies the next day. As I was watching the movie, I kept thinking "Why would anyone like this?" and still don't know to this day. No, don't try to explain, it won't work. But at least I feel better about finally getting my opinion out about this really pointless movie.</fullReview>
