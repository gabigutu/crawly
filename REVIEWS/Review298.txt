		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen LA CHIENNE, and although most of SCARLET STREET is a remake, the two are entirely different films. LA CHIENNE is virtually a comedy. In fact, it begins with an introduction by puppets (!), so we know we're not to take the plot very seriously. Renoir's film is light and fun, and is very interesting to watch for comparisons of 'moral standards' between France and Hollywood.By now, you probably know the story. A sad little man gets involved with a prostitute and her pimp. Hollywood toned down the fact that Robinson and Bennett were involved in a sexual relationship, and the ending of the film had to live up to Hollywood's standards of 'morality'. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet, but needless to say, the endings between the two films differ in a major way.What makes SCARLET STREET so outstanding in my opinion, is that given the repressed nature of the protagonist, the film works better because of the changes. You can better understand the pressures of what living as a human doormat has done to this man, and how coiled up he really is. Edward G. Robinson gives one of the best performances of his career, which is saying a lot! I know, there will always be those who will insist on seeing him as the cigar-chomping tough guy only, and won't accept him as anything else, but SCARLET STREET showcases his more subtle talents and his enormous range. Joan Bennett is pure charm and snake oil in this, and Dan Duryea out-weasels Richard Widmark in KISS OF DEATH [in fact, I'll bet good money that the weasel toons in WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT were based on Dan Duryea's character!]. Hollywood films will always falter in comparison to other country's films because the industry's fear of offending audiences always dulls the blade of truth. But, at least during the classic era of Hollywood, the talent usually made up for the story flaws. What do you get when you put Fritz Lang, Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea together? Magic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The penultimate film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am of the firm belief that Orson Welles's Touch Of Evil is the ultimate film noir, but this little gem comes in at a very, very close second.The Lang direction and visual style is apparent on every frame, and the performance of Edward G. Robinson is among his best, and often strangely neglected.For me, the essence of noir films has as much to do with the bleak outlook on human existence as it does the visual sense, and at the very beginning of this film, we see (IMHO) the single, most perfect noir moment: Chris Cross (Robinson) is given a dinner, a nice little send off for a nice little man. On his way out, a friend asks if Chris is going to ride the train home, as is his normal pattern. Chris has something on his mind though, and chooses to walk instead.That one single moment, that one choice... and because of that, this man will lose his home, his wife, his career and the very thing that makes him want to continue, his art. One moment, one choice, and an entire life is destroyed.THAT is noir!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another compelling masterpiece from Fritz Lang!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is often said of Fritz Lang that his American films aren't as good as the ones he made in Germany, and judging by the films of his that I've seen so far; this analysis is proving itself to be true...but damn, this one isn't far off. Scarlet Street is simultaneously compelling and unpredictable for it's duration; Lang truly knows how to plot a film, and that is evident throughout. The story follows a banker and aspiring painter, played to perfection by Edward G. Robinson, who saves a young woman from a purse snatcher one night while on his way home from a party. The two begin talking to each other, and the banker 'accidentally' tells the girl that he's paints pictures and gets a lot of money for doing so (Lang shows us the pitfalls of trying to impress young women by way of lies). However, all was not what it seemed with the purse-snatcher, and he's actually the young lady's fiancé; and when he learns that his girlfriend has a man with money after her.... he's out for all he can get!A lot of Lang's American oeuvre is concentrated on the American justice system and various other crime related things, and this one is no different. Scarlet Street professes that nobody can ever 'get away with murder', and the fantastic climax to the movie shows this masterfully; much more so than many other films that have tried to convey the same message have. Scarlet Street is drenched with irony throughout (ironically, it took a non-American to make an ironic American film). This irony ensures that the film stays interesting, as the audience is never able to guess what's around the corner. There's nothing worse than a predictable film, and Scarlet Street is certainly anything but. The movie is packed with stand out moments, but non stand out more so than the ending. I'm a big fan of horror films and have seen many; but many of those fail to be as chilling as the ending of Scarlet Street. The atmosphere that Lang creates is incredible, and it ranks one of the most powerful psychological mind games that I've ever witnessed on screen. If Fritz Lang set out to put people off murder with this film; I dare say he succeeded. I know I won't be murdering anyone after watching this!Overall; Scarlet Street is another Fritz Lang masterpiece. While not as mind blowing as Metropolis or as powerful as M; Scarlet Street fills a niche all of it's own. I rate this film as a 'must see', and I can almost guarantee that you will not be disappointed after seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A defining film of classic Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Cross is a bank cashier who has just been given a gold watch by his boss for years of faithful service. Chris has three gifts, which are highly sought and cannot be bought: honesty, integrity and talent. The first two earned him the gold watch but the third is something he keeps to himself. He's a "Sunday" painter who paints from the inside out as a means of escaping his colorless life and loveless marriage. Chris is a man who loves beauty but has none himself, and so he fantasizes about some pretty girl that might see beyond his exterior to the man inside. And so one late rainy night chance places a beautiful damsel in distress in this path, and after saving the girl from the villain, he falls desperately in love and to his amazement, the girl loves him back. But things are not what they seem, and in a short while, Chris will trade in the three gifts he does possess for something he can never have. One of the defining films of Classic Film Noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Noir with shades removed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SCARLET STREET is, no doubt, one of Hollywood's first mature forays into the relationship of a prostitute with her pimp and her client.Until 1945, the big screen's version of a 'lady of the night' was almost waif-like in her mien, casting innocent doe-like eyes at any gentleman who would like to share "a spot of tea" for a nominal fee. As portrayed by Joan Bennett, Kitty is cool,cynical, calculating, a 'ho' who is world weary and holds no illusions. Dan Duryea as her slick, slimy pimp/boyfriend, Johnny, matches Kitty scene for scene in the seediness of their relationship. "Lazylegs" is Johnny's term of affection for his Kitty when he's not cuffing her about openly on the streets.Then there's the third wheel to this tragic ride, Edward G. Robinson as the henpecked husband Chris Cross who also happens to be a frustrated weekend artist. Kitty sees Chris as a hearty meal ticket as Chris laps up Kitty's milk, little realizing that his dream girl is a nightmare in waiting.Director Fritz Lang's unflinching finale leaves the viewer drained of emotion. There is no Hollywood happy ending at the end of SCARLET STREET, just a back alley of guilt, punishment and shame.It is no coincidence that 'Melancholy Baby' is refrained throughout this flick. As played on Kitty's phonograph, the record is scratched and skips over and over at the same spot. For this recording is, like all the characters who reside on SCARLET STREET, damaged goods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Fool Like an Old Fool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to see that your youth has escaped you. It happens to us all. The sad personage of Christopher Cross is very touching. He has seen his life pass with a nice gold watch all he has to show for it. His wife is ugly and mean spirited, his work is dull. He is quite a good painter but hasn't time to do anything about it. Them "she" comes into the picture. All those charms, sexy, vulnerable, and evil, with a connection to Dan Duryea (what a cad) to boot. When the Robinson Character comes to her rescue, it's Johnny (Duryea) who is slapping her around. She is perceptive enough to believe that the well dressed older man must have money, and, if she plays her cards right, she can squeeze him for money. He falls, hook, line, and sinker, and really believes she cares about him. Not only is she an opportunist, she even uses his art as her own to get more money. Because he is moonstruck, he lets her go on and on. There is a subplot concerning his wife's first husband and some other things, but he slowly descends the path to destruction. Everyone watching the movie knows that the poor sap is going to get his at some point. The way it happens is a bit of a stretch. Chris should really feel very little guilt; he is victimized all long the way. But in film noir, the dark elements demand their pound of flesh. He is paid for his foolishness and trust.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought it good, memorable film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen "La Chienne," the movie that others say this is based on. I can only say what of think of this film. I thought this film was interesting and sad, and I have seen it several times and enjoy it every time."Kitty" and "Johnny" are con artists who dupe a middle-aged lonely man into loving Kitty, who's a lazy whore. Robinson has a painting hobby that has never gone anywhere, and he criticizes his own work for lacking "perspective." But he's happy to show Kitty his work, pretending he is a successful artist.I have always liked Edward G. Robinson, in every role I have ever seen him in. In this film, he is married to an old, mean wretch of a woman, his job is really at a bank as a clerk, and when a younger, beautiful Joan Bennett pretends to be in love with him, he does everything he can to keep that love, even if it means going against the law to satisfy her demands for money. In turn, the woman "Kitty" and her boyfriend, start showing his artwork using her name, and amazingly, she is a sensation. He ultimately finds this out, and even so, only wants her love, and she turns on him harshly, saying she never cared for him, making fun of him, and crushes his heart. He goes berserk, and winds up lonely, haunted by the beauty he thought loved him.I thought this film was great film noir, and I enjoyed all the characters. Dan Duryea is at his best as a total piece of slime, Joan is a cruel, lazy beauty, and Robinson is just great in his role as a lonely, desperate man who only wants to be loved and admired. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent noir by a master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang does a wonderful job directing "Scarlet Street," a true film noir from 1945 starring Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea. A miserable, henpecked man, Chris (Robinson) falls in love with a prostitute, Kitty, and she starts milking him for money with the encouragement of her abusive boyfriend Johnny (Duryea). Chris is a cashier who has just reached his 25th year of service; he's also a part-time painter. He steals bonds from his wife, who is the widow of a police detective, and sets Kitty up in an apartment where he can also paint since all his wife does is complain about him cluttering up their place. He believes that Kitty is an actress and that Johnny is the boyfriend of Kitty's ex-roommate. You really want to slap him. His stealing escalates; meanwhile, Johnny and Kitty are passing his art work off as Kitty's, and she's making a name for herself. Instead of killing her then and there, Chris is happy about it, believing that he's a failure and could never have sold a painting, and continues providing her with art work. We assume she and Johnny are getting the money.Alas, there probably are desperately lonely and unhappy men like Chris with footprints all over their bodies, though Chris seems pretty gullible even by 1945 standards. Robinson, however, does a fantastic job in helping us understand why Chris is the way he is. He's a simple, shy, self-effacing man who just wants someone to love him and enjoy his hobby of painting, and Kitty pays lip service to that while she's sleeping with Johnny. It seems that just to bask in her presence is enough for Chris.Using the backdrop of New York City, Lang has directed this with magnificent style and flair, making it one of the most famous noirs of all time. And the performances are top notch. It's amazing how much Joan and Constance Bennett looked alike when they were both blond, but they were very different actresses. Constance had a great deal of sophistication; Joan did better playing tramps. She had a low voice and could be very sexy, and she made a stunning brunette. I saw her in person in the late '80s and was surprised at how tiny she was given how tall she looks here. If anyone has seen the "Gone with the Wind" screen tests, she was one of the most beautiful Scarletts. Here she's very convincing talking out of both sides of her mouth, telling Chris that she loves him and Johnny that she loves him. Duryea is phenomenal as a very unlikable con man, and the two make a great couple.But the character of sad Chris hangs over the film due to Robinson's performance with his shy smile and nervous manner. When his anger emerges, it's years and years worth of it. Unfortunately, he's basically too good a man not to hate himself for actions committed in a rage, and in true Hollywood fashion, he goes the way of most men who let themselves be made fools of by women.A really, really great film. Lang was difficult to get along with, and as the studio system diminished, the powers that be were less willing to put up with him, so his last Hollywood films can't compare with those he did at the top. This is top Lang. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most depressing film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward G. Robinson gives the most subtle - and possibly the greatest - performance of his career in this, the most depressing film ever made. Such a devastating ending is hardly possible these days, and indeed wasn't supposed to have been in 1945. "Immoral, corrupt and tending to incite crime," they called it, "A Hollywood movie we can do without." Perhaps the subversive ending was Lang's answer to those who had criticised his 'cop-out' ending for 'The Woman In the Window' a year earlier. The other two leads - Duryea and Bennett - are brilliant as well, and all the actors make us feel in the end that no one has got what they deserved. 'Scarlet Street' has so many beautifully subtle touches in it that it really has to be seen several times in order to be fully appreciated: the parallel between Kitty and Chris' flower (his 'problems with perspective'); the expression that flashes over Kitty's face when Chris 'confesses' that he's a married man; the brief reference at the beginning to Chris's superstition, which will eventually bring about his psychological downfall. Like many Lang films, it deals with the concept of criminal justice, and is a clever, cruel and fascinating film - a little dated technically, but far ahead of its time, and one of the greatest and blackest film noirs from the forties. The climax is still one of the most chilling in film history - more frightening than most of the great horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film from director Fritz Lang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>************************MILD SPOILERS AHEAD*****************************Edward G. Robinson is a diligent and mild mannered cashier who begins to envy his boss who has affairs with beautiful women and seemingly lives the good life. One dark night, he comes to the rescue of an attractive but gold digging woman, Kitty (Joan Bennett), who really doesn't love him, but thinks he is a talented and rich painter. He permits her to believe this because he is smitten with her. While he falls hard for her, she and her conniving boyfriend, Dan Duryea, run a scam selling his paintings, which turn out to be valuable after all. Edward G. Robinson's character is blinded by love and when he is finally convinced that Kitty won't ever be his, he snaps! The results are shocking.I've heard much about the famed director Fritz Lang, but this is his first film I've seen that I'm aware of, unless he directed the silent film Metropolis which it seems that he may have and which I didn't like all that well.Anyway, this is a great film! It's a morality tale and sometimes morality gets twisted when the good character goes bad and the bad characters get more that they bargained for from someone they thought was an easy target. It's wonderfully directed by the aforementioned director Fritz Lang. The movie gets better and better as it progresses. By the end, this old movie had me in it's clutches. Extremely watchable and entertaining, the director put together some extraordinary cinematic moments which pack a punch and linger in your memory. I was amazed by Edward G. Robinson's performance in the scene where his boss fires him. The tears in his eyes and the look of shame and defeat on his face are unforgettable. Edgar G. Robinson delivers a near genius performance. Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea are no slouches either. The real applause, however, needs to go to the director for many marvelous touches in this film and for a powerful climax that will impact you. I give this movie a 91/100. In my book, it's a classic or near classic film. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Late Expressionism, Early Noir--incredible plot, amazing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scarlet Street (1945)It starts slowly, with little bits of intrigue and a lot of empathy for Edward G. Robinson's character, Chris Cross, a lonely cashier with dreams of being in love. And then he sees a man hitting a young woman on the street, and he rushes to help her. Things start a torturous, complicated, fabulous decline from there. The woman sees how Cross finds her beautiful, but Cross, it turns out, is unhappily married. And petty, selfish cruelty turns to many worse things.Fritz Lang, the Austrian director now firmly settled into Hollywood, is not known for cheerful movies (he directed M, for one), and this one draws on so much empathy, and heartbreak, and finally downright shock and surprise, it's breathtaking. Great film-making, beautiful and relentless. The woman, Joan Bennett, comes alive on the screen, duplicitous and raw. Her boyfriend, Dan Duryea, is perfect Duryea, clever and annoying and as usual, coming out less than rosy.The cinematographer, Milton Krasner, has so many richly brooding and dramatic films to his credit, it's almost a given that we will be invisibly swept into every scene (and much of the action takes place in an apartment almost tailor made for great filming, with glass doors, and two levels to look up or down from). The story is key, based on a novel by Georges de La Fouchardi?re, little known here, but he wrote "La Chienne," the basis for Jean Renoir's second film (1931), where the film announces to the audience that it is about, "He, she, and the other guy . . . as usual." And that describes Scarlet Street just as well, for starters.Lang is credited as one of the key shapers of the film noir style, and that certainly applies visually. It lacks that film noir key of a young man at odds with post-War America, but it does have a man, alone, at odds with the world. Chris Cross is a pathetic creature, far more naive than most of us could ever be, but yet we identify with him because he represents innocence swept up in a world more sinister than we expect. He's a victim, in a way, but also the cause of his own troubles.And troubles they are. What a story, what a film. Dark, wrenching, and unpredictable. Very Fritz Lang.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, after celebrating his twenty-fifth years as a cashier of a company and receiving a golden watch in a dinner party, the middle-aged amateurish painter Christopher Cross (Edward G. Robinson) protects a young woman, Katharine March (Joan Bennett), from an assault on the street by a young man, Johnny Prince (Dan Duryea), without knowing that he is her lover. Chris invites Kitty to drink a coffee in a bar, and presents himself as a successful and wealthy painter. The small time crook and caftan Johnny sees the chance to raise easy money and convinces the manipulative Kitty to take as much money as possible from Chris. He embezzles his company and steals his wife, and Kitty moves to a huge studio. Chris brings his paintings to the new address, and Johnny takes them for evaluation and they are considered masterpieces by an arts critic and by the owner of a gallery. Kitty pretends to be the painter, becomes famous, leading them to a tragic conclusion."Scarlett Street" is a masterpiece of film-noir: a magnificent sordid story, with sex and corruption, the femme fatale, and the losers, all the elements are presented in this movie. The direction of Fritz Lang is precise as usual, and Dan Duryea, Edward G. Robinson and Joan Bennett are simply fantastic. The conclusion, with Chris haunted by the ghosts, is excellent. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Almas Perversas" ("Wicked Souls")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, Tense Drama With Some Fine Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good, tense drama that builds up an interesting 'noir' story that includes some rather creative story elements. It has several strengths, but most of all it features three fine performances by Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett, and Dan Duryea. It's also easy to see Fritz Lang's skilled hand at work in the story-telling, mood, and pacing.Robinson shows his skill and versatility in portraying a mild-mannered bank cashier who really wants nothing more than the chance to dabble in his painting, before getting caught up in a complicated situation. Bennett is quite effective as the opportunistic young woman who befriends him, and Dan Duryea adds his presence and ability to very good effect - Duryea had the knack of portraying this kind character as well as anyone. His appearance in any film-noir always seemed to make an average movie good and a good movie even better.The story is developed carefully, as Robinson's character slowly begins to realize that he has gotten into a situation beyond his control. By the time that things come to a head, the tension is considerable. The ending is also rather resourceful, in being carefully written so as to satisfy the stringent requirements of the production code of the era while also ending the story in a way that seems appropriate and fitting to the tone of the movie as a whole.All of this adds up to make "Scarlet Street" a fine movie that is well worth seeing, especially for fans of film-noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Conscience Can Kill You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a slow first half, the second half of the film picked up considerably and made the whole film worth watching. Because I am a fan of many of the actors in here, I'll watch it again but it's not one of the more intense, riveting film noirs of the 1940s.Dan Duryea did what he did best: play the cocky wise-guy. Joan Bennett as "Kitty March" offered good looks, a body, and a despicable character. Her foil was the pathetic "Christopher Cross," portrayed by Edward G. Robinson. No tough guy role here for Eddie G. He's just a poor sap taken in by a pretty younger woman. Actually, it's hard to feel too sorry for "Chris" as he lets an innocent man go to the electric chair. At least he has a conscience, which torments him more and more as he winds up losing his mind. Here's another example that one really does "reap what one sows" even if it isn't apparent at first. A conscience gets the best of most people. That's the message of this film, if you can stay with it. Margaret Lindsay is in here, too, someone I've always enjoyed watching, particularly in her films of the early '30s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your Life: What If...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Some spoilers.) As he moves uneventfully through middle age, Chris Cross, a poor, henpecked accountant, played to perfection by Edward G. Robinson, begins to feel the exact dimensions of his particular prison. He has never "done anything", being a lifelong office drone with a drab and cheerless home and a loveless wife who is a terrible scold. His only retreat from quiet despair is dabbling in oils in his spare time. Although he clearly longs for something to happen to him, he is a physically unadventurous man, we quickly realize, who wouldn't know where to start trying to bust a move even if he had the heart. When a sequence of events is set into motion, by a chance meeting with a prostitute, he is jack-knifed into a track he could never have imagined. (It is typical of the temper and character of this gentle man that he doesn't recognize Katherine March as a prostitute, or that the man beating on her for money isn't simply a thief, but her pimp.) Once the bus on which Chris has been biding his time begins to roll down the hill, he wants off at the next stop. But it is too late. This fatalistic film could make you believe that we are rationed in life precisely what we are able to handle. --And further, that the few people who manage to fly under the radar for a while and live a life not intended for them are always checked, inevitably. Chris never really gets cut much slack here, even during his out-of-control ride: He experiences one of the two life triumphs he has longed for-- the public discovery of his artistic talent -- vicariously, as through a pane of glass. Even when his art becomes famous, it happens in such a messed-up way he is forced to observe from the sidelines, wondering what it must be like to be the artist who is getting all the accolades. And the one other life triumph he longs for -- the love of a beautiful woman -- plays him false, when it finally appears, making the sad, unexciting little life he had before seem sweetly and simply desirable by comparison. Scarlet Street IS an unstintingly sad, claustrophobic story. Movies seldom told stories like this at the time of Scarlet Streets release, and still don't-- too downbeat; everybody likes "feel-good" movies. --Don't they? The makers supposedly had to change the ending of this film to satisfy censors. What remains is nevertheless a finish that is hauntingly "right", if not especially just --one that will stay with you for years to come. Ten Stars. As good as it gets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's something to this story of Professor Unrath and Lola at the Blue Angel, but with Dan Duryea added to the mix. The respected cashier Robinson, having been honored by his co-workers and boss and having seen his boss slip out for a night on the town with a doubtful woman, finds out just how slippery the ground beneath his feet is when he tries to do the same. Bennett and Duryea ruin him, mock him but he overturns the applecart, sending them on their way to their own Hell.How pathetic Robinson is! He must pursue his hobby in the bathroom, out of sight from Rosalind Ivan, playing another battle ax, and when his buddy from work stops, Robinson is like the boy caught smoking. We almost feel good for him for rescuing Bennett from Duryea until we see the designs the sleazy Bennett has on the little man. She portrays the part wonderfully. "Lazy Legs" Duryea calls her, but she is more of a spider, luring fly Robinson to her web. Duryea is wonderfully oily.I think our one reviewer is correct: Lang surely was dissatisfied with the 'it was all a dream' finale to 'Window' that he took this one to a more satisfying conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few movie fans, and no film noir fans, will want to miss this flawed but fascinating film, with the great Edward G. Robinson playing Christopher Cross, a banker and amateur painter who falls in love with a woman (Joan Bennett) young enough to be his daughter?and devious enough to destroy his life. She is in love with the no-account (Dan Duryea) who slaps her around and encourages her friendship with the old dupe. But who is duping whom? He tells her he's a famous painter, and she believes him. So does the no-account, who tries to sell the paintings?and sets in motion a series of events that will drastically change Cross's life.I haven't read the novel or play "La Chienne" that provided the basis for "Scarlet Street"; nor have I seen the Jean Renoir film based on the book. I hear they're all black comedies, which might explain the offbeat quality to this film. Did the director Fritz Lang intend a black comedy only to be thwarted by Universal Studios? Did he intend the serious tone but neglect to remove some of the sources' black comic elements?Whatever happened, Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea don't quite seem to belong to this movie. Duryea in particular seems to playing his part for laughs. Bennett isn't bad, but there's a certain phoniness to her performance. Watch that scene where she sits in her bed while talking on the phone: she seems to be posing for a magazine layout. She's also too stridently evil. There are hints from her dialogue that her character, Kitty, is a fundamentally decent woman corrupted by her lover. But Bennett doesn't convey this particularly well. I believe Kitty's hateful outburst at the end is an expression of self-loathing, and of a frustration over Robinson being gullible enough to *allow* her to be so evil, more than it is an expression of sheer malice. Bennett plays only the malice.Another thing that seems left over from a black comedy is the introduction of the character with the eye patch. I won't give away the surprise; but I do think the situation too wacky and implausible for this film. Did this plot twist come from "La Chienne," or was it imposed by censors who wanted to prevent a certain sin from occurring (in a film already drenched in sin!)?The two young lovers, Kitty and Johnny, seem drawn from life?if you can ignore the way they're performed. Kitty is a woman who couldn't bear a man to treat her well. Her *need* to be slapped around was probably too potent for 1945 just as it's too politically incorrect for 2007. But it's true to the dark side of human nature. We all know women like Kitty. Johnny is a bit opaque to me. Does he need to slap around a woman to love her? Does he love Kitty at all? My guess is, he doesn't love her. Does he even want her? That I don't know.This slow-moving film rewards the viewer with many persuasive and memorable moments. There's the behavior of Robinson's shrewish wife (Rosalind Ivan) when a friend comes to visit. There's Robinson's sincere speech telling how he creates a painting. Finally, Fritz Lang uses shadows, distorted sound and bizarre sets to convey Robinson's state of mind in the frightening last scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fritz Lang directs this moody Film-Noir. Glorious black &amp; white. Interesting story line and well acted. A meek henpecked bank cashier(Edward G. Robinson)becomes an embezzler after meeting and falling in love with a much younger woman(Joan Bennett). The lovely and alluring Bennett's pimp(Dan Duryea)convinces her into manipulating the older man for money and control of his modest art work. Emotions can run the gamut and it is easy to find Duryea's character most offensive. Robinson and Bennett leave very little room to improve their skills. Also in the cast are Margaret Lindsay and Jess Barker. I loved the rainy scene and the moment when Robinson finds out that his muse is using him. The wrong seems to be righted, but still leaving a price to pay. Wonderful old time classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Immanent Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward G. Robinson is a timid bank cashier suffering from low self esteem. He's married to a shrew and takes refuge in his weekend painting, which he deems unfit for display except to friends, of which he seems to have exactly one, and THAT one so distant that he isn't even aware of Robinson's love of painting. Robinson's a decent man, though, and interferes when he sees a man slapping a woman around on a lonely street in Greenwich Village.He shouldn't have. The woman turns out to be an "actress" (Joan Bennet) being mistreated by the man she loves, her "boy friend" (Dan Duryea). Over coffee, Bennet is mistakenly led to believe that Robinson is a famous painter whose work sells for as much as fifty grand. She and Duryea, two weasels, successfully dupe Robinson into supporting Bennet in her own apartment and Bennet is constantly wheedling money out of him. Robinson's problem is that he's trying to support himself and his nagging wife on a cashier's salary, but, since he's now in love with a woman who loves him, or so he thinks, he steals money for her from the bank.The story gets complicated after that, with Robinson's paintings being discovered by an art critic and, without Robinson's knowledge, being sold for big bucks under Bennet's signature, and -- well, Robinson finally twigs and murders Bennet with an ice pick. Duryea is convicted of the crime and executed. Robinson's embezzlement is found out and he's fired. Then he contracts a severe case of immanent justice, which is the notion that bad behavior leads to illness and suffering, even in the absence of any causal connection. Robinson winds up wandering the streets, an insane bindle stiff, hearing the voices of Bennet and Duryea ridiculing him.The year before this was released, Fritz Lang directed a successful noir with the same three leads in similar roles, "The Woman in the Window." There, Robinson was a psychology professor who kills a man in self defense and tries with Bennet's help to cover up the crime, even while scuzzbag Duryea is figuring things out."Scarlet Street" suffers by comparison. It's an ugly picture. In the earlier film, Robinson's wife was away, but he gathered with two or three friends regularly to have dinner and some witty and sophisticated conversation at their club. Robinson's professor was a little bored but otherwise generally satisfied with his life. The plot was simple, straightforward, and filled with suspense. In this one, Robinson is stupid and friendless from the beginning. Instead of one whiny voiced snoop, everybody seems to mistreat him, lie to him, exploit him, and ridicule him in his absence. Or, like his wife, they simply insult him constantly and boss him around. And they all live like slobs. Bennet flips her cigarette butt into a sink piled high with dirty dishes.The problem doesn't lie in Lang's direction. He does a fine job. (The murder scene may make you gasp with surprise, the brutality emerging as it does out of a mild-mannered clerk.) There's a bit of ironic humor in evidence too. Robinson's wife, too stingy to buy her own radio, goes downstairs to listen to "The Happy Family Hour," while Robinson sits at the dinner table and buries his head in his hands. And the dialog is sometimes keen. "He's too dumb to be a phony". And he IS. Robinson's performance isn't bad but it's stereotyped. There's little complexity in it. He's thoroughly undermined by his corrosive lack of self esteem, a naive, self-deprecating fool and he's treated like one. Bennet is more animated than in the earlier film, but Duryea is, if anything, even a riper villain than before.In real life, of course, Edward G. Robinson was a true aficionado of classical art and, along with Vincent Price, had one of the more esteemed and expensive art collections in Hollywood. In the film -- and I don't know if this was intended as a joke or not -- his much-admired paintings truly stink. Take a good look at that flower in the milk glass. My kid could have done better than that with finger paints in kindergarten. I'll reserve judgment on the big snake with the forked tongue wrapped around the el tracks. That one is either way over my head or way under it.Overall, it's pretty depressing and paints a bleak Edward-Hopperly picture of modern life, so to speak, without much in the way of redemptive wit. It reaches for tragedy and winds up with only melancholy, baby. Rent "The Woman in the Window" instead. If nothing else, the transfer to DVD is better. This print is so fuzzy and blotched that when an envelope is held up for the audience, the viewer can't read the address.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty, downbeat film noir from Lang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film noir "Scarlet Street" is generally regarded as one of Fritz Lang's finest American films. In it, Edward G. Robinson plays a hen-pecked middle-aged husband who strikes up a would-be relationship with a younger woman of questionable moral fibre. Little does he know, her actual lover has persuaded her to milk him for all he's worth.You might find that the above description sounds a bit clichéd and I'd be inclined to agree. About the first hour of the film proceeds in predictable fashion before the story really comes into its own. The plot does eventually justify your attention but the routine proceedings of the film's first half are arguably its biggest drawback.The cast is decent but not outstanding. Edward G. Robinson gives the best performance by far. It's hard to believe that he was never even nominated for an Oscar over his long career. I have less patience for Joan Bennett &amp; Dan Duryea, though that's mainly because their characters are basically one dimensional.Lang's direction is attractive while the H.J. Salter score and Milton Krasner cinematography combine to give the film the atmosphere that it requires. The adapted screenplay from Dudley Nichols also delivers the goods in the long run.Had the film not started out so ordinarily I would have ranked it higher but, even though the latter portion of the film is eminently satisfying, I can't ignore what preceded it. Nevertheless, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the film despite my caveat regarding the film's relatively uninteresting early stages.By the way, this film is in the public domain, meaning that any distributor can sell copies without licensing the material. As a result, poor quality versions of the film abound on home video. As far as I know, the best presentation available is the Kino DVD edition, which is mastered from material preserved by the Library of Congress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fate And Circumstances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scarlett Street finds Edward G. Robinson getting away from the gangster type and more to the mild mannered Mister Winkle which he played a couple of years before. Unfortunately things don't end as good for Christopher Cross as they do for Mr. Winkle.A mild mannered little guy married to a harridan of a wife in Rosalind Ivans, Robinson's only outlet in his life is the painting he does. He's far better at it than he thinks and if he had some encouragement instead of misery from Ivans this whole story never would have happened.In any event due to a combination of circumstances, his own personality and fates compelling the path he takes, Robinson winds up involved with bad girl Joan Bennett and her layabout boy friend, Dan Duryea. When Robinson moves his studio over to her place, Duryea grabs up some paintings and tries to sell them.He makes a real impression on dealer Vladimir Sokoloff who sells them to noted critic Jess Barker and Duryea and Bennett say she did them. And Robinson the chump, goes along with it because he's so taken with Bennett.Fritz Lang directed this film and it's one of his best American made films about fate just directing the broad march of events and trapping people into circumstances.Leads Robinson, Bennett, and Duryea were all in Lang's last film The Woman in the Window and there is some similarity in plot. But I think Robinson's character is better compared to Claude Rains's Claudin in Phantom of the Opera and how he reacts when he thinks he's being made a fool of.As for Joan Bennett, she's one of the coldest hearted women ever created on screen. All of the leads get a brand of justice one way or another in Scarlet Street.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fritz Lang's Scarlet Street gets a fine performance from Robinson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scarlet Street was one of the most interesting film noirs for me because of Edward G. Robinson's characterization of a meek man forced into crime instead of his usual tough guys. I loved an early scene he had with co-worker Samuel S. Hinds about inviting him to his house. That set the tone of what a nice man Robinson is here. Then he saves Joan Bennett from an attacker and they have a dinner where he lets her believe he's a wealthy painter instead of a clerk who just celebrated his 25th anniversary at his company with a gift watch. What he doesn't know was that her "attacker" was her boyfriend Dan Duryea who likes to slap her once in awhile. While you can see some twists come a mile away, the performances of the three leads and many of the supporting ones are so compelling that you're with them and director Fritz Lang every step of the way. Writer Dudley Nichols' dialogue is so snappy with irony that while the whole thing is treated seriously you can't help but laugh at some scenes. I especially liked Durea's "For cat's sake, he's lying" at the end of his cross-examination after hearing Robinson's claiming he "copied" Katherine's (Bennett) paintings! Good performances from the actresses playing Katherine's roommate and Robinson's wife Adele. Well worth seeking for film noir fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the Lang/Robinson Formula, This Is No "Woman in the Window"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the grand tradition of films noir, the title of this 1945 entry has nearly nothing to do with the plot other than to evoke an atmosphere of danger and possible murder.The pairing of director Fritz Lang and one of my all-time favorite actors, Edward G. Robinson, resulted in one of my all-time favorite films from the 40s, "The Woman in the Window." But the lightning didn't strike twice for me when it came to this film, which also stars Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea. Its plot is all over the place and is impossible to predict from one minute to the next. That can be a good thing when done well, but it felt confusing and inconsistent as applied here. Robinson is as good as always, and Bennett is a treat as this film's femme fatale, but the sluggish pacing and constantly shifting narrative prevented me from ever feeling fully engaged.It does boast one of the creepier and most cynical endings I've seen in any movie from that same time period.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>F is for Fake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In order to fully grasp this, I believe you should know a bit about an earlier Lang film with the same principal players, called The Woman in the Window. The protagonist was a quaint college professor, who falls asleep and meets a woman next to a shop window with a painting of her. The whole point of that film was a dream that enticed with sex and freedom that proved destructive.Look at the annotation of this. The dream is pretty much the same, a meek cashier at a big firm yearns for a bohemian, exciting youth he never had, to be loved by a pretty young girl and be able to devote himself to his painting. He's also a painter on the side, in his own living-room. Of course he meets a young girl, impresses as a famous painter, and the sexual fantasy is gradually fleshed out around him. In the end, he paints her portrait and the portrait finds its way on the window, which is another way of acknowledging the dreamer of the story, asleep in the midst of images.This is all you need to know as introduction if you haven't seen it. Otherwise, read on.There are several layers nested inside of this, all about the illusion of conventional reality and conflating art, sex, and storytelling. One of the most stunning is that he rents a Village penthouse where he can escape to for love and painting, but the thing acquires life quite apart from him and he's really an outsider, always interrupting some plot or masquerade.The second perspective is from the end of the woman and her scheming boyfriend, who manipulate for money this bohemian dream he's having. This supports the outer, let's say more contrived elements of noir - deception, a femme fatale, the con.So he has gone along with the woman's notion that he's a famous painter, also pulling the strings of an image, being a storyteller, but she is discovered as a great painter in his place, in order to convince she spouts many of the same romantic notions about art he told her. He goes along with this, another story, another image being staged as the real thing. His theory is that he was never going to be recognized as himself, because appearances are everything. And this is what the dream is about; in real life, he is henpecked husband to a domineering wife, always told to do the dishes and donning a ridiculous flowery apron to do it. This is who he is, a submissive being. So he cannot help but dream up a situation where initial confidence and control is taken away, and once more he finds himself smothered by a strong woman, once more unknown as a painter, but now the woman is attractive, and his art devoted to rapturous feelings for her is valued.More fakery ahead; a dead husband returning to life, a trial where witnesses go with the fabricated version (this is stunning and deserves its own essay-long post), the protagonist repeatedly denied truth when he confesses.So this is it. Life could be simple, if we could only put a line around feelings. It isn't, so we paint, seek out sex, or fashion stories in our head about the impulses.Each of these is a only another layer of paint that obscures the real thing, which is often so banal, so unromantic, say a flower being painted inside a bathroom, that one option is to paint our way through to a world of fiction and dwell there.The result of this is shown to be more or less disastrous for everyone, this is the moral pull in the other direction. Our protagonist suffers a common noir fate; he dreams so far that he is no longer recognized as himself, a broken soul stranded in urban limbo with voices of the stories in his head.The other option would come around the time of Antonioni, the cessation of stories (regular readers will know that I identify this with Buddhism).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie, but one that I'll never watch again. Too depressing--like most of us, I like to watch fiction films for entertainment, not as a form of self-punishment. Robinson's acting is superb, but Both Duryea &amp; Bennet seem out of place here. They look unconvincing in their respect. parts. Duryea doesn't even seem to be taking his role seriously, until the con is exposed. And his attire doesn't help much; I kept fearing that at any moment he would take his panama off and break into a tap dancing routine; and when wearing those suspenders I was expecting at any moment to see Ross Perot dropping in for an interview. I know he was the resident bad guy in many films of the 40s but I don't see anything threatening in his presence. Even his regular slapping of her looks forced and she doesn't look really intimidated by him, as it would be the case of any abused woman. As for her, she looks totally unconvincing as a streetwalker. She's too fine and delicate. Phony is the word that best describe her acting here. Lindsay should have been the one playing the character, a real babe! (had I been Chris I would have immediately forgotten Kitty when meeting her).For more than an hour SS plays out more like a comedy noir than a film noir, as if Lang wasn't still sure where he wanted to take his movie; this is especially true in the scene when Johnny &amp; Kitty examine the paintings Chris just brought in. That would be fitting, as Lang seems to have a dark sense of humor too: just note the violins during the first "romantic" date between Chris &amp; Kitty--and what a crap the "masterpieces" are.I see here that Chris has fooled not only Kitty but also many reviewers. He is not the poor, innocent, sap many assume he is. He has been using her as much as she has been using him; both are profiteers, egocentric little creatures. There's no generosity in them; Chris's problem is not one of lack of self-esteem but of egoism, as he sets no ethical bounds to his own behavior when trying to fulfil his romantic fantasies. The emptiness in his life is the result of his own spiritual vacuousness, his emotional laziness, and for that he has nobody else to blame but himself. His own boss doesn't think much of him as he doesn't even bother to personally present him his 25th anniversary gift. J.J. Hogarth knows him well, as everyone else, Adele the first. That's why they treat him the way they do. And he hasn't been conned either by Kitty &amp; Johnny after all, because they have given him good value in exchange for the money he paid: the feeling of being young, free and in love. He has as much right to complain as if they had been selling him bona fide cocaine or alcohol. And what truly makes him explode is not his discovery of the con, which is secondary to him, but the fact that he has come to realize that he can't escape the prison of his own life. Adele isn't gone after all, she has simply reincarnated in Kitty. At the sight of her taunting him, Chris has understood that this is simply a vision of things to come, a vignette of what his future life would have been, had her instead accepted his marriage proposal. It's really that awful revelation, the sight of the ugliness of his own life, what makes him go berserk. So he stabs her the same way he would have broken in pieces a mirror showing him his own unflattering physical features. That's why he is so consumed by remorse, later, having caused the deaths of two innocents. They are not guilty of the misery of his life; it was like that before they came and it will be the same after, but now with the burden of their deaths on his conscience. Had they been truly guilty in his eyes, had the con really been played on him, he would have felt instead avenged, redeemed, free.I give it 7/10 mostly for the cinematography and for Robinson's acting work, but I don't think it matters. This is genre rapidly fading in the popular conscientiousness--not only because of its B/W but mostly for his utter hopeless and its cynical take on life in gen.--and for one I won't be missing its deeply entrenched misogyny and pessimistic mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man can take only so much...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>and Chris Cross (Edward G. Robinson) has taken just about that limit. Fiftyish failure Chris has just marked 25 years with the same employer. That's the good news. The bad news is he has exactly the same job that he had when he first got there - bank cashier. Plus it looks like there are no promotions in his future. His wife Adele was originally his landlady. In middle age he married out of loneliness and now is pretty much relegated to being her housekeeper and her verbal punching bag with her constantly comparing him to her dear departed husband, a police officer who was drowned in the line of duty. Living spouses are usually no competition for dead ones, who lose all of their faults as soon as they lose their pulse, and this situation is no exception.Then one night meek Chris makes an uncharacteristically bold move and interrupts what he perceives as a mugging. He's instantly smitten with young pretty Kitty March (Joan Bennett), the mugging victim. Chris may completely misunderstand Kitty - he thinks she is a young innocent alone in the big city- but Kitty has totally misunderstood Chris - she thinks he's rich and an acclaimed artist because of his knowledge of art and the fact that he mentions that he is a painter - it's actually his Sunday hobby. Neither corrects the wrong impression the other has because each wants something. Kitty wants money from Chris so she always has a sob story as to why she is poor and seemingly alone in the world. Chris wants to feel young and alive again, which he does with Kitty, so he finds ways - illegal ones - to give her the money she wants by embezzling from his employer and by stealing from his wife's personal stash of cash.However, Chris and Kitty are not as different as you would think. Kitty is a doormat in a way herself. That mugging that Chris saw was actually Kitty's boyfriend Johnny (Dan Duryea) hitting Kitty for not giving him any money. In spite of Johnny's worthless ways she can't live without him and does whatever he asks which usually involves ever more elaborate schemes to get money out of Chris. She doesn't seem to mind the rough treatment she receives from Johnny either. All of this deception gets even more deeply layered before the film is through and eventually leads to murder. I'll let you watch and find out who is the victim, who is the killer, and who is the accused.The acting by all of the principals here is just perfect. Although it seems that Kitty is a prostitute, at the beginning of the film she has a roommate that explains Kitty is a failed model because she is too lazy to show up to work. This was probably done to satisfy the censors because minus that explanation you couldn't help but conclude that Kitty is a prostitute and Johnny is her pimp. They certainly both have the attitude. Highly recommended as one of the great film noirs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone with a bit of classic film knowledge will know about Hollywood movies acquiring a cynical streak in the 40s and 50s. The plot of a picture like Scarlet Street has been analysed into banality for various psychological readings over the years, but there is little about its story that is unique to what we call film noir. It is in any case a rough remake of the earlier French film La Chienne, itself based on a novel, and a silent American picture called The Whispering Chorus (1918) has many similarities. What is so striking about Scarlet Street, and so many other noirs, is not the themes of the story but the way it is told. Cinema is, after all, about images.A lot of the look of pictures from this time is down to the circumstances of the war, when resources for film making were at a severe low point. Even prestigious wartime productions like For Whom the Bell Tolls and Since You Went Away while epic in length take place on a few small and poorly-lit sets, and aren't exactly bustling with extras. Now take a little production like Scarlet Street which would receive an even smaller allocation, and by necessity you must film it in tiny cramped sets shrouded in darkness, or dark street corners devoid of passers-by. Of course, poverty-row pictures have existed in every era, but I think the thing that distinguishes ones like this is that they worked sensibly within their limited parameters. A B-Western from the 30s or a trashy sci-fi from the 50s would aim high and thus look very cheap. A picture like Scarlet Street aims low and thus looks appropriately atmospheric.If ever there was a director to wring a nightmarish feel from the simplest of elements it was Fritz Lang. He actually makes a virtue of Scarlet Street's low production values, shrouding many of the scenes in a cloak of darkness. Take the squalid bar where the two leads go for their first drink together. The standard way to dress that set would be to fill it with mean-looking riffraff. Instead, dark and all but deserted, it has the atmosphere of a graveyard. And yet Lang's compositions arrange the sparse set decoration into complex patterns, making everywhere look like some horrid maze. Scarlet Street also contains some fine examples of Lang's use of imagery to make us understand a character's mindset. When Edward G. Robinson explains that when he looks at the dilapidated flower he "sees" the ornate one he has painted, there is an attention-grabbing whip pan to the real flower balanced on the edge of a grimy basin. In the following scene there is a jarring cut as Joan Bennett throws her cigarette in a sink full of dirty crocks. The similarity of these two images, and the way we are made to pay attention to them, gives us a subtle link between Robinson seeing beauty in the wilted flower, and seeing worth in Bennett.It's odd how Lang's pictures normally featured quite overblown hammy performances, whereas here the three main players are all nicely understated. Eddie Robinson, normally a brash wise-cracker, does an excellent and rather poignant job of the sensitive and self-effacing Chris Cross, very subtle and very believable. Joan Bennett is great too, making us believe in both the low-down floozy who loves a gangster and the sweet, innocent lass Robinson worships. And then there is another fabulous turn by Dan Duryea, who always seemed a bit of a caricature because of his mischievous face and sly voice, but could be a very effective villain when he underplayed it, giving the impression of a creepy man who is capable of sinister acts. In fact, Duryea is in constant danger of stealing the picture, and Lang wisely puts his back to the camera in a lot of scenes to stop him upstaging the leads.Of course, the real question is, does all the business of Scarlet Street work? It does indeed. The story may have been old, but this version of it has a unique atmospheric veneer which makes it chill the heart and linger in the mind. This is how great film noir works.</fullReview>

After the small conversation the girl understands that his Savior is a rich painter. The poor banker wants to meet her again and the girl's fiancée tries to find a way how to slowly extort the money from the banker. And all this deceiving can begin.And you can never think how things are going onwards. This is the movie that todays filmmakers have to take as an example how to build up an interesting plot. No way you can predict what happens next and even if you see one step ahead then the bigger surprise will be the next one.Fritz Lang nails it all. Edward G. Robinson is terrific in the role of banker Chris. So is Rosalind Ivan as his nagging wife.Scarlet Street must have on of the most horrifying endings of all time. Beside the creeps it gives you (that many horror films fail to do) it has an message to tell: you can never get away with anything!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A repeat viewing of "Scarlet Street" today has heightened my appreciation for the film, a sordid little affair expertly presented by Director Fritz Lang. Lang brings subtle nuances to his characters to help us understand what drives and motivates them. We have a pretty good idea early on that Christopher Cross (Edward G. Robinson) is a meek bank clerk, but one doesn't see how truly desperate his life has become until he puts on that blasted apron to wash the dishes. Or how about the 'three on a match' superstition put to the test at his retirement dinner when Chris's boss lights his cigar, a quick aside shows him crossing his fingers to ward off fate.Art critic David Janeway had the perfect description of Kitty March (Joan Bennett) describing her as a Mona Lisa without the smile, a testament to her two faced nature. With boyfriend Johnny's (Dan Duryea) encouragement, Kitty plays Janeway along as well. How many boyfriends did Johnny think she could string along before the whole thing fell apart? With relatively little screen time, Rosalind Ivan portrays every man's worst nightmare in a wife, an Edith Bunker on steroids relentlessly hounding her husband into submission on a daily basis. One wonders if there could have been an ice pick in her future as well, although the re-appearance of her presumed dead husband was a slick table turn by Chris. However I'm not sure I can buy the presumption that the Cross marriage is automatically over just because Patch-Eye shows up; that matter wasn't satisfactorily resolved in my view, though fair enough for Chris to continue his foray into delusion.Though the movie doesn't start out that way, Chris winds up committing the perfect crime, with the inadvertent help of con man Johnny who winds up taking a death chair rap. It would have held up too, except for Chris's conscience. In a scene reminiscent of the Bogart/Greenstreet conversation in the film "Conflict", the seed of a killer's self destruction is planted by a detective who theorizes on the guilt of the criminal mind. By now, if one doesn't realize how hapless Chris has become, it should be crystal clear. The authorities don't believe his confession, and with the disembodied voices of Kitty and Johnny mocking him from the grave, Chris can't even successfully commit suicide. He has become one of film's biggest losers."Scarlet Street" is a compelling journey into noir territory and holds up well after sixty years. Robinson, Bennett and Duryea are each successful in creating characters so pathetic that one can only stand at a distance and marvel at their performances. In that regard, the film, much like Chris's paintings, will give you a peculiar perspective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unshakably kind-hearted, emasculated Chris Cross (Ed G. Robinson) summons the courage to rescue dame-in-distress Joan Bennett one rainy night in which he unprecedentedly breaks with routine, walking home by foot instead of taking the subway. It's a slight cry of freedom pulled from a moment's whimsy, but it leads to his downfall (what else?). I think the best and worst thing about this noir is the kind of psychological life the film permits Cross: he is a dupe, yes, but he isn't so much pulled by fate as he is lead astray by a crumbling feel for his own conscience, which, as it happens, seems less invoked by the femme fatale's destructive web as it does his desire to disentangle himself from his ruthless wife's clutches at any cost. This is his impairment, that which makes him blind to the fact that Bennett has no designs on marriage. In fact, Cross's actual liberation occurs when he bumps into his wife's old husband, as the glimmer of hope for a new start emerges. The marriage to this young woman (Bennett) is a mere formality, a closing chapter on his former subjugation?I would say what pricks him more than her outright rejection and taunts, which undeniably recalls his wife, is his own realization that he hasn't broken free at all. His dread of returning to the old, seemingly irrepressible life is what really sends him over the edge, not so much his realization of the "con" (which he dismisses in an earlier scene).(Spoilers follow.) This one keeps growing in stature the more I think about it, and I'll probably revisit it soon. I saw the ending, however, as obviating the above interpretation?it dilutes the idea that Cross is using Kitty as much as she is using him, and makes Cross the haunted, love-struck dupe again, when I think he was mostly acting on his own desire to escape. He seized an opportunity, just as she did. Although he is certainly the more sympathetic character, the theme of manipulation is still present to that point?I can't buy that he was in the relationship purely out of love, and the domestic scenes bear this out, I think. I'm certainly willing to listen to any other interpretations, though...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterful Film With Great Characterizations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scarlet Street" is a dark film about a man named Christopher Cross (Edward G. Robinson) who lives one of those lives of quiet desperation. His job as a clerk in a bank is unfulfilling. His wife is a harridan who let him know daily that she considers him a nuisance. He does have one small pleasure that allows him to express his feelings--painting, which he does despite her ridicule.One night he meets a pretty, young woman named Kitty (Joan Bennett) he thinks is charming. Being rather na?ve regarding the machinations of those who are deceptive, he fails to recognize her intentions. Kitty and her boyfriend conspire to play upon Chris' feelings.The result is a story full of twists. Director Fritz Lang frames the scenes beautifully, creating shot after shot that impress the eye. The actors fit their parts perfectly, even when the behavior of a character is slightly over the top. As I watched it, I was reminded of Hitchcock's works--a master in control of his craft.The ending is not what I would choose--though it is filmed so well--but the artistic choices were limited at the time of its release (1945). That minor objection is nearly insignificant given the overall quality of this film, where actors and director have together created a wonderful tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lang's atmospheric crime story spoilt by a slow first hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SCARLET STREET is an atmospheric film noir that tells of a doomed love triangle between a trio of rather dastardly characters. Holding the whole thing together is a doomed performance from Edward G. Robinson, a distinctive-looking actor who invests his character with a real sadness. Robinson's hangdog looks combined with the bad decisions of and pure bad luck surrounding his character makes for a memorable movie.The director is none other than Fritz Lang, who once again paints an eerie picture of crime and punishment. Scenes of characters wandering the rain-drenched streets are familiar from the likes of M, but this is an all-American production. Joan Bennett plays an utterly horrible femme fatale, while Dan Duryea is the epitome of small-scale evil. The plot is a unique one that brings to mind the recent story behind the Tim Burton film BIG EYES but the style is all Lang's own.My only problem with SCARLET STREET is that the story is a little slow, with much of the incident packed into the last half hour with a long, padded-out first hour before that. A little more consistency regarding the pace would have made the classic; as it stands, it's merely acceptable and still worth watching for that haunting ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good character film but moves a little slowly at times and is less of a film when it moves off Robinson's Cross</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Cross is a reliable employee of a bank and has been for twenty-five years. However his marriage and his work still leaves him unfulfilled and he is touched with jealousy and regret when he sees a colleague stepping out with a younger woman. On his way home from a work presentation, Cross comes across Katherine "Kitty" March in a spot of bother and comes, in his own way, to her aid. Walking her home Cross is giddy like a schoolboy, seeing a future with this pretty young woman. So blinded by this enthusiasm is he that Cross does not see that Kitty and "friend" Johnny are really trying to take him for a fortune they believe he has.This film is best known to me for a couple of scenes with very famous dialogue but I had not seen it for ages until recently. The film has a great character at its heart and the story is more or less about this man's mid(ish) life crisis that sees him falling under the spell of a younger woman who really offers him nothing but ruin and despair . This is the strongest part of the film by far and the character of Cross is well enough written to carry the film forward. The downside of this is that, when the film fills in other aspects of the plot that do not directly involve Cross, I found it to be a little dull despite the fact that a lot of the action occurs with Kitty and Johnny because really the value was within Cross. The moral is well delivered at the end and, because of how it is down I did take to it more than some of the films of the period that had to have similar endings.A big reason for the character aspect working is Robinson's performance who happily plays himself as a convincing old fool who, to put it simply, is turned out by a young woman. I can see what attracted him to the role and he plays it very well, with his body and delivery showing him to be just outside of the reason and logic that made him successful in his job. He also plays the conclusion of the film very well and makes that work as well as it does. Bennett is pretty good by avoiding the typical sultry femme fatale cliché and playing it a bit more "normal" while also letting the exploitation she is involved with changing her character. Duryea is OK for the most part but cracks convincingly and enjoyably at the very end. Lang directs with a touch of melodrama but he seems to understand the characters and brings them out well while also working with the atmospheric cinematography.Overall then this is a good film but perhaps not the classic I had hoped for. The character of Cross is fascinating and really well played by Robinson throughout and the film is at its best when it is focusing on him but, perhaps understandably, it is not as good when it moves away from him to work with the rest of the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brokerage house cashier Christopher Cross is a shy, retiring fellow who likes to paint in his spare time. On the night he is honored for twenty five years of loyal service he defends a woman (Joan Bennett) being beaten by a man (Dan Dureya) who it turns out is her pimp and lover. Cross falls for Kitty and plays along with her impression he is a successful artist. Boyfriend Johnny Prince pressures her to seduce Cross into setting her up in an apartment where he can paint. With a Philistine for a wife who threatens to burn his work Chris takes the leap. Prince takes some of Cross's work to a flea market where an art dealer is impressed and wants to promote the painter. Prince enlists Kitty to play the part. Meanwhile Chris is ripping off his employer and stealing his wife's securities. When he catches a break to escape his marriage he runs to Kitty who humiliatingly rebuffs him.Under the powerful direction of Fritz Lang Scarlet Street is smoothly paved with cynicism and callousness from end to end. One of the finest visual story tellers of the twentieth century Lang peppers the viewer with revealing compositions of a hypocritical society where corruption vanquishes virtue. The main complaint about Cross's art is that it lacks perspective which mirrors his situation in affairs of the heart. It also extends itself to the abused Kitty and self absorbed Prince. As Cross this may be Edward G. Robinson's finest performance. As circumstances transition him from milk toast to monster Robinson evokes all levels of convincing emotion in a mid- life crisis that reaches operatic heights. Joan Bennett's Kitty is a lazy beauty (she won't get up to fix a skipping record ) who uses it to cruel advantage where it is graphically summed up by Lang in a scene where she has Chris paint her toenails. Dumb as dirt she does however buffalo an art critic in another sly Lang commentary by reciting verbatim Chris's explanation of craft while looking very easy on the eyes. Duryea's Johnny is all ego as he ineptly attempts to pull off one far fetched con after another. He is so serpentine that even in the face of wrongful execution you find it hard to sympathize with his plight.Lang does an excellent job at manipulating audience emotion with his amoral cast of shortsighted characters and in the situation they find themselves. All are trapped and doomed and he leaves little room for the viewer to root for anything beyond a murderer getting away with it. It is dark, despairing experience brilliantly executed by a master of the art form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this to check out Lang's work, but the frenetic, crazy camera angles and dark shadows parodied in Son of Frankenstein and the 1967 comedy Casino Royale are absent here, and this pretty much seemed to my eye like a conventional noir in the way it unfolds.Edward G Robinson is interesting in the role but the other two in this three-hander are stereotypes and uncharismatic, though this fact has a wonderful payoff much later on. The problem is it strains credulity too many times. Robinson picks up a woman of ill repute (it's not that obvious she's a prostitute, but perhaps I've led a sheltered life). She gets the idea that he's an artist big shot, but this wouldn't hold for more than a couple of days in reality. There are other snags that seem to owe much to the Hayes Code. It does pick up interest as it goes on, as there are a couple of twists, but so does the level of unbelievability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Fritz Lang Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film ranks right up there as a serious foray by Hollywood into the world of mature men, prostitutes and their pimps with no holds barred. The seedy underbelly exposed, an abusive pimp, and a girl who'd do anything for him. Further from Pretty Woman, one can't get. And far ahead of its time in 1945.As it is Fritz Lang's film, the screenplay and direction are tight, each frame important, the scenes of New York realistic and the dead dull life of the 'stooge' portrayed by Edgar G. Robinson in one of his finest roles. Joan Bennett is a marvel as the girl with ne'er a heart of gold in sight as she views her prey as a piggy bank and methodically strips everything of value from him.Dan Duryea plays the man one loves to hate - her slimy,seedy, slippery, abusive pimp who peels cash, jewellery and dignity from her as if she were a banana.The plot twists and turns and one never knows where it's all going, the final twenty minutes are a complete shock, in the best noir style and the last scene reminded me of that one in the Pawnbroker, the oblivious city swirling around a devastated soul. Gut wrenching.Recommended. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christopher Cross, in middle aged, and in a life going nowhere and devoid of love and inspiration. Till one evening he rescues Kitty March from a mugger, it's the start of a relationship that has far reaching consequences for them, and those closest to them.The previous year director Fritz Lang had made The Woman In The Window, a film that was hugely popular with critics and fans alike. Here he reunites from that excellent film with Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea, the result being what can arguably be described as one of the best exponents of Film Noir's dark sensibilities. Adapting from works by André Mouézy-Éon and Georges de La Fouchardi?re (novel and play), this story of desperate love and greedy deceit had already had a big screen adaptation from Jean Renoir in 1931 as La chienne, which appropriately enough translates as The Bitch! Now there's a Noir title if ever there was one! What Lang does with this adaptation is drip his own expressionism all over it, whilst crucially he doesn't ease off from the harsher aspects of the story. This is nasty, cruel stuff, and with Lang at the time feeling a bit abused and used by the studio system he was slave to, who better to darkly cloak a sordid story with a biting edge? Is it purely coincidence that Lang took on this film about a struggling artist who's vision is stifled by another? Possibly not one is inclined to feel.Edward G. Robinson is fabulous as the pathetic Chris Cross. Married to a wife who constantly heckles and belittles him (Rosalind Ivan), Robinson's take on Cross garners empathy by the shed load, so much so that once Kitty (Bennett) and her beau, Johnny Prince (Duryea), start to scheme a scam on Chris, the audience are feeling as desperate as Cross was himself at the start of the movie. Few noir guys have so meekly fell under a femme fatale's spell as the way Cross does for Kitty here. But such is Lang's atmospherics, you not only sense that it's going to go bad, you expect it to, and naturally Robinson is just the man to punch us in the guts with added impetus. Bennett and Duryea are very convincing, almost spitefully enjoying taking the hapless Robinson character for everything they can, and the visuals, especially during the bleak, shadowy last couple of reels, cap the mood perfectly.This film is in truth probably saying more about its director than anything else that he made. And in fact it was said to be one of his all time favourites. That's nice to find out because it finds him on particularly good, and yes, devilish form. Grim, brilliant and essential film noir. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edward G. Robinson plays Christopher Cross a mild-mannered bank cashier. He's married to a mean vicious woman. One night he saves beautiful Katharine March (Joan Bennett) from being beaten up. They got out for drinks after and he lies to her and tells her he's a famous painter. He's fallen in love with her so she decides to use that against him and take him for everything he's got. She plans it all with her slimy boyfriend Johnny (Dan Duryea). Things get complicated and it all ends on a very negative and bleak note.Easily one of the darkest film noirs of the 1940s and one of the best. Well-directed and acted by almost everybody. The script is full of sharp dialogue and many twists and turns. Also it suggests strongly that March is a prostitute but doesn't come right out and say it. As it was this was banned outright is some parts of the US (which is ridiculous). The only negative thing here is Duryea. He plays his part WAY too broadly. He seems to act like he's in a comedy and not a drama. Still it's well worth catching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:This is my favorite of all of Edward G. Robinson's roles. It took bravery to play a lowly bank clerk completely subjugated to his wife. We have constant scenes of her berating him with the picture of her first husband openly displayed for existential contrast which she does incessantly. He rescues a prostitute who worships her abusive pimp boyfriend. Robinson paints as a hobby completely oblivious to its monetary value. Well, you can guess what the prostitute and the pimp decide to do with this one. Robinson's role, for the bulk of the movie, is so self-effacing and humiliating while providing the moral basis for what comes later, it shows you the actor the man was. Bennett and Duryea are both excellent in not exactly typical roles for 1940's movies. Lang always returns to this theme as in Secret Behind The Door. The monster inside of seemingly ordinary 'civilized' people. The transformation is quite sudden here; there is a growing suspicion in Robinson's mind which crescendos with one of his paintings being spotted in a art dealer's window. Even here, Bennett deftly manipulates him despite when he discovers that she is signing his paintings. His adoration of a woman way above his physical appearance's station is the key to understanding the obsession. Indeed, spend some time with his wife and the fixation becomes quite believable.Lang has a moral quandary on his hands given the Code of the day. The cruel murder of Bennett is off-screen. He then frames the pimp for the murder. Here is where Lang twists the film so cleverly. It starts so well showing a ride with Robinson listening to two cops discussing crime. One of them says the ones that didn't get caught are the real losers for their consciences will torment them forever. Sure enough, the movie crosses out of an empirical Noir and adds supernatural touches of the two of them haunting him to insanity. This has always been the point of attack upon this film; admittedly, it is quite a break from traditional Noir. Yet, it gives the movie its unique, dark status as one of the bleakest of all Noirs even Kiss Of Death which doesn't exactly end well. There, Mature pays with his life for the protection of his loved ones. Here, the Code had to be met without making the usual hackneyed: cops are prescient, omniscient geniuses which is so typical in bad Noir. I recommend it to you as a singular Noir that will stay with you for quite a while. The blending of Noir with a supernatural Twilight Zone type ending gives it a needed darkness. Of course, sociologically, you get Big Brother's point, don't you? Even if you get away with it, 'they' will come to haunt you. I know, like many movies try not to notice the Oligarch's hidden mind control. I love it for it shows, as did the classic science fiction Forbidden Planet, the darkness within all human souls despite however ostensibly 'civilized' or in this case: milquetoast. Robinson is so mild mannered, beaten down, manipulated and spun about, his snapping is so much more to Lang's point. The performances are excellent even the bank manager who is equally stunned to find Robinson as the embezzler funding Bennett with bank funds.

Director Lang, truly makes the film one of the most depressing shocking pieces of cinema that has to be seen, most people don't really want to see a movie that not going to have a happy ending, but seeing this film will be worth it.

		<fullReview>I would say not by much. Fritz Lang's Scarlet Street is honestly my favorite film of his: not only is it well made, it's just brutal in its view of humanity and fate.Edward G. Robinson makes Chris Cross one of the most pathetic noir protagonists: weak-willed and timid, he yearns for an existence better than his own, where he can quit his boring day job and paint his modernist works for a living. Trapped in a sexless and emotionally abusive marriage of convenience, he wants to be with young and lovely Kitty (played with pure venom by Joan Bennett), who unbeknownst to him is a prostitute in a sadomasochistic relationship with Johnny Prince (Dan Duryea, one of the great cinematic sleazes), who may or may not be her pimp as well. His chance encounter with her and her pimp's plot to fleece Chris for all he's worth leads to the darkest and grimmest of noir endings, where Chris cannot even end his own life to escape his misery.Definitely not a film if you want a pick me up, but it is a masterpiece. Equally expressionistic and naturalist (as in the naturalism of Stephen Crane or Jack London, with the idea of man as powerless before fate and/or his own environment), it is a riveting watch.</fullReview>

For a good part of this film it had more of romance drama type of feel. The scenes were bright and cheery, something very unusual in a regular film noir. That is until the climax of the film where it fully jumped to a creepy almost horror like feel. There were noticeably more night scenes and shadowy sets noticeably crammed into the ending. What didn't work for me in this film is the main character, and thats disappointing because of how big of an effect that role can have. Many other aspects worked and the story was beautifully designed but the main character pulled this film down so much.

		<shortDescription>Black Humourless plot of "The Rebel" (1960)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If any US readers have seen the British film "The Rebel"(1960) starring the late (d.1968 see IMDb.com) comedian Tony Hancock, it concerns itself with the latter stealing the work of an artistic genius who cannot make a name for himself, then Hancock passing off the work of his friend as his own.Surreally, I thought about this plot while seeing "Scarlet Street"(1945).It is of course the companion film to "The Lady in the Window" (1944) with the same leading cast which I saw tonight back to back.I wonder if "The Rebel" scriptwriter had seen this Fritz Lang film before writing the comedy plot? In view of the moral code in Hollywood which among other things decreed that villains always had to get their just deserts before the film end; I was fully expecting Edward G. to end up getting arrested then condemned at the film end.How refreshing then to have an unpredictable ending in a film noir for a change.You could argue that Edward G. was lucky at the end to have his freedom as a tramp to pursue his artistic inclinations without the constant malign presence of his harridan of a wife.The prevailing moral code could not allow the script to state that Joan Bennett was a prostitute (although we see no evidence of her customers) - she gets away with just saying she was an "actress" and explains "..but the show closed tonight", leaving viewers to draw the necessary but unspoken conclusions.I wonder whether Fritz Lang was a capital punishment abolitionist as he skilfully shows a worthless pimp being executed as a result of testimonies under oath from witnesses giving mainly circumstantial evidence.We all know the main argument for abolition is that if the eventual truth comes to light, it too late to make redress to the executed felon.On the other hand a more brutal opinion is that Dan Duryea &amp; Joan Bennett both got the fate they so richly deserved.Of the two companion films, I enjoyed "Scarlet Street" the better awarding it 7/10, probably because I am a bit of an artist myself and felt a certain degree of sympathy for Edward G.!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Let the Leaches into the Blood Bank</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a movie to see if you're feeling depressed. The final scenes are about as dismal as 40's noir gets. But then the Nichols screenplay has to compensate for letting a murderer off the legal hook and sending an innocent man to the chair. That's a really heavy load for a law-and-order decade. Of course, Duryea and Bennett are only innocent in the narrow legal sense. In the moral universe, they're a couple of real bottom-feeders, deserving (in my view, at least) of everything they get. They fasten onto the hapless little bookkeeper (Robinson) like twin leaches at a blood bank convention.True, the meek Robinson and the shrewish wife (Ivan) come close to caricatures as do Duryea and Bennett, but who cares since their interplay is so compelling. Get a load of all the sneaky innuendo between the pimp and his streetwalking lady. Of course, rules of the day wouldn't allow movies to get sexually explicit, so skirting the edges had to do. Here it's piled on more than usual. Clearly, Bennett's seductive blood-sucker enjoys getting slapped around, while Duryea's preening peacock enjoys dishing it out. Between them, they're not exactly Jack and Jill.Making the bookkeeper a closet artist was a masterstroke. It suggests that beneath the homeliest, meekest exterior may lurk real suppressed talent. Robinson expresses his gift under cover, in the bathroom, because he has no other place to call his own. He even cringes when his tyrannical wife walks into the room. In fact, he acts like a dour little servant both at home and at work. Speaking of work, note that great opening scene that defines Robinson's world. The boss doesn't even walk over to present him with his reward for 25-years of service. Instead, the bullfrog egotist passes the watch down the banquet line, bragging about his judgement the whole time. And when the bigshot sneaks into the limousine with his silken mistress (also a master touch), you can almost feel the little bookkeeper's shrunken world get heavier.No wonder he gloms onto the glamorous but devious Bennett after he "rescues" her. It's his one big chance for the kind of romantic escape he could only dream of. So what if he knows she's not really sincere. He still gets to dream dreams that no longer seem totally impossible. Meanwhile, she sells his artwork claiming it as her own, while he's even too self-effacing to care. It's hard at times to know whether he's more pathetic than sympathetic-- note the cage in which he slaves away all work day. Either way, the Robinson character amounts to an unforgettable study in repressed emotion. And when he finally gets to release all that back-up, we may think there is in fact such a thing as emotional justice.This is a Duryea showcase. Seldom has he been more oily or loathsome. His scenes with Bennett are like trying to decide between cancer and starvation. There's been no one quite like him before or since. Bennett too is excellent, just the right blend of brass and perfume. Note how she sprawls around in seductive poses-- no wonder Duryea labels her Lazy Legs. However, Charles Kemper appears to have wandered in from a WC Fields movie. His grasp of the missing-cop-husband role can't seem to decide between smirks and menace-- where was director Lang on this one. Nonetheless, this is big-time noir, a crushing portrait of moral corruption, from a master of the breed. So don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the best movies I have seen all through out Cinema history. It had me on the edge of my seat from the first frame to the last.Brilliant direction by Fritz Lang who times and measures every nuance and emotion of this movie like a master conductor.The cast are equally brilliant with Edward G Robinson taking us through this journey like a close and trusted friend.The timing and pace of the movie is a work of art and genius. This is extremely rare to get all the elements so right in a movie. And Fritz Lang has done it.This is an all time classic that stands the test of time. A Truly great masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Banned In New York State</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film produced &amp; directed by Fritz Lang is a fine story carefully crafted with a fine cast into a very good story. Edward G Robinson is great in his role as a henpecked bank cashier who is also a painter. He steals money from his employer in order to romance Joan Bennett in one of her early roles as a brunette.Robinson is married to Estelle whose husband was a cop who died on duty falling in the river. This marriage is not made in heaven. When the missing husband shows up, he makes sure Estelle gets him back so he can get out of this disaster.Bennett's character has a cad of a boy friend she is in love with named Johnny. It is hard to have any sympathy for Johnny as he is one of the most parasitic men ever put on film. A drunk who never works and always is taking money from Bennett.This film has a complicated plot in which no one winds up happy. What is interesting is the film was banned in New York State because it depicts an ice pick murder when Robinson finds out the truth about Bennett &amp; Johnny. This might be one of Robinson's mildest character film roles yet it gets banned? Go figure this one out, it just shows New York and several cities which banned this film too were already dysfunctional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based upon Jean Renoir's La chienne, Fritz Lang's film tells the story of a retired bank cashier (Edward G. Robinson) with a shrewish wife (Rosalind Ivan) that meets a young lady (Joan Bennett) by accident and is smitten.Reminiscent of Night and the City, Dan Duryea is a loser with big ideas, and tries to get his girlfriend (Bennett) to worm a few thousand from Robinson.While she is sucking money from Robinson, he comes up with an idea to make more money. Just like Night and the City, things go sour, someone is killed, and Robinson finds out that it is better for a judge to give you the works, than to give it to yourself.The ending is just too sweet.

		<fullReview>It's really good but don't watch if you are prone to the blues because it just gets worse and worse for the poor guy. Every choice he makes in life only leads to more misery. He can't even manage to kill himself or get anyone to do it for him. He is utterly doomed. The acting is excellent, and I believe that a man who had tried to do the right thing all his life would feel overwhelming guilt because of his descent into evil. Was he victimized? I don't think so. It was his own decisions that got him to where he was. And in the end, that was guilt and shame inducing. There's nothing harder than knowing you destroyed your own life. As I see it, he decided not to pursue art and went into accounting. He decided to be a little gray person. He decided to be deluded by the only woman whom he felt would marry him. He set his sights in life extremely low. Then when he decided to do something radical, he messed that up, too. The only thing he succeeded in doing, in an uncharacteristic spurt of confidence, was arrange for his wife to see her first husband was still alive. Perhaps he carried that off because he was starting to feel more confident and secure with his paintings and his delusional secret life. I guess there's a lesson in all this. I'd say that lesson is to be true to yourself. And if you are honest with yourself, you probably won't be so easily fooled by others. If he had only believed in his artistic talent, in himself, none of this would have happened. Well, now, I'm depressed. I think I'll go watch a comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware The Third Light</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's remake of Jean Renoir's "La Chienne" gives a depressing account of how a lonely man who lives an extremely drab life gets involved in circumstances which lead to his life becoming infinitely worse! His problems begin shortly after he chooses to ignore the old superstition about the third light from a match bringing bad luck. After his boss lights his own cigar and then a colleague's, he asks Christopher Cross (Edward G Robinson) whether he's superstitious. Chris replies that he isn't, crosses his fingers and then accepts the third light.After attending a dinner to celebrate his 25 years in employment as a cashier, Chris is walking home alone when he sees a violent struggle between a man and a woman on the other side of the street. He intervenes, the man runs away and he and the woman, Kitty March (Joan Bennett) have a drink together. This meeting leads to others during which Kitty, who is a street walker, convinces gullible Chris that she's an actress and that she's short of money. When Chris talks about his love of art and painting, she mistakenly assumes that he's wealthy and she and Johnny (Dan Duryea), who is her abusive boyfriend and pimp, manipulate him into renting an expensive studio where Kitty can live and he can enjoy his painting.Chris is in a miserable marriage with a woman who nags him relentlessly and compares him unfavourably to her late, first husband and having been duped by Kitty into thinking that she has a romantic interest in him; Chris borrows money from his boss to pay for the studio. At the studio, he is introduced to Johnny who Kitty says is her friend's boyfriend and after having brought some of his paintings to be stored there; he starts to work on a new portrait of Kitty. When Kitty wants more money, he starts to steal from his employer.Johnny, who is also a con artist, passes some of Chris' work off as having been painted by Kitty and they start to achieve some success. When Chris discovers what's happened, Kitty acts very upset and tells him that she only sold them because she was in desperate need of the money. After he meets his wife's first husband who'd faked his death, Chris takes the opportunity to ensure that his ploy is exposed as this conveniently means that his marriage is no longer valid. Chris is elated by this development and proposes to Kitty who cruelly ridicules him. Chris' violent reaction to this seals the fates of Kitty, Johnny and himself."Scarlet Street" is often compared to "The Woman In The Window" because of the many similarities between the two movies. Apart from sharing the same director and three leading stars (Robinson, Bennett and Duryea), they both tell stories of what happens when a respectable middle aged man goes off the rails. Portraits and gallery windows also figure prominently in both tales. "Scarlet Street" is, however, far bleaker and more pessimistic than its predecessor and its characters are more unsympathetic and manipulative. Kitty and Johnny are despicable and depraved and their treatment of Chris is deplorable and cruel. Having said this, the fact remains that their ultimate fates are both extremely brutal and grossly unjust. Similarly, Chris who is the victim of some atrocious treatment degenerates from mundane respectability to embezzlement, murder, deception, perjury, mental breakdown and destitution. Rarely can any story have descended into such a grim and desperate outcome from a scenario which was itself so dreadful from the start.Milton R Krasner's dark, shadowy cinematography and the recurrent strains of Ernie Burnett's "Melancholy Baby" together complement the mood of this film perfectly and the performances by Robinson, Bennett and Duryea are all consistently strong. "Scarlet Street" remains a great movie which is both thoroughly absorbing and totally uncompromising.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mona Lisa Without the Smile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lowly cashier Edward G. Robinson (as Christopher "Chris" Cross) receives the nominal company gift of an engraved watch, for 25 years of faithful service. Slightly tipsy, Mr. Robinson leaves to look for the New York City subway. On a Greenwich Village street, he sees beautiful Joan Bennett (as Katherine "Kitty" March) being slapped around, and thrown to the ground, by boyfriend Dan Duryea (as Johnny Prince). Robinson rescues Ms. Bennett, and Mr. Duryea flees. Unhappily married, Robinson is enthralled with shapely, sexy Bennett, and succumbs to her request for a drink. Bennett suspects the older, unattractive Robinson is a wealthy artist; she decides to use his obvious interest to her advantage.Director Fritz Lang's brilliant, daring, and imaginative follow-up to "The Woman in the Window"; "Scarlet Street" is one of its genre's crowning achievements. Bennett's nasty, spitting "Kitty" is a sleazy, amoral classic; if the part weren't so unflattering, she could have won a "Best Actress" award. Somewhat less underrated, Robinson masterfully manages his mild-mannered role; certainly, he deserved "Best Actor" consideration. Always convincing in "tough" roles, Robinson is especially believable as the apron-clad "Chris Cross". Bennett and Robinson formed a striking screen partnership, under Lang's direction.Their characterizations are beautifully summed up when Bennett, likely a lazy prostitute, orders aspiring painter Robinson to paint her toenails. At home, Robinson is forced to paint his pictures in the bathroom; he sees beauty in a flower on the sink; and, you'll see the clear outline of his toilet bowl, in the lower right of your screen. Dudley Nichols' screenplay (of the original "La Chienne") cleverly plays within, and stretches the limits of, mainstream motion picture standards. Duryea, Margaret Lindsay (as Millie), and shrewish Rosalind Ivan (as Adele) are the best supporting players.See "Scarlet Street" once for the story, and twice for the art. ********** Scarlet Street (1945) Fritz Lang ~ Edward G.

		<shortDescription>"Scarlet Street" is vintage Lang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scarlet Street" (1945, Fritz Lang) Edward G. Robinson and Joan Bennett reteam with Fritz Lang in 1945's Scarlet Street to create a noir-ish Greenwich Village complete with chirascuro, the love wounded anti-hero, a would-be hooker, and a slick playboy part-time pimp. The latter description goes to the great character actor Dan Duryea (also in Lang's previous film with the aforementioned duo in The Woman in the Window). There are many scenes that shine for their intimate detail in setting, text, and shot. The lighting is so awesome you can feel the intensity of the scene. Lang didn't leave much undetailed! The story revolves around the three characters of Criss Cross, Lazy Legs, and Johnny. Guess who's who. I always get a kick that Lang chooses the bad boy of so many movies past (notably Little Ceasar) to be a man who in one scene is shot in a woman's ruffled apron with a kitchen knife (from cutting liver) pointed at his terrific nag of wife who rushes into the kitchen to confront him, again. Dan Duryea can play the ultimate scumbag with such ease, you'd think he really was one in real life.Fritz Lang made 24 American films in 21 years and Scarlet Street was his 12th. It would also be Joan Bennett's fourth of five turns under Lang. Scarlet Street is a great example of a well-crafted studio made film noir. Lang claimed that this film contained the first murder of an innocent person!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scarlett Street" is a neat film noire mystery from director Fritz Lang. Its another of those "spider and the fly" type stories where the helpless male is drawn into a relationship with a predatory woman.The film opens at a dinner honoring the middle aged Christopher Cross' (Edward G. Robinson) 25th anniversary with the firm run by J.J. Hogarth (Russell Hicks). When the Cross sees his boss leave the party for a gorgeous young blonde, Cross begins to reflect on his own situation. The meek and henpecked husband of a nagging wife Adele (Rosalind Ivan), he finds his only pleasure in his paintings and dreams of one day too finding love with a younger woman.On the way home from the party, Cross happens upon a young woman, Kitty March (Joan Bennett) being beaten by an unknown assailant. Cross rescues her and becomes friendly with the young woman. Later Kitty's sleazy boyfriend (who else but Dan Duryea) see an opportunity to make money off Cross whom they believe to be rich.In order to get the money he needs, Cross is forced to steal first from his wife and later from his company. He sets Kitty up in a fancy apartment and moves his paintings there. Meanwhile Kitty and Johnny hatch a plan to try and sell Cross' paintings under her signature. The paintings unexpectedly are sold and Kitty begins to gain fame as the artist.Cross in the meantime, has managed to get free of his marriage and hopes to move in with Kitty. But then he walks in on Kitty and Johnny and.............................................Lang gives us all the elements of 40s film noire..the hapless sap unable to resist the charms of the "femme fatale", the no good boyfriend, several unexpected plot twists as well as, the usual staples of dark shadows, night scenes and rain soaked streets. It has an excellent script that keeps you guessing all the way.Robinson is superb as Cross the doomed hero. He was a much better actor than he was ever given credit for and this remains one of his greatest performances. Joan Bennett is seductive as the "femme fatale" who gradually draws Robinson into her web of deceit. Dan Duryea, everyone's favorite cad, is excellent as the no account boyfriend. Others of note in the cast include Margaret Lindsay as Kitty's friend, as well as Charles Kemper and Samuel S. Hinds.The same director and three stars had collaborated on the equally excellent "Woman In the Window" the previous year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scarlet Street directed by Fritz Lang in 1945 is another example of a dramatic film noir. This movie (like many others) has that "post war" feel about it. There are many brilliant uses by the director in this film. His use of lighting, and camera angles really help tie the movie together. Nothing is too choppy or out of place. The whole movie just flows together. The real meaning in this movie about how nothing is really as it seems is a great lesson for any audience member. Especially in the time these movies were coming out. The end of the great depression, and America moving toward a better future is a real key background component to this movie.</fullReview>

He was a little plain in comparison for how big the movie should have been. Some of the things felt a bit forced, like with the sudden plot twist at the end. It's certain different from your average film noir with a little more than often cute and happy moments, but that gets shot down, especially near the end. I'm one for sad/messed up plots, and the cast did move me a little, even if it was in a negative way where I wanted to yell at the main protagonist for messing around with someone he shouldn't have really been doing so to begin with. Being an artist myself, you definitely....need to use your head more. I'd like to see some sort of a remake with this, in a much better/well done light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meek cashier and aspiring painter Christopher Cross (Edward G. Robinson) falls in love with a younger woman named Kitty (Joan Bennett). Kitty's got an abusive boyfriend named Johnny (Dan Duryea) she's crazy about. Instead of being jealous about Cross' intentions towards his girl, Johnny encourages it. He's hoping to use Kitty to fleece the old guy of all his money. Nice film noir with comic touches that reunites the director and two stars of Woman in the Window. While not as great as that film, it's still pretty good. Lang's direction is superb. I especially loved the finale. Robinson gives another amazing performance in a career full of them. As I rewatch many of his films lately he is rising to the top of my "most underrated actors ever" list. Bennett and Duryea breathe life into characters that move effortlessly between amusing and repulsive. Throughout the film they often seem like buffoons there to provide comic relief, only to have their darker sides come out and remind you these are not nice people. The wonderful and lovely Margaret Lindsay appears as Kitty's roommate. She's a treat in all of her scenes. Also Rosalind Ivan plays Cross' henpecking wife. She's very funny, as is the subplot involving her first husband. It's an entertaining picture. Probably not what you would expect as it has some lighter moments which is uncharacteristic of a film noir. But it works well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fritz Lang at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to say that I personally find Scarlet Street to be Fritz Lang's greatest achievement in his Hollywood-based era of movie making. Not only because it endorses the pure magnificence of the noir genre, but also presents a strikingly deep insight into the mind of a depressed aging man. It is in a few aspects similar to his one year older masterpiece The Woman in the Window, but the personal drama and shocking rupture of a certain relationship is still much more powerful. What amazed me the most is the previously mentioned emphasis on the characteristics of Christopher Cross, the protagonist, who is married to a woman he does not love one bit, and in the meantime is desperately trying to charm and 'seduce' the beautiful and utterly deceitful Kitty. He lies to please her, begs for her love, asks her to marry him (it happened so many times that I actually stopped counting) and in the end what did he get? Well, you have to find for yourselves, but I can tell you for sure - It really was not worth the sacrifice. Yet, in the end, I was not truly sorry for what had happened to the old man. If you blindly trust a pretty lady (running around with a strange fellow), you simply deserve what is coming to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Asks the audience to stretch their imaginations a lot, but overall an effective film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scarlet Street" at times is a very far fetched film. Its only that the main character of Christopher Cross (Edward G. Robinson) is such a sap and constantly allows people to take advantage of him, usually with him not knowing it, that the film stretches credibility. Basically no intelligent human being would put themselves through the humiliation this character endures. Its almost over-the-top at times it becomes distracting. Fortunately, most of the rest of the film is very well done indeed. Even though the story itself asks the audience to stretch their imaginations a bit too much, it is affectively gloomy and a nice little slice of existentialism. Its got the film noir philosophy in spades.The direction by Fritz Lang isn't his finest work. He has good command of camera and the actors, but his sense of pacing (at least until the final half hour) is mostly off. The acting across the board however is superb. Even though his character isn't believable, Edward G. Robinson is fantastic as the poor sap, gaining much audience sympathy. Joan Bennett plays one of the most unlikable femme fatales ever, almost rivaling Ann Savage in "Detour" for pure evil. Dan Duryea is also despicable as the fast-talking con man, but both him and Bennett get their parts right. Overall, despite flaws, "Scarlett Street" is an effective film noir. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another dark morality tale from Fritz Lang, re-engaging the services of Edward G Robinson, Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea from the earlier, superb "The Woman in The Window". Again, it's Robinson's lot to dream dangerously, as he succumbs all too easily to the put-on charms of cheap hoodlum's moll, Joan Bennett, after a chance encounter in the street where Robinson ironically rescues her from a beating by said hoodlum, her flashy but violent boyfriend, played again with panache (and bang, wallop!) by the underrated Duryea. Although less visually striking than the for me, superior "T.W.I.T.W.", nevertheless we are taken more deeply into Robinson's motivations; besides the obvious lust for a younger attractive girl and his envy of his philandering boss, he is egged on by a particularly harridan-ish wife and the under-appreciation of his latent artistic talent, to end up not only destroying the thing he loves (with an ice-pick no less) and then ultimately himself as his tortured conscience drives him to attempted suicide and a haunted vagabond existence when he botches his own hanging. Robinson is wonderful, not too proud to don an apron to demonstrate his servility to his witch of a wife en route to his descent into paranoia. Bennett too is fine, using her very obvious charms to arouse then ensnare and finally completely humiliate her meek prey. Some of the plot devices are however altogether too fanciful (Robinson's nascent artistic genius, in fact poorly served by some pretty awful paintings in the film and the third-reel reappearance of Robinson's wife's previously presumed drowned first husband which stretches even film-noir pulp-fiction too far in my estimation) but all is pretty much retrieved by the darker than ebony conclusion, with haunting images of Robinson's descent into madness and penury, after he brutally murders Bennett and then allows Duryea to go to the chair for a murder he didn't commit. Lang works his dark themes excellently and even though my viewing pleasure was spoiled somewhat by a poor quality DVD copy, no-one did noir better than he, in my humble opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another of Fritz Lang's atmosphere-laden Hollywood film noirs,SCARLET STREET is somewhat less suspenseful and gripping than the superb WOMAN IN THE WINDOW made the previous year with the same actors (Edward G.Robinson,Joan Bennett,Dan Duryea) and technical crew,but is nevertheless solidly compelling throughout.Robinson gives an outstanding performance as the ordinary middle-aged bank clerk trapped in a loveless marriage (with the malevolent Rosalind Ivan),whose only solace is through painting,until he meets the seductive prostitute Miss Bennett.She is of course,manipulating the besotted Robinson for every penny she can muster,with help from her relentless pimp(Duryea). The strict Hollywood censorship of the time meant that spades couldn't be called spades,but it is pretty obvious thanks to Lang's clever handling exactly what kind of amorality is present.Robinson,one of the most gifted actors of Hollywood's golden age,was criminally never nominated for an Oscar during a lifetime of faultless performances (LITTLE CAESAR,DOUBLE INDEMNITY,THE CINCINNATI KID,etc.),and was only awarded an honorary Academy Award shortly after his death in 1973.His performance as the downtrodden,hopelessly misguided individual exploited to the point of killing has considerable depth and pathos,and he is closely matched by Bennett and Duryea as the seedy low-lifes more than willing to exploit his vulnerability.This sort of story and characters was meat and drink to Lang,and indeed the Film Noir genre,and he predictably does a first-class job with the material at hand,though the gloominess and relatively methodical pace at times is a little wearisome.The ending,though,seeing a dissipated Edward.G suffer remorse and guilt over his brutal killing of Miss Bennett (in which Duryea is found guilty and executed) is decidedly offbeat,both for this period in US film,and even by contemporary standards,and is hauntingly memorable.SCARLET STREET is consistently a notable example of 1940's Hollywood Film Noir by one of it's acknowledged directorial masters.RATING:7 and a half out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Lang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a disturbing movie, in many ways. Edward G. Robinson, who is superb, is a pipsqueak in a trivial job. He's married to an absolute virago and retreats from his relative career failure and his unhappy home life through his painting. Joan Bennett, also very good, humiliates him further and steals his creative name as well. Dan Duryea is sublimely creepy as her boyfriend.It's hard to like anyone here -- even Robinson's character. Feeling sorry for someone is not the same as being moved by him.It's gorgeously filmed and has a fine script. I have to say that I prefer Renoir's "La Chienne," on which it is a variation. Both are good movies and in some ways there is no real point comparing them. For example, in some ways "They Live By Night" is a uniquely beautiful movie. In other ways, Robert Altman's take on that same story, "Thieves Like Us," is more immediate and gripping, though less heartbreaking.See the Renoir and the Lang. Lang was later to remake another Renoir movie, with disastrous results: "Human Desire." "Scarlet Street" is a very fine movie on its own.Joan Bennett's career is a a kind of fascinating post script. In this, and in Lang's "Woman In The Window," she is glamorous and evil. Only a few years later, she appeared in two other movies related to one another, in diametrically different casting: "Father off the Bride" and "Father's Little Dividend." The symbolism is obvious, even broad, but I love the organ-grinder and his monkey at the movie's opening. When I was a small child living in Greenwich Village, where I still live and where the movie is set, I remember seeing them on the sidewalks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS* This is the telling of a really sad story. Lang has done a great job directing this one. Excellent acting, beautiful photography, interesting storyline. Yet I think that certain aspects of the story should be emphasized or explained, such as Chris's reaction to his separation from his wife (he seems to have made the decision to send her husband back to her quite blithely and he never seems to regret having given her up after he murdered Kitty) or Johnny's behaviour after his arrest (if he is such a clever guy, then why did he keep swearing and saying incriminating things against him when he got arrested and during trial?). These set aside, this is a movie worth watching. One of the best I've seen so far from that era.7</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarlet Street - My Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a very bad-tempered film. I wasn't a huge fan, personally. It felt like they kept throwing the main lead under the bus when he did nothing wrong, but then again he was terribly naive and the whole time everything was just a massive mess without a good ending. It wasn't the best of stories or scenarios.It never seemed like the ending would end up the way it did, either. It felt so random. It was all about art and getting money and love affairs, and it ends like that? It doesn't make sense to me. I did not care for the plot of the film for the way it handled the characters or their development or lack thereof. If anything they didn't change at all, and it only focused on the negativity and the deceit rather than how they characters responded to it. Sure Kitty and Johnny had a lot of interaction but there was nothing substantial to them. That and the plot holes are enormous; how did the two know Chris was going to come to the rescue when he did? How did the police know who and when the killers were located/were? Those were major key points in the plot and they are easily debunked.Overall, not as good as I would have hoped. The photography isn't as good either, and there was nothing particularly interesting with the execution of it either. This would have made an excellent noir film if it was made better. At least in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"No one escapes punishment . . . "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . under the Hollywood censorship laws of the 1930s - 1960s. As the documentary *THIS MOVIE IS NOT YET RATED pointed out recently, the Roman Catholic Church controls America's movie ratings--then and now, just as it has dictated ALL important rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court lately (ALL the 5-4 decisions can be scored: Roman Catholics 5, the rest of us "losers" 4). Given the tight "moral" restraints, then, of living in a Theocracy (under a church which battled for centuries to burn alive anyone who said that the Earth was round and orbited the sun), SCARLET STREET is as good as it gets. Sure, the U.S. Supreme Court allows nearly ALL of the Super Rich "One Percenters" to escape ANY punishment for their myriad Crimes Against Humanity. But Edward G. Robinson's gifted, self-taught artistic genius "Chris" in SCARLET STREET is NOT a One Percenter. The reporter with him on the train to Sing Sing SHOULD have said "No peasant escapes punishment." Censors messed with SCARLET STREET more than nearly any other film in history. Someday soon CGI will allow the actual scenes as originally scripted to be recreated, restoring this story's integrity, as well as that of thousands of other films defiled by the church. But we'll need to fix our Supreme Court first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He "picked" the biggest "Ice Princess" of them all!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this follow-up to Fritz Lang's "The Woman in the Window", Edward G. Robinson and Joan Bennett were reunited for a similarly themed film noir that starts off incredible and very slowly disintegrates in front of the viewer's eyes. Robinson is a veteran store clerk receiving his 25 year service medal who wryly comments on the fact that the boss seems very happy with his tremendously younger "girlfriend". By chance that night, Robinson tipsily comes across Bennett, seemingly being mugged and beaten up, and "saves" her. She sees an easy mark, although his naiveté is almost saintly, and dives in to fleece him as fast as he dived in to save her. Things are not what they seem with this low-class broad, and unlike "The Woman in the Window", it is obvious from the start that she has no use for him other than his money, or the money she thinks he has.Robinson is married to the most vile woman who keeps throwing the memory of her first husband in his face, and he is desperately in need of some womanly affections. So it isn't long before he's set her up in a Greenwich Village apartment, storing his artwork and supplies there after a nasty row with his wife, and Bennett's abusive and extremely sleazy boyfriend (Dan Duryea) takes the opportunity to try to sell a few of his pieces. It gets attention from a buyer from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Duryea takes advantage of this to make it appear that Bennett is the artist. So far, so good. For a moment, the film goes from sleazy pulp noir trash to the elegance of the New York art world and the film is moving at a nice pace with Robinson perfect as the dumb sap, Bennett as a femme fatal equally as dangerous as Stanwyck's Phyllis in "Double Indemnity", and Duryea a total rat who has absolutely no morals. But all of a sudden, the writers throw in a wrench which in retrospect makes absolutely no sense, and this turns the train onto a track where there is no ending but the station of death.Up to the point where this happened, I was going to rank this higher than "The Woman in the Window", but that changed the minute this bizarre plot twist (involving a stranger who comes into the plot out of nowhere with no seeming purpose) which dropped it from a potential ***1/2 to a disappointing **. There are still some great things which happen towards the end, one filled with irony and a sense of moralistic purpose, but the damage has already been done by this point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Movie With A Cast Of Morally Bankrupt Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing I thought, after meeting every character in this movie, was that EVERY character was a JERK! Not since "For Love Of The Game" have I seen a movie where I couldn't stand ANYONE in the film! Now this is not to say that this isn't a very good movie...it is. What it is though is a cast of losers...from Cross to his wife to Kitty to Johnny to the re-appearing dead husband. Everyone character has no moral value whatsoever and the only redeeming characters are the store owner, Cross' boss and the non-card playing newspaperman on the train.It is this newspaperman that is the highlight of the movie. HE is the one that correctly reasons that NO MURDER GOES UNPUNISHED. He figures he would rather have a judge send him to the chair rather to live with himself. And Cross finds that out...the hard way: unable to kill himself and unable to live with himself.From personal experience I can tell you one thing: what Cross experiences in his rundown motel room after Johnny's trial IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST DEPICTION ON FILM OF WHAT LIVING WITH A MAJOR SIN IN ONE'S LIFE WITHOUT REPENTANCE IS LIKE. It should be mandatory viewing for every Bible student to grasp that invaluable painting of nights with unforgiveness in your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Exceptional Lang Thriller with Dozens of Twists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You Only Live Once" director Fritz Lang crafted another film noir masterpiece with this 1945 Edward G. Robinson &amp; Joan Bennett melodrama "Scarlet Street," with Dan Duryea. Essentially a remake of Jean Renoir's 1931 film "La Chienne," Lang's film focuses on his usual themes of crime, deceit, insanity and poetic justice. Literally, nobody is who they claim they are, and everybody swallows everybody else's lies. Worse, when the characters break down and confess the truth, nobody believes them! This delicious irony makes this Universal Pictures release a compelling but cynical movie. "Scarlet Street" doesn't have any shoot-outs, car chases, tough talking guys, or musical numbers. Indeed, it is a quiet film that simmers until it comes to a boil in its last half-hour. Nevertheless, for the patient, "Scarlet Street" qualifies as a richly rewarding experience.The narrative concerns a milquetoast bank cashier Christopher Cross (Edward G. Robinson of "Little Caesar") suffering from a mid-life crisis and a marriage of convenience who takes the plunge for Kitty (Joan Bennett of "The Woman in the Window") a lip-smacking dish in high heels. Actually, she is a prostitute. They meet late one evening after Cross leaves a party thrown in his honor by his philandering boss, abank president, J.J. Hogarth (Russell Hicks of "Seven Sinners"), who he has worked for 25 years. Hogarth gives him a 14K gold vest watch as a memento for his service. After helping one of his friends Charlie find a bus, Cross gets lost in the warren of city streets. He spots an unidentified man knocking around Kitty and drives him off with his umbrella. Ostensibly,nothing good comes out of their coincidental encounter that evolves into a May/December romance. Scenarist Dudley Nichols, who penned the screenplays for "Stagecoach" and "The Informer" for John Ford, wrote the script based on the novel and play "La Chienne" co-written by Georges De La Fouchardiere and André Mouézy-Éon, which had earlier by filmed by Jean Renoir in 1939. Nichols' screenplay is a labyrinth of twists and turns with surprises galore. Virtually everything has been artfully foreshadowed and despite the dictates of the Production Code Administration, everybody deserves what they get in the end. The dialogue is fantastic.Masquerading as a wealthy painter, Christopher strikes up an amorous relationship with Kitty, even though he is married. Of course, she sees him in a tuxedo and takes it for granted that he is really wealthy. Similarly, she tells him that she is an actress and he swallows her lie without a thought. Eventually, he winds up embezzling money from the bank where he works to keep Kitty in the lap of luxury while she and her scamming boyfriend Johnny Prince (Dan Duryea of "Winchester '73) take advantage of him. Christopher's critical, carping wife Adele Cross (Rosalind Ivan of "The Suspect") doesn't care a whit for Christopher's crummy little paintings, so he takes them to Kitty's apartment. Johnny takes Chris' painting and an art critic adores them. Meanwhile, Johnny engineers it so that an upper-class art critic believes that Kitty is the painter.As it happens, Adele spots the paintings and exposes her hen-pecked husband as a third-rate ripoff artist. It seems that Adele's first husband, a corrupt cop, Patch-Eye Higgins (Charles Kemper) abandoned Adele and she wound up marrying Christopher. Accidentally, Christopher learns that Killy has been selling his painters but allows Kitty to maintain the ruse as the real painter and paints more pictures. Christopher doesn't know that Johnny and Kitty are in cahoots, but when he discovers their skullduggery, he murders her in her own bed. Everybody believes that Johnny did it because one of Kitty's friends hear her say that Johnny was entering her apartment. Another brilliant, well-paced meditation of crime, murder and the death penalty. Not to be missed! Robinson is excellent and his comeuppance is terrific, definitely not what you'd expect from a movie made during the heyday of the Production Code. Duryea mades a great calculating villain."Scarlet Street" keeps you guessing from start to finish with some exciting surprises and white-knuckled suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fritz Lang Winner!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* SPOILER AHEAD* Another gem from one of the greatest of all directors, Fritz Lang. This is a nasty story about a poor, henpecked man who gets involved with a whore (who does not have a heart of gold) and her low-life pimp. The characterizations here are very strong from all the players but if you like them slimy and despicable, then you will love Dan Duryea as Johnny, a most unlovely person. Duryea made a film career playing parts that were either evil, cowardly, or both and was always superb. Joan Bennett gives an excellent interpretation as a hard hearted man- killer who uses Edward G Robinson to the extreme and pays the price in the end. Although the ending is somewhat softened in order to meet the censors' rule that "nobody gets away with murder", or at least "not quite gets away with it", the baddies get their come uppance and Edward G. goes off the deep end. That voice which keeps repeating "Jeepers, Johnny" drives him to distraction and onto the streets. A very satisfying foray into film noir at its best from the best, Herr Lang.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this frustrating to watch, for there was absolutely nothing cheerful about it. All the characters are so embittered or are embedded in some plot to embitter someone else, that it's hard to sit through it. The protagonist here (Robinson) is minimalized to wearing an apron in front of his simply evil wife, while he does the dishes and dreams of his "girlfriend" Kitty, who really only uses him cause she thinks he's a rich artist. Her boyfriend/pimp is always scheming to use her to get rich and is always slappin' her around, for Cat's sake. It's all so dark, cerebral and murky, that by the time it was over I thought I was Artex, sinking into the swamp of sadness. Lang totally reverses his role on capital punishment here from his masterwork of a decade earlier M. There, the sadistic child murderer is made out to be a victim by reel's end. Here, the totally justified killer is made to wander the streets forevermore, guilty of killing the two OR (and I mean OR) jealous of their eternal relationship in the afterlife. It's definately a good movie, though an immediate watching of a Capra film is required as soon as the last depressing reel is played.</fullReview>

The plot twists that follow are ingenious and the bitterly ironic story is worked out beautifully.

		<shortDescription>one of the truly bittersweet moments in the prime of film-noir, with some big doses of humor and lots of awkward tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Fritz Lang's great American films, Scarlet Street, is technically a refashioning (if not an outright remake) of La Chienne, Jean Renoir's early sound film, and it even has some echoes of the Blue Angel in its examination of an older man stripped down to his pleading essentials for an object of desire. But it's a powerful and unflinching look at the subject matter nonetheless, even as it's true entertainment; watch it with an audience and see how often the laughs pop during the scenes with Chris and Adele as she yells his ear off and he makes comments that jab right at the core of their terrible marriage. The story is painful in its simplicity, as well as complex in fabrication, so to speak: a working man, a cashier, Chris Cross (ho-ho, as it goes in film-noir in some of the names of things) is respected among his peers, as at the start he's given a party and a new watch. But he dislikes his job, prefers painting, and does it ever Sunday or whenever he can. He meets a woman by chance- he sees her getting hit while walking home from the party, and offers to take her to a diner to get her bearings (this, after telling him not to wait for the cops to come, as it was her fiancée/pimp after all, not some thug, who was hitting her). He tells her he's a painter, a famous one, and she's impressed mostly through the monetary means.Soon she tells Johnny Prince, who is as sleazy and street-smart as Kitty is conniving and needy in her own way, about this Chris guy and his artwork. Time for a hustle, he thinks, and soon she has Chris playing right out of her hand, stealing money for them even as she doesn't know this is happening. But something else happens too- he paints again (hilarious paintings, though there is "something" there as the critic characters point out), and somehow they sell well when Johnny tries to sell them off on a fluke to prove her wrong. Then *she* is made the one who painted them by Johnny to the critics. Then the story goes on, Adele's "ex" husband returns (eye-patch and all), and the relationship is discovered by Chris. So much of this is sordid and should be convoluted, but Lang is extremely intelligent in handling such material that spells of the doom of the protagonist right from the get-go. And unlike The Woman in the Window, the previous collaboration of Lang and Robinson's, this doesn't have any kind of contrived ending. Quite the opposite, it's one of the great heartbreaking endings to any film, noir or otherwise.It should be glorious what happens in the end, and it is in the most outright ironic ways possible (and humorous, seeing as how Lang shoots the 'testimonials' during the trial, all in one position with the same lighting over and over, with gaps protruding and not mattering in the slightest for the jury). Scarlet Street brings out some of the most dastardly moments in human beings to be found in the film-noir, where the 'average Joe' can be taken advantage of due to his good nature and gullibility, as well as some more complexities like a level of spite with the wife (Rosalind Ivan, by the way, is fantastic in the role, sometimes overlooked among the other main players), and the ones who are more off of the get-by-on-what-comes-around are cruel and only with bits of conscience. There is a fabulous scene where Kitty, who is rightfully uncomfortable about saying the paintings are hers, finally gives in and tells the art critic the same lines Chris fed her, "to paint is to fall in love", and then finds herself having to play into HIS hands now! Even better is when Chris, upon hearing that Kitty has been putting her name on his paintings from Adele while wearing an apron, has a knife right in his hands pointed right at Adele.It's one of those everlasting images of a man emasculated to the point of satire, yet is still profound in its realistic take on the imbalance of power in a relationship, which is an underlying theme in the film. Meanwhile, the layers of deception have rarely been this staggering in Lang's work, and through the moments of dark hilarity and odd circumstance, there's a foreboding that's all the more depressing because, really, Chris is the protagonist and in his own self-created downward spiral for an illusion that he should have, but can't by way of the real nature of Kitty (Bennett in maybe her best performance) and the transparently sneaky and devilish Johnny (Duryea, who steals his scenes, or tries to, from Bennett). It's not a stirring damnation of society like M, but on its own small-scale human level it's probably just as thought provoking. Make sure though to try and get a good print to watch, as sometimes the color/tint changes from reel to reel, albeit as Library of Congress prints. A+</fullReview>

The movie gets usual Lang characters , an average man is caught web-like in seedy nightmares of his own making and a tremendously imaginative journey into the depths of human desperation . The mild-mannered Edward G Robinson is extraordinary as a meek cashier snared by a femme fatal magnificently performed by Joan Bennett as a manipulating , predatory beauty woman . Nasty Dan Dureya with a straw-hatted completes the exceptional trio , playing perfectly an astute crook . Atmospheric cinematography with dark and shades in black and white -although also available colorized- by Milton Krasner who along with John Alton and Nicholas Musuruka are the fundamental creators of the special atmosphere of noir cinema . Hans J. Salter composed the score musical finely fitting to the sensation of menace and suggestion .

He secretly hides her away in a apartment, and uses her as his creative muse while blossoming as an artist. That's all I can say without revealing too much of the plot. I saw this film about 20 years ago, and didn't appreciate the subtle actions of the characters while I was watching it.

There are terrific twists &amp; turns and even though there were several points during the film where I knew what was coming next, that didn't spoil the enjoyment of watching it all unfold.

		<fullReview>Scarlet Street was a movie that some could say portrayed a modern day prostitute and pimp scenario, or a prostitute with a client. Kitty one of the main actresses lives a double life, she takes advantage of a "mature" gentleman Chris Cross who is a famous painter at the time in New York City. Kitty is in a relationship with an abusive significant other and just wants to be treated like a proper women. Later on in the movie Kitty reveals that she was just using Chris for his money, and he is distraught with emotion by this. Fritz Lang did a wonderful job directing by leaving you with a cliff hanger of a ending not your typical Hollywood style happy ending, but one more full of gluttony and shame. He also has a spectacular eye while character portrayal from angles and foreshadowing with the light placement. I would say this is a good movie if you enjoy classical mystery/ thriller. Also the twist of the a classical character portrayal from outfits and style to a mid 1940's movie was excellent on the directors part. I enjoyed this movie and do recommend it to others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christopher Cross, as portrayed by Edward G. Robinson, is mild-mannered, polite, and generally someone the audience can sympathize--or even identify--with. Throughout the film, I found myself cringing for him each time he was tricked into further complicating and upsetting his life.Nearly every character is infuriating this way, which speaks to the acting and the writing. It's not a typical movie about serving justice in response to unjust actions; it says more about the cruel nature of the world.In addition to that, the camera work and sets make for a really beautiful film. There was a lot of glass involved in the sets of Scarlet Street, and the cinematography made the most of it. The settings are often light-filled, beautiful, in direct contrast with the goings-on of the film (though in many ways reflective of Cross's deluded feelings of love). This puts it in a very strange place in terms of noir film, staying true to the genre in as many ways as it (generally visually) does not.At its heart, though, that is exactly what it is. Though the visuals aren't gritty, the story elements and tone certainly are. Cross is a man deceived, and then haunted. The employment of non-diegetic, internal sound to represent that haunted feeling Cross has makes the audience feel as many things as watching Cross be deceived earlier in the film.Scarlet Street is unforgettable because it's so powerful.</fullReview>

The screen was either too bright or too dark or there would just be a blob of light right in the center. It could get pretty annoying as you were watching the film. The camera work was pretty good, though. There was a lot of perspective. The shots were from a lot of different angles and characters. You could get more than one point of view during the movie which made it more interesting to watch. The acting was very good, too. All the actors played their characters very well.

		<fullReview>I didn't see anything spectacular about the lighting or camera-work in this movie. Its full of a lot of short takes and pretty normal camera angles. Scarlet Street was one of my least favorite film noirs that I watched throughout the course. It is about a man named Chris Cross who works at a bank. He is in an unhappy marriage and the only thing that seems to make him happy is painting. A girl by the name of Kitty mistakes him as a rich painter so she is nice to him in hopes of getting her hands on his fortune. Kitty's boyfriend encourages her and he also wants her to get all of his money so they can become rich. Chris also goes along with it so he has to find creative ways to get his hands on more money so Kitty wont find out that he really isn't a wealthy painter. Kitty and her boyfriend sell Chris' paintings and tell people that Kitty was the one who painted them. However, I did like the ending because it was so shocking and that's what really made it a film noir and the kind of movie that I like. Chris ended up murdering Kitty and then tried to hang himself. Kitty was known as a great artist after her death. Both Kitty and Chris' lies caught up with them in the end. I just thought it was a little slow moving at first and it took me awhile to get into it but it wasn't a bad movie in the end!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Borderline Noir with indelible Dan Duryea as a totally decadent pimp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252 {\fonttbl} {\colortbl;\red255\green255\blue255;}Viewed at Seattle Film Noir Festival, July 2008. Lang's "Scarlett Street" with Joan Bennett and Edward G. Robinson is a masterful thinking man's psychodrama but its inclusion in noir is open to question ? "SCARLET STREET" (Universal, 103 minutes) starring, Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett, and Dan Duryea is very much a companion piece to Lang's other 'darkie', "Woman in the Window", 1944, which also starred Robinson and Bennett (with Duryea in a smaller role, as well). It looks noir, it sounds noir, and it even feels a little noir, but except for that indelible Dan Duryea (whose slam-bang pimp is its main claim to noirness) it's just not "noir" enough. An excellent psychological study of a middle aged man (Robinson) stuck in a terrible marriage, who falls head over heels for a beautiful hooker with disastrous results, that yes ? a fascinating melodrama, and all that, yes, but noir it ain't and, for the following reasons ?First of all, Joan Bennet is much too classy to play a noir anti-heroine, while Edward G. is on the border ? a certain darkness in his soul, true, but basically ac classy top-drawer dramatic actor a bit too theatrical here to qualify for noir. (The ending where he goes bats and hears voices is strictly from German Expressionism, far too arty for "noir"). Secondly, the screenplay is much too brainy for a noir, (the obvious parallel for art History buffs, between Robinson, the unschooled weekend painter, and French post-impressionist "primitive" painter, Henri Rousseau), and some of Bennett's dialogue, reflecting on Edward G's weekend art work had me thinking, "Hm ? this gal must have gone to Vassar before she became a hard-boiled hooker". Bennett is indeed lovely to look at, but she's far from the ideal noir blonde-bombshell (she was, in fact, often compared to Hedy Lamar in the forties as the ultimate Brunette Beauty of the time) and, although she was a very competent actress, casting her as a hard-as- nails whore under the pimpship of Dan Duryea was definitely pushing the envelope to attract the more respectable "A" movie audience. Given the glossy Langian context she does pull it off, but you can see her acting a mile away. Duryea on the other hand doesn't act ? he's just there, in the totally decadent pimpish flesh! And, compared to the just about unknown Beverly Michaels in "Wicked Woman .. well, we'll get to that in a minute. Overall, "Scarlett Street" is a thinking man's psychodrama, and another outstanding Fritz Lang opus, but its inclusion in noir is open to question</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as Fritz Lang's German films but then again, not much is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard numerous people say that the films that Fritz Lang made in the United States just aren't as good as the films he made in Germany. After having seen this I would have to agree with that. But to be fair that would be a pretty hard act to follow. Lang's German films are amazing pieces of art. This is still a good movie just not as good as M or Metropolis. Chris Cross (Edward G Robinson) is a middle aged man who is unhappily married to his wife Adele Cross (Rosalind Ivan). One night Chris befriends a girl named Kitty March (Joan Bennett) who is under the control of her brutal boyfriend Johnny Prince (Dan Duryea). Kitty is under the false impression that Chris is rich from the avid painting that he does and Prince wants Kitty to con the seemingly naive man out of his money. Really she's a greedy person and gains Chris's trust only to eventually ruin him at the end. Even though this isn't as good as Lang's German movies it's still god. The acting here is all good. Robinson and Bennett are especially good. The only one who I find did a poor performance was Ivan, but that's only because her character was just annoying. If you are just learning about Lang and his films and you want a good place to start, I would advise that you watch M or Metropolis first. But to all of you who already are fans of Lang and you haven't seen this movie I do highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts out with a man receiving a gift and then noticing a very attractive woman. As the man leaves the party him and another man talk about the woman and how beautiful she was. In turn Christopher Cross (played by Edward G Robinson) finds Katherine "Kitty" March (played by Joan Bennett) in despair caused by an argument with her boyfriend, Johnny Prince (played by Dan Duryea).Christopher falls for Kitty on their first encounter. He fabricates a story that he is a wealthy painter that sells his portraits. He desires Kitty that he writes letters to her. Kitty's boyfriend Johnny reads the letter and comes up with a concoction plan to drain money from Christopher.Kitty thinking that Christopher is wealthy, asks him for money. Offers him the opportunity to use her place to create his paintings. All along Christopher is married but not happy.Christopher working for a bank and not being wealthy, steals money for Kitty. All while Kitty and Johnny are stealing Christophers paintings and make a big profit off of them. Kitty claims to be the painter of the portraits and becomes popular with the artist galleries. She signs her signature on the bottom of Christophers paintings. Christopher's wife, Adele questions Christopher because she sees his paintings in the gallery but with Kitty's name signed on the bottom.It comes to Christopher's attention that he is being double crossed and Kitty makes him think that she is doing it for his benefit. Christopher shortly finds out that he is not legally married to Adele so he seeks Kitty's acceptance of marriage. Kitty declines and Christopher kills her. Johnny comes home in a drunken rage and gets pinned for the murder while Christopher walks free. Free from jail but not free from destroying him mentally and emotionally. Christopher is haunted by the fact that he killed Kitty and is tortured until he is mentally broken down. The voices will forever haunt him.Christopher's raw talent of being a painter went unnoticed by himself. Lies, deception and murder were carefully written and acted out. The story line stayed on track from one scenic act to another. It showed that one should think before they act and remember that everything you do has a consequence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful story of intertwined lives and ill-fated destiny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joan Bennett plays prostitute Kitty March, a dumb, lazy dame who only gets going when batted around by her boyfriend, pimp/gambler, Johnny Prince. But this relationship has Kitty in heaven; Johnny's heavy hand with her shows the match is true love. "Jeepers Johnny, I'm crazy about you," she croons. Dan Duryea plays Johnny here and he's in fine form. No actor could put across a stinker, an insolent petty criminal with shallow manipulating charm like the tall, lanky Duryea. In comes hen-pecked, abused husband Chris Cross, played by the stellar Edward G. Robinson. Cross is a dejected, self-effacing account clerk by day, and a target of emotional assault by his virago of a wife Adele during his night hours. Adele's got him in a ruffled apron, cooking dinner and washing up afterward, all the while berating him with blow-by- blow recitations of his deficiencies. But Cross has one consolation; he paints. He produces canvases of subject matter singularly personal and idiosyncratic. He dreams of becoming a great recognized artist, his wife threatens to throw his creations into the trash. Then on a lonely dark Manhattan street corner, fate puts Kitty into Cross's life. Soon a triangle of associations form: Kitty and Johnny and Chris Cross. Johnny, ever the schemer, masterminds a plan to extort money from Cross who he is convinced is a famous artist. Kitty, of course, is set up as the bait. And of course, Kitty is strong-armed into going along with the extortion. Joan Bennett is good at portraying this woman, at bottom one of coarse nature, but one that can mimic a minimal refinement when it suits the game. With a gullible target like Cross, it's a done deal from day one. Edward G. Robinson, a talented versatile actor gives a poignantly intense performance as the na?ve, lonely man totally invested in his own fantasies. But the tragedy is not his alone. All three main players here become victims of deception. This is neither a crime drama nor being made in 1945, a prime example of the film noir genre, which reached its zenith in the post World War II years. Although some noir-ish elements exist, there are no stalwart heroes battling the forces of night evil here. Only the casualties of human vulnerability and frailty. A highly recommended film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Middle aged man in hen pecked unloving marriage becomes infatuated with a younger woman who really hates him and is out to bankrupt him due to her greed and lies and that of her secret lover. This movie is being described elsewhere as film noir. The lead actor gives a brilliant performance.For someone known to play strong gangster type parts, the role reversal here is remarkable as this part is of someone who is a loser, who is weak and who is emotionally unstable. The key plot is this story is the way the wicked younger woman manipulates the gullible older man.In my view the film ought to have concentrated solely on that issue rather than bringing in some contrived sub plots. Because of that instead of a 9, I award this:7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Met on Scarlet Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen "The Woman in the Window" and loving it, I had high expectations of this film, which also stars Robinson, Bennett and Duryea. But when I saw it years ago, I was disappointed. I saw it a few weeks ago and I was very impressed with this story about a middle-aged man who finds happiness in painting even though he doesn't really sell anything and despite the fact his wife doesn't understand him and why he needs to be painting. He meets Joan Bennett, by way of rescuing her from the unwanted attentions of a masher. A friendship ensues and, when his wife threatens to throw out his painting stuff, Joan tells him he can leave it at her place. Of course, one thing leads to another and things get out of hand. Robinson forms an obsessive, unhealthy crush on her, and it becomes obvious to the viewer that she is only using him, when we see Duryea as her real lover. **SPOILER** And, her fate is inevitable. There are only three possible endings from this, and they are all downers. A: Robinson gives himself up to the police. B: Robinson kills himself. C: Robinson does nothing but linger, exist, and wander aimlessly on as he lives despondently in his mind, lost for eternity in regret and despair. Which one happens? Find out for yourself, but you've been warned. While this is given grade A treatment and is very well made, you "leave the theater" not exactly happy. This was a huge hit at the time it came out, but not necessarily because people loved it; but because it was offensive to some important groups, which banned it from being shown in some theaters. Therefore, it made the news and was talked about. Therefore, it was a big box office. Judge for yourself and see what the talk was all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Winners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Realised at the end of WW2, this is a surprisingly downbeat movie for such a joyous period. Good old Edwarsd G Robinson plays a solid citizen with the implausible name of Chris Cross. He's a trusted nobody who's given years of sterling service to his naff job. He's also trapped in a loveless marriage to a wife who clearly has her hands on all the purse-strings. Then, one night he does the Good Samaritan bit for some tart having it rough from her abusive boyfriend. She's a good-looking floozie played by Joan Bennet. Amoral, with a sado-masochistic streak, she loves her pimpish boyfriend despite his abuse. The boyfriend is truly a cad-and-a-half played with nice sleazy edges by Dan Duryea.Crossie has a midlife crisis and is smitten by the floozie. He is also a talented artist as yet undiscovered and in need of a good publicist. This new love of his life doesn't know his true circumstances at first and thinks he's quite successful - with MONEY. She and her boyfriend hatch schemes to rip him off big-time.In due course, Chris finds out and gets so cross he brains her with an ice-pick. Evidence points to the boyfriend. He's found guilty and fried. Cross himself goes nuts.This is one of those stories about the horrendous consequences of infatuation and betrayal that we read about almost every day. I have a slight mental block because I find the complete lack of suspicion on the part of Cross a bit hard to swallow. After all, if you're jealous enough for murder, you're bound to be watchful of any other male. Still I guess love can be blind at times. There are no winners in this movie. It's a downbeat film-noir of bunny-boiling in reverse. Quite a class act, all things considered. Though not ideal viewing if your own relationship's in the doldrums. It's filmed in B&amp;W &amp; now available on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fatalism is subverted by Lang's interpretation, giving way to a lucid moral observation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SCARLET STREET is a very European movie, Lang exercised his style on a wholly European subject and human syntax, one recognizes easily the spirit of the original story; it is also that Lang truly understood it, and even renewed it, creatively, in a masterful _auctorial interpretation. Lang's SCARLET STREET oozes with an impassible though funny psychological acuity, whose soundness gets him through the temptations of ready?made fatalism. The world-view of the movie is interesting to consider. Though of course his couple of sidekicks are far surpassed by Robinson, it could be granted or at least advanced that the cast really shines. Duryea, in a role undoubtedly defining for his movie persona?that of the violent, mean, vulgar and murderous thug?gives a remarkable performance; Joan Bennett, a babe whom I don't very much like, has the verve and vitality required for her part. But it's of course Duryea who is indeed almost on a par with Robinson as far as sharpness and precision are needed; Mrs. Bennett has a more insipid routine, that of the cold bitch, nymphomaniac, lazy and vile. Lang's take on the human viciousness is, fundamentally, a heart?rending movie, though immensely funny too. Robinson plays a guy who's abused and crisscrossed by everyone; he also has the exasperating, infuriating ignorance and ingenuity of the genuine victims, eliciting both pity and despise. Robinson's character is not a Spirache Nec&#x15f;ulescu because he's much more naive and also more cultured and romantically disposed and of a creative, artistically creative nature. The nature of the leading character, Cross, the man about whom I have been talking to you, betrays somehow, on screen, his provenience in a play, in an European play, he has this European stage outlook, something a bit more authentic than what the Hollywood scenarists usually imagined; and one feels the stronger, though conventional, resorts of a stage play behind the scenario. Adele's missing husband completes the image of a deeply vicious and mean world. This world-view, this popular philosophy is of course conventional and ready?made?a popular melodrama at heart, seasoned with fatalism?but it's not the movie's last word and is in fact overthrown by Lang's interpretation, where the stream of the events evades predictability and subverts the _clichés from below?turning the movie into a bitter representation of life, within which the psychological observation is good. So we are not left with a lesson of fatalism?but instead with a piece of excellent moral observation that subverts the fatalism firstly suggested. Lang doesn't want to go where the _clichés of the popular philosophy, or the fatalism current in the _noirs, would take him; a comparison of Lang and Wilder would be interesting, as each's films ooze with different miasmas. SCARLET STREET is a delicious, though sad, bitter and at times staggering movie, of brio and gusto and atmosphere, and of sharp humor, of sustained pace; I loved the shots of the rainy streets, and I regret not seeing it with a witty person to taste its humor?because SCARLET STREET begins like the anti?screwball (or its polar opposite, the screwball upside?down), a riot about the delusions of a sensitive and meek heart belonging to an oldster who has never seen an undressed woman, unattractive also because he's not mean and vicious, as Robinson was awesome with this kind of roles of humble, unglamorous folks in the line of Gabin and Simon?than whom Robinson was of a much humbler countenance, of course, while the French looked rather street?wise. The dialog is sharp and well?written. Margaret Lindsay was a babe cuter than Joan Bennett.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitch. Perfect. Period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fundamental nature of film noir has to do with a disheartened viewpoint of life and reality as much as it does the visual impression, and at the very beginning of this film, we see a quintessential moment subtly culminate after the first scene, an instant that divulges the whole philosophy of film noir: Fritz Lang, in another precision success with a truly intense and emotional dramatic thriller, casts Edward G. Robinson with a gifted perception of his capabilities as Christopher Cross (Chris Cross, get it?), a meek banker and recreational painter, and this careful and resourceful noir opens at a dinner honoring him for his long career at the bank. On his way home, a friend invites Chris to take the train, as per his typical algorithm. Chris has something on his mind however, and chooses to walk instead. And with the snap of the fingers, a match point of the tennis ball on the net, his life changes forever. As soon as he makes that seemingly meaningless, impromptu decision, he helps Joan Bennett, a femme fatale who is evidently being assaulted by a man. Almost immediately, he is captivated by her as his own life at home is controlled by his oppressive who worships her previous husband, a cop who drowned while struggling to rescue a woman.We care a great deal about Chris because he is a common man. He lets people walk all over him. We hate his wife. We find his job as boring as he does. We can identify with his love of something he never quite got to do as much as he wanted to, which is painting, and as of his remarks concerning his appreciation of it, Bennett misguidedly thinks him a prosperous painter. It happens that the attacker was Bennett's brutish boyfriend, played with Dan Duryea's exceptional ability to be not quite evil and not quite intimidating but just a sniveling jerk, with whom she was quarrelling over money. Duryea encourages her to go in for a relationship with Cross, so as to wring money from him. Kitty entices Cross to rent an apartment for her, one that can also be his art studio. They take a high-priced apartment in earlier times enjoyed by Diego Rivera. One appreciates Edward G. Robinson's character and how the stress and burden of being a living bathmat for everyone else has shaped his actions, and how the world around him is in a sense slowly but surely receiving their just desserts, merely by his uncoiling.He is thrilled and, as we sense without it necessary for the film to demonstrate, unstoppable, in recapturing the dreams of his younger years that have eluded him. To bankroll this confidential life, Cross embezzles from the bank. In the meantime, Duryea takes a crack at selling some of Cross's paintings, catching the attention of a celebrated art critic. Bennett acts as if she painted them, enchanting the critic, who guarantees her a career. When Cross's wife sees her husband's paintings in a money-making art gallery as the work of someone else, she accuses him of cloning this commercial artist's work. Cross understands that he can sell his paintings under Bennett's name, and with enthusiasm consents to her being the known face of his work.Though we are aware early on of the deception against Edward G. Robinson's character, we are still stunned by some of the directions the film takes after this point. The script is pitch- perfect as many of its events border on implausible but never seem to slip over that fence, because Scarlet Street is essential a dark story of how twists of fate and lottery wins of chance can be traps in spite of how little one can blame someone like Robinson for taking advantage of them.</fullReview>

I love the atmosphere Fritz Lang created for scruffy part of town where the characters reside. The scenes are full of stairs and rooms in different levels. I love the paintings in the film. Was that style fashionable then or was it considered cheap? All the smaller parts in the film are wonderful too, like the wife.Joan as Kitty March is so delightfully naughty. She and Dan Duryea show their characters living petty sinful criminal lives with energetic performances. I suppose it was not easy showing that kind of life in films those days with out it looking like fun. Of course everyone gets punished in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean Renoir's "la Chienne" is a crucial film in the history French cinema:it's arguably the first talkie which is a true masterpiece .Fritz Lang certainly liked Renoir,for he remade two of his best works.In the fifties he would redo "la Bete Humaine" as "Human desire" (and using the two actors of his precedent film as he did for "Scarlet Street" :Glenn Ford and Gloria Grahame).But "Human desire" ,for a French who knows the original by heart, was a disappointment.On the other hand "Scarlet Street" is quite successful if you do not compare it with Renoir's "La Chienne" .Although Dudley Nichols roughly follows the 1931 plot,the two movies are worlds apart.The first thing to bear in mind is that Jean Renoir,in the early thirties,was nothing short of an anarchist:both "la Chienne" and its follow-up "Boudu Sauvé des Eaux" were ferocious attacks against the Society,the Bourgeoisie,the Army and the Church.Michel Simon's portrayal has almost nothing to do with that of EG Robinson:uglier than the American thespian,Simon created a thoroughly new character (in the French cinema)who would reappear in the next work.He,too ,became a tramp at the end of the film,but this tramp would become "Boudu" who took a spectacular revenge on the bourgeoisie.If you are curious enough to see "La Chienne" after watching "Scarlet Street" ,you 've got to see "Boudu" too,if you want to understand Renoir.Fritz Lang's concerns are not the same: he was obsessed by the fact that any human being is a potential criminal .EG Robinson plays a character who recalls the one he plays in the "woman in the window" (it's revealing that "Scarlet Street" ends with the portrait of Joan Benett).A professor in "woman..." ,Robinson is a painter amateur in "scarlet street" : a way to keep reality away ,and reality is his missus ,a shrew also present in Renoir's opus .The wife's former husband plays a much more prominent part in the first version: he was a warrant officer in the army during WW1 .Lang's hero ,unlike Renoir's ,feels remorse.Never Renoir would have indulged himself the scene on the train,where a man warns the unfortunate painter :there's something higher than human justice!And he does not even hint at God.We are in Lang' s world when Chris becomes crazy in the flat,with an unusual inventive use of the soundtrack and the lightnings .But you have got to notice that both versions feature the immoral death of Johnny/Dédé .In 1953,the ending of Zola's "la Bete Humaine" was terribly sweetened for "Human Desire" .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scarlet Street is a fantastic film, I would even go so far as to say that it is way ahead of its time. Each character out-acts the other, which is not too common when Edward G Robinson is on screen, but just look at the chemistry between Dan Durea and Joan Bennet its shocking! Ms Bennet plays the role of the harlot sloth down to a tee, its hard to believe at some point she's acting, as it is so natural. What can be said about Edward G Robinson, well, I would say this is one of his better vehicles as in a movie to watch over and over, though not his best ever performance, as there are better showcases out there for that ie; Sea Wolf etc.For those of you that have looked at Fritz Langs other cinematic works, you will not be disappointed with this one. Everything expected with a true Film Noir is here - and in spades! Even from the opening credits you get the sense that this is somehow gonna be a lot darker than you imagined, with the director genius at work and a strong cast it hits every note correctly.Its a shame that whenever I have seen this film, that the print is usually quite dull, lacking any restoration, though I'm sure some would argue that it adds to the dark, murky feel of the picture.Overall, be sure to watch this one if you have any kind of interest in cinema or Film Noir. Ideally, I recommend a late night viewing in the dark - you won't be able to leave your seat, so get comfortable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early in Scarlet Street, a mousy cashier and "Sunday painter" named Christopher Cross is asked by one of his co-workers if he is superstitious about being the third person to light his cigar from the same match. As he answers no it is clearly revealed that he is crossing his fingers behind his back. This wink to the audience pretty much sets the tone for this entertaining cinematic feast which is so rich that it's worth seeing again and again. As movie buffs know, Lang reunited the three lead cast members (Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea) from his previous effort, Woman in the Window (1944) and intensified their characters for Scarlet Street. Without going into intricate details which are well covered in other commentaries, both plots concern a married, middle-aged man (Robinson) who gets into ever-worsening trouble after suddenly crossing paths with a femme fatale (Bennett). Scarlet Street explores the power of illusion and the role of money and art in human relations, our striving for beauty and love, and not least how one wrong move (or by implication, one right move) can radically change the course of one's life. The three main characters are living a lie - presenting a picture, if you will - in order to get what they desperately want. Every frame is loaded; props, gestures, camera angles, and settings carry narrative weight, symbolize states of mind, warn of danger, reveal secrets, foreshadow plot developments, comment on individuals as well as the larger world. Lang also uses sound imaginatively: the song "My Melancholy Baby" recurs in multiple forms; radio static adds to the impact of a tense moment; disembodied whispers haunt the protagonist. And many viewers who first discover Joan Bennett here in the juiciest role of her career will want to rush to see whatever else she did.Scarlet Street begs comparison with Jean Renoir's La Chienne (1931), adapted from the same source material (a French novel by Georges de la Fouchardiere, published in the US as "Poor Sap"); both are the work of gifted directors with radically different visions. Renoir's touch is gentle, detached (even the face slappings seem almost like love taps); his characters are more down-to-earth and often filmed in real Paris locations; the sexual angle is frank and even casual (American cinema wouldn't catch up until the 60s). Lang on the other hand is tightly focused, bold, even brutal, but not without humor. His street scenes are artificial studio constructs; his characters are closer to types than full-blooded people, but I believe that their dehumanized circumstances justify this approach artistically. Lang's screenwriter Dudley Nichols brilliantly delineates plot mechanics that Renoir elides, revealing to us the notch-by-notch turning of the wheels of fate. And we can't look away. We are just as trapped as as Chris Cross. The contrast between the movies is neatly expressed by the way they present the protagonist's paintings: Renoir's are soft, naturalistic; Lang's hard-edged, stylized. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER*** Renoir's ending is bittersweet and ironic; Lang's grim and unutterably sad.Edward G. Robinson once said or wrote that Scarlet Street and his performance therein were "monotonous." His misgivings are perhaps those of a seasoned actor who felt underused by a director known for treating actors like puppets. But from the audience's perspective the result is chillingly effective.A noticeable oversight: although the story clearly takes place in 1934, the clothes and hairstyles are strictly mid-40's. No effort was made to correct this incongruity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SCARLET STREETafter the success of The the woman in the window, the director Fritz Lang makes a year later, and with the same protagónist couple, another film-noir. But he duplicates the bet and he not only maintains the level of the previous one but obtains one of the best films of his career as a director: Scarlet Street. Christopher Cross, a dark and failed employee, interested in his free time in paintings, falls in love with Kitty, a much more young woman. A diamond clock and a confused chat,makes her believe that he is a rich man and she will try to take advantage of that. After cutting the bows with his previous life (and his morality) and giving himself completely to that fatale woman, Christopher will face the deceit and the humiliation. Already lost completely, he will be able to become an assassin. Edward G. Robinson incarnates masterfuly the character of the weak employee, a strange twist in the career of the actor (generally related to roles of villains or strong characters). As the fatal Kitty Joan Bennett shines (The woman in the window, The Scar). Fritz Lang,a recognized director from his German films (Metropolis, Dr Mabuse, M the black vampire) obtains with Scarlet Street one of his better works. A oníric and paranoic film, where the routine, the humiliation, the money and the death are mixed.

		<shortDescription>Leaves most noirs looking hysterical and shrill.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the richest and greatest of all films noir, great precisely because it rejects the easy male self-pity and misogyny that mars even the best of the genre. Only Lang could take a thriller and make it a domestic melodrama; a complex thesis on art and the artist; a depiction of the corporately corrupt American soul; and a frightening vision of hell on earth. He doesn't stint on the pleasures of noir though, with brutal violence, explicit sexuality and Expressionistic shadows reefing each scene; but Lang is an ironic observer, always exposing the truth of a seemingly confused situation with unforgiving irony. The film is as much a game as the bar's chess tiles Chris Cross walks on as Kitty manoeuvres him into the noir plot. Unmissable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noir-ish remake of _La Chienne_ is more psychological than the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film definitely has a different feel compared to Renoir's _La Chienne_. It's less of a melodrama and more of a psychological noir-ish thriller. Nicely composed by Lang- particularly the closing scenes. Rent this version of _La Chienne_ and save your Renoir viewing for _Grand Illusion_.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is a bitch ... and irony is a pimp ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people got it, and some don't ? life is a bitch inviting us to meditate on its cruelty and drown its bitterness in sweet thoughts of success ? a far-sighted excuse for optimism only to drug ourselves by giving our lives a pseudo meaning ? but it all ends up the same. A loser is a loser ? with an inner beauty in the ferocious attachment to get off his sordid condition despite an adversity conducted by his self-pity. That's the only department in which a loser can shine ? a loser is only a failure with a promotion. I watched the film after learning that it had influenced Martin Scorsese, one of my favorite directors, and frankly, I couldn't believe a movie from 1945 would touch such a sensitive nerve in me. But it did, "Scarlett Street", the remake of Jean Renoir's "La Chienne" -a movie I should see too- is a particularly affecting film-noir, depicting the descent into madness of a man in middle-age crisis, consumed by a profound desire to be loved by a younger woman.This is film-noir, you know, no Capra's romance, a cheap doll like Katherine March alias 'Kitty', the volcanic and torrid Joan Bennett can't fall in love with a lower-than-average Joe, Christopher 'Chris' Cross, a modest bank cashier, remarkably played by the great Edward G. Robinson ? so blinded by his complex he can't realize she's using him. She's her life filler, but he's her pocket filler ? Chris obviously didn't live enough experience to realize that girls in the real world love to be overpowered, and that there's no place in this cynical world for pure and sentimental hearts like his. But this is the sad reverse of his artistic side. As an amateur painter, Chris injected all his energy and talent into that passion to transcend his miserable condition of a likable clerk constantly belittled by a bullying wife. Chris has an admirable sensibility, but his life is so pathetic on the surface, he couldn't even measure the extent of his talent, not even sign his own creations, a fault that would use Kitty to take all the recognition, encouraged by Johnny, the man she 'loves'.And the movie is so cynically lucid, that it doesn't allow Chris to be upset by that: even when he realizes the fraud, he forgives. I thought it was because of his talent's recognition but no, he just wanted to share his happiness with her, like a marriage, the ultimate self-disrespectful man not realizing that he signed the death warrant of his soul through this attitude. I couldn't help but feeling angry toward Chris, until I realized that something in this character spoke to me. Sometimes, we can't afford to raise our head and face adversity, and the least we do is to admit our weaknesses, as to give an excuse for the world to ignore us, being ignored is still the best way not to be hurt ? cowardice disguised in realism. Film-noir is a fascinating genre so it can translate the lowest and darkest sides of our personalities into powerful (inter)actions and Fritz Lang's "Scarlett Street" is so dark it's blinding.The greatness of this film relies essentially on the characters. The acting is the driving force with basically, three protagonists who form one of the most pathetically fascinating love triangles ever. Chris loves Kitty because she makes him feel desired and loved, like meaning something to someone, unlike his hateful wife, married for some obscure interest reasons. Because, men in self-pity can only live through the eyes of other people, that's their tragedy. But Kitty only prostitutes herself and shares the gain with her pimp of a lover, Johnny, played by the inimitable Dan Dureya, this actor I already hated as the snotty spoiled kid in "the Little Foxes", and that I hated even more now. And even at the end, his relationship with Kitty was quite ambiguous. I can't count how many times he slapped and insulted her, but I guess Kitty was aroused by such a manly attitude. I would find her as pathetic as Chris, if she wasn't so ridiculously attractive, like a modern bitchy version of Scarlett O'Hara. I could forgive Chris. Women can be worth our dignity ? even if you never get them without dignity.In fact, I ended up 'understanding' all the characters' actions, as if my evil side was also rooting for the couple. After all, they tried and it worked, and maybe men like Chris are meant to be victims. Wives, situations, bad luck ? I don't know. And the conclusion doesn't leave much optimism on the subject. Chris finally kills Kitty when she reveals everything, stabbing her several times with an ice pick. This moment is crucial because Chris ceases to be a victim; he's an antihero, he chose to commit this act. But he's still pathetic as he didn't admit his guilt to cause Johnny's sentence to death. He could have saved Johnny but he was so in love with a woman who hated him, that he didn't want her to be remembered as a fraud ... and didn't she try him when she mocked his lack of virility saying that he wouldn't have the guts to kill Johnny ? the pimp was doomed.And he ironically made a painting legend out of her, and he became a bum, haunted by the ghostly whispers of 'Kitty' flirting with 'Johnny' somewhere in the after-world, haunted by the guilt... forever. He got away with the murder, but his guilt will torture him because there's no redemption without admitting the guilt, and even when he does, people think he's crazy. I understand how good old Marty got his inspiration ? Chris lost his job, his wife, recognition and the girl he never had anyway, and with her, also vanished his last ounce of dignity remaining. Chris was a loser, he's now a failure ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I lost those wings a long time ago."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've often heard Fritz Lang's Hollywood drama, 'Scarlet Street (1945),' described as a definitive film noir thriller, comparable to 'Double Indemnity (1944)' and 'Out of the Past (1947)' in its iconic use of noir lighting, themes and motifs. My sources must, therefore, have been faulty, for the first two-thirds of the film perceptibly avoid any genuine associations with the genre, and the main character's interactions with an exploitative femme fatale and her violent boyfriend are played primarily as a light drama, almost as a dry comedy. Most of the story up until this point, with the exception of a suitably dark and stormy opening, plays out in broad daylight, failing ? or, indeed, not even trying ? to evoke that sense of claustrophobic anxiety that is present in film noir's finer representatives. Because we are consistently kept well-informed of our villains' wrongdoings, there's little sense of shock, deception and betrayal, and, at various points in the story, it almost seems as though we're supposed to actually sympathise with Kitty March (Joan Bennett).Viewed as a straight drama, Lang's film is considerably more effective, if only because the viewer is not waiting on the first cold-blooded murder that is so long in arriving. Christopher Cross (Edward G. Robinson) is a docile, dependable cashier, a dull bank employee with fruitless aspirations to become a recognised artist. Stuck in an excruciating marriage to a wife (Rosalind Ivan) he can't stand, Chris decides, on one particularly stormy late night, to stray from his comfort zone, and thus achieves a level of happiness that he had never experienced. After ostensibly rescuing a helpless damsel, Katharine "Kitty" March (Joan Bennett), from the clutches of a would-be attacker (Dan Duryea), Chris risks a tentative relationship with the young women, never realising that Kitty is cunningly exploiting his affection for her own monetary gain. When Kitty and boyfriend Johnny begin passing off Chris' unique paintings as Kitty's own work, I momentarily thought that I'd strayed into the mistaken identity trappings of an Astaire-Rogers musical; the tone of the story is much too light to pass for film noir, and might easily have been transplanted into a fully-realised comedy.Of course, my description thus far has neglected any mention of the film's final thirty minutes, when the film undergoes an intense and radical transformation. Following the unexpected return of Adele Cross' ex-husband, and an ironically-ineffective blackmail attempt, the film finally strays decisively into the classic film-noir tradition, and what an entrance it is! Exploding with alarming abruptness into a fit of brutal cold-blooded violence, the typically-meek Chris hacks Kitty to death with the blade of an ice-pick, and callously allows her cocky boyfriend to die for the crime. Though the Production Code typically dictated that all murderers must either die or be convicted, Lang reserves an even more disturbing punishment for his main character; the guilt and torment of his actions leaves Chris a cold, soulless figure prowling the squalid streets of the city, forever a prisoner of his own conscience. Had the film maintained this dark, bleak tone for the entirety of its running time ? rather than just for its final act ? 'Scarlet Street' would certainly have been a superior thriller, but, even as it stands, at least a single viewing is essential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film noir has it all. A lot of wonderful night shots, shadows which are used as a filming technique and also symbolically darken the life of Robinson's character. Bennett gives us a superb femme fatale who only differs from some of the other famous femme fatales of the period in the way that she is not self-motivating. The criminal energy lies to a large extent in her boyfriend and for the majority of the movie she merely plays along. As a matter of course the end of a film noir is never really surprising. The production code made sure that every character who is portrayed as "bad" or criminal gets their due punishment and so we know that Christopher Cross will not get away either.In two scenes in the movie the gramophone record is getting stuck at one and the same spot during a love song, repeating the word "love" over and over. I found this a great way of implying that what love may be felt by the characters (Kitty towards Johnny and Christopher towards Kitty) will ultimately lead nowhere and only to their doom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting performances in an intriguing film noir...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>None of the characters in SCARLET STREET are likely to win your admiration for their moral fiber--in fact, this is as seedy a bunch of individuals as you are likely to see in any film of this type. But you have to hand it to EDWARD G. ROBINSON, JOAN BENNETT and DAN DURYEA for giving it their all and then some.I've only seen this film on a less than quality VHS print that was in public domain, so it may be that the B&amp;W photography in the original release was not quite as murky as it appears on video. A crisper print would have been desirable, but still the story itself gets you involved in the sinister trap that Robinson falls into. He's excellent as the hen-pecked husband who becomes obsessed with a beautiful woman--even if she is just a tramp that he fancies. Unfortunately, she has designs only on using him for materialistic purposes in a scheme she and her boyfriend (Dan Duryea) concoct to swindle him. Character actress Rosalind Ivan does a fine job as his complaining wife.If you like film noir of the '40s full of unsavory characters bent on robbing, stealing or killing to further their gains while the plot takes more than one twist, this is your cup of tea.Not a great film, but an interesting example of how skillful Fritz Lang could be at wringing a lot of suspense out of some pretty thin material. At the end, though, you may feel that something was missing in the way the story plays out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stark femme-fatale story pits timid, artistic older man Robinson (playing strong against type and proving his meddle) against iced heat Bennett, looking like a million bucks squeezed into a five dollar package. She gets him to rob from his bank to pay for her rent in a nice condo she shares with her lover, Duryea, who's looking like a perfect dandy in his one dollar brim round hat. Lang and associates pull off the visual elements very well -- excellent photography. This movie came out in the mid 40s, and although I doubt it exactly cheered those audiences up, they sure got a good show for their money for once.p.s. 2008 -- still just gotta love Dan Duryea in that dandy hat. The movie reminded my friend of a horror film, and there are indeed moments especially towards the end where it has moments of outright horror, with Robinson's character haunted by the ghosts of his conscience. It's a bit heavy handed there, but it does allow for a different kind of fall-out than the typical end that befalls a transgressor in movies. It reminds me of "Fury", really getting inside someone's head and literally showing the manifestations of his guilt. What I like best about the film is the whole element of her stealing his art, taking on the identity of the artist. You put that together with the kind of pimp/prostitute relationship she has with the Duryea character and it's an interesting triangle. You have her taking on his identity, the "self portrait" that becomes central as an image. Then you have Duryea eventually taking on Robinson's role as the guilty party in the murder. It's tragic in a way that even though he's now recognized as a great artist, his subterfuge with the girl has made it impossible to claim them as his even after she betrays him. No wonder his name is "Chris Cross"! I absolutely love all the performances here. Bennett isn't usually a favorite of mine necessarily but she is just perfect for this role for some reason. It's the way she seems to adopt a feeling for each scene the way a woman in real life would put on a dress or a hat. "You always wanted to be an actress", as Johnny tells her. She and Chris get to live out their dreams in an odd way, Chris becoming a "great artist" and she living a role that is in itself a performance. But they can't enjoy the fruits of those dreams because to reveal the truth would destroy them. It's as if they share bits and pieces of their ideal worlds, and if you put the three of them together you might end up with a whole human being.</fullReview>

Smitten, amateur painter Chris lets Kitty think he's a wealthy artist. At Johnny's urging, she lets Chris establish her in an apartment (with his shrewish wife's money). There, Chris paints masterpieces; but Johnny sells them under Kitty's name, with disastrous and ironic results.This film got some hefty good reviews here on IMDb. I can't say I really liked it so much. I thought it was very slow and not especially interesting. But then I should also mention that the print i watched was very very dark which might have taken something away from the enjoyment.I don't know.

		<fullReview>This is not a film to see for the first time 65 years after it was made. To me if felt turgid as if the principals were wading through molasses and I speak as an admirer of all three leads. It also - as viewed in 2010 - tips its glove from the start. Any time we see a Caspar Milequetoast pick up a gold watch for 25 years loyal service in a job where he has access to big bucks we know it's only a matter of time till he trousers a sizeable chunk and all we are waiting for is a motive. In nine cases out of ten there's a woman involved and so it is here with Eddie Robinson breaking his journey home to intervene in a dust-up between a pimp and a whore and winding up behind the eight ball. This is worthy of Irwin Shaw whose overriding theme was the role played by chance in life. There's also something of a ridiculous sub plot involving the first husband of Eddie Robinson's wife, a cop who disappeared and was presumed drowned several years previously. Nothing much wrong with that but how many cops do YOU know who have a life-sized portrait in oils of themselves in an ordinary apartment. Almost certainly this was better the first time around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See the French original--it's a much less predictable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can definitely understand the positive reviews for this film and I would have probably scored this film a lot higher had I not also seen LA CHIENNE--a French film that from which SCARLET STREET was derived. However, while LA CHIENNE is a less polished film, it is much funnier and grittier and makes a much stronger impact because it doesn't take the easy way out and give a "Hollywood-ized" (i.e., "sanitized") ending. In fact, up until the end, I might have given SCARLET STREET an 8 or 9. But the end was just awful. Now in general, I don't like overly explicit films (after all, I am a parent and a teacher), but the production codes of the time really went way overboard--this film should have been left as it originally was. I really don't want to betray the endings, because it could ruin both films for you, but I will just say that LA CHIENNE has a kind of happy ending while SCARLET STREET is a heavy-handed morality play at the end--totally softening the harsh impact of the first 90% of the film.As for the film, the performance that stood out the most was the supporting actor, Dan Duryea--he was what made this film a far better than average movie. Joan Bennet and Edward G. Robinson were fine, but Duryea just "chewed up the screen". Robinson's character was a nice treat, as he was very likable and sympathetic--much like Charles Laughton in THE SUSPECT. As for Fritz Lang, while he was certainly a great director, I think this was one of the least inspired jobs he did that I can think of. You would never know this is the same director who made METROPOLIS, M or THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW. Oh, and by the way, THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW came out the same year as this film and featured both the same basic cast AND a somewhat similar plot! In fact, after I saw both films, I mixed them up in my mind until I saw them both for a second time! Despite my objections to the movie, it is still well worth seeing. The basic plot is GREAT--but the ending,...YECCHH!! Do yourself a favor--after you see this film, try to find LA CHIENNE! You won't be sorry.By the way, the SCARLET STREET DVD was by Front Row Entertainment and had a really poor quality print and offered no extras. I think this might be a public domain video and often the prints floating about are pretty bad of many of the public domain movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Extremely depressing movie about a meek and lonely man. Who after what should have been his greatest achievement ends up involved with a young woman and her sleazy boyfriend. The two take advantage of the poor slob to the point where his life, by the time the movie is just about over, is no longer worth living.Christopher Cross, Edard G. Robinson, has worked as a cashier for the J.J Hogarth Brokerage House for 25 years. At a party, with him as the guest of honor, Chris is Given a gold chain watch by his boss J.J Hogarth, Russell Hicks, for his loyal and dedicated service for the firm.Going home that evening Chris sees a man beating this young woman and runs to her rescue knocking the assailant down and out with his umbrella. Getting away before the police get there it later turns out that the man Johnny Prince, Dan Duryea, is the woman's Kitty March, Joan Bennett, boyfriend who has a habit of smacking her around and is also a cheap con-artist. Chris taking Kitty back to her apartment soon falls in love with her not realizing what he's getting into. Kitty, like her boyfriend Johnny is also into conning people out of their money and she sees in the love-sick Chris a real pasty who may have a load of cash that she can cheat him out of.Modestly telling Kitty that he paints, Chris is too embarrassed to tell her that he's a cashier, she gets the bright idea that he's a famous but naive artist who's paintings can sell for hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars on the open market. Together with "smarty paths" Johnny "lazey legs" Kitty, cute little pet names the two give each other,plan to take the starry-eyed old geezer for a ride. Chris has one problem he's married to Adele, Rosalind Ivan, who's anything but a wife but more like a jailer to him. Adela can't stand Chris' cheapness and even worse hates the very sight of his many paintings that clutter their apartment. Adele even threatens to give them to the junk-man with the rest of the junk in the neighborhood that he picks up. Kitty taking advantage of the meek and kindly Chris has him go as far as embezzle him employer, J.J Hogarth, of some $1,200.00 to pay for her, and secretly Johnny's, apartment in Greenwich Village. Johnny soon gets the idea of selling Chris' paintings, that he has stored in Kitty's apartment, for cash thinking he can get as much as $25.00 apiece for them. To his surprise Johnny finds out that art expert and columnist David Jeneway, Jess Balker, had seen them and is completely agog over the paintings and is willing to pay as much as $5000.00 for each, which are in the dozens, of them.With Johnny giving Kitty credit for the paintings she quickly becomes one of the great young artists of modern times with the real artist, Christopher Cross, having no idea of what's been happening to his paintings that he left for safe keeping with Kitty. It's Chris' wife Adele who finds out about what's been happening with his artwork when one afternoon she sees in the window of the expensive Dellarove Art Gallery his paintings selling for $500.00 with Kitty March's name on them. Adele accusing Chris of plagiarizing Kitty's paintings has him go to her Grennwich Village pad only to find out that his painting are gone. Still Chris forgives Kitty for selling them and even gives her credit for them being as valuable and famous as they are because of her looks, yes Kitty is very beautiful, not his painting talent! What a first class jerk! Lighting strikes Chris later when his wife's late husband detective Sgt. Higgens (Charles Kemper) comes out of hiding, he faked his death five years ago to keep from going to jail for police corruption, and shows up out of the blue trying to blackmail Chris into keeping his being alive from Adele. Wanting Chris to pay him off to keep quiet, and not ruin his marriage to Adele, Higgens doesn't realize that he's been heaven sent for Chris and how now Chris can have his marriage to the pain in the butt Adele annulled, which he eventually does, and be free of her for good. Free and now safe to marry Kitty Chris goes into her apartment to tell her the good news only to find out that she has a boyfriend and what exactly she thinks of him. In that he's a jerk and unattractive moron who's too stupid to know it for himself. Which leads Chris into losing it and attacking and killing Kitty with an icepick. Fate, like the Lord for those who believe, works in strange ways and in the case of Christopher Cross it put everything right in a very ironic and deadly way.Johnny ends up in the Sing Sing electric chair for Kitty's murder, which he was innocent of, and Chris lose everything, his job his wife his home his self-respect. In the end Chris is left to roam the cold and unfriendly streets of NYC and see what a fool he was by letting his emotions override his common sense and have his life destroyed by a pretty face but with a cold and devious heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose there are things worth mentioning: the relationship between a whore and her pimp/lover and the skill of Lang. Perhaps you see some extraordinary acting.As for myself, Lang upsets me because he seems merely a highly skilled filmmaker with good intuitions and few signature tricks. But he seems to have no soul in his projects. They seem mechanically conceived, German, if you will. Sure, the sets of "Metropolis" were extraordinary, and the staging of "M." But I think Godard had him right in "Contempt," a knowledgeable old guy with no blood in his projects.This one is often cited as among the best of noir, but I don't agree. Noir for me has lots of bizarre coincidences that could only happen because our poor victim is in a film. We conspire with the goddess of fate of that world to jerk the players around. Plus, our hapless target has to be innocent, so far as the territory it drifts into.This guy causes his own problems. The story moves along because of the conspiracy of the two lowlifes, not by some capricious force. And the end is strictly Poe. Its no "Detour."But it does have some interesting folds. It is, of course a project made by an artist and it is about an artist. It features an actress whose character pretends to be an actress, and then a painter. While the original movie is related to painting (and is a great movie, by the way), it doesn't feature painting. That was added into this version and is the one element that truly works.Lang uses a different camera mode whenever a painting is in the frame (except for the last), as if he were stepping back and letting us know that we are in the painting.This is not noir by my definition, and Lang isn't the master that many suppose.

		<shortDescription>Jeepers golly, yipes This is film noir?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Third rate dialog and studio system casting doomed this project before it ever could get off the ground. Sultry Lauren Bacall or tempting Gloria Graham would have been highly preferable to Joan Bennett but even her casting made more sense than Dan Duryea as her pimp boyfriend. To say he is no Richard Widmark or Lee Marvin is an understatement. I expected him to take off his white hat and start singing and dancing every moment he appeared on the screen. The contrived appearance of a previously presumed dead character, wearing a pirate's eye-patch as a disguise, would have made more sense in an Ed Wood's Jailbait than in a film by the great Fritz Lang. The eye-patch as a disguise and his story of ending up on a banana boat to Honduras made as much sense as Victor Lazlo eluding the Nazis in a yellow suit in Ted Turner's colorized version of Casablanca. All of this is unfortunate because Fritz Lang was still capable of making great films as shown with The Big Heat a few years later. The basic premise of the love of a young woman ruining an older man (e.g. The Blue Angel) could have resulted in a worthy film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film just makes me feel so sad for men who've been corrupted by vindictive women. this man poured his heart out though this women, he put his life, his job and his marriage on he line for her and she still had absolutely no love for him. Yes he was completely stupid but come on he was blinded by love and a cheap job and a horrible wife who constantly rubbed her ex fiancé in his face. it was really creepy with the voices and stuff, it made me think like wow is this what some homeless people or crazy people go through? around this generation women pretty worshiped men, cook, clean, stay home an watch the kids, hell, rob a bank if you could convince them, this films shows the ending to that women clearly. yeah they'll do anything for you and crawl over anyone to do it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing with poor production values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm far less impressed with this film than almost all of our other reviewers. I am closer to the Bosley Crowthers group that felt the film was lacking...but not bad.First off, when I started watching this film I wasn't aware of what year it was made. I was surprised how old Edward G. Robinson looked (and I don't mean because of the makeup) for a film made back in the 1930s. Then I checked the date. 1945??? This LOOKS rather outdated for a film from 1945.Second, it just looks cheaply done. And I was watching the TCM print, so I imagine it's halfway decent. But I can't say much for the production values here.In terms of the story, it moves slowly through much of the movie. Becomes far more interesting in the last 20 minutes, but the final ending seems disappointing...like the director just ran out of steam.The highlight of the film is Edward G. Robinson's performance. I've always appreciated his work, even when I wasn't impressed with the film project. And that is true here. Joan Bennett is fine as the Scarlett woman, though I wasn't overly impressed. Dan Duryea was always good at playing the cad, and he does here, though this is far from his best film effort.I give this film my "average rating", which is a "7". Pretty good. Not bad. But nothing to write home about. And BTW, it's a weak "7".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Downbeat and Bleak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Heavy Stuff and was Considered a Corrupting Influence upon its Release so much so that it was Banned in Three States. Not to be Shown. Dangerous. Well, there You go if there was Any Doubt about its Powerful Impact even Today.Modern Viewers are Taken by it and even a Few Complain about how Dark and Depressing it can be on those with a Fragile Nature. That is a Difficult Reputation for a 1945 Film to live Up (or Down). It is one of the Early Film Noirs and Director Fritz Lang Delivers another of His Bleak Look-In on the Human Condition.This is One of those that has Little Argument Finding Itself Labeled Film Noir, as so Many do. It is All Things Noir. Dark, Expressionistic, Fatalistic, Existential, and Surreal. It is Sharply Defined Defeatism with Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett, and Dan Duryea all Attaining Accolades along with Lang.This is Simply a Great Movie, a Fantastic Film Noir and a Scalding, Unrestrained Story that is Sensual, Brutal and Ultimately Sad. The most Downbeat of Endings brings Things to an Unhappy Conclusion.Note...For many years this Film was in the Public Domain and there are many awful releases floating around. Do yourself a favor and seek out a new release from KINO on Blu-ray or DVD. These Prints have been restored to original condition and it is essential that this Film be seen as such for maximum enjoyment and representation. Anything less is unacceptable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>perfect except for ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward G. Robinson plays in this odd twisting story about a meek and mild cashier who paints as a hobby. He gets entangled with a bad user female (Joan Bennett) who tries to take him for any money she can get (for her boyfriend mainly) by playing him along.Turns out Robinson is a talented primitive painter. His paintings he thought were worthless are valuable. Bennett starts selling his paintings signing her name to them.If anyone deserved to be killed more I can't imagine it...Robinson in a fit of passion murders Bennett and seemingly everything works out but it doesn't...Why is it in US noir films do people never get away with things? You have to watch British or French films to see the ending everyone wants to see. Such a puritanical society.Acceptable entertainment except for ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edward G.Robinson, a fine actor, plays a middle-aged cashier named Christopher Cross who is unhappily married.Painting is his only joy.Then one day he "rescues" a young woman, Kitty Marsh (Joan Bennett) in nocturnal Greenwich Village.It turns out that the man he saved her from is actually Johnny Prince (Dan Duryea), her fiancé.Together these two trick the man.Fritz Lang is the director of this film-noir classic Scarlet Street (1945).Edward G. Robinson's performance is something really memorable.Joan Bennett is brilliant as the double-faced woman.Dan Duryea does very good acting job as her accomplice.This movie is full of greatness.In the end Robinson's character walks with remorse in his soul, hearing them voices...After he has killed Kitty with an ice-pick.After they have executed Johnny for her murder.The man can't live with himself and tries to kill himself but fails.He has to walk for an eternity with remorse in his soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woman in the Window on Scarlet Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Lang's followup to "The Woman in the Window," Robinson again plays a mild-mannered fellow obsessed with temptress Bennett while Duryea plays another slime-ball. Bennett's character, while equally beautiful, is quite different from the earlier film. Although not quite as good as "Window," mainly because the acting and the direction both go a bit overboard and the story is not presented as efficiently, this one is a fine example of film noir. The contrast in the endings of this film and "Window" is remarkable. What a great run for Robinson in 1944-45: besides these two Lang films, he also did "Our Vines Have Tender Grapes" and the incomparable "Double Indemnity."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen one single Lang American film that i do not consider to be, overall, a failure. I find it that it is relatively important to, once in a while, search for one of these films, watch it and try to understand what was the shift that makes them work so bad, at least today. After all Lang gave us Metropolis which is a prodigy of visual sets, not so much of narrative. But than he made M, which is a really good project, that starts something that he could have transported to the American noir. He is also in the generation of Germanic directors who invented the basic lighting that would be integrated into noir. And I think the problem starts there. In his mental shift towards American movies and audiences, Lang decided to keep and reaffirm what he had always done best: visual staging. But he never understood the dynamics of the noir narrative, the fabric of the noir world. How the shadows, lights and hats only truly work when they structure (or are structured by) the narrative.(spoilers) And there Was an interesting narrative here!, at least as far as these films go. Of course it is superficial (so is almost every film) but it had potential to be explored in a visual medium. It has the self-reference of the main character being an image maker (a painter). The common man dragged through temptation (the woman) to a world he doesn't understand and to which he ultimately collapses. But the girl is also not in charge of her own game, because of love. And even the bad guy, who is supposed to supervise the whole thing looses absolutely control. So fate comes above everything. In the middle we have an interesting and well explored (in terms of script) diversion through the ever juicy theme of mixed identities: our surrogate on-screen gets his pictures signed under other name without consent. Finding this out he doesn't react how we supposed, instead embraces and encourages this to go on. Ultimately he kills his own work, by killing the persona that assumed the identity of his work. So when he kills the girl, he's sort of committing suicide. That makes it perfectly useless to actually show the suicide in a later sequence that drags the film more than it required (although this scene IS visually interesting on its own because of the use of light, there we have Lang!). I suppose some scared conservative producer would ask for this scene, in case people wouldn't understand the previous one.The problem is that Fritz doesn't do pretty much anything with the material he's got, in terms of visual adequacy. He gets his script, and than considers every set, every sequence, on its own, not as part of an integrated storytelling conspiracy, but simply as a workable scene on its own. It's as if Fritz in front of the possibilities of the script was like every other man in front of Robinson's paintings: unable to go beyond the crippled perspectives, unable to understand the core.My opinion: 3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lang's genius can't overcome an overblown script that adds unnecessary scenes and exposition and attempts to adapt an unglamorous story to the star power of Edward G. Robinson, miscast in the lead role. My advice: see the movie that this is a remake of, "La Chienne".</fullReview>

I personally don't know how I would have made it better, but it just seemed like something was lacking. The performances are just fine, and the story is not bad, the direction and the cinematography is great as always for Lang, but it just needed more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not bad Lang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty ragged rushed job, leaking its cheapness around the edges a little too much. Look at his Ministry of Fear and you can see how much better looking that one is. And even worse is its heavy handedness. That all said, it still has a lot going for it. Nobody ever used the purity of blackness better than Fritz, probably from the ooze of Nazism from whence he sprungeth. Which in a way makes the shoddy look of the film almost, but not quite work for him. The slatternly poses of Bennett in this is nice, and the sheer terror of Robinson's marriage to his harridan has probably never been captured better. Too bad nobody ever asked Lang or Hitch what they thought of the other. They were so similar and at the same time, not. Taking opposite directions to get to Rome. Hitchcock would never have used Duryea. His villains were always much smoother. The art dealer in this would have been his venue: her lover, and Dan the art dealer. Nevertheless, we are left with what we have here, and even though it all seems ruthlessly rushed and jammed together, like a dream, taking it for what it is, it is not bad. And the paintings, well, they are of the same ilk. Rather primitive, but haunting. It should never be forgotten that there is always something very S and M about senor Lang, always waiting to leak out around the edges, not for nothing he had that monocle, the whip never far away: and this bears those trademarks in spades: that business with Johnny whacking Joan around.In fact, a much starker film of his along those lines, Cloak and Dagger, higher budget etc, where he could let his sadism out a little more, has one of the most gripping deadly fights in cinema: Gary Cooper killing Marc Lawrence nearly literally tooth and nail, and near the beginning there is an astonishing moment when the lady villain of the piece roars back and whales the hell out of Cooper, right in his face so hard that you find yourself looking for blood rushing to his cheeks, just BAM, but in Scarlet Street all that is pretty well held in check, which makes me want to try to find Lang in some interview, what he thought of this film. Overall it seems something he did not really put himself into that much. Maybe a six or seven coming from somebody else, but from Lang, only a five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hmnnn....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you can accept Edgar G. Robinson in 1935 as an aging mouse of a man and Joan Bennett of all people as a prostitute, you might enjoy Fritz Lang's SCARLET STREET. Respectable married man meets streetwalker, and it will never be the same again for either of them. Bennett of course has a pimp, played by a young and rakish Dan Duryea. Robinson is keeping the woman in a Village apartment, and quickly suspects something is amiss. The middle of the film is pure padding as Bennett begins to sell Robinson's amateur paintings for a hefty sum in what is known as "irony." Hollywood waters down the plot and characters so much, it becomes one big bore. The ending is all too predictable, and this could stand a rewrite and remake. The mark could be played by somebody like Dennis Quaid or Harrison Ford, the whore by Scarlet Johannsen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant but dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first thought about this film. It was simply average. The story was OK, probably original for the time it was made. I didn't think that Edward G. Robinson was well cast here and some of the characters actions weren't made clear enough. For example I didn't find it that obvious that the woman was abused by her boyfriend, though this is just ue to the lack of actual violence, the time it was made an all. Robinson plays a good guy. Some skanky woman latches onto him and he ends up telling her how he paints. She kind of gets the wrong impression and begins to believe that he is quite wealthy. But he is actually not. He lets her assume for a while, I guess he likes her. She stays in their to try and steal his money, which he doesn't actually have. Good concept, lacking execution. One of Fritz Langs worst film I'm afraid.</fullReview>
