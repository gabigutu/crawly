		<fullReview>So here it is, the landmark film which ushered in the Nouvelle Vague, introduced Francois Truffaut and his screen persona Antoine Doinel to the world, and changed the direction of cinema for ever. And an impressive piece of work it is, too. By 1959 the process of film-making had atrophied (artistically, at any rate). Stale and stagey artifice was the norm, and for the upcoming generation of film-makers and critics (Truffaut was both) a new way of conceiving cinematic art had to be found. In this, his feature film debut, Truffaut found it. This is cinema verite at its freshest and best. The film looks like a documentary and absolutely drips with kitchen-sink candour. A handheld camera follows Antoine around his parents' flat and we get to peer in on the grimy, cramped and oh-so-ordinary minutiae of a humble little life. "Don't forget the garbage," Antoine is repeatedly told, and Truffaut certainly doesn't. He pulls off with resounding success the seemingly impossible feat of making the mundane seem entirely absorbing. "C'est peut-etre un question de glandes," suggests a teacher as we see the adolescent Antoine go quietly off the rails. Paris (or more accurately, that part of Paris bounded by Montmartre and the Gare du Nord) is wintry and stark, the unlovely and prosaic environment in which Antoine functions - or fails to function. Truffaut wants, inter alia, to deflate the "April In Paris" myth so virulent in the 1950's. He succeeds mightily. Antoine is disaffected. Parents, home and school are all inhospitable and the sleety, foggy streets south of Pigalle convey Antoine's alienation admirably. Deadpan humour is a powerful weapon in Truffaut's armoury. Antoine's inept note-forging, the outlandish excuse which he gives for his absence and his long-suffering look during his mother's reminiscences are all nicely done and raise a chuckle. The bird's-eye view of the P.T. class, shot with a rooftop camera, conveys wordlessly the comedy of the rapidly diminishing line of pupils. A punch and judy show is filmed from inside the performance canopy, looking out onto the audience of small children. Their total lack of artifice is delightful to see, and underscores Truffaut's point - candour is beautiful, staginess is unacceptable. As Antoine's father frogmarches him along the street after the typewriter debacle, bemused passers-by stop to stare at the camera. Not only is this disarmingly honest, it is also profound. Cinema should exist, as it were, inside the camera, not in elaborate sets. Antoine rides in the spinning drum at the fairground, the camera fixed rigidly on him, allowing the onlookers to dissolve into an undistinguished blur. The camera IS Antoine's subjective self. The performance of 15-year-old Jean-Pierre Leaud as Antoine is astonishingly good. He is natural and engaging, and his soliloquy (delivered to the psychologist) seems an incredible piece of work for so young an actor. A long, long tracking shot accompanies Antoine as he runs away from it all, and is intended to convey, by the very rhythm of his breathing, the internal subjectivity of a child who has been let down by his parents and his society. The final freeze-frame, with no histrionic fireworks, no resounding words and no tidy denouement, closes the film on a note of immense emotional power. Antoine is alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the shining stars of the French New Wave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every day life, however 'real' and gritty it may be, is rarely portrayed on film and was certainly a rarity in the 1950's. In Europe however, there was a movement in film-making that embraced this realism and searched for the deeper meaning in the 'here and now'. This is about the most basic and miniscule portion of the meaning behind the French New Wave of the 1950's ? films that explored the filmmaker's surroundings, and eventually became an inspiration for filmmakers around the world. Francois Truffaut's 'The 400 Blows' is one of the most well-known films of this movement, and has been embraced and hailed as one of the greatest films of all time.After viewing Truffaut's 'The 400 Blows', I have been ruminating over the deeper meaning behind his story of Antoine Doinel, a 14 year old boy in Paris who is having trouble in school and trouble at home. In school, he is marginalized as a trouble-maker, yet it is obvious that it is more a matter of him causing trouble by expressing himself creatively rather than following along with mundane assignments. At home, Doinel has to deal with an adulterous mother who only pays attention to him when it suits her needs, and a father who is barely present. Doinel responds by doing the only thing he feels he can do, and that is by acting up; eventually earning an expulsion from school and being sent to a juvenile prison camp by his parents. Nothing is cut and dry in 'The 400 Blows'. If one were to take the film at face value, there would be a 'so what' feeling. What the film subtly explores is the disenfranchisement of youth. There is no joy in Doinel's life ? anytime he tries to express himself creatively or acts up in a playful way he is shot down and metaphorically forced back into line. This is not a typical Paris street kid either, this is one who reads Balzac for pleasure and conveys intense emotion. The problem is that no one is there to notice or care. Another aspect of the French New Wave was that the films were not merely a product of a Hollywood factory; these were intensely personal films to the writers and directors. In the case of 'The 400 Blows', it is certain that Doinel is based on Truffaut, himself only 28 when he made the film. Truffaut's cinematography in 'The 400 Blows' is exquisite. We see a Paris that is not in Technicolor with colorful fountains like 'An American in Paris'. This is Paris from a Parisian's perspective ? and the difference is breathtaking and intense. These are not Louis XVI style houses, they are tiny flats where people have to sleep in closets and walk up and down six flights of stairs. The city views are those of a native Parisian ? the kind of tour one would get if they asked the average Parisian for non-tourist attractions.There is still a lot that I have to learn and think about 'The 400 Blows' and French New Wave in general, but with the minute amount of understanding I have of it, I found it to be an intense film, one that left me emotional and craving enlightenment. Rarely is there a film that leaves that kind of impact on me, but Truffaut managed to leave me speechless and deep in thought with 'The Four Hundred Blows'.--Shel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent tale about childhood and the quest for liberty, masterfully shot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Les quatre-cents coups is the film that opens up the New Wave movement. I think many of the characteristics of the New Wave -as pointed out in class- can be inferred form the differences between the last film we saw in class, Carné's Les enfants du paradis, and this work by Truffaut: real life situations, no sets, everyday people. I have found in Les quatre-cents coups a brand new, refreshing and overwhelming cinema. But Les quatre-cents coups is also a dense, complicated film. Its autobiographical character makes it an encyclopedia of personal feelings, opinions and nuances of an introspection by Truffaut.Technically, the main differences between Truffaut and the previous cinema is the use of camera movements and angles. Although Renoir had made a witty and fresh use of traveling and long takes, Truffaut masters this technique as anyone else does. The camera moves smoothly, it nearly swings or floats from angle to angle following an action, as if the spectator was a ghost amid real life. Truffaut enjoys playing around with the camera: extremely long takes as we have never seen in any of the previous films: some of them in the classroom, other in Antoine's friend house, or a magnificent take at the end of the film in which we see Antoine, then a panoramic view and then Antoine again, running towards the sea. He also shoots from impossible angles, like those at the beginning from below the Tour Eiffel, or the nearly zenithal take following the jogging students in the streets. Or he teases us with the fake black out, when Antoine goes down the stairs to throw away garbage. Or shows us inner feelings through close-ups: the scene in which Antoine lies to his father telling him he did not take his map.However, I think that the most important difference between previous films and this one is the treatment of action. Truffaut is an observer, a photographer of soul. He takes a fiendish delight in shooting casual, long scenes: the boy tearing away his notebook pages; the whole sequence of Antoine's arrival at his empty home is excellent: the three reflexes in his mother's mirror -in which she will look afterwards, or Antoine combing his hair, laying the table. Also the spinning ride, or the long traveling following the escape of Antoine. They are long, but not slow. They keep tension up, as if everyday acts and decisions could be heroic and transmit the greatest interest and attraction. It looks like a documentary on human life! Some comments could be made about Antoine Doinel, alter ego of Truffaut. He is a very complicated character. The most curious thing about him is that he behaves like an adult: he acts, walks and talks like a man -especially if we compare him to his teachers or his father! However, at some times I think Truffaut describes himself as being not too witty: remember the candle in the hole on the wall, or how his friend convinces him to steal the typewriter and then makes him give it back, or how he innocently copies a whole paragraph from Balzac. He wants to be an artist, but he is not -not yet. This lack of wit and fatality -he is caught but everyone around him cheats as he does- leads him to a rebellion that grows stronger and stronger. This explain why he is such a rebel and not his friend, or the other children in the class, who live in the same social group.The main topic in Les quatre-cents coups is the quest for freedom, but not in the way Renoir looked at it, in fact is closer to L'Atalante by Vigo than to Renoir's La grande illusion, for example. Renoir is more concerned by social struggle and the liberty of the people. But Truffaut is more introspective, more intimate: indeed this film is the description of life attitude of an independent spirit through the autobiographical look of the author -this is cinéma d'auteur. We can find many elements from Truffaut's life in the film: a difficult family situation, problems at school, the Army, etc. These elements will appear throughout the film. Antoine, alter ego of Truffaut lives in the school, in his house, in the streets and finally in the juvenile detention center. In each one of these places he will find adverse situations he will have to overcome.The school The school is the first oppressing environment for Antoine. At the very beginning he is caught, by chance, with a pin-up calendar. This fatality will be recalled in Antoine's life later or -when he is caught by the porter giving the typewriter back, having been his friend's idea to steal it. He is a rebel, and nothing will refrain him from being so. He is punished, and he misbehaves again, writing in the wall an inspired poem. The school is the only place in which Truffaut makes a little bit of criticism, in this case against the education system: the three teachers are either cruel (the French teacher) or stupid (the English and Physical Education teachers).The house The house situation might be similar to that lived by Truffaut in real life. Her mother, a beautiful, egocentric and unscrupulous woman -sometimes sad, and old looking- who hates him. At the end of the film we discover that she did not want that child. This hatred and the attitude of his father -a smiley and cheerful but weak man- will add to the necessity of Antoine to flee. Truffaut gives us a Freudian wink: when his teacher asks him why he missed school, Antoine will sharply answer: 'My mom died!'The streets In the streets Antoine will find freedom, challenge, adulthood but also perversion: he becomes a man in a 13-year old boy body, little by little. But he will also become a criminal; together with his friend they will climb up in the scale of crime. He first skips classes. He and his friend stroll around the city, innocently. Then they begin an adult, abnormally rebel behavior: they make cars stop in the middle of the street, for example. The spinning ride is one of the few symbolic images in the film -that is another difference with Vigo and Renoir filmmaking. The scene of Antoine trying without success to fight against centrifuge force in a mad spinning trip really shocked me: he fights against reality and he is suffering, but he also has fun in it. Afterwards, he leaves home. . He will learn about solitude and indeed not a single word is heard in a long sequence. I really enjoyed the long, silent scene of the milk robbery. Antoine runs outlaw like an animal, we can feel loneliness, cold, hunger, sleepiness. It is another of those long, slow but at the same time agile scenes about casual acts: drinking a bottle of milk. At the end, the streets will make him a criminal. From the moment he is caught on, he is not treated as a child anymore. He wants to be an adult, and a spell will sort of be cast on him: he will be treated as such. It is significant when he is caught by the porter. He is told not to take off the hat, which made him look like an adult. From then on, he is treated roughly as if he was a man, especially in the police station.The prison And finally he arrives at the prison, which I think is the climax of oppression -we must remember the comparisons to the Army Truffaut detests. It is maybe the simplest of the scenarios, he find himself facing what he hates with no other possibility. The ending is a sublime anticlimax. After being punished for eating the bread, Antoine goes on 'normal' life within the detention center: he visits the psychologist -an ultimate introspection by Truffaut-, receives his mother and talk to his new friends and plays soccer. And suddenly, when we least expect it, he flees. He runs, runs, runs, the longest run I have ever seen, and the most exciting. He reaches the sea: his dream, and a symbol for eternity and absolute in poetry. He splashes into the water, he stops and looks back; the first time he looks right into the camera. This has got undoubtedly a deep and very personal meaning that maybe only the author knows. It is a pessimistic or an optimistic ending? I think it is above all an out-of-this-world ending. If the simple presence of the sea, Antoine's object of liberty, is overwhelming for the spectator, how should the character feel? I really liked the final traveling: we follow Antoine's run over the sand, but the camera is facing the inland, we are waiting to see the sea as much as Antoine is waiting to wet his feet. I do not really think that he is deceived, although his look into the camera is ambiguous. I think he stares at the spectator because he has realized what the truth is: the character is now out of the film. And the truth for him, I think, is this: I can reach freedom whenever I want, but absolute freedom is impossible to achieve. He is staring at us, but he is also looking back with a grave look: he might have seen his pursuer in the distance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>French cinema at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truffaut has worked wonders here, creating a masterful tale of a boy confused, troubled, and unloved. Antoine Doinel (played superbly by Jean-Pierre Léaud in the lead role) has strict, unfaithful parents, and a harsh, oppressive teacher, and falls into delinquency because of his unhappiness. He lies, steals, skips school and runs away from home, and soon ends up in a juvenile delinquency centre.Truffaut's inspiration for this film came from his own depressed childhood, so he bases Antoine on himself, including in terms of appearance. Being a 'New Wave' (a cinematographic movement of the sixties, involving directors who believed Hollywood films were too lavish and unreal) director, Truffaut always used a real location for the film, including breathtaking shots of Truffaut's native Paris. He also made a cameo in the film in the style of Hitchcock.Delinquance is the key theme here. Antoine, who is a character who believes in liberty and freedom, and the way he is always locked up is repressive for him, and this provokes a constant need for him to be out.Trying to make a realistic and moving film was Truffaut's aim, which, by watching this film, I realised that he had done amazingly well. Also, by combining humour and drama too, we have the defining French film of the 20th century. A black and white film that is full of colour. Bien sur, François Truffaut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Filmmaking by a Great Filmmaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Four Hundred Blows is the semi-autobiographical story of Antoine Doinel, a boy trapped in a life of contemtptuous authority who turns to outward rebellion. Truffaut shows his mastery of the cinema in this, his freshman attempt.The film is perfectly cast with Dionel relaying neutral facial expressions for the majority of the film. The boy, although not necessarily evoking sympathy from the audience, definitely evokes empathy. He is a pathetic character forced into his position by his teacher and his almost uncaring mother.Throughout the film, Truffaut hints at the possibility of a happy life for the protagonist, but just as soon as the ideal is given to us, it is taken away. The mood shifts in the film are fabulously orchestrated through contrasting scenes, music, and even acting. From the opening sequence through the final, enigmatic still shot, the movie is a masterpiece of both French and world cinema. It is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truffaut's powerful and moving look at adolescence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE FOUR HUNDRED BLOWS (François Truffaut - France 1959).Twelve-year-old Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) has troubles at home and at school. Ignored and neglected by his parents, his relationship with his mother is further strained when he discovers that she has taken a secret lover. Added to this, his school teachers have written him off as a trouble maker and, with luck seemingly never on his side, it is Antoine who ends up getting the blame for bad behaviour. Finding refuge only in his love of cinema, Antoine soon finds it necessary to break free and discover what the world can offer outside the confines of everyday life. I have always struggled with the labeling of this film as one of the pivotal entrances in the "Nouvelle Vague". Since Jean-Luc Godard's "Au Bout de Soufflé", who uses a completely different approach to film-making, with his restless jump-cutting and endless references to pop culture, Truffaut presents his case clear cut, as realistic as possible. But this was something completely different from the way American films portrayed juvenile delinquency so far. No iconic trouble makers like James Dean or Marlon Brando, just a realistic portrait of a twelve-year old boy sliding into isolation. The very idea alone was something novel, seldom depicted in a way like this. Much of the praise must go to Jean-Pierre Léaud, who never even seems to be acting. His every movement, thought, expression come across as completely natural. Truly, one of the most remarkable performances of such a young actor I've ever seen. Watching this over 40 years after it was made, it all looks deceptively simple, with Truffaut's perfect integration of music and image, location shooting on the streets of Paris and the naturalistic performances. Truffaut used many innovations but they are not easily noticeable as in Godard's work. This was for instance the first French film to be shot in widescreen (aspect ratio 2.35:1), which required much planning on Truffaut's part, with some surprising results. In many scenes we don't see the other person Antoine is talking to, which gives the viewer the illusion as if Antoine is almost talking directly to the camera. Jean-Pierre Léaud would continue his role as Antoine in four more films by Truffaut, "Love at Twenty" (1962), "Stolen Kisses" (1968), "Bed and Board" (1970) and "Love on the Run" (1979).Camera Obscura --- 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordiany Portrait Of A Parisian Youth - One Of The All Time Greats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In viewing François Truffaut's The 400 Blows for perhaps the fifth time, I finally began to realize its true greatness. Inspired by the director's childhood, The 400 Blows (Truffaut's first film) is primarily about a young boy growing up with his mother and stepfather in Paris and apparently heading into a life of crime. Most adults see the boy as a troublemaker, but in the film, he is meant to be the protagonist.Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is the boy's name. He is resourceful, quiet, and does what he can to get by. At home, he has a struggling relationship with his parents, especially his mother. She is a woman of curious interests, always distracted by her incommodious son and a secret affair with a man from her job. Antoine's stepfather appears nice enough while treating his son as an equal in a good manner, although he is not really attached to him. However, both parents share common traits: they are away from home quite a bit and do not pay close enough attention to their son. Sadly enough, they only judge him by his behavior and by reports they get from other people.At school, Antoine's teacher classifies him as a menacing troublemaker. Not that it is entirely Antoine's fault, he just has terrible luck. In the opening scene of the film, we see a poster with a half-naked woman on the front being passed around quietly by the students. The teacher is sitting at his desk with his head down, grading papers, until the poster comes to Antoine and he finds it. He sends Antoine to the corner of the room, where he writes a note of resentment on the wall. As punishment for that, he is to diagram the exact words that he wrote. At home that night, Antoine's homework is interrupted. Because he did not complete it, his good friend René convinces him to skip school the next day, although Antoine is reluctant at first. They walk around France and notice Antoine's mother kissing a man that is not her husband. She and her son make eye contact, but René assures his friend that everything will be alright. The next morning, as the boys return to school, Antoine lies to his teacher and says the reason he missed school was that his mother died. Everything is alright until his mother, furious, arrives at school and her son is immediately identified as a liar.And yet, we see Antoine alone at home in some private, subtle, and hopeful moments. One of them being, his love for Balzac. He adores him, and we see him reading his biography and lighting a candle in a shrine in his honor at home. One day, at school, the students are proposed to write an essay on an important event in their life, and Antoine chooses the topic of his grandfather's death, in which he incorporates a phrase from his Balzac book. Alas, the teacher identifies this as plagiarism, and sends Antoine out of the classroom, along with René. The two boys stay at René's house for quite some time, living up to the expectations of a life of crime, until they steal a typewriter leaving Antoine caught trying to return it. He is later sent to a juvenile delinquent detention home.The 400 Blows is not meant to be a tragedy. Rather, it is a character study following Antoine Doinel's life and decisions he makes as a direct result of the many things going on in it. Even The 400 Blows captures a few moments of happiness joy. One of these is a priceless sequence in which a gym teacher is leading Antoine's class for a jog through Paris, not realizing that the boys are peeling off and running away two by two. There is another scene after Antoine's shrine for Balzac catches on fire and his parents are stressing and yelling at him. His mother suggests an outing to a movie theater, where they end up going. After the film, we see the trio in the car, laughing and reflecting on what they had seen. We see this as a moment of hope for Antoine and his family, for this being the only time they are all happy together.There are many poignant moments however, emerging late in the film after Antoine is caught for stealing the typewriter. His father is fed up with his behavior and escorts him to a police station where he is sent to a jail cell and later in a police wagon full of prostitutes and thieves, with his face peering through the bars, full of tears. His parents discuss with the authorities that they cannot not take him back because they believe he will only run away again. So, in turn, their son is taken to the juvenile delinquent school. These sequences express a reality of Antoine's life, in tune with the outcome of himself. He remains quiet and reserved towards the end of the film, as if he has nothing to say. The story of Antoine Doinel and his many experiences allow a life to be filled with curiosity and exploration. Every second of the ninety-nine minutes of the film is not wasted. Truffaut allows every minute to be overflowing with creativity while still maintaining the central story of the protagonist. It is not a film that can be taken lightly as a family movie to be watched every Saturday night. It is a film to be given plenty of thought, carefully examined, and given a conclusion. The genius of the film does not rely on that, moreover, it relies on how much is put into the film. Down to the smallest detail, the film is able to maneuver and progress. The story contains elements of sadness, regret, family, warmth, happiness, humor, values, and choices. Just like life itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorable Story With Thoughtful Direction By Truffaut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The memorable story of young, troubled Antoine is worth seeing for a good number of reasons, probably most of all for the thoughtful direction by François Truffaut. It stands out from most other movies about troubled youths, both in the way that it portrays the main character and in making such good use of seemingly minor events in showing how they shape Antoine's life.As Antoine, Jean-Pierre Léaud (in the role with which he would always be identified) strikes a nice balance in making his character come to life without making any of his actions seem forced or over-dramatic. Truffaut sets things up for him perfectly, by presenting a great variety of situations in his life that allow Antoine's character to come out naturally. Many of the settings are in themselves interesting and creative, despite being located in familiar types of places.The story is written carefully so as to allow the viewer to identify with and sympathize with Antoine, while still seeing his faults clearly. What is often the most affecting thing about it is the way that Truffaut shows how even the most commonplace kinds of events can have such an effect on a maturing person, if they are a source of disappointed expectations or misunderstood intentions. To make this kind of movie so effectively without relying on violent or shocking material is an admirable achievement, and it repays careful thought and attention while watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense emotional journey of one boy's early life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of the greatest I have ever seen. It depicts some events in the life of Antoine Doinel, a young French boy who gets into a lot of trouble no matter what he does. This was the first film by Francois Truffaut, and I believe that it is filmed with such an innocence that you can really feel some of the emotions that Antoine feels. I love the simple style of this film, and I think it adds to its charm. The story is can even be painful to watch as one sees all of the things that happen to Antoine. I think that the reason for the strong emotions embedded in this film is that it is semi-autobiographical. I think the cinema is what rescued Truffaut from a life like his protagonist.In short, an inspiration to all filmmakers-they DEFINITELY don't make them like this anymore!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserved Truffaut Classic Benefits Significantly from Criterion's New DVD Package</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the seminal work of the French New Wave, the 1959 directorial debut of 27-year old Francois Truffaut has such a vaunted reputation that the final film is bound to disappoint. However, the pristine print that comes with the new Criterion Collection DVD really makes me realize what a brave and emotionally resonant film he made ostensibly about his own troubled adolescence. It's worth seeing twice - once for the film itself and a second time to listen to the newly recorded commentary by Truffaut's childhood friend Robert Lachenay (the true-life inspiration for Rene in the film). Speaking in French but subtitled in English, he provides insights into the story and context of the film that no film scholar or even production associate could possibly provide. As a point of comparison, listen to the by-the-numbers commentary by film scholar Brian Stonehill (recorded back in 1992), which is thoughtful and well researched but devoid of the human factor.The film's title comes from a French colloquialism that translates into "raising hell", an appropriate reference since the story focuses on a thirteen-year old hellion named Antoine, living in a poor section of Paris and neglected by parents downright arrogant in their dysfunctional nature. Antoine consequently lives a street urchin's life as he lies to people in authority - his parents, his teachers, and the police - since he admits rather sadly that the truth doesn't make any difference. Truffaut tracks Antoine's life through a series of dispiriting episodes that ultimately lead him to be sent away to a reformatory after he gets caught returning a stolen typewriter and his mother and stepfather tire of their responsibility over him. To Truffaut's immense credit, the film feels stark and naturalistic without resorting to dramatic manipulation, and he finds the ideal Antoine in Jean-Pierre Leaud, who brings out the confusion, angst and wandering attention of his character in realistic terms. He is especially impressive in an apparently improvised scene where he is interviewed by the school authorities about why his life has come to this. It is heartbreaking to see how bleak his life becomes, yet Leaud imbues the incorrigible, often intolerable side of Antoine with fervor.There are several interesting extras included with the 2006 DVD package starting with two separate interviews with Truffaut, the first a year after the film's release discussing he film's impact and the second five years later when we see the filmmaker in a more reflective mood about his cinematic influences. Leaud is featured in 16mm screen test footage where his naturally ebullient personality emerges and then after the 1959 Cannes Film Festival where puberty has apparently kicked in and then in 1965 as a comparatively reserved twenty-year old. The screen test of Richard Kanayan (who has a minor role as a schoolmate) is amusing for his Satchmo-inspired rendition of "When the Saints Go Marching In" and his eerie resemblance to Fantasy Island's Tattoo, Herve Villechaize. Be forewarned that the film is relentlessly downbeat, but Truffaut's emotional investment and consummate abilities as a filmmaker, even at this stage of his career, make this essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>François Truffaut was one of the best French critics past director and his letter is "Les 400 coups", a good example of this. The start of the "Antoine Doinel" (Jean-Pierre Léaud), series is dedicated to a movie fresh, dynamic, without a second to rest or boredom. A perfect example That cinema should be culture and at the same time, entertain, serve as escape. And that Truffaut has succeeded in most of his films, something that few directors have achieved.François Truffaut is responsible for this dark urban tale, the film summit "novelle vague" French, one of the best debuts in film history. This debut feature tells the vicissitudes of "Antoine Doinel" a child whose life does not smile, your teacher will not tolerate it, hates his mother and his father ends up feeling the same after "Antoine" and best friend begin to make mischief.It is a beautiful but very sad story, drawn with great skill and with a screenplay by Marcel Moussy with Truffaut. It is a deeply self-biographical film, and dedicated to his mentor André Bazin.The film is well made, has a good photography, with a melancholy and nostalgic soundtrack, excellent performances for both children and adults, and an argument that many will shed tears for its crudeness. This works and this film take place among the great films of the good cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Luckily Truffaut didn't stop with `The Four Hundred Blows"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Four Hundred Blows (Quatre cents coups, Les )" ***. (1959, French, R, 94 min Directed and co-written by François Truffaut with Jean-Pierre Léaud, Claire Maurier, Albert Rémy). `The Four Hundred Blows' is idiomatic French for raising hell. Which I found to be a strange title after someone explained the meaning. No one in this movie is really raising hell nor forcing hell on others. Antoine Doinel (Léaud) is a 14 year-old Parisian boy and a superficial view of his life is not idyllic but hardly hellish. His mom (Maurier) isn't the most attentive person in the world. She is busy with a lot of things besides being a mom. She has a lover, a fact about his mom that isn't a point of pride with Antoine. Antoine has a stepfather (Rémy). Again, not the most attentive of parents. Antoine isn't a good student. All in all it's not the easiest of lives but nothing worth raising hell about. And the hell he raises, isn't that big a deal. He skips school. He gets caught stealing a typewriter. (Actually he gets caught returning the typewriter when he finds out he can't fence it.) Antoine ends up in a reformatory and escapes, ending up on the shores of the North Sea. In what has become a relatively famous scene from French cinema, Antoine turns back from the sea and looks straight into the camera. What's intriguing and very good about `The Four Hundred Blows' is Truffaut's story telling techniques. It is a very straightforward telling of a few events. The camera often holds on a subject for a very long time. In one scene, a police or school psychiatrist is questioning Antoine and the camera never moves from his face. Truffaut is very matter of fact about the events of Antoine life. There are no really bad people in Antoine's life. It doesn't seem overly traumatic that he skips school, sees his mother with her lover, or that his parents agree to send him to a reform school. In the final scene on the shores of the North Sea, we see a confused and sad young kid. Is he going to lead a life of raising hell, a life of stifling boredom, or will he accomplish greatness? Truffaut doesn't tell us and it made me want to see the sequel. Luckily Truffaut didn't stop with `The Four Hundred Blows.' `Love at Twenty', `Stolen Kisses', `Bed and Board' and `Love on the Run' continue this semi-autobiographical story of the young Parisian.`The Four Hundred Blows' is available on video. I recommend you rent it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull and pointless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off, I would like to point out that I am not a hater of foreign or B&amp;W films, and I also have respect for different artistic styles in cinema. But this film was simply terrible.The protagonist fails to develop or evolve in any way. So many people have described the boy as being "misunderstood", and authority is considered the villain...but this is NOT a film about a misunderstood child being victimised for no reason. He is given plenty of fair opportunities to improve and redeem himself from his selfish, reckless actions, but he shoots them all down and continues to do wrong until his parents are forced to go to extreme measures to control him...and even then, he does not change. There is absolutely no character journey.We are also shown a great amount of long, pointless shots that do nothing to advance the plot, nor carry any discernible symbolism.The whole experience is a slow, dull observation of a dislikable boy reaping what he has sewn time and time again, without learning from his mistakes. Painfully pointless, and unrecommended if you value good characters and plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Living a wild life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film aka "the four hundred blows" is a mistranslation.Faire les 400 coups" means"to live a wild life. As a French,I'm stunned when I see the popularity of this good ,but by no means outstanding film. 1.It's not the first film of the "nouvelle vague" move;check Agnes Varda's "la pointe courte",(1956)Alain Resnais's "Hiroshima mon amour"(1958),Claude Chabrol's "le beau serge"(1958) are anterior .Historically,"les 400 coups " comes after. 2.The "nouvelle vague" was sometimes ponderous and hard on their predecessors:Overnight,Julien Duvivier,Henri-George Clouzot,Claude Autant-Lara ,Yves allégret and a lot of others were doomed to oblivion.THis selfishness and this contempt is typically "nouvelle vague".You 've never heard (or read) the great generation of the thirties (Renoir,Carné,Grémillon,Duvivier already,Feyder) laugh at ,say,Maurice Tourneur or Max Linder.So,thanks to Truffaut and co,some people will never discover some gems of the French fifties or forties(Duvuvier's "sous le ciel de Paris",Autant-Lara's "douce",Yves Allégret's "une si jolie petite plage " and "man?ges").THe novelle vague clique went as far as saying that William Wyler,Georges Stevens and Fred Zinemann were worthless! 3."Les 400 coups " is technically rather disappointing:it's very academic ,the story is as linear as it can be,the teachers are caricatures,and the mother Claire Maurier delivers such memorable lines as (you've got to be a French circa 1960 to understand how ridiculous it is): Well ,your father 's got only his brevet (junior school diploma)and,as for me ,I've got only my high school diploma!You've got to know,that circa 1960,hardly 10%of the pupils had the HSD in France! Antoine Doinel should have been proud of his mother after all!She wants him to have diplomas,who can blame her? 4.Compared to the innovations of "Hiroshima mon amour",which features a brand new form,and a new "fragmented " content,"les 400 coups " pales into significance.Truffaut will master a new form only with the highly superior "Jules and Jim", helped by the incomparable Jeanne Moreau. 5.The interpretation is rather stiff;Jean-Pierre Léaud ,arguably listenable when dubbed in English ,is still decent,but he will soon degenerate into the most affected of his generation. 6.The topic=stolen childhood had better days,before (Julien Duvivier's "Poil de carotte" ,Luis Bunuel's "los olvidados") and will have after (Maurice Pialat's "l'enfance nue",Kenneth Loach's "Kes") I do not want to demean Truffaut,his movie is not bad,but,frankly,French movie buffs,prefer "Jules and Jim" "l'enfant sauvage" (a film honest ,true and commercially uncompromizing to a fault)"l'argent de poche"(as academic as "400 coups" but much more funny)or his nice Hitchcock pastiche "vivement dimanche".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild Child</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francois Truffaut's first feature, and like many first features it's semi-autobiographical. Well, there's nothing wrong with that. As Joyce advised, "Wipe your glosses with what you know." There are only two cautions to be observed. One is that your first story, about yourself, doesn't turn you into a moral paragon. The second is that, having gotten that initial material out of your system, you have the industry and talent to go on to other things -- not necessarily less personal, but less heavily invested. Truffaut managed to rise well above his beginnings.Jean-Pierre Leaud is the boy of about twelve who lives in a shabby and cramped apartment in Paris with a mother who, though she sometimes tries her best to act otherwise, doesn't really want him and never has. Leaud's father doesn't mind the kid, but things are tough. Both parents work. The mother is being unfaithful and the father is distant.So Leaud begins to get into trouble at school. (And what a run-down, working-class school it is.) He writes graffiti, gets caught, gets punished, but seems to learn nothing from it, nor from forging a note excusing his absence by claiming that his mother has died. He winds up running away from home, stealing a typewriter, getting caught, and sent to an "observation camp" where he's subject to tough love and interviews by a social worker. He runs away from the camp too and the last scene is of Leaud chugging along a wide strand, splashing through the tiny waves of icy sea water.Truffaut doesn't give Leaud easy excuses. He's gone through tribulations, certainly, but so have many of the other kids in his class. And at least Leaud wasn't sexually abused as a child -- the kiss of death in movies these days. But his story isn't one of a born delinquent either. He takes no pleasure in destroying things or in hurting or disappointing others. He exploits nobody.And the parents themselves aren't evil or weak. Their foibles are recognizably human. His parents only rarely indulge him but they never beat him. The boy may live in a bare apartment with cracked walls and not enough furniture or heat, but so do his mother and father, so they're subject to the same physical stressors.In fact, there's nobody in the whole movie who is entirely evil or entirely good, despite the fact that the film is in black and white.There is a vein of comedy in it too. Their language teacher is trying to get them to pronounce English correctly. "Where is the girl?", he asks one student in clear and precise tones. "At the bitch," replies the student, and the teacher explodes in a volcano of insults in French -- and he stutters! Overall, what you're most likely to get out of this film is a sense of Truffaut's abiding pity for the human condition. Take the Punch and Judy show that we see a couple of dozen young kids watching. The camera pans slowly across their faces, and we see them laughing and yelling -- and we see their misshapen heads, their diminutive chins, their crossed eyes, and those ears that kids of that age tend to have, like African elephants sticking out from their skulls, all ready to flap with excitement. You have to love kids to love that kind of ugliness.The style is grainy and documentary with only occasional touches of art that are noticeable enough to call attention to themselves. Two kids sit on a bench in a wintry garden and talk about their hated parents while the camera deliberately lifts itself to a syrupy statue above them in which a loving mother is kissing a cherub.And that last shot -- a freeze frame of Leaud on the beach at the end of his tether, unable to go forward into the sea, unable to retreat to the camp he's just escaped from. The image is still and Leaud is captured staring into the camera lens, waiting, as it were, for the audience to judge him. We, the jury.Truffaut was one of the New Wave of French directors, most of them formerly critics for a French magazine. (They gave us the term "film noir.") Jean-Luc Goddard was another. But I think Truffaut leaves Goddard in the dust. Goddard is far more fashionable because of his on-screen pyrotechnics. He up-ended the grammar of film, as if to say, "Look at me, Ma!" What he did to editing alone was what Sinead O'Connor did to the Pope's photo. And he was political in the right way for the time. But he lacks Truffaut's essential humanity or, let's be honest, his humility. Maybe it's just me but compassion seems a more evolved emotion than aggression. I wonder if Truffaut ever read Rousseau.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made but the story just didn't grab me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>François Truffaut's "The 400 Blows" is routinely listed as one of the greatest films in all of foreign cinema. At the time of its release it was hailed as an important film and subsequently proved to be immensely influential in the context of the French New Wave.The semi-autobiographical story concerns a Parisian adolescent (Jean-Pierre Léaud) who attempts to escape problems at home and at school by delving into a life of petty crime. Unfortunately, he never receives more than a temporary respite from his predicament and frequently ends up deeper in trouble. The script is fairly loose and strives for realism above all else.Enforcing Truffaut's aim of realism is the group of actors that he assembled. Léaud indisputably carries the film, at once delivering an authentic performance while also showing a maturity beyond his years. While not quite as impressive, the supporting cast is nevertheless uniformly solid, perhaps none moreso than Guy Decomble as Antoine's antagonist at school.Truffaut's direction is exceedingly well-handled, not to mention impressive for a debut feature. The film also sports attractive cinematography and a lively score by Jean Constantin.Indeed, the film can scarcely be faulted for any flaw in its construction or execution. Instead, my tempered enthusiasm is the result of feeling a certain amount of detachment from the main character. Naturally, this sort of objection is largely personal so your mileage may vary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I personally didn't like it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is Francois Truffaut's classic. This is considered to be a classic of French cinema but I respectfully disagree. In my opinion, repeat IN MY OPINION this movie does have a lot of problems.The plot of this movie is that Antoine is a child in France who has negligent parents and frequently gets in trouble with his teacher frequently. He takes it upon himself to run away from home (for little reason) and when returning steals money and other objects.Firstly, there is not one character to sympathize with. Antoine was clearly someone to feel sympathy for, but who feels sympathy for someone who skips school only to arrive the next day and say his mother died. I couldn't see him as anything other than a petty criminal who couldn't take the punishment he was given.Then there are parts of this movie that are just weird in terms of action and reaction. If a child almost burns down your house by accident what would be a logical move? a) punish the kid and move the matches to a place where he couldn't find them or b) go watch a movie at the cinema. If you thought a) then you would be wrong. I know they're negligent but this is just ridiculous.So that is the 400 Blows. In my eyes it is not a good movie but in most others it is a classic. If you want to watch it then that is fine. If you have a problem with stuff like what I said above then don't watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's of course ridicules to call this movie a bad one but as far as so called new wave French movies go, this isn't the best example of it, in my opinion.Can't really see how people can call this one of the most powerful and emotional drama's ever made, unless you perhaps had a tough youth yourself and can identify yourself with its young main character. Perhaps it's also due to the fact that it is of course being placed in a totally different time period, at also a different country and culture but personally I couldn't really place myself in his shoes because throughout the movie he's doing some things that I can't see myself ever doing or saying to someone.But this is perhaps also one of the powers of the movie, at the same time. It's not showing things and people as just black and white, good or bad but it more shows that nobody is truly a good or a bad person. Sometimes it are certain circumstances that force us to do things in order to 'survive' in this world. Whether or not you like it, you sometimes have to do things you know you're later going to regret.In that regard this is a quite good random slice of life, or a coming of age movie. You could take the movie both these ways really, since it for a change is a movie that entirely focuses on its young main character and tells the entire story from his perspective. It's an original but also risky approach to the genre, that in this case did work out, also really thanks to Jean-Pierre Léaud, who plays the young boy.So it all in all really remains a well put together movie, by François Truffaut, that just didn't really ever got to me at a more emotional level. Extra praise should be send Truffaut's way though, since this movie actually was his first full length movie and he made at a quite a young age as well. Definitely not a bad first movie by him, though thankfully still he and his movies grew better over the years.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

I only have seen three and I'm a little bit hesitated to watch "Fahrenheit 451".The 400 blows has some powerful meanings and many appreciate it for its historical importance as one of the first (if not the first already) new wave movies in French cinema history.The best thing in the movie .. in my point of view is the kid Jean-Pierre Léaud performance.The movie is dated .. still has some of its wonderful meanings but it is not a joy to watch, I believe.Watch it out of curiosity .. after all, it is just my opinion and you probably need a 2nd opinion about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truffaut's Bulls-eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 400 Blows is a film that every teenager must see. When I was 14 (Antonie's age in the film I suppose), I hated everything. I hated school, I hated living with my parents, and I didn't want to be subordinate to society on the whole. To put it simply, I wanted to just get out there and live my life instead of being picked on by school teachers and essentially be an outcast amongst my peers, who were spoiled rich white males thinking with their you know whats instead of their brains. Antonie Doinel is a character who used his mind and what did he get? He was sent to reform school. He possesses the traits of every average adolescent male. He wants to expand his mind (he reads Balzac), doesn't do his work, riles up the teacher, doesn't really get along with his parents (although his father seems to have more vested interest in the boy), defaces classroom walls, and looks at and defaces pinups. Quite simply, his character is one of the most complex to ever be created.In short, The 400 Blows is about an unwanted teenaged boy who submits to the world of petty crime when the rest of the world has turned his back on him. There's an interesting line that Antoine's father says to him at the beginning of the film. The boy is running back from the grocery store with flour for his mother and he runs into his dad coming home from work. "Always running son, eh?" And that's what we see for the full 99 minutes of The 400 Blows. Sure, Antoine is actually running (especially at the emotional climax) but he's psychologically running away from the very people holding him back from breaking out in the world, be it his parents, the authorities, and so forth. There is so much other things that we see that cannot be fit into this review. Antoine and his friend Rene skip school one day and go around town. Antoine goes into a gravitron, which is an amusement park ride that spins around in circles. And that's what his life is doing: he may enjoy the ride for the time being, but he's ending up where he started from.The film is not without humor, though. One cannot help but laugh when Antoine tells his teacher after skipping class that his mother died. "Personal preference obviously," his father says in response to the mother venting about such news. Also, Antoine's letter to his parents explaining why he ran away sounds like an adult wrote it, but there is some humor to it. "We'll discuss all that's happened" it says. Even Antoine getting expelled from school after plagiarizing Balzac is pretty humorous and he decides not to go home and live with Rene. They end up stealing little things such as posters, clocks, and they go to the movies. However, when he pinches a typewriter from his father's office, that's the end of his little rebellion. He is sent to a correctional facility (and this is an emotional scene, as the boy is placed in a police wagon and cries as he takes a look of the streets of Paris at night). Perhaps the most emotional scenes take place in the final portion of the film. Antoine is placed under psychiatric evaluation, where he reveals he was born out of wedlock and his mother wanted an abortion (this is hinted at in the beginning when he runs in on a conversation between two old ladies talking about forceps and a Cesarean section...perhaps they were indeed talking about an abortion procedure. Antoine feels uncomfortable around this conversation and we can see it). He can't see Rene when he visits, and his mother tells him he's on his own (although I wished Antoine would've told her "I hate you").After briefly listening to a young delinquent who was caught trying to escape, Antoine decides to do so and bolts during a soccer game. We just see Antoine running, and running, and running. There's no music at first until he gets to the ocean. Truffaut pulls the cameras back and we see an endless horizon, endless opportunities for our young protagonist. The musical score plays and this is where I continue to get misty eyed with every viewing. Antoine, who has never seen the ocean, runs within the current, but has nowhere to go. The film ends in the famous freeze frame with a closeup of the boy's face. Either he's been caught, doesn't know what to do, or this mimics the mugshot sequence that we saw before he went into the correctional facility. The ending leaves a lot to the imagination, but there's one thing that cannot be imagined: The 400 Blows is easily the most touching film I've ever seen. I don't think I'll see another one quite like this.Everything seems to lock into place here. The acting superbly executes brilliant dialogue. Truffaut has some innovative camera movements (the darkening of the corridor while Antoine takes out the garbage and the final shot are examples of this) throughout. The musical score is beautiful. And, France isn't portrayed as this very romantic country. No, it is dark, it is gloomy. This is the dark side of this very storied nation. Here, Francois Truffaut tells his story to the viewer. When I first bought 400 Blows, I didn't know what to expect. I figured I'd pick it up because 46 years after its initial release there was still a lot of critical buzz around it. I'm glad I spent the 30 dollars on this film, easily my favorite of all time next to 2001: A Space Odyssey.I only have one complaint: I wish I'd have seen The 400 Blows when I was 14. It probably would have saved my life more than the music I was listening to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very sad movie about a neglected boy and the adults who brutalize him.Filmed in evocative black and white, this movie does a great job of showing this kid's isolation. His shallow, self-centered mother uses him as a chore servant. His father's only contribution seems to have been giving him a last name. His snarling teacher barely tolerates him. And his supervisor at the reformatory is memorable only for giving the boy one of the more loathsome slaps on film. How interesting that the boy is seen at his most vulnerable in what seems to be his only sincere interaction with an adult, during an interview with an unseen female psychologist. I caught this movie on TCM and was disappointed to hear that some four other sequel movies followed with actor Leaud and director Truffaut. For me, this fact took some of the power from the final scene of this film, in which the boy has run as far as he can. His final expression is devastating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is all about simplicity, but that doesn't stop it from being a masterpiece. Many times the most simple things are the best. Simplicity is often the right road to go far.François Truffaut must have directed this film with all his dedication, heart and soul. It's realistic, touching, sensitive and human. It does a very good job in showing the existence's crisis faced by the teenagers, as well as showing how hard life can be in that complex phase of life. It also feels very nostalgic for many reasons, but it would take me forever to number them here. Another thing which this movie triumphs is when it comes to settings by showing us the streets of Paris and many different areas of this city fondly known as the "City of Lights". The soundtrack is magnificent, it sounds so sad, so deep, so intense and so beautiful.All in all, a wonderful movie, with very little to be improved. Even its ending is very expressive. There is something inspiring about that ending and it makes me wanna do the same thing. Antoine Doinel runs away to a beach, finally experiencing the sea. He wets his feet, but doesn't take his shoes and socks off. That "freezed" final shot of him looking at the camera accents the originality and makes it more memorable. I think that if he got into the water and swam (with a "freezed" final shot either), that would make the ending even more memorable. Jean-Pierre Léaud is wonderful in the role of Antoine Doinel, a normal however troublesome 14-year-old boy. I mean, look at the way he is treated. His teacher hates him. His parents are a disaster together and give little credit to the boy. Can you blame him? But, as I said, the actor is wonderful. You don't see young actors like this anymore: this expressive, this natural, this charismatic, this confident in front of the camera, this talented... they're a vanishing breed.Although of dramatic nature, there are elements of comedy in this great film. Certain scenes really make me laugh like few movies do now. Antoine Doinel is often funny and so is his good friend René (brilliantly portrayed by Patrick Auffay). Richard Kanayan is hilarious in every scene he shows up, even though his role is minor and he barely talks. But the things he does, combined with his figure and the actor's charisma and talent, make him hilarious. Guy Decomble is priceless as the impatient and short-tempered but hilarious French teacher, "fondly" nicknamed 'Petite Feuille' by his pupils.Just about all the kids are very good. Claire Maurier and Albert Rémy are interesting choices to play Antoine's parents and they convince.Title in Portugal: 'Os 400 Golpes'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>French moviemakers have always really great with children. From the 1930's (Poil de carotte) to the 1960's (Guerre des boutons) or more recently (Le Petit Prince a dit, 1992), childs in French movies seems always realists, themselves. They don't act like little adults or stupid human beings. Les 400 Coups is sure the best picture ever made with a child. It's also the first movie of master Truffaut and probably his best work, along with Jules et Jim. But Truffaut will have a very bad idea after that: make other films with the same kid growing up, become an adult. The problem is that Leaud will grown up to be a pretty bad actor. He's great in this movie, probably because he never think, at that time, that he will become an actor. I love everything in the movie, but I have a little preference for the scene where the little kids look at a puppet show. Their faces are amazing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent but not memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I confess I didn't seem to like this film nearly as much as most people here seem to have, and unlike them I don't have much to say. I understand why people love/loved this film. When it was released, it was original and inspirational. Nothing else like it existed. The characters are easy to understand and relate to, the story as well. Nothing wrong there. However, it was mostly the way the film was shot that ruined it for me. It's full of long, metaphoric, unimportant shots that really just confused me rather than appealed to me. I often wondered just when is Truffaut going to end this overly-long shot, not out of suspense but out of frustrated boredom. Overall it's a simple, sad story that will leave you sad and confused. I respect it for it's craftsmenship, but it's not even remotely entertaining or thought-provoking. I'm sure people would accuse me for being shallow, but this is an honest opinion and I have studied and read about this film. I have thought much about it, and I'm still of the same opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We need films like this today. Desperately. (possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The 400 blows' immediately introduces its hero in a breathless credit sequence: I mean the Eiffel Tower, glimpsed from different angles as the camera drives through the streets of Paris, emerging from behind buildings, through trees, opening onto avenues. It is a magnet - wherever you go you move towards it - and a totem. This sequence is transposed later, when Antoine goes to the funfair, and rides on one of those moving cylinders, like a zoetrope. The comparison is deliberate - Truffaut is situating his film in film history, declaring his intention to start again, to get back to first principles, to a time when moving pictures was a medium of possibility, before it was bogged down by genre and the studio system. this zoetrope has a transformative power - it takes a character from neo-realism and abstracts him, turning him into a figure in a Grand Guignol, crawling in eternal circles. But, from his point of view, it completely transforms the outside world, from a thing of oppressive solidity content to stare in powerful distance, to a formless, unstable mass. This sequence crystallises the power of Truffaut's film, its freedom and its concern with entrapment. It charts the decline into imprisonment of its main character with a style of buoyant liberation. So while Antoine is trapped in this barrel, he is also offered a new way of looking beyond those merely content to look on from the outside.'The 400 Blows' is the first masterpiece of the nouvelle vague, that iconoclastic movement that briefly saved cinema from stagnation as an art-form, just as it declared that it was an art-form (hmm, a connection?). It's a cliche now that Truffaut was the least innovative of the New Wavers, and yet it's still surprising that a film built so classically (moving from Paris to the countryside; balancing the opening school scene, with its barred doors, with the closing borstal scene etc.) still achieves that tingling spontaneity so rare in the cinema (e.g. Jean-Pierre Leaud as an actor laughing with the crew as Albert Remy breaks an egg). The first viewing of '400' is such a rush you'd be forgiven for thinking that it, like 'A Bout de souffle', was made up on the spot, and it is only on subsequent viewings that you marvel at Truffaut's formal control, the rhythm of his camera movements and editing, the consideration of his compositions. That image of spinning round a fixed pole is the one that haunts me. Just as the decline of Michel Poiccard in the Truffaut-scripted 'A Bout de souffle' is figured as a car running out of steam, so Antoine is forever running in circles, brought back to a fixed point, having gotten nowhere. To move is to live - that is why the final freeze-frame is so frightening: Antoine has usurped the Eiffel Tower, has become the centre of the spinning top - he dominates the closing frame, just as the opening ones were empty (of humans). But at what cost? - has he simply wound down into inertia?: the subsequent Doinel films would suggest so. (that closing beach scene, in which Antoine seems to be running against moving, phosphorescent sand, also alludes to another great work about a young artist and his city, Joyce's 'Ulysses' and its chapter 'Proteus')Although the film rarely shoots directly from his point of view, the style is an exuberant expression of Antoine's sensibility. Antoine is ambisexual, still seeking his identity, just before seeking sexuality - early on he sits at his mother's dressing table, his face splintered by the triptych mirrors; later he steals supplies from the ladies' toilet. This embodying of subjectivity in objective style is what saves the closing third from de Sica-like sentimentality and manipulation: we are rarely outside Antoine's head, people are wonderful or horrible as he experiences them. Only twice is his sensibility intruded on - when he is caught bringing back the typewriter, the captor creeping his point of view; and the interview with the faceless psychologist at the borstal, filmed as if behind a double-sided mirror, the feral animal penned at last.'The 400 blows' is revered as a moving, melancholy picture of misdirected adolescence. It is sometimes forgotten that most of the film is pure comedy, delighting in gags, digressions, bits of business. For much of the running time, you envy Antoine - what joy it must be to be young and in Paris, swashbuckling in the schoolyard, truanting in the city, smoking cigars: his family situation is no worse that most, at least he has friends, a roof over his head, and can read Balzac. Antoine is a bit of a clown: all clowns eventually settle down, make the right choices at crucial moments in their lives. Antoine somehow misses those rarely visible choices and finds himself locked up, descending the various levels of institutional hell. His often amiable and/or witty parents are no more evil than he is a saint, although an educational system that asks kids to simply copy down 'great' poems (a Sisyphean task in one ink-blotted case) is clearly wrong. Georges Delerue's score - romantic, exuberant, tragic, bittersweet - ranks with the three greats ('Vertigo', 'Taxi Driver', 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg').</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good movie, but hardly brilliant or a classic.A boy, Antoine Doinel, is often in trouble at school and doesn't get along with his parents, especially his mother. He briefly runs away from home but then returns (or is returned...). After a while he ups the ante and turns to petty crime...Interesting drama. It also has its lighter side. There are many moments of comedy - the scene with the gym teacher taking the class for a walk was priceless! However, hardly the classic this is made out to be. Directed by Francois Truffaut, this is regarded as being the vanguard of the French New Wave movement. But it really isn't THAT good. It is hardly profound - the plot is a few weeks/months in the life of a early/mid-teens boy. There is no big realisation at the end, or plot closure.Even as a character-based film it is not fantastic. Yes, you feel some empathy for and engagement towards the boy but he is more villain than hero. (The adults are hardly saints either, I might add).Worth watching though, as it is a reasonable story, and to see what all the fuss is about...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title of the film is The 400 Blows but its actually an expression for 'Raising Hell.'Made in 1959 in a cinema verite style. This is the full screen debut of Francois Truffaut and an example of the French New Wave. It was a critical hit.Jean-Pierre Leaud plays Antoine Doinel, a misunderstood teenager in Paris who constantly gets into trouble at school and an at home. Doinel is based partly on Truffaut himself.Doinel finds school boring, does not get on with his teachers who usually catch him telling lies including an embarrassing one where in a panic he tells that one of his parent has died. At home he is alone a lot as both parents are working. His glamorous mother (Claire Maurier) seems to have little time for him. He gets on better with his father (Albert Remy) who is more playful but as the film progresses, he is actually the step-father and you also learn that his mother is having an affair. Doinel wants love but his step- father seems too weak (he suspects his wife is cheating) his mother too busy but he seems happiest when she does give him attention such as towelling him down after a bath.Doinel and his best friend Rene get into all sorts of scrapes and petty crime. Several times Doinel runs away from home and sleeps rough. He gets caught stealing a typewriter from his stepfather's workplace and comes into the attention of the police, social services and the judiciary. At the end he is sent to a young offender's institute that he also runs away from and onto a beach to what looks like an uncertain future.However Truffaut would re-visit Doinel over the course of his directing career.Seeing this film it becomes apparent how much this influenced British New Wave in the 1960s. So much of this film reminded me of Kes by Ken Loach which its naturalistic acting. Its obvious now how much the film Kes was inspired by this film. Just look at the mischievous scene where the sports teacher takes the class for a walk around the streets of Paris and few by few the kids disappear. Then there is the very naturalistic scene at the Punch &amp; Judy show where the the much younger kids are enjoying themselves. The city is a playground but when Doinel is living rough its also oppressive and scary.Of course as time has gone on the shock value of the out of control adolescent has been lost with newer, more franker films. The French New Wave also had a different way of telling stories in the cinema that someone like me brought up on a diet of junk Hollywood blockbusters might not always appreciate. The film can be a little too wayward and loose.However the final freeze frame of a boy fulfilling his dream of seeing the sea but still alone and lost is regarded as a classic. Apparently the first time a film ends in a freeze frame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very colorful black and white film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A "French New Wave" director Francois Truffaut's first feature film The 400 Blows (1959) is mainly based on the real story of Truffaut's childhood which establishes the new theories for the modern cinema. The 400 Blows against the classical Hollywood film clichés (in a good way), and it's episodic and somewhat documentary-like cinematic techniques help to create the authentic story of a 14-year-old boy. The protagonist Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Leaud) is viewed as a trouble-making teenager among the adults. Actually, Antoine lives an unhappy life dealing with his verbally abusive mother who is having an affair with a man from work, and his kind and friendly yet not deeply attachable stepfather whom he initially considered as his biological father. His departed grandfather is the only inspiration in his life. His luck is not good. At his school, Antoine has to deal with an uninspired teacher who always doubt his talent and pictures him as nothing but as a "troublemaker". To make a matter worst, he skips school, and lies to his parents and teacher. Receiving unprofessional reputation from his school teacher, and all the negligence from his parents force him to get the statuses of a liar, a dropout, and a theft which eventually lead him to the juvenile detention home. Delinquency is the key theme in this film. Antoine believes in freedom, and he is constantly planning to escape from being locked up. Using real locations in Paris, and having unprofessional actors with some improvised dialogues define the cinematic reality in this film. It is realistic, yet it has a moving story in which Truffaut skillfully plays around with the camera to add colors to this black and white film; extremely long shots in Antoine's' running scenes, a high aerial shot of the boy jogging scene, and a series of close-ups and deep focus shots will draw the audiences in the middle of actions as well as into the main characters' mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Powerful of All of the New Wave Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1959, the world was introduced to a man who would become considered one of the pioneers in the art of filmmaking both in production and in theory, François Truffaut. Truffaut made his debut with The 400 Blows, which is widely seen as his best film and one of the greatest directorial debuts of all time. The film tells the story of Antoine Doinel, played by Jean-Pierre Léaud, who is an adolescent boy growing up in Paris. Antoine is an incredibly misunderstood boy who is continuously believed to be a trouble maker, and eventually ends up committing petty theft crimes due to neglect and resentment. The film's story draws from many of Truffaut's own experiences as an adolescent in Paris. Antoine's sadness, desire, and ambition are all reflective of the early life of Truffaut.Right from the beginning, we get the feeling that this is a very personal film from Truffaut and is drawn directly from the heart. In the opening credits there is a dedication to André Bazin, a famous French critic who served as a father figure to Truffaut and attributed to a lot of his beliefs. Given knowledge of Truffaut as a person can advance ones knowledge in understanding the personal significance for him. One in particular that is very interesting is when Truffaut claimed that cinema had saved his life, and that this was something he has shown in all of his films. The parallel in The 400 Blows is a scene in the middle of the film when Antoine and his parents go to the movies. It is one of the few moments in the entire film where there is no conflict, neglect, or resentment between the family and shows the cinema as a sort of escape for Antoine. Anyone who has ever felt a sense of neglect in their home can probably relate to this, not necessarily because of the cinema aspect, but simply in principle. One detail in the film that is interesting is the comparison of the two different views of Antoine; the vision of him as a troublemaker from his parents and teachers, and the sympathetic feeling that audience has for him as we see him more as a misunderstood boy. Antoine always seems to be caught at the wrong moment. Whenever the boys are doing something in class that is troublesome, Antoine is the only one who seems to be caught. In one scene where he is writing a French essay in class. Antoine is a fan of French novelist Honoré de Balzac and makes an homage to his work in the essay, but the teacher sees it as plagiarism rather than homage. The film's title actually refers to the negative view others have of him as the French translation of the title means "to raise hell". He is a boy of curious and independent thought and filled with sadness and neglect that happens to always be seen in a negative way.Jean-Pierre Léaud gives an excellent performance as Antoine that will leave you quite surprised with the then fourteen year old actor. Léaud's performance is so honest and sincere that it is what makes the character of Antoine feel even more real to the viewer. The scene towards the end when Antoine is speaking to the psychologist is perhaps the most honest in the film, and the feeling of sincerity in it is some of the most powerful I have seen. Throughout the film, Antoine ends up giving into a life of petty crime and even briefly goes to a facility that resembles juvenile hall. He steals a typewriter, lies to his teacher at one point, and is even seen smoking in one scene, but it's Léaud's innocent filled performance that shows the audience that Antoine is not just this troublemaker that he seems to be, but was rather forced into that direction. Without this part of the portrayal, the audience may simply think that he is as bad as everyone believes.The 400 Blows is a masterful work of the art in cinema and is best representative of nearly everything Truffaut tried to capture by making films. The heart, passion, and principle are so strong in this film and they are used in such a way that only a truly talented filmmaker could do. The film is also a shining example of the Auteur theory that was proposed by the film's dedicated person, André Bazin, as well as his contemporaries which included Truffaut. The theory tells us that it is the director who is the true author of the film. Not the studio, not the screenwriter, not the actors, etc, it is the director who gives it it's human story and power. Truffaut shows us the wonderful significance of the personal story in cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 400 Blows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 400 Blows (1959) **** (out of 4) Francois Truffaut's tale of Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Leaud), a young boy who is misunderstood by his parents and teachers. He starts off with a few small outbursts but as those around him begin to turn their backs on him, Antoine's crimes grow a bit more serious. Films about out of control youths were common in the silent era and they were extremely popular in the 30s and 40s thanks to The Dead End Kids and films like WILD BOYS OF THE STREETS. The genre got even more popular with REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE and this here led to countless rip-0ffs but what's so amazing about THE 400 BLOWS is that Truffaut was able to take something we've seen countless times before and do something fresh and original with it. I thought the most important thing about the picture was the realism that the director brought to it. I thought the screenplay itself was excellent because it was very truthful to the subject and also very realistic. In most movies you have one thing that happens, which leads to a "big" scene of something worse happening. That's not really the case here because the events happen in a way that just comes across as true. There are small things that go nowhere. There are minor things that get turned into something bigger. There are fun times with the parents and bad times. I thought the entire film had a terrific flow to it and especially when you consider how many times we've seen this type of thing before. The performance by Leaud is certainly another thing that's very important and especially because there's not a single frame where you believe you're watching an actor. Instead, Leaud makes you believe that you're seeing a real kid struggling through these important years of his life. Claire Maurier as the mother, Albert Remy as the father and Guy Decomble as the teacher also add wonderful support. I certainly wouldn't call this one of the greatest films ever made but it's certainly a very important and impressive one that manages to make you think about one's actions when it comes to children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Raising Hell" - François Truffaut's French New Wave masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>François Truffaut's, "The 400 Blows," (1959) is an excellent character study of a youth living in poverty in Paris, France during the 1950's. Truffaut pulls many experiences from his own adolescent life to construct a very real telling of a troublesome young boy scorned by his teachers and parents because of his unquenchable thirst for exploration, excitement and what his superiors see as insubordination when it comes to society's rules. In under two hours Truffaut is able to tell the story of a troubled kid in Paris and subtly relate it to his own feelings about Cinema and its place in society at the time. Antoine Doinel is a young boy growing up in a small poor house in Paris under his mother and step-father's rules. After several examples of how Antoine is treated by his parents and his instructors, he decides he must run away in order to be happy. After being caught and sent back home a few times, he meets another boy with similar goals as him and the two go on a crime spree throughout Paris. Eventually, Antoine gets caught stealing a typewriter and is sent to the juvenile detention center to be rehabilitated. After only a few days he escapes the juvenile center and runs toward the sea in hopes of freedom. The film ends with a poignant freeze-frame of Antoine's face after he turns away from the sea and it is here that Truffaut freezes these characters and their story in cinematic history. These are characters forever locked into this particular story. Truffaut is drawing attention to the audience's knowledge that they just watched a film. The most important aspect of this film is not necessarily the story or characters themselves but rather the cinematic conventions that the film follows or breaks. You can compare Antoine Doinel to cinema itself in the way Truffaut see's the art form. He see's it as a young boy trying to be free and not follow society's rules. 400 Blows is a long desperate run away from conformity and to the freedom of the sea. Truffaut once said, "I demand that a film express either the joy of making cinema or the agony of making cinema. I am not interested in anything in between." He uses freeze-frames, fades, dissolves, and jump cuts to inform the audience that they are watching a film and in doing so he and his fellow colleague's practically created the French New Wave style. For all the things that 400 Blows says about society at the time, especially French society, the film's comparison to cinema itself, and the invention of a totally new cinematic movement, François Truffaut led the way for his contemporaries and himself to create new original films away from the traditional ideas of what a film had to be. The film went on to earn the 27 year old director the unique distinction of Best Director at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival and has forever changed the way movies are conceptualized and produced. One of the original auteurs, François Truffaut's "400 Blows" raises hell in the cinematic world and has gone down as one of the greatest films every made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So here is a masterpiece from Truffaut. The story revolves around a boy and his teen age life. His parents' marriage is not that good and for most of the times they blame him for all the problems. He is mischievous but the circumstances are making him do so. The ending is superb.Pros:You will find the lead child character very intriguing as there are things that you could relate to yourselves. His character has been analyzed fully. All the other supporting cast also plays their role well. The story is good and moves at a pace, which gives the viewer full chance to analyze everything that they want to. Cons:The story in the middle seemed to be too much exaggerated and looked as if they just wanted to make up a feature film. But it soon caught pace.MESSAGE: "Life is like that."VERDICT: "A must watch."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A picture about flight - but where to?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Les Quatre-Cent Coups" is arguably the French filmmaker Truffaut's most personal film, borrowing a great deal from own experiences and people around him or circumstances Truffaut could identify with. The English translation of the title unfortunately doesn't reflect the ambiguity which is prevalent in French, where the idiom "quatre cents coups (du diable)" refers to "impish pranks" or "pieces of mischief" and beatings at the same time. The emphasis does not lie on the latter in the original intention, thus setting the picture in a better context. Be it as it may: Being the first feature of Truffaut after having started out as a film critic, he knows exactly what he wants to do with the material, and it shows as he embraces realism in Paris of the 50s and 60s - real life, everyday people, situations as they happen, right until the minuscule details.What you get with "Les Quatre-Cent Coups" is not a big epic story, it's small things put together. It's a progression, a chain of consequences where cause is followed by effect, with pieces here and there adding to the downward spiral that draws Antoine Doinel more and more into it. He is a boy with hopes and dreams, trying to cope with his life the best as he can given the cards dealt to him on his spinning ride, reacting in a young adolescent's way to counter them, making mistakes, yet also attempting to correct them, nevertheless ending up running, running, running - where to? Truffault just poses the question in intense imagery, unusually long, slow and poetic scenes, with wide children's eyes starring back at the viewer, photographed in splendid black and white. An emotional journey not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I watched Francois Truffaut's "the 400 blows". I am not sure why it is called this, so if anyone can help please comment. So this is considered to be a classic, and a centerpiece for discussion in film school. In this regard, I must be ignorant. This is a classic movie, this is a good movie, but I guess I just don't understand what makes this such a big deal for film students. It is a great story about little Antoine doniel who drinks, smokes, steals, skips school, lies, and runs away repeatedly. There is no moral question directed at the viewer it is just his life, and it has been hard but not terrible, like many people's own experience, and so we are not there to judge. The character is revisited throughout truaffot's career in several films, he even uses the same actor Jean-Pierre Laud. Pretty impressive considering the films span 20 years and he started at age 13. I recently reviewed "you can count on me" in many ways this film reminded me of it, in the sense that nothing is over played but we get to understand what goes into shaping someones life. I am looking forward to seeing the further adventures of doniel, and letting you my one reader know my self important opinion. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This wonderful film, the spear point of new wave cinema, has many delightful moments. In one of them, Antoine has seen his mother consorting with her boyfriend, a fellow worker. The mother attempts to "make nice" with the 13 year old so that he will not reveal her infidelity to her husband - affectionately tucking him into bed. However, the boy's expression makes it clear that he understands his mother's selfish motive perfectly and is not buying her act.What makes the story so compelling is that Antoine is an intelligent, sensitive and compassionate child. One wants to leap into the film, grab the unfeeling adults by their throats and throttle them to force them to pay attention to him and consider his needs. At the end we realize, as Antoine perhaps also has discovered, that we are all fundamentally alone in a world of self-absorbed people like the adults who so badly neglected and misunderstood this valuable young man.</fullReview>

Amazing camera shot as well as acting by the young lead in this film we are introduced to what life would have really have been like for this young lad as he chooses to be homeless and is eventually arrested. The parallels to the school and jail as well as the boy's home and jail. This film does a brilliant job of always making the young lead stand out from the rest of the heard seemingly for no reason.

		<fullReview>Sometimes it is best to view a film with no expectations. Without thinking one way or another about how the production will turn out, there always leaves an element of surprise, be it good or bad. That is how I felt when I began watching Truffaut's The 400 Blows. I was not expecting it to be good or bad. I was just expecting to view it with an open mind, something that is rare for me.The 400 Blows was an interesting watch. Having only viewed a handful of French cinema titles, I was drawn into the differences between this coming-of-age tale from another country as opposed to the coming-of-age tales that are typically seen in America. When it comes to America, a coming-of-age tale usually has a great deal of sex, drugs, or both. There was little to none of these two elements in The 400 Blows. I appreciated the fact that Truffaut took time with characters rather than blatant salaciousness.What I appreciated most about The 400 Blows was its pseudo-documentary style. There's a scene early on where lead character Antoine is told to get out of bed. Antoine does what he is told. In most films, the director would cut as soon as the character is out of bed. However, Truffaut continues the scene long past that point with Antoine changing clothes. It is times like these that the audience almost forgets that they are watching something fictional and feel more like they are watching a documentary on someone's life. This is a style that Robert Altman would later perfect (Altman was still mainly directing television at the time of the release of The 400 Blows). Adding to the feeling of a documentary is the use of sound. There is music, there is in almost every movie, but the use of music is so low-key and soft that I hardly noticed it. One of my nit-picks with a lot of old and new films is the overuse of a loud, overbearing score that despite the intention, actually takes away from the emotion that is supposed to be taking place on screen. There's a certain amount of elegance to the way that the music is used in Antoine's story. It never takes away from the proceedings. It feels organic and welcome. There was a movie I loved when I was younger called Joe the King with Val Kilmer. The plot was nearly identical, there were several homages to The 400 Blows (which I didn't get at the time), and it was just as effective. If I were to go back and watch Joe the King now, I would probably find it nothing but a mere knock-off of The 400 Blows. I'm a comedy guy. I generally don't like watching movies that leave me feeling depressed after viewing them. My overall feeling of The 400 Blows could best be summed up with a quote from a character in the picture itself: "It wasn't funny, but it had depth."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still relevant after half a century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francois Trauffaut's early (and considered generally to be auto-biographical) work "400 blows" is as relevant today as it was nearly half a century ago, and as universal. Despite medical advancement, sad stories of an unwanted child from an unwanted pregnancy unfold everywhere, all the time.The excellence of this film is in the way it handles a subject matter that is so common that it's very difficult to touch an average audience, let alone the cynics. And yet, "400 blows" tells the story in such a simple, honest way that you will sit up, pay due attention and respect, even if it doesn't break you down in uncontrollable sobs (which can sometimes be achieved through cheap contrivances).Nor does it paint a skewed, one sided picture of a life with nothing but misery for the 12-year-old. There are good moments such as when the family of three goes out to enjoy a movie just as any ordinary family would, as the step father is a reasonable and loving man who treats his "acquired" son very decently, almost like his own. But it is precisely these good moments that make the bad that much more poignant.There are neither total villains nor complete angels in this film. People are people as we know, that we can identify with, in other words, ordinary. They are often selfish, bullying, despicable, but not without moments of genuine goodwill. Antonie, our 12-year-old protagonist, is how any 12-year-old would be like, capable of mischievous actions but not burdened with the rejected spirit that a life of vicissitudes would have given to an adult. While we may feel sorry for him, he is too young to feel sorry for himself. Most illuminating is the interview with a psychiatrist towards the end of the movie. Observe how he answers all the personal questions in such a matter-of-course, honest way, with no uneasiness or hostility. It is most interesting, and a little ironic, that his innocence is accentuated when he talks about his sexual experience, or rather the lack of which, to be exact. "But some of my friends have done it", he hastens to add, a very natural thing to do, to show that he is not entirely ignorant. Then he goes on to talks about an abortive visit to a brothel (when the one prostitute who usually agree it "do it" with very young boys is just too busy) with the most genuinely innocent smile on his face.It is not seeing what the boy is (a juvenile delinquent, though not a particularly bad one by today's standard) but contemplating what he could have been that breaks the heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A masterfully directed, beautifully rendered indictment of a society where a boy such as Antoine can fall through the cracks. The cinematography is incredible, contrasting innocence with experience, playfulness with malice, and love/friendship with indifference. The film is a poignant, but equally breathtaking reminder of the fact that children will be children, and that without support from the adults in their lives, they will lose direction despite the best efforts of their own peers. Rings all too true even now in American society, where the neglected children of parents with their own ideals, goals, aspirations, and desires are all too often left to fend for themselves without the essential support system of any culture - the family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a big Truffaut fan before I saw The 400 Blows but it wasn't till then that he really converted me. This is easily one of the most moving films I have ever seen. Technically brilliant, well acted and stunning on all accounts, Blows is a tearjerker in the best sense of the word.Two scenes that really stuck out in my mind. Obviously the incredible ending (don't worry I'm not ruining anything). Who ever thought that watching someone run for five minutes could be so enthralling (or so fulfilling)? Also the scene with the other boys slowing trailing off until there were only four or five left. There's brilliant stuff everywhere you look in this film.I recommend The 400 Blows to anyone who appreciates good movies, because this one has something for everybody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stories of childhood have often been tempered with the melancholic yearning of lost innocence (as in Louis Malle's Au Revoir Les Enfants) or the profound weight of human misery (as in Robert Bresson's Mouchette). -An opinion in a filme web -This is a genuine filme but I don't consider the Les Quatre Cents Coups (The 400 Blows) a masterpiece. Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud),is an attractive troubled adolescent who chooses the cinema and to read Balzac as escapism,imagine how far away this boy is from our time of predominant `video games'.Also was interesting the black and white cinematography and to see a different Paris from the 1950s.Every great film has its unforgetable moments (like Mouchette's night in the woods,). I can choose three or four in this movie ,but I prefer two great ones: Antoine watching through the back window of the police van while this is moving away(also Antoine in jail pulling his turtleneck over his nose).The other emblematic scene is the last one:Antoine Doinel escapes, and the great moment when he rushes, arms open, toward the sea, savoring his freedom, is captured by Truffaut in a memorable freeze frame.Jean-Pierre Léaud brings a natural performance of tenderness and quiet desperation. I recommend you too LE PETIT VOLEUR(1999) by Erick Zonca. 7/10</fullReview>

This is also in large part to the actor Jean-Pierre Leaud, who plays the character as love-starved but never self-pitying. My heart broke to see him neglected by his mother. Together Truffaut and Leaud have, without sentimentality or preachy moralizing made this a character to love. I breathlessly watched him stumble through life, taking two steps back for every forward one. Until the heart-stopping final scene, which is beautiful in its simplicity, when despair turns to hope.

		<fullReview>Freezeframe close up....that image still lingers in my mind. Truffaut's "The 400 Blows" is not only his best work, but the best film I've ever seen. It paints such an accurate view of life; the pain, the awkwardness, the loneliness, and the love. The first time I saw it was on Bravo a few years back. The film felt so contemporary to me, that it shocked me to see it was made in 1959. Jean Pierre Leaud gives a devastating performance. Its strength lies in the fact that he's not playing a cute, lovable boy, but a true teenager. This might be the first time a director did not condescend to its child actors. (Truffaut, along with Spain's Victor Erice, remains one of the best child directors in the history of cinema). The cinematography is incredibly sophisticated, and yet approachable by anybody's standards. I have read that Truffaut regrets using the Jean Constantin score, but IMHO, it works to this day. It gives the film an emotional punch, particularly through the final frames. I know I will never grow tired of praising or watching this film. It is simply the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still relevant today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon first seeing the Francois Truffaut film 400 Blows, I was struck with the thought that this film was either designed to scar children away from a life of crime or just a social commentary on juvenile delinquency in Paris in the early fifties. This film is neither. Truffaut's main goal in making this film was to show the uncontrollable downward spiral of one boy. We are shown this through the boy "Antoine" eyes. Whether reflected in multiple mirrors at his mom's vanity or from the bottom of a spinning carnival ride, it is his view and perspective of the world that we see. The adult world is conspicuously absent except for the occasional villain or incompetent who happens to pass through Antoine's life. This film is shocking today, with our modern views on decency and political correctness. It was not designed to shock its audiences at the time. The idea of a child being disposable is a lost concept in today's world. The end of the film is especially important in the fact that Antoine, alone on the beach, could be interpreted as having reached his end. He has, throughout the film, sunk lower and lower no matter how hard he tried to better himself. By the end, we are led to believe he has reached his end, both figuratively and literally. My feeling is that instead of despair, he is faced with hope. The beach represents not an end but beginning, and one of limitless possibilities and a chance to begin again. This film is a timeless story of hope and the possibilities of redemption. Truffaut's style is modern and creative for its time. He stays away from stylized techniques that would have only dated this film. If this film was in color, I feel that an audience of today would have a hard time differentiating 400 Blows from a modern movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt, this is a masterpiece. There are at least two unforgettable sequences in this movie. The first is the puppet show, with those children's faces looking at the stage, quite out of anything that can be expressed by words... being so childish and perfectly baby-like, but at the same time so desperately resembling to the faces of us, adult spectators of movies and life. A second, extraordinary moment is the final encounter of the boy Doinel with the ocean, at the end of the movie. Out of the school-jail where they have sent him, he runs through the French countryside until he finds this long beach. When he finally reaches the water, he gives that sudden and unexpected look into the camera... that is when the movie ends, and we can't help being pervaded by a full, cosmic empathy with Antoine Doinel. Thank you Mr Truffaut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sympathetic and engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An idiomatic translation of the French title of this movie, Les quatre cents coup, would be something like "Raising Hell," understood ironically. Twelve-year-old Antoine Doinel, played very winningly by Jean-Pierre Leaud, doesn't suffer "400 blows," although he does get mistreated quite a bit, and he doesn't mean to raise hell or to be a problem to his parents or society. He's just a boy being a boy. Unfortunately his mother (Claire Mauier), who is more like a wicked step-mother than the boy's biological mother (although she is that) would like to be rid of him so that she can spend more time pursuing her hobby, which is adultery. His cuckolded step-father (Albert Remy) is no help, although he seems to care more for the boy than his mother. And the institutions of society, as represented by his school, the Parisian police, and the social services people, seem intent on turning poor Antoine into a criminal. Truffaut ends the movie at a spot where it is still far from clear where Antoine is really headed, but we can guess that his spirit will be undaunted.Some have called this, Francois Truffaut's first feature, realism, but if it's realism, so is Charles Dickens. This is an extended slice of life, a coming-of-ager stopped before the boy does become of age, and in this sense original. Truffaut paints everybody but the boy and his best friend in such a negative hue that we cannot help but identify with Antoine. This is not realism, but it doesn't matter because this is a splendid film, perhaps not as great as some have claimed, but very much worth watching because of Leaud's fine performance and Truffaut's original and charming presentation of Paris in the 1950s. In one sense Truffaut makes the City of Light a child's playground, and in another, it is a repressive, indifferent monolith. Antoine's transgressions--ditching school, telling lies, stealing from his grandmother--are trivial. But Truffaut wants to make sure we don't misunderstand so he has the boy get into trouble for (1) having a magazine passed to him in class, (2) unconsciously memorizing Balzac (he is accused of plagiarism by his fascist teacher) (3) returning a typewriter, which admittedly he had lifted, and (4) lighting a candle in honor of Balzac (which starts a fire).My favorite scene is the one with the psychiatrist in which we hear her questions, but the camera stays on Antoine. His candid, eminently reasonable and entirely sane answers to her questions demonstrate that he is a completely normal, even admirable boy, and that it is society and its stupid adults that are off the mark.The faces of the children at the Punch and Judy show are wonderful and the sequence of Antoine running and running so gracefully and seemingly with little effort symbolizes the longing that all children have to be free.While I think this famous movie is perhaps a little over-rated, I can tell you that if you haven't seen it you are in danger of being labeled a cinematic illiterate.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film around three or four years ago for the first time. I had watched it late at night, and I was very sleepy after it ended. I was rather ambivalent towards it. To tell you the truth, I don't know whether I had even heard of it before I rented it. And I don't even remember if it was my first film by Francois Truffaut, either. I have seen two others, The Green Room, which I didn't like all that much, and Shoot the Piano Player, which I loved. My guess would be that I saw The Green Room first, then looked up what else Francois Truffaut had made, and which ones were considered his better films.Anyhow, by some route I rented The 400 Blows, and, as I said above, it left me unaffected. I went to bed afterwards without thinking much about it. It was only a couple of months later that I realized how good it was. The memories came flooding back one day when someone mentioned it to me. I have had similar experiences with La Dolce Vita and Casablanca, among others. As I thought more and more about it, I realized just how great it was.Still, I never went back to it until now. I am strange in that way. There are some movies, some of which aren't even that good, that I will watch over and over again, alone or with friends. There are other films which I know are great, but that I never feel I have time to revisit them (there are always more films to be watched). The 400 Blows is one of those films, unfortunately. I don't know why. I have even considered purchasing it several times. I never did. So when I saw it tonight, it was like seeing something brand new.I remembered only a few of the most memorable scenes: the carnival ride (followed by Antoine catching his mother with a strange man), the whole Balzac sequence, the psychologist's interview, and, of course, the famous final shot, the freeze-frame of Antoine Doinel looking into the camera. After this time, I will probably remember everything a lot better and a lot longer. The first time, when I was ambivalent, I had time to forget before I finally grabbed hold of those fading memories.Why is this film special? Because it is the perfect example of childhood caught on film. I don't think there is anyone who could watch it without thinking that it rings true. Every piece of film that deals with a similar subject falls behind this one. The only one that I can think of that comes anywhere near is Federico Fellini's _Amarcord_. Jean Vigo's _Zero for Conduct_ is also very interesting, and probably influenced this film a lot (I know Truffaut was familiar with it, but that may not have been until after this film came out). Antoine Doinel is such an endearing character. I hope that sometime soon I can procure and see his other filmic exploits. And I really need to see more Truffaut in general. I'm far behind with him. Well, The 400 Blows deserves a 10/10, no doubt. It is easily one of the best films ever made, and one of those films that any knowledgable person would include it in a list of films that are absolutely necessary for a student of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truffaut bares his soul and delivers a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best-loved and most memorable of all French films, Les quatre cents coups established François Truffaut as a great film director and launched the acting career of Jean-Pierre Léaud.This is a poignant story about the life of a young teenage boy who seeks escape from his loveless, lonely existence by committing minor crimes and creating fantasies. We now know that the film is a semi-biographical account of Truffaut's own troubled childhood. He too lived with an adoptive father and a mother who resented having a child. (Truffaut himself was born in secrecy, to avoid the scandal of a birth outside of wedlock, and parcelled off to his grandmother for the early years of his life). Indeed it is difficult to see where the autobiography ends and the fiction begins - a characteristic which is noticeable in virtually all of Truffaut's subsequent films. It is probably Truffaut's intimacy with the subject of his films that imbue them with such warmth and humanity and guarantee their emotional impact.Jean-Pierre Léaud was cast by Truffaut himself, having advertised the role. There is an uncanny similarity between the two men, both physically and in their mannerisms. Léaud became Truffaut's friend and protégé for a substantial part of their careers, with Truffaut reusing the character of Antoine in a series of films spanning 20 years. Indeed it is difficult to watch Léaud without seeing something of Truffaut in his performance. In Les quatre cents coups, Léaud plays the part of the unhappy teenage boy ? la perfection. His futile attempts to please his parents, his empty fantasies, his loneliness when he takes to the streets of Paris - glimpses of a broken childhood that immortalises the young Antoine as possibly one of the most sympathetic figure in French cinema history.Henri Decae's black and white photography appears the perfect medium for Truffaut's wistful tale. Location filming is used extensively, creating an impression of expanse and freedom which depicts what the young Antoine is looking for but which is constantly denied him. The scenes when the young boy is ultimately confined in a police van being driven the night streets of Paris have a deeply tragic poignancy. The final shots, with Antoine apparently finding his freedom on a vast expanse of beach, but leading no where but to the open sea, are similarly very moving.Decae's photography and Truffaut's script are very well complemented by Jean Constantin engaging musical score, having a child-like simplicity that seems to underline the futility of Antoine's aspirations for a better life.Les quatre cents coups was instantly successfully when it was released in 1959, winning Truffaut the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival. It was one of the first and most influential films in the New Wave of French films. It was and remains a popular film all over the world, but especially in France. It is - simply - a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this monumental work, one central motif deeply influenced all other notable proclivities: realism. A documentary-like work otherwise, this movie does what I most admire about movies: immerse us with different lives, times, and places. So, first, this quality in the '400 blows' predominates and accentuates the rest of the movie to germane sensitivity; from there the plot takes over and we delve into the lives of a small middle-class family, and the main character among the three family members--the boy. Indeed, the astute social critique leaves the viewer with long lasting impressions. But the boy's plight will ever remain the single most potent symbol in my memory of the vindication, liberty, freedom, and inevitable alienation humans undergo in their lives. Definitely a movie I would like to see again and again, if not to enjoy the beauty of the filming, but at least to remind myself the predicament of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waving in the new cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In general, it's very rare to see a film made before 1970 or so that offers a convincing picture of everyday life. Which makes this film by Francois Truffaut, dating from as early as 1959, all the more impressive. 'The Four Hundred Blows' is simply remarkable, with its naturalistic dialogue (laced with black humour) supplemented by the very subtle musical score (also a rarity in films of this vintage), imaginative camera work and an incidental construction that have set the template for just about every notable piece of cinematic realism made since. The point is that "naturalism" does not come naturally; and Truffaut was light years ahead of his peers in imagining how a portrait of the real world (and the feelings of its inhabitants) might be created. Having re-watched one of my favourite films recently, Shane Meadows 1999 effort 'A Room for Romeo Brass', another story of troubled boys in dysfunctional families, I find myself amazed how much more in common 'The Hundred Blows' has with that film than with its contemporaries.Truffaut also gets a fine performance from his young leading actor Jean-Pierre Leaud. If I have one criticism, it's that the film's ending seems slightly premature; we see a boy whose life is collapsing, but he is yet to recognise the fact. The film is almost like a prelude to a later, unseen tragedy; but the absence of sentimentality or melodrama are to be commended. A landmark film, still fresh after 45 years.</fullReview>

I could just describe the plot here but if you don't already know about it, it would be better if you just watched it without knowing anything about it. This movie was dedicate to Andre Bazin, a film critic who died in 1959 and also helped Truffaut when he deserted the military. I would say this movie is better than Shoot the Piano player, Truffaut's follow up film to this one. I had read somewhere that this movie was autobiographical for the director.

		<fullReview>Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is a fourteen years old boy rejected by his mother and his stepfather, who gave him his name. This lack of affection in his home makes him a rebel, bad student, liar, reckless and stealing objects and money at home. This movie was the first one directed by François Truffault and is a landmark of the Nouvelle Vague, a French style of making films initiated by Truffault and Godard. This movement has produced low budget, but high quality movies, using a small crew, hand camera and free screenplay, with lots of creation and improvisation. The character Antoine is the alter-ego of Truffault. His crimes, watched in the Twentieth-First Century, are minors, but in 1959 were much serious. It is a very good movie, recommended for those who indeed loves cinema. My vote is nine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(2nd part of 30 reviews of the films I think are the 30 greatest ever made. Being 2nd has nothing to do with how good it is compared to the other films) Atoine Doniel is one of the most likable heroes in the history of cinema. And by likable, I don't really mean "likable" so much as a character everyone identifies with in some way. He is the rebel with a cause, a 12 year old who isn't so bad behaved as he has very bad timing. When a centerfold is passed around class, the teacher catches him with it. When he creates a shrine to his idol the poet Balzac, it catches fire.I have not seen any of the other "Antoine Doniel" films, and I don't want to. It was probably a mistake to make any more - the film ends perfectly as it is, and its better off left alone.Doniel lives in a small, cramped apartment with his two parents who are constantly yelling at each other. He occasionally gets along with the father, but more than often he is treated unfairly by both. The film follows him through many misadventures, that go from skipping school and running from home and stealing a typewriter. By the end we're cheering him on and no film manages this better.I'd rather not write any more about "The 400 Blows" (or "Les Quatre Cents Coups" which is short for a French idiom - "faire Les quatre cents coups" "to raise hell"). Instead, I'll let you see it and watch the events unfold before you. It's not at all boring, I'm 14 and loved it. This is not only one of the best, but my favorite movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the sort of thing that only now thrills the film eggheads. After all, Feierstein's Flex Crush will have you know that Real Men don't watch anything by Truffaut. It might have been interesting if Truffaut had anything to -say- here. The camera-as-voyeur motif was nothing new. Have we all forgotten De Sica's "Bicycle Thief"? Or anything by Hitchcock?So all we get is the extended metaphor of the juvenile as Truffaut, who spends all his free time 'screwing up his eyes' at the movies, who wrecks schoolroom discipline, gets accused of plagiarism(the many petty thefts), and ultimately escapes societal confines to make 'his own movie'. Sorry...been there, done that too many times for this to matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truffaut's first film is a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To not have a mother's love is one of the most heartbreaking things in life. Antoine Doinel is an example of a kid who, on the surface, has a stable home life ? with a roof over his head, a decent school, and parents who look out for him, albeit with them sometimes taking turns as one or another is often out at night. However, as the movie progresses, we get glimpses of just how difficult the young man's life is ? his mother's infidelity, overheard arguments, and their careless comments. The way Truffaut slowly reveals the details is masterful, which is all the more impressive given this was the director's first film. Doinel is played by Jean-Pierre Léaud, who at 15 was taken under the 27-year-old Truffaut's wing as a kindred spirit of sorts, and he turns in a remarkable performance ? natural, honest, and highly realistic. We see him acting out in school, cutting class, and getting into trouble. Even when he does try to apply himself, reading Balzac, it ends wrong at home, with the candle he's lit in a small shrine of sorts starting a fire, and at school, where out of inspiration he paraphrases Balzac so closely that he gets an F for plagiarism.There are many great shots, and the film is beautiful. The street scenes in Paris. A swirling centrifugal carnival ride. The shot from atop a tall building, which follows a school teacher as he leads the kids down the street, only to have groups of two and three of them peeling off along the way to get into mischief. Little children watching a puppet show, with rows and rows of faces reacting with such natural animation, and unmistakably telling us of their emotions. The interview with the psychologist, shown from her perspective, as Doinel answers her questions about why he lies and steals in a straightforward manner. That's a very powerful scene, and one that really ties it all together emotionally. This film will impact you. Its ending leaves the young man's fate unresolved ? just as in life. He's at a crossroads of sorts. He may get into further trouble and spiral, becoming a criminal, or he may be saved by a passion for something, as Truffaut himself was with cinema, or by his inner good nature. We certainly hope for the latter, but can't help but worry. Put up with by his stepfather but unloved, a nuisance to his mother and deep down unwanted, labeled a bad kid by his teachers and put into the system ? these things go deep into his core. In a non-cloying way, the film explains why some people turn out as they do, and makes us want to be more understanding and kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Through this film, I got an idea of the beautiful old French town and of the life that children lived mid-20th century. How many psychological problems evident in this canvas ... Looking at it I realize how many create one psychologist and psychiatrist profession for half a century ... I'm sure we lucky to be born in the current years, and our children are lucky more, and even more grandchildren. Let's think about what role can play this pattern, if it is to watch most of the people of the future: - For a positive effect, it is necessary to show in the ripened age, then people will be able to sympathize with the previous generations ... - It can be seen in the infinite power of the unconscious and desire for freedom ... - Our desire to deeply pledged to go beyond and take the life under our cap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Coming-of-Age Story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever heard the song "Institutionalized" by Suicidal Tendencies? That's what The 400 Blows is like.A young, delinquent boy's life continues to spiral downward as he refuses to obey, and live, the way his parents and society want him to. I want to call this film a coming-of-age story, but the boy's character does actually go through a change of self in the film. By refusing to adapt he is physically in a different setting by the end of the film, but it didn't seem like he was about to stop refusing.It's hard to say why he is refusing. We find out that the boy as not had as many opportunities as some. He is poor, which is contrasted to his rich, and also delinquent, friend. So it's not that the because he poor that he can't seem to fit into society's rules--there are boys of all ages at the observation center he is sent to at the end.All of this is told beautiful through a well written story with little dialogue overall. There are stunning shots of inner Paris, reminiscent of Woody Allen's Manhattan. As the story progress, and the boy's life progressively spirals downward, the setting moves farther and farther out of the city, finally ending with the boy standing at the edge of the water--one of the clever symbols in this film.Cons: This film is a rather dated, and it's a little slow. But, it's worth watching. I enjoyed The 400 Blows; the more I think about it, the less flaws I can come up with.I think the best interpretation for the theme this film is to do with the institutionalization of youth...early interpretation of the school-to-prison so-called pipeline?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The 400 Blows" is a drama movie in which we watch a young boy whose parents do not pay the appropriate attention to him and leave him many times alone. This has as a result for the young boy to go into some crime actions which will have a very important to him but also for his parents.I really liked this movie because it shows us how important is for young children to have close to them their parents and how this can influence not only the way they think and act but also the way the see things around them. I also liked this movie because of the nice written plot and of course the direction which has been made by François Truffaut. In this movie I believe the best interpretation was Jean-Pierre Léaud's who played as Antoine Doinel and he was simply outstanding. Another great interpretation made by Antoine Doinel who played as the teacher of French.Finally I have to say that "The 400 Blows" is a must see movie and it really worth the time that you are going to spend on it. That's because it shows us the importance of the parents for children but also the importance of the school and the teachers. It also shows us how teachers and general school can influence children to go on with their life and what impact it will have also in their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawless piece of filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows is a great story told in excellence about a French adolescent named Antoine Doinel (played by Jean Pierre- Leaud) who is left without attention from his parents (Albert Remy, Claire Maurier) and turns to a life of crime and eventually gets caught for stealing a typewriter, and gets put into an observation center (where he will eventually escape from there.)My theory for that scene where Doinel escapes from the observation center is that maybe he escaped from the observation center because he missed his family and friends so much that he wanted to see them again very badly. This was a truly well made movie that I think is Truffaut's best and most personal because this film was inspired by his early life of which I am pretty sure that as a teenager Truffaut might have done the same things that the Leaud character did but I don't know yet, and this movie I and critics alike think that this movie is one of the best movies of 1959, as well as one of the best movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes, we like to be surprised, and this indeed is a pleasant surprise. The 400 Blows is a very odd name and intact bears no real meaning with respect to content of the movie. But, The 400 Blows is a great film in a way that very few films are. There is a climax scene in which Antoine Doniel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) just runs to the ocean. There is a reason and it is that he just wanted to see the ocean. So, this film is not one that has a great story and is not even a deeply moving film. It's a film that most of us relate to as this is a film that has a child's tormented and troubled childhood. The film is more like a fictional documentary and a journey of a 12 year old boy, who is tormented by his teacher, plans to leave home, find that his father is not the original one. It's a great concocted film and a very deeply layered one. And all kudos to the director Francois Truffaut who is given us a very typically French film that has lot many subtexts and reflects the turmoil of an era and also speaks volumes about the sensitive minds of kids. Acting by Jean-Pierre Léaud is outstanding and even by other kids is superb. But it's Jean who steals the show all the way by making the audience sympathise, empathise and move with him. Francois Truffaut gave us one of the finest films on Kids and he must be saluted for that. The good things are the cinematography, the costumes and the art direction. Wow, they all were supreme and the cinematography specifically, built up a mood that even I felt related to the child and he seemed so close to me. Easily one of the best French Films, I rate this 5/5 and a must watch for all those who are into some serious film making. A film is not typically about a story, a beginning, a end and the interval bang, it's a poem or a journey and it can be anything. Some like it, some will not but good stories are bound to get some serious appreciation. I thank Truffaut for giving me this wonderful Film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Defining Work of French New Wave.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>François Truffaut's feature film debut is an intensely touching portrait of our adolescent years which beautifully captures the day-to-day activities we spent doing for hours despite it being deemed useless by our parents &amp; teachers, the classes we bunked to go for movies or play, the teachers we loved to hate and the many times we were 'disciplined' for the smallest of things.The 400 Blows is my first stint with this director's works &amp; the elegant manner in which he has unfolded this story before our eyes is sheer poetry. Set in early 1950s Paris, The 400 Blows is an expertly crafted character study of a young adolescent who's often misunderstood by his peers &amp;, after being left with no attention, delves into a life of petty crime.Wonderfully directed by Truffaut, the film not for once loses its grip on the viewers' attention despite featuring no definite plot or offering any sort of redemption in the end. It's a careful observation of how even the smallest of events sometimes end up playing a significant role in shaping an individual and its black-n-white cinematography makes sure that the film never ages out.Coming to the performances, this is Jean-Pierre Léaud's show from start to finish &amp; to say that he did a fine job in capturing his character's essence would be a massive understatement for it's a performance that's nearly flawless. On an overall scale, The 400 Blows remains one of the most notable works of French New Wave and is a treasured gem that offers an unapologetic, honest &amp; nostalgic reflection of adolescent life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film marks the beginning of Two Legends; Truffaut and Leaud; One of the Most Intriguing Stories on Adolescence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The 400 Blows', Truffaut's debut feature film, marks the beginning of his screen persona, Antoine Doinel; it's one of the most noted films of the French New Wave, and one of the most intriguing stories on adolescence. The most brilliant aspect of it is that it doesn't have a particular agenda, and just lets us witness everything going on in the life of a misunderstood teenager as it is. It's the thoughts and acts most teenagers go through, maybe in different ways. I think, most people would relate to Antoine at some level or the other.It's the story of a misunderstood child who faces trouble both at school and home, and tries to escape both these places. He senses neglect at home, and and his taste and talent being ignored or (misunderstood) by the teachers doesn't help either. Lack of affection is the main cause for most mischief and rebellion at that age.The background score is mesmerizing, and it really sets the tone of the movie from the beginning credits scene showing us entrancing visuals of Paris - beautiful, innocent, yet rough like the main protagonist. The wide-angle camera is used quite effectively (it's 1959).The acting is terrific. It's said that Truffaut auditioned hundreds of teenagers before finalizing on Jean-Pierre Leaud, with whom (he said) he found many similarities of family neglect, talent, mischief and rebellion. Jean-Pierre is incredibly talented and charms us with his acting; the shades of innocence, fear, rebellion and curiosity are portrayed quite adeptly by him. His monologues with the counselor are quite captivating. He goes on to play Antoine Doinel in four other Truffaut movies.Most memorable scenes from the movie include: The 'Wheel Of Death' scene, which is actually the first scene in the movie that completely fascinates and thrills you. The single shot of the kids on a morning jog with their PE teacher, where they bunk the class by slowly detaching themselves from the main group; it's incredibly amusing. Antoine's sessions with the counselor. And of course, the beautifully-shot open-ended climax scene.(Note: The film's French title comes from a French idiom "faire les quatre cents coups" which means "to raise hell", but I can't figure out why they went for the literal translation for the English Title; it doesn't make any sense at all. In short, it's a terrible and misleading English title, and has got nothing to do with the film.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>thoroughly modern film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is a young delinquent in Paris. He's disruptive in class. He skips school and plays hooky. He sees his mother cheating. After getting publicly hit, he decides to run away from home. He stays away for one night. He continues his delinquent ways after returning home. He steals a typewriter from his stepfather's office. However he can't unload it and tries to return it to the office. He's caught and his stepfather turns him over to the police.This François Truffaut film was probably daring for its time. It has the feel of a modern indie. It's a grimy part of the poor Paris. It's not the bright light. If I have one complaint, it's the boy lead. He does a fine job but he doesn't stand out enough. Maybe that's part of the point. It's a meandering story of a rebellious boy falling through the cracks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film in my high school French class and found it to be a captivating story of a misunderstood young, unattended young boy, Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) that delves into a life of petty crime (thank you IMDb for the plot reference).François Truffaut gave the movie solid direction and momentum and, while I watched this 1959 film in the 1990s, I thought it was still dynamic, fresh and dramatic with an intriguing cast of characters, beautiful cinematography depicting the streets of Paris and a fascinating story. It was interesting to see the Antoine character struggle to survive out in the large city all the while ditching school, being neglected by his parents, moving from home to home and acting as a rebel to the world. This generated the audience's sympathy and made them intrigued in finding out what Antoine's next move in each day of his life would be.Overall, it is a dramatic and beautiful film with a sad, melancholic music score and a deep, mind-numbing story in which you will find entertaining.Grade B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I waited long to see this film as it is considered the starting point of what is called nouvelle vague, so the day came and I prepared to see a great film. Almost 2 hours later I ended up having a lot of sympathy and empathy for the boy and really thought it was a great piece of cinema I just experienced. But deep in my understanding I realized that I expected a lot more from it, even when I believe the cinematography is great, the script is good, the direction immaculate and obviously Antoine Doinel interpretation astonishing. But for being the beginning film of such an essential cinematic movement I found it lack of emotion, distant to the character, and the story did not catch me as I would like it to. Anyway, It's highly recommended as a principal matter of study on how french cinema went from poetic realism into nouvelle vague, a different kind of approaching to human perception of reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Cited as one of the films that begot the French New Wave, this one cuts straight to the nerve if you were ever mis-understood or felt isolated as a kid (and who wasn't?). Knowing that it's a semi-autobiographical presentation from director Francois Truffaut makes it all the more poignant. Truffaut was a troubled youth and (like many of us) used his love of cinema as an escape, and to provide hope for his future. His mentor, the famous film theorist Andre Bazim, died just before this (Truffaut's first) film was released ... it bears a dedication to Bazim.Jean-Pierre Leaud plays 12 year old Antoine Doinel, a boy who just can't get a break at home or school. Labeled a troublemaker (the film title translates "to raise hell" or "to live a wild life") by a lazy, cruel teacher, and treated as a lost cause and unwanted burden by his tight-sweater-wearing mother (Claire Maurier, over 80 and still acting today) and stepfather (Albert Remy). Antoine's days are spent reading Balzac, watching movies, and dreaming of escape. A couple of unfortunate incidents spiral out of control and he ends up first in jail and then in an "observation center" for troubled kids.The beauty of the filmmaking is evident in most every shot ... and there are some amazing extended takes. The overhead scene of the PE teacher "losing" students as they jog through the city is humorous and insightful. The puppet scene in the park is an extraordinary long take of kids' innocent and mesmerized faces, and the extended shot of Antoine running through the countryside is a cinematic first. Above all of that is the famous ending shot - a zoom in to freeze frame of the young boy caught between land and sea (past and present).Truffaut and Leaud teamed up for four more projects featuring the same character, Antoine Doinel. In 1962's Antoine and Colette, he finds first love. 1968 brings Stolen Kisses and true love. 1970's Bed &amp; Board has Antoine getting married, and finally 1979's Love on the Run brings divorce and life after a failed marriage. Other than the "7 Up" series, I can't recall a movie character being tracked in real time for two decades in multiple films.The French New Wave also included directors such as Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, and Jacques Remy (who appears as a policemen in this movie). These filmmakers used realism to tell their stories at a time when Hollywood was using icons such as James Dean and Marlon Brando to express rebellious youth. This makes for an interesting comparison and fun analysis. Whatever your preference, Truffaut's first feature is clearly an exciting development for cinematic history.</fullReview>

I recommend this film to people of all ages, from eight year olds to ninety year olds. It is a great piece of artwork from Truffaut. The reason it does not deserve a 10/10 is because some of the editing is a bit lax. By this I mean when I want more conversation or more length to a scene, it's short.

Truffaut's expertness in camera movements is so remarkable and it is beyond the fact that it is only his first film, take the centrifuge ride shots for examination, both rotating ones and stationary ones are novel to commingle together from different angels, a feat can only be amazed. Another much-appreciated long shot is about a gym teacher leading a group of schoolboys jogging on the streets, the sky-roving camera meticulously and jovially captures the process of boys sneaking away from the procession by turns, such a benevolent and ingenious skit, the same can be referred to a little boy's ink-smearing writing scenes, the close-up records the entire happening resolutely, these paragraphs augment a touch of enlightenment and virtue of innocence which resides inside every kid's heart in spite of the story per se is a tale of woe. Antoine's familial life suffices all the negligence and misery that will impair any unsullied soul, it is a tragedy has omnipotent repercussions on everyone, Truffaut and his co-screenwriter Marcel Moussy inject great dedication and patience into Antoine's character, it is for sure the most acute and iconic portrayal of a child ever on the silver screen!The grainy texture and vintage monochrome of the film has an immanent allure to film buffs, apart from Léaud, Claire Maurier and Albert Rémy as the mother and stepfather of Antoine, both resemble a kitchen-sink superficiality and lifelike casualness as the rest of the cast, Léaud's naturalistic responses towards fate's rough handling is a boon, it is explicitly emotive and the film has earned its prominence fair and square, a must-see should not be missed by aficionados.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the best coming of age stories ever made, and when I saw this film, I didn't expect to be as impressed or as emotionally drawn in as this 1959 classic did to me! Starting off with our protagonist Antoine Doinel misbehaving in class and then expanding the story out into a truly remarkable film about what is essentially child abuse "although I imagine the culture in 1959 France, and 2013 Britain are two whole different things... but what makes this film truly remarkable is its young star. Once you set eyes upon his daring, yet cheeky behaviour, you begin to see why he has an apathy for life that no child in my personal opinion should have. What is going on here is the whole "Nurse Ratchet" scenario really brought to form by 1976 by "one flew over the cuckoos nest", the format is very similar, with everything the adults doing to help the child just pushing him further and further from social obedience. The shots of him seeing his hometown drive out of view at the end had me in complete hysterical sobbing mode, and with good reason... The cinematography is just as alive today as if it were made today in black and white, yet, the same thing can't be said for the setting... Its absolutely amazing to see what Paris looked like in 1959, its beautiful and (even in b&amp;w, which people should stop complaining about... and subtitles) this serves up as one of the best international movies of its time. The acting is very rarely wooden and over the top, and never from our main character, I can quite safely say that this film needs to be broadcast more. I would pay a lot of money to see it on the big screen... I just cannot bring myself to criticise this fantastic gem of cinema!

		<shortDescription>Greater than a coming-of-age movie, and avoids many of that genre's tropes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 400 Blows is not a coming-of-age movie, as some reviews suggest. The child protagonist is not necessarily moving toward a deeper understanding of life or preparing to become a fully-functional member of society. He is a largely static character to whom events happen, and the movie follows his attempts to navigate and perhaps exert a limited sort of control over his less-than-ideal circumstances. He lacks any particularly precocious qualities or quirks, so his behavior and manner of expression are not that of some child prodigy. He behaves for the most part as a normal child his age would in similarly-challenging situations, and that makes him more relatable than many adolescent figures in film. I'm not sure I've ever seen better acting from a 14 year old, and the DVD version contains an interesting interview with that actor recorded a year or so after the film wrapped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mistake, reflected onto years of petty crime, of absence of family love, and denial are all reflected in the movie 400 Blows. We viewed this movie as a closure for our film appreciation class this year in ninth grade. The purpose of watching this Francois Truffaut film was to get an inside view of the French New Wave, and how it differs from all of the Hollywood films of the time period. The plot is based on a young adolescent who is mistreated, has a lack of love and attention, and how he believes in the inside he was a "mistake". Antoine, the main character, reveals his life to the viewer, making one reflect the reasons behind why he behaves the way he does. The heart-breaking experience is one that the viewer can understand, and get to a point where one has empathy towards Antoine and accepts the story behind a troubled boy.The movie starts by showing an inner aspect of a never-ending cycle, which starts in the point where he faces a scarcity of caring from the family, specifically from the mother, which leads to his behavior problems. This misconduct will foment the mistreatment from the adults. It commences at the school, where Antoine is handed a picture of a lady and his professor punishes him by taking away his recess and demanding him to write that he will not write on the wall again 1000 times give rise to the fact that Antoine will miss school the next day. The fact that he doesn't attend school the morning after will lead to a discovery that will change the relationship between Antoine and his mother. His non-stopping escaping from his own reality will hand him things he never would have expected.The character Antoine Doinel is performed by Jean-Pierre Leaud, reflected by the story of Truffaut, which is later used in several other movies. In my personal opinion, I believe he Leaud engages perfectly with the character and story, making him a perfect choice. The fact that the French New Wave films were based on films closer to the reality of the place, helps Jean-Pierre Leaud fill identified, making it an easier character to perform. His silence throughout the movie makes the viewer focus one's attention in his actions and the reason behind all this quietness. The other actor I believe plays an excellent roll is Claire Maurier, as Gilberte Doinel; Antoine's mother. She is parts of the stereotype of the "sexy, unfaithful blonde", which leads to a couple of events in the film. This events are essential in demonstrating the causes of Antoine's behavior, and that's why it is so important for Maurier to act it out precisely.As to what I personally liked, there are several scenes and elements. I believe there are 3 indispensable details revealed in the film that divulge important parts of Antoine's life and reason of being the way he is. One of these scenes is when Antoine tells the psychologist that his grandmother told him that his mother wanted to abort him, and that it was thanks to her (his grandmother) that he (Antoine) was born. Just this fact creates a feeling in Antoine's mind that he is useless and unwanted. Gilberte also behaves toward him in a way that makes Antoine believe it even more, including the fact that she treats him more like a servant than a son. I also appreciated the fact that Truffaut enfasized certain parts of the story that were important for the viewer to see and understand. One example of this is almost at the end of the film where there is a long scene of him running away. This creates a feeling and and understanding of how long it was for him to obtain the liberty he wanted. A present moral in the film is that no one can judge a person without knowing him/her first, just as the quote states "don't judge a book by its cover." This is a misconception that has always been present in the human lives, when one judges another by his actions or appearance alone. The second part of the lesson is that we need to understand why something is the way it is, because everything has a reason behind it, and eventually try to accept it, or at least understand it. The fact that people, most of the time, judge a person's misbehavior without knowing the reasons behind it, reflect a lack of empathy in the world. Empathy is when one can "get in the shoes" of another person, and understand the situation they are in.I would recommend this movie to a group of people older than twelve years, or in a time that they will be able to understand all the inside detail behind the story, understand the metaphors and the meaning of every feature. To enjoy the movie today, one must be aware that the pace is very different from the Hollywood films of the 21st century. Not only is it necessary to be aware, but to appreciate this kinds of films, because the viewer not only learns about Antoine's story, but also how the people lived in those times. The film is currently unrated, but I believe an accurate rating would be PG-13. Some inappropriate language and behavior is shown, that's why the parental guidance would be necessary, as well the fact that one could need help to divulge the meaning of some scenes.Rating: 8.5/10Mariana is a ninth grade student in the film appreciation class, but is mainly interested in drawing/painting and music.

		<shortDescription>400 blows to shoot you with amazement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently finished watching the movie "400 Blows" with my film appreciation class about 3 days ago. The movie "400 Blows" was released in 1959 as well as written and directed by the legendary French director, François Truffaut. François Truffaut directed in the times of The New French Wave and in 1959 released the movie "400 Blows"; which was not only his first full-length film but also his first success. It is a movie in black and white that takes place in France and establishes the psychology and ideals of people from these times. These factors contribute to making this movie so interesting and open for analysis and different opinions. I believe everyone deserves to have and share and opinion; therefore I would like to share mine about this movie.The movie "400 Blows" takes place in France and follows the same characteristics and values of the year in which it was released; 1959. The movie tells the story of a young schoolboy, Antoine Doinel and metaphorically points out the 400 blows he receives throughout his journey. Truffaut strives to make the audience watch the movie with eyes of pity and compassion, as he presents clear reasoning for why Antoine is tempted to submerge into a path of crime and rebellion. Behaviors such as his teacher's discipline, his parent's lack of attention and his best friend's mistaken priorities will guide Antoine to look back at his life and take an important decision regarding his future. There are 5 main characters in the movie around whom the plot takes place: The main character Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaude), Antoine's parents Gilberte Doinel (Claire Maurier) and Julien Doinel (Albert Rémy), Antoine's French teacher 'Petit Feuille' (Guy Decomble) and Antoine's best friend René (Patrick Auffay). In my opinion these actors and actress did an excellent job portraying their roles and I would not change any of them. Antoine did an impressing job, having only 14 years of age he managed to display a rebel, daring fearless expression as well as a concerned and victimized one. His parents and French teacher played a cold-hearted role in the movie, being perfect for what the director was looking for and at the same time being essential in contributing to the child's future decisions. Finally, René was a spoiled boy; more than spoiled, a young boy granted with liberty. His parents were never around and he always seemed to get away with what he did which allowed him to be a perfect foil for Antoine's bad luck, destiny and spotlight. I really liked the fact that the movie played only one song and made it classical, which contributed to making the viewers, feel familiarized with the film and giving importance to the movie scenes. I liked the fact that the director gives importance to two main scenes in the movie; which he makes long and eye-catching. The first important scene is the one where Antoine skips school and rides a Rotor Ride; immediately the camera becomes another person in the ride and focuses without moving on every turn the ride gives, occasionally showing Antoine's new position in the ride. The scene lasts a couple of minutes and attempts to make a metaphorical comparison resembling the turns (or 400 blows) that Antoine must take in his life. The second important scene is the one shown when Antoine is running. We can see him running for a long time and matching distance; to the point in which you begin to think about all those important event in the movie and drawing analytical conclusions from them. The run symbolizes liberty, or in another point of view, juxtaposes it. The camera also took an important role in the movie, more than just filming it. A very interesting scene is one near the end of the movie when Antoine's mom comes to visit him. The camera focuses on his mother, which allows an emphasis in all the harsh statements coming out of her mouth. But then, the camera takes and interesting shift to his mother's hat and stays there for a while. This allows the viewer to interpret the camera's intentions and conclude that it was meant to show the mother's materialism and appeal to external beauty; contrasting this with her internal lack of beauty and planting the following question in the public's head "Is she beautiful?" I learned important morals after finishing this movie. First, I learned that it is easy to judge a person for his actions if you do not now his reasons; however it is no reason to do it. Before judging someone, we must first care to learn why this person is how he is and why he acts the way he does; for we may be ignoring cruel events on these people's lives. We all have events that shape our lives; all hard in their own way and we all have different ways to react to them which takes me to my second point; fate. As a viewer, I could see how even though Antoine's best friend René does the same things he does and even influences him to do them, it is Antoine who gets punished and impacted by this. Leaving me with the conclusion that even though they both did the same, it was Antoine's destiny to end up where he did. I believe others will also learn important morals from this movie; for it media is a great way to educate a mass. I think it is an essential movie to watch at some point in your life regarding your age (as long as your parents allow you too if you are young). I think everybody should watch it with an open and critical mind to enjoy it. I really liked this movie and I'm glad we took the time to watch it. It is an A+ movie!

		<shortDescription>Critique: "The 400 Blows"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is "The 400 Blows" a movie of a young child's miss happens, or an acute critic against French education? The movie "The 400 Blows" by Francois Truffaut exposes the harsh situation that Antoine Doinel, a twelve-year-old boy, undergoes. It depicts the unique and inefficient ways of educating children in the 1960's. This movie connects with the viewer in a profound way. The story is told through the child's perspective, creating a sense of connection and compassion in the reader, for this young character. Jean-Pierre Leaud successfully portrayed Antoine Doinel's character. As a viewer, his act was very convincing; one could almost grasp that feeling of despondency and solitude that the child lived in. Not only could he act accordingly, but also one could sense that he understood Antoine to the fullest. One can see that the character's actions added with bad luck sinks him into a spiral downwards. One event leads to another, and ends up being sent to the juvenile reformatory. The modern viewers can argue that his actions of lying and stealing are justified by the lack of attention, support and love the child receives during his upbringing. One can say this because now the education institution and ways of educating have changed. Currently, schools enforce strictness and well behavior through alternate means. At the time of the film, physical aggression was key in order to educate a child. As tested, and as can be seen in the movie these types of attitudes just motivates the child to continue acting poorly. Now a day, we're convinced that if the child is properly cared for and listened to one can prevent them from having such despondent and unfortunate outlooks. One technical aspect that enforces the mood of each scene is the music. The melodies through the film act are coherent. Each different scenario has appropriate songs, which create a pleasant feeling in the viewer. These tunes accompany Antoine Doinel through all of his misfortunes and adventures, making a stronger connection between the audience and the boy. The director did a very convincing job not only by choosing each song, but also by showing the different scenes through distinct angles and perspectives. For example, one of the most playful and happy scenes in the movie was when the teacher takes the students for a jog. These slowly begin to depart, leaving the professor by himself running. This scene is shown through a giant's perspective; one can see the sequence as if one was standing in a building. Also it was escorted by cheerful and lighthearted music, which accompanies the scene perfectly. This scene portrays how the actions of the children are made out of immaturity and out of juvenile behavior, and not carried out with mean intentions.The setting of the film is also a technical aspect that gives life to the story. The tiny apartment adds to the theme of loneliness. In such small areas, three people may seem a multitude. In the movie, it looks crowded, but it enforces the idea of Antoine being so uncared for. Although he is in a tight room with his parents he feels distant, and forlorn. This idea of being accompanied but lonely nonetheless, builds his character, and impulses him to act as he does. The deepness of the themes portrayed in "The 400 Blows", were considered something never seen before, something that films had never depicted previously. After stealing the typewriter and after being sent to the juvenile reformatory, the viewers are left with the feeling that if the parents could have been more caring and understanding his future would have been different. He could have then matured, and acknowledged that his behavior wasn't appropriate. By doing so he would have learned without undergoing such harsh conditions.During the 1960's the film was considered extremely modern and fresh because of the particular format it has. At the time, an innovative movement was manifesting in Europe, better known as the French New Wave. This movement was composed of mainly French directors who strove to portray social and political issues in their films. This specific movie shows how uncaring parents raise children, and how this lack of sensitivity foments the increase of young criminals. One of the main reasons for which the film "The 400 Blows" was so successful, was that it encompassed some of the main characteristics of the French New Wave, such as this shift in plots, theme, and message. The director, Francois Truffaut was one of the main leaders of this movement, along with other major figures such as: Andre Bazin, Jean Luc Godard and Eric Rohmer. After the success of "400 Blows", there were sequels following the film. Of which included: "Antoine and Collette" and three others: "Stolen Kisses", "Bed and Board" and "Love on the Run". Nonetheless none of these films had so much of success as "The 400 Blows" did. The last shot, which is a zoom in of Antoine in the beach after he escaped, gives appropriate closure to the movie. His blank stare in the camera, consumes the story with an excellent dramatic touch. This last shot is well known as the image of the French New Wave. The character through the story talks about how he had never been to the sea, and that he wanted to see it fervently. This image shows how the child accomplished his dream of going to the sea, but still feeling abandoned and lonely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Candid Without Cheap Thrills, Truthful Without Moralizing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1959, when this film was released, the "Big Film" was Ben-Hur, and except for the terrific chariot race, today that film can be fairly tedious and in spite of the Biblical setting, dated in substance and style.Truffault's film, on the other hand, seems as fresh as childhood should be, with young Antoine Doniels struggling to become himself when his support system continually fails him; there is, in his situation, a universal cry for help. No false dramatics here, no dopey comedy, no idiotic stereotypes--instead performances that touch the mind and the heart, scenes that stick in the mind (all those kids ditching the self-absorbed gym teacher as he snakes them through Parisian streets!), and a famous conclusion that still poses the same question. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic French New Wave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic French, new wave movie, directed by Francois Truffaut, is the best film I've watched in a long while. Jean Pierre Leaud plays Antoine Doinel, a troubled and misunderstood adolescent who has problems at school, lacks attention at home and gradually spirals into a life of petty crime. I was confused by the title until I learned that it is a straight translation of the French but misses its meaning; the French title refers to the expression "faire les quatre cents coups", meaning "to raise hell". The striking contrast between the (rare) happy times Antoine experiences with his parents - (his happiness being almost painful to watch in light of its rarity), and the ugly scenes where he is berated, neglected, or physically punished are crafted perfectly. Although the central theme is rather grim, there are wonderful bursts of humour, innocence and adventure throughout The 400 Blows. Antoine is clearly distanced from 'regular', happy children and nowhere is this more apparent than in the scene where he and his best friend, Renee, played by Patrick Auffay, are planning Antoine's 'running away from home' in a packed auditorium of children watching a Punch &amp; Judy-like show. As the camera pans around the small children's faces we can see how utterly absorbed they are by the show while Antoine and Renne stand apart from the crowd, only absorbed by the difficult tangle their lives have become.The 400 Blows sometimes gives one the feeling that a mere string of unfortunate events are solely to blame for how Antoine's life turns out but his dysfunctional home, defiant nature, yearning for independence and contempt for authority play a big role too. This is a beautifully made, intelligent, absorbing movie and I cannot fault it one iota.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>François Truffaut's first film and one the best movies ever made. Jean-Pierre Léaud plays Truffaut's on-screen alter ego Antoine Doinel, a mischievous youth in Paris, getting into one fix after another. Ignored by his parents (Albert Rémy &amp; Claire Maurier), he toils away his time cutting school, going to the movies and getting into trouble. Léaud, who would reprise this role throughout the next twenty years, is remarkable. Not too bright, not to aggressive, but oddly likable. Truffaut explores themes that he'd go back to time &amp; again with many subsequent films. The 27-year old directs with such a sure hand, it's hard to believe this was his debut. Henri Decaë's cinematography is stunning and Jean Constantin did the music. The film's final shot has become one of the defining images of the French New Wave.</fullReview>

It also happens to be one of the most influential films that has ever been made. And I can see why!Interestingly, Truffaut made four other films with Léaud depicting Antoine later in life. He meets his first love, Colette, in "Antoine and Colette". He falls in love with Christine Darbon in "Stolen Kisses". He marries Christine in "Bed and Board", but the couple have separated in "Love on the Run". How Antoine is shown later in life may have one thinking differently of him in this child role...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant art-direction is one of the umpteen things that make this a wonderful movie. It's a movie that depicts the lives of several unattended children in the world who make a living through petty crimes.Antonie is the scapegoat for the impropriety of his classmates. He hails from a bourgeois family in Paris and strictly obeys what his step-mother and father ask him to. He doesn't get love, the love children of his age get from their parents. He is treated with affectation, rather than affection, by his step-mother after he finds her dating another man. He is punished for things he doesn't do. He tries to turn a new leaf, be a good student and write good stories. But he is punished for plagiarism, abused for setting a curtain on fire and even resorts to stay away from home in the night and steal. He is then sent to a Juvenile home as his parents grow more and more impatient with his behavior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 400 Blows. A Truffaut's about a 12 year-old, Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud), perhaps too much independent for his young age. As great 20th century minds, he rejected school and the whole system in general. The only ones he relied on was his father, who in spite of all the incomprehension, was actually faithful to him, and his closest friend, René. They skip classes together to go to the cinema and one day he actually runs away from home. He goes living in an abandoned factory and gets away with it by stealing. This leeps on until his parents (finally) understand they are incapable of educating him and Doinel his sent to an observation centre. This movie is then turned into a sequel by Truffaut himself, and emphasised the beginning of the nouvelle vague, which is believed to have truly began one year earlier, by Claude Chabrol. Being the first movie directed by Truffaut, and if enframed in its time, it's quite impressive how it turned out so forward and full of character. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mundane story of Antoine Doinel, a boy growing up in Paris.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's my understanding that Truffaut was inspired by "A Touch of Evil" to make his first movie, and his first was this incredible story based loosely on Truffaut's on childhood. I also understand that "faire les quatre cents coups" is French slang for "to raise hell" or "to make trouble," and I suspect the title of the film in English would be more nearly "The Troublemaker.""The 400 Blows" was directed by François Truffaut, and it stars Jean-Pierre Léaud as Antoine. Antoine lives in a one-bedroom apartment in 1959 Paris with his mother and step-father. Neither appears to care much for or about Antoine, and he's a trouble-maker at school. He skips school for awhile, and ends up in a jail for a petty theft. After wondering what they were going to do with him during the summer recess, his mother and step-father have an inspiration -- let the police keep him in custody.The movie is full of subtle and not-so-subtle clues about Antoine: his step-father gave his mother money to by sheets for his cot, but they were not purchased; Antoine's pajamas are torn; he reacts angrily to his peers and his teacher, shouting threats and calling them names. Léaud is marvelous as the miscreant, showing the hurt Antoine feels on a face that hides his emotions. "The 400 Blows" is the best character study I've seen, and it has the best ending of any movie I've ever seen. It's a heartbreaking film without being maudlin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle haunting brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>French director Francois Truffaut made a stunning directorial debut with the deeply moving The 400 Blows. The film tells the story of Antoine Doinel, a misunderstood and neglected adolescent as he devolves into a life of petty crime. He has a depraved upbringing, living with his parents who only seem to notice him when he gets in trouble for things that are constantly blown out of proportion by his hateful teachers. The only place Antoine can find refuge is with his delinquent friends who, being much more fortunate than Antoine, don't suffer the consequences of their actions like Antoine does. The film is a meaningful look into the life of the adolescent and growing up under subtly harsh circumstances. His upbringing isn't outright brutal, but it is quietly cruel in a way that creeps up on you and you only realize the kind of terrible things going on in retrospect. Thus Truffaut creates a very real and very human tale that doesn't dote on the easily accessible aspects of a story like this.I've always felt a bit of forced tension in Truffaut films. I've never been able to fully believe a film of his and I only see the character interaction as ways to get the psychological study points across. The 400 Blows is different, however. I really felt something during this film. It is a film that will keep the gears in your head turning as you absorb its deep complexities and its clever nuances that drive home points that aren't right in front of your face, but they are there subtly. Truffaut constructs the storytelling in this film brilliantly and our exposure to the study of a child's psyche is delivered with tasteful moderation. Nothing feels forced yet everything has meaning. It is something so skillfully construed and is something that a lot of films today fail to do. They drive their meaning too forcefully and it becomes too overbearing, while Truffaut quietly slips you the hidden meaning under the table rather than spoon feeding you.The tone of The 400 Blows is strikingly different for a film as old as this. It is very sincere and quite dark. The film has an atmosphere of touching sincerity that won't immediately make your heart cry out in anguish for the characters, but when you think about it and you absorb the events of the film you realize how heart wrenchingly sad they really are. Plus, Truffaut's quietly haunting camera work makes the film all the more calmly depressing. It is a somber film that doesn't throw anything at you, but you know that there is a deep sadness growing within the film that comes to fruition after the movie is actually over. It's a strange sensation, but very noticeable if you take in the film correctly.I feel like The 400 Blows is a film that gets better with age. I'm not doing cartwheels about it right now, but I can see how its intelligence will grow on me until I see this film as a masterpiece. I can only assume these things and only time will tell. But I still have enough insight to call The 400 Blows an fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinema raw.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The introduction of Francois Truffaut into cinema is The 400 Blows, a marvelous insight into the profile of a teenage Parisian boy unable to connect himself to his surroundings and the responsibilities required of him. He cannot focus at school, he dislikes his home life and his parents' constant bickering, and he has an uncanny knack for getting into troublesome situations. This story arc is based in part on Truffaut's own childhood, only to be saved by the cinema and its open invitation of stability and security.While being widely considered as the starting point for the French New Wave, a watermark moment in film history, this film at its most basic level is essentially the story of a young boy attempting to find the place in which he fits most comfortably. Perhaps the most striking characteristic of the film is Jean-Pierre Leaud's face, which is so simple and understandable in its emotional tone and perception that we are never once aware of him as an actor portraying a role. He is this character of Antoine Doinel in every sense. Truffaut also was able to showcase his genius of genuine film-making. A devoted defender of the auteur theory, no other director made this theory more believable. Every shot, every camera angle, every scene bursts with the excitement and joy of film; this is a most rare characteristic. This is certainly a Truffaut film; no one else could instill such rhapsody of life and living. Despite the downbeat material, there is a remarkable sense of a new beginning. Indeed, this was a new beginning for Truffaut's life. And we are more than happy to go along for the ride with him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dehumanizing to be non-threatening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the year this film was made, I believe the issues it addresses remain exceedingly current. I think it is somewhat of a synecdoche of what society at large instills in people nowadays. It is very difficult to tread outside of the very well-delineated lines our superego has drawn for us. Antoine seems to be spiraled into this vertiginous voyage of soul destruction on almost a whim. I think it is symptomatic of our culture to "lend" our views of the world to the children, stating how they should feel and act, while not allowing their free expression of emotion. It is tragic, yet it reveals the parents' own unresolved issues and their need to project their own unwanted aspects into their kids, in whom they can exercise a more strict control. So, in the end, children not only have to carry the burden of their own emotionally chaotic and ever-changing inner world, but they need to shoulder the brunt of their parents' failings as well; perhaps this was best exemplified when Antoine's parents demand that he take the garbage out, they need to remind him that in the final analysis he is responsible for dealing with everybody's waste. What ensues in someone who has been so brow-beaten by life, without ever having their own emotions validated, is that they doubt the reality of their emotions, and encapsulate themselves into a protected world that is numb to any further assault by the world, what Sidney Klein would term an "autistic cyst." The destruction of all that is externally good is symbolized when he is being taken away in the police wagon, the tears he sheds represent the death of emotion in itself, in a cathartic manner. When the end rolls around, even fantasy cannot save him. He approaches the ocean and when he sets foot in the water, her starts to walk sideways and eventually turns away with an emotionless face? the world has nothing left to offer him. His mother also plays out her own intrapsychic dynamic very well; she suffers between the pull of her id and her superego; her id is represented by Antoine, since he was conceived out of wedlock, and he is the personification of her rebellious side. Society (including her husband) puts demands on how her child should be reared, and since he represents such a powerful force in herself, a selfobject coruscating with a lust she perhaps wishes she could reclaim, there must be hell going on inside her head. She eventually succumbs to the oppressive punitive superego, and the only way she can eliminate her pulsating id is to eliminate her contact with its concrete representation, her son. She isolates her affect and summarily casts him into the destructive world that in essence destroyed her as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie numerous times. It never grows old or stale. Each time that I watch "The 400 Blows", it seems like the very first time. This movie is superb on all levels: acting, direction, cinematography, script and the music! Watching Jean-Pierre Léaud's character "Antoine" develop on the screen totally captivates me. Antoine is a rascal and creates his own problems, but he is a product of his environment: he is rejected by his mother and his stepfather. In their eves, he cannot do anything right. He sees them as rank hypocrites. He has no role models to follow. His teachers are crass and demeaning to their students. As the result of these influences, Antoine is forced to carry a burden that is too much for an adolescent to bear!I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes B&amp;W movies that showcase the aforementioned qualities. This movie shows the "other side" of Paris that movies like "An American In Paris' ignore. "The Four Hundred Blows" is a great example of realistic, gritty cinema that packs a gut-wrenching wallop! There are no glittering sets, well-dressed ladies or men, or high-flying songs in this movie. I have worked with children like Antoine, trying to keep them in school. "The 400 Blows" is a great movie because it causes the viewer to care about Doniel and his fate.***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 400 Blows And The Three Prodigies Of The Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my eyes, there are but three true geniuses of the cinema. There are only three filmmakers who do not make films to either make money, garner artistic achievements, or even out of some truly pure and long harbored dream. There are only three men who made films because they were born to, because this world gave them no other choice. People who were meant to stand behind the camera, to tell a story, and to live 24 frames per second. Prodigies, immortalized by celluloid, there stand but three born geniuses of film. Stanley Kubrick is one of them, Orson Welles is another. And so is Francois Truffaut. Truffaut in particular strikes an interest with me personally, if for no other reason than he too was a film buff, and like me fanatical when it came to the ones he loved, and often times tyrannical when it came to the ones he detested. Before Tarantino was hailed as the film buff triumphant, before Martin Scorsese's obsessive lists came to light, there was Cahiers du cinéma, there was Francois Truffaut. Now I have neither the time nor the patience to scribe the depths of his fanaticism, but believe me, I'm fanatical, you may too think yourself something of a radical cinephile, but when it comes to Truffaut's love for the cinema and obsession with the screen, we all seem like Michael Bay fans. He was the critic triumphant, but damn was he a brilliant writer. You can tell by reading his early writings, particularly his Portrait of Humphrey Bogart or an essay titled God Bless John Ford, to pages upon obsessive pages articulating the lengths of Orson Welles and the brilliance inside of him, or his assessment of Jules Dassin's 1955 crime masterpiece 'Rififi', he talked about films in a way I'd never heard. Films touched him, deeply. They moved him, and captured his soul, and he was thankful each time the lights dimmed and the film started, he was thankful for the baptism that moving pictures gave him. His film debut was to be titled Les Quatre Cent Coups, or The 400 Blows. The 400 Blows in an intimate, private, autobiographical, and improvisational account of misunderstood youth, and the adolescent innocence of petty crime. The film features child actor Jean-Pierre Léaud, in a performance of a caliber so immense, no child actor has been able to scale it's weathered boundaries. It is a pure tale, both heartbreaking and undeniably heartwarming, it is a film that not only looks beautiful, but is beautiful. It is one of the best stories ever told, one of the most personal accounts ever reproduced from one's own life for the silver screen, and it marks Francois Truffaut's salutation to the wonderful world of the cinema. The screens were his conquer, and he knew had to do it. To scale the highest peaks. He was born to. The world gave him no other choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"To Raise Hell"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It becomes so easy to get caught up in extolling the virtues of any of the "greatest films ever made" to the point where the extollers begin to forget the essence and point of the film itself. François Truffaut's The 400 Blows is as definitive an example as any. Consistently topping critics' lists and credited for effectively spearheading the movement known as the French New Wave (along with Godard's Breathless), the most important thing to remember about Truffaut's seminal work is that, far from being designed to be an awards-lapping masterpiece of art cinema, the film was spawned by autobiographical sentiments so anarchic and countercultural that they would sneer at the notion of any such pretension. And this is the true beauty of The 400 Blows ? that it feels so wholeheartedly honest that there is no sense of trying to cater to any particular audiences at any point, naturally making it paradoxically all the more refreshing, delightful and compelling. 'Delightful' and 'distressing' are sentiments consistently courted by every fibre of Truffaut's film, as he refuses to pigeonhole himself within the confines of autobiography, morality tale or any sort of genre. Fusing the gritty aesthetic and stark, lived-in locations of neorealism with boldly cheeky and irreverent cinematic flourishes (cameras consistently slyly pacing about and brazenly cheerful musical interludes, as if winking at the audience whenever the mood threatens to become excessively dour), Truffaut proves just as adept at capturing the free-spirited joie-de-vivre of youth as articulating the socializing forces which can far too easily twist childhood into a downward spiral of acting out to being branded a societal criminal. Harshly criticizing Antoine's clueless parents and excessively disciplinarian school system without quite devolving them into cartoons bereft of authenticity, Truffaut equally resists exonerating Antoine himself of any responsibility for his actions, but fervently insists that we understand rather than judge Antoine, with the hope that such clearly delineated concerns could prove preventable in future real life contexts. Nonetheless, while a bitter undercurrent colours the film, there remains veritable magic throughout, particularly associated with the cinema and the sea, but such perfectly spaced out moments are enough to leave the viewer departing the film wiping tears of poignant happiness rather than social anxiety from their faces. If nothing else, the film merits its accolades for extracting arguably the best performance from a child actor in cinematic history from Jean-Pierre Léaud as Antoine. Appearing to live rather than play his part, Léaud invests Antoine with a remarkably vibrant yet precariously subtle energy, his most inconsequential gestures belying volumes of character information and authenticity ? the sheer joy he exudes when attending the cinema with his parents, and of course his infamous haunted stare in the film's enigmatic final freeze-frame demonstrate a masterful talent already in full force rather than merely developing. In support, Claire Morier delivers a mother figure who, despite being effectively loathsome, the viewer still yearns to love, as her moments of attempting to positively connect with her son offer incredible weight and nuance which eliminate the fear of her descending into a stereotype. Furthermore, Albert Rémy equally toes the line between inciting love and hate as Antoine's father, constantly caught between sparkling dry humour and selfish, sporadic criticisms towards his son and wife alike. Finally, Guy Decomble's militant teacher may come across as a terrifying overstatement, but probably one that eerily speaks to a child's sense of how such a figure would come across, and Decomble, pitching his performance between credible and filtered through a child's perception, is uncomfortably effective. Flawless technical work and exhaustingly poignant emotional resonance aside, Truffaut's The 400 Blows remains at heart a scrappy, defiantly jubilant ode to childhood, and thus proves more memorable as such than as incendiary social commentary. Either way, it is abundantly clear that a film that defies pretension and inaccessibility so vehemently yet is still such an abiding classic deserves to be seen by one and all. New and old viewers will be wishing by the end that they could go on running alongside Antoine, whisked away in his cheeky, heartsick countercultural defiance, for eternity. -10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Francois Truffaut's masterpiece that is The 400 Blows is just that. The movie for me picks up after the past film "La Maternelle" leaves off. The film is also a much less optimistic portrayal of the youth of France and the end is just amazing. The movie sadly won't be seen by everyone and isn't for everyone. I highly recommend this film for anyone who is interested in a full fledged foreign cinematic experience.Everything in this movie ranging from the cinematography to the acting is superb and is on a whole other level from the rest of the world's pictures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The 400 Blows' (original title: 'Les Quatre Cents Coups') is a nice film directed by François Truffaut. This is one of the defining movies of the French New Wave, which was influenced by the Italian neorealism.The title 'The 400 Blows' might cause some confusion, leading one to believe that it is about corporal punishment or crime. But it's not. While the English language title is a straight translation of the french language title, the meaning is another ball game. The french language title is part of the expression "faire les quatre cents coups" - which means "to raise hell".This french motion-picture is especially significant for its director, as it reflects events of his own life and even his friends's lives. So, it's a semi-autobiographical film (Truffaut saw on the character Antoine Doinel a lot of himself). Besides, the film lets us know the unfair way how juvenile offenders in France were treated back then.The story is about Antoine Doinel, a common teenager in Paris, who is seen by his parents and teachers as annoying and as a rebel. We do feel for him and I'm pretty sure that many of us can (or could once) relate to him at the same age.It's a film which simplicity is all about, with a simple plot and no major surprises. But it's beautifully filmed and done, real, human, sensitive, dramatic and, to a degree, poetic. It is also very convincing in portraying the adolescents's conflicts and crisis of existence. It also demonstrates how times were so different and how people had much more liberty at the time. Completely different of nowadays's pressures which we are so prisoners of.Another beauty of the film is on the settings. Through the adventures of the two kids, it takes us ourselves to the streets of Paris (even if only by screen), without forgetting to mention that the first minutes are an excellent opening, showing images of the heart of the city (as if we were traveling by train, car, motorcycle or even bike), near the Eiffel Tower and even right next to it. On this, I'd like to make a comparison: it shows a lot more of Paris than 'Before Sunset'. What a difference, there isn't even comparison! I know they are completely different films, but they both take place in the same city. I always thought that 'Before Sunset' shows very little of Paris. They were "lazy" on that one. But not with this one.The final part of the film is also especially beautiful, showing Antoine running away to the ocean (which he always wanted to experience), reaching the sea's shoreline, running into it, then turning back to the land. It's as if he is hesitant and at the same time determined to go as far as he can. Then the camera zooms in and "freezes" his face looking straight to the camera like he is breaking the 4th wall.Jean-Pierre Léaud is great as Antoine Doinel, as well as Patrick Auffay as René Bigey (Antoine's best friend). The kids have the best performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit I am bluffed. I need films to have some "resonance", to tell me something about where and when I live, or about me. Hence I use to focus myself on films of my time, thinking (fallaciously I now reckon) that it's the best way to find this resonance. But circumstances led me to see this film I always avoided until now though I knew to be highly praised. Is it because education is an eternal issue? Even if the French school and justice systems are not anymore what they were at the time of "Les 400 coups", questioning is aroused. Plus though sometimes a bit long, it's often funny. Even enjoyable by a 10-years-old, and even raising questions from them. Only question is: how much do you need to be French to enjoy it and see it work on you? Because we laughed more often than English people around us, and I wonder how much just seeing good old has-been France played a role in our enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the Caged Bird Runs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My ninth grade French teacher showed "Les quatre cents coups" in class, which is highly recommended (it certainly separated this teacher from the one in the film). Today, you'd probably need permission slips, but it's definitely worth the effort. No dubbing or subtitles were allowed - so we had to see a "pure" French version. This was in keeping with the classroom rule forbidding any English be spoken as soon as we went through the classroom door. Nobody understood French well enough to get much of the conversation in the film, and there was no discussion following the film. But, no discussion was necessary.You understood all you need to know through visuals and vocal inflections; and, the French version is likely be more engaging to a schoolchild stuck in the classroom. It can be timed to end at the closing bell.François Truffaut really shows Jean-Pierre Leaud how to run like hell.Many critics point to the cruelty of the schoolteacher and ineffective juvenile facility as main points administering the "400 Blows" of the English title. But, the one "Blow" mattering is the one inflicted by parents. It's no secret that the Father isn't the boy's original dad. That's not a problem in itself (and, neither is her affair), but it will be, here. More serious is the problem of Mother. In early scenes, the boy longs for Mother by sitting in her make-up chair. Next, he overhears older women discussing bloody childbirth. And, when he needs an excuse for school truancy, he says his mother died. Without parenting, you grow up fast.********** Les quatre cents coups (5/4/59) François Truffaut ~ Jean-Pierre Léaud, Patrick Auffay, Claire Maurier, Albert Remy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Childhood's End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 400 Blows is the film that brought the French New Wave international repute (one year before Breathless), garnering worldwide critical acclaim and turning its director, Francois Truffaut, from a major force in film journalism to a major force in film creation.Godard's debut, it is true, is the more stylish of the two, with its risqué jump cuts, philosophical dialogue and gangster posing, but The 400 Blows delivers in terms of spirit and youthful tenderness, essentially marking the different personalities of both directors.Both films are, however, in love with cinema and, watching The 400 Blows, one is reminded of the child protagonists from the films of the Neo-realists, the kids from Bunuel's Los Olvidados and, on home turf, those from Vigo's Zero De Conduite. The comparison with Vigo is particularly resonant ? many of The 400 Blows' most stirring and poetic moments would not look out of place in the earlier director's short canon of acclaimed work.As Truffaut's debut feature-length production, The 400 Blows is an outpouring of emotion and exuberance, with many of the events depicted drawn from the director's own childhood. Yet the story never feels sentimental and, for all of our attachment to the central character, Truffaut never deliberately tugs at our heart strings, leaving us instead to take in the events ? one minute whimsical, the next, tragic ? and have our moods swing gently, but passionately, in time with the images.In Jean Pierre Léaud, Truffaut finds his younger self again (albeit a cheekier, slightly tougher version) and the actor delivers an extremely naturalistic performance as Antoine Doinel, subtly conveying emotion in the most intense circumstances. This is what prevents the film descending into melodrama, and what lends it its subtlety and its realism.Perhaps the most touching scenes in the film are those that celebrate the friendship between Doinel and his school mate René. The two are kindred spirits and bunk school together to catch the latest films at the cinema, try out the latest rides at the fair or come up with another money-making scam. The two live in a shared fantasy world and the only affection they receive is that from each other. Doinel, for all his petty thieving and delinquency, is a caring, affectionate boy ? far more so than any of the elders in the film (who are seen to be liars, thieves and ? what's more ? physically and verbally abusive). This friendship between the two boys is particularly resonant as it mirrors the real life relationship between Truffaut and his lifelong friend Robert Lachenay (who assisted in the production of the film, as well as in that other New Wave classic, Paris, Nous Appartient).The film is, after all, an attack on a society that feels burdened by its children, that no longer has time for them and that seeks to instill in them a sense of guilt and blame for many of life's problems. The film is an elegy to the innocence and freedom that Antoine and René fleetingly enjoy, before the net ensnares them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Understand It? Google "Alice Miller"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truffaut and Moussy understood the parental abandonment (and abuse) of children more or less as famed author Alice Miller (Prisoners of Childhood, For Your Own Good, Thou Shalt Not Know) understood it.Miller saw millions of children being raised by parents with all manner of narcissistic obsessions that prevented them from living =for= their children, believing instead (as had probably been the case with their =own= parents) that the children lived to serve =them= and not the other way around. Miller's research (at about the time this film was made) revealed that raising children to be "farm animals" had been a cultural norm in Northern Europe for centuries.Truffaut and Moussy knew it wasn't occasional or just "here and there," and that it was a pandemic in the working class of their time. "You've been so hard on him," his phlegmatic (and codependent) father says to his mother. "He's always a problem," says the self-involved, sexpot madre.To them both, however, he's little more than an inconvenience in their lives. So long as he does his chores and stays out of trouble, he is viewed by them both as "merely tolerable." He gets no attention (or rewards) (or reinforcement) from being "good," so... he goes "rotten" and becomes the center of his parents' lives."Juvenile delinquency" was a relatively new phenomenon in the West in the '50s. And a lot of noise was being made about it at the time. This is simply Truffaut's explanation of it as the expectable result of combining working class slavery with the "grab the brass ring" expectations sold by the media.It was "big news" to filmgoers in those days. For many, it =still= is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film I had taken years to finally get around to seeing the The 400 Blows is truly excellent if not a bit strange in it's presentation. The last third of the movie seems a bit harsh considering what the boy actually did, by today's standards it's pretty much nothing at all. The best part of the film is Truffaut's camera work which is nothing but superb. The black and white really makes the film, showing the depressing life of a boy unwanted at home by his mother, and it seems he does not know his father is not really his father. He turns to a life of petty crime and running away to escape his problems only to find he is too young for the streets of Paris. This film has always been hailed as a masterpiece, and in it's time it was. Today it is more a trip to the past, a past that is not very much different then today as I'm sure their are plenty of children in the same predicament out there right now. Still an important piece of film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Classic Pioneer of Modern French Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first film by legendary French director François Truffaut that I have seen. Finally. I read that this was one of Truffaut's first films,if not his very first. Furthermore, "The 400 Blows" holds an important place in French film history as the film that ushers in the Modern Era of French cinema. It is vital to keep these facts in mind as we review this film.On the surface, it is actually just a film about how chronic parental neglect leads to juvenile delinquency, a topic oft-tackled in many films. But as the pioneer in Cinema Verite, "The 400 Blows" is remarkable in its most original approach (at that time, at least). The ordinary life of a low-income family in a small apartment is portrayed with an almost documentary feel. We follow the lead character Antoine Doinel as his ordinary school mischief leads to truancy, leading to running away from home, gradually leading to actual thievery and eventually, to jail. We see how the adults (his parents, teachers, authorities) around him react to his behavior. It is all very realistic. Of course, we have seen this style a lot of times by now. But keep in mind that this film was the FIRST to do it.For me, the best part of the film was definitely the lead actor Jean-Pierre Léaud. He is very natural as he goes through a tumultuous adolescence as experienced by his character Antoine. It seemed like he was not acting at all. The highlight of his acting is that scene where he was being interviewed in the corrections center. His delivery of those lines was appropriately nuanced and felt. There was none of the affected artificiality that mars a lot of child performances at that time. I read that Léaud would reprise this character in three more Truffaut films, so I hope I can also get to see those in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Coming-of-age Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For his feature-film debut, critic-turned-director François Truffaut drew inspiration from his own troubled childhood. The 400 Blows stars Jean-Pierre Léaud as Antoine Doinel, Truffaut's preteen alter ego. One of the defining films of the French New Wave, it displays many of the characteristic traits of the movement. Written by Truffaut and Marcel Moussy,it is about a misunderstood adolescent in Paris who is thought by his parents and teachers to be a troublemaker.Misunderstood at home by his parents and tormented in school by his insensitive teacher, Antoine frequently runs away from both places. The boy finally quits school after being accused of plagiarism by his teacher. He steals a typewriter from his father to finance his plans to leave home. The father angrily turns Antoine over to the police, who lock the boy up with hardened criminals. A psychiatrist at a delinquency center probes Antoine's unhappiness, which he reveals in a fragmented series of monologues.Poignant, exhilarating, and fun, this film is an important classic. Originally intended as a 20-minute short,it was expanded into a feature when Truffaut decided to elaborate on his self-analysis. For the benefit of Truffaut's fellow film buffs, The 400 Blows is full of brief references to favorite directors, notably Truffaut's then-idol Jean Vigo. The director's ode to his childhood is an engrossing watch that is alluring in its simplicity and brilliant in its direction. It flows nicely at its own pace, never allowing melodrama to ruin its realistic and voyeuristic atmosphere.In addition to that,it brought a fresh and piercingly honest portrayal of troubled youth to the screen. In many ways, Antonie Doinel is not only the cinematic embodiment of Truffaut, but also the French New Wave as a whole.Because of that,it has become one of the all-time great coming-of-age movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever wanted to just get "away from it all" in life, go joyriding in stolen cars, steal stuff to keep your fantasy thriving, all while dealing with constant contradictions of authority and goal-makers? That's pretty much what I got out of this movie. There was excellent, whimsical acting by all the cast (mostly out of the kids in the classroom), great direction on little nuances that the lead boy, Antoine, felt like doing, and excellent cinematography showing the depth of where poor choices can lead you (and oppositely, the grandeur of the openness of hope in a stress-free society). The story was typical of any boy trying to understand what everything means in life while still under the roof of his parents, who constantly lie to one another and live a dramatic lifestyle between each other.One the other hand, though, nothing was really learned after Antoine experiences his version of remorse for his actions. In fact, he doesn't really grow up at all. It's almost as good as half of a movie. I think the film was just trying to show the consequences for a life gone awry, made possible by the lies he told, by what he stole, and how he treated supervision and authority, which, in my opinion, isn't a grandiose story to tell at all. It's pretty understandable in anyone's life that's been raised well. So I lack to see the fervor in which some might enjoy the story or the film as a whole.I think the replay value of the film is low. The score was amazing, with his own complex theme and everything. Again, the technical aspects were there, but the experience of Antoine's was not much of one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Your parents say you're always lying"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a little hesitant about rating and reviewing François Truffaut's 'The 400 Blows,' as my first viewing was a rather dysfunctional and muddled affair, one of those moments when you wish that DVD technology had never been invented as a substitute for the perfection of the cinema screen. A remarkable feature-length debut from the revered critic-turned-director, Truffaut's touching and funny portrait of juvenile angst proved one of the pioneering films in the French New Wave. Just a few days ago, I decided to attend my university's film society for a showing of the film, but, inconceivably and unforgivably, the screening was started a full thirty minutes into the picture, and, due to a wearisome technical fault, we missed a further ten minutes in the centre of the story, including the moment when young Antoine reveals himself to have never seen the ocean, a remark that proves extremely significant once we arrive at the conclusion.Fortunately, I had a copy of the film back at home, and promptly viewed the scenes that had been neglected, allowing me to better appreciate the intricate depths to which the film explored its characters and their respective situations. Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) was born out of wedlock, and practically abandoned by his parents to live with relatives. After several years, Antoine returns to his resentful mother (Claire Maurier) and his kind, if inadequate, stepfather (Albert Rémy) to hopefully commence a normal lifestyle, but, driven by the discomfort of his uneasy home relationships, Antoine descends into a life of mischief and petty crime. When his misbehavior becomes overwhelming for his strained parents, Antoine finds himself in a correctional facility for juvenile delinquents, and, despite the institute's strict disciplinary action, he still finds himself yearning for "a life of his own," to be completely independent of his elders, and to live unrestrained by their narrow-minded restrictions.Léaud, in only his second film appearance, is wonderfully natural in the main role, portraying Antoine's tortured confinement ? stemming both from society's restrictive disciplinary system, and his stagnant family relationships ? with poignant, and often funny, enthusiasm. He would reunite with Truffaut on a further four occasions between 1962 and 1979 to complete the story of Antoine Doinel's life. There's little doubt that 'The 400 Blows' is at least partially autobiographical. Truffaut himself never knew his natural father, had a detached relationship with his mother and frequently found shelter in his love for cinema. During the film, Antoine discovers a passion for the French novelist and playwright Honoré de Balzac, whose successful career was borne from a life plagued with personal and professional difficulties, his willful nature often squandering his attempts at business success. Always thirsting for independence from those who dictate rules to him, Antoine relates easily with Balzac, even building a candle-lit throne to the author, but his word-for-word "homage" is mistaken for plagiarism by his short-sighted school teacher.The film's final moments are rightfully celebrated for their touching and poignant ambiguity, as Antoine escapes from the juvenile institution and proceeds towards the ocean, which he has never seen before; his arrival at the rolling waves representative of that almost-unattainable independence of which he was so desirous. In a single, extremely smooth long-shot, Antoine ambles across the sand, always moving forward but seemingly getting nowhere. As he finally kicks at the breaking surf, Antoine pauses, perhaps uncertain of his path from here. Having acquired his goal of independence, he suddenly finds himself alone and purposeless, a small boy playing dolefully in the water. Antoine turns his back to the ocean and faces the audience directly {does he see his pursuers approaching in the distance?}, and the camera zooms in on a captured frame of Antoine's face, his soft, inquiring eyes asking us what he's supposed to do now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A poetic story of a young boy's quest for freedom and liberty. The story is truly beautiful as we watch this young boy do whatever he can to enjoy life and free himself from the stranglehold of his parents and his school teacher. That being said, Antoine is certainly a human character. In attempting to escape from his parents, he has to do some terrible things. He steals and gets caught for it, spending a night in a prison cell.The final shot is one of the most beautiful and uplifting I've ever seen. I never imagined that the pure simplicity of a tracking shot following one boy running away to the beach could evoke so much emotion, but it made my heart swell up immensely. In fact the entire film is phenomenally shot. Some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. I found the entire picture incredibly relatable. Antoine's interactions with his parents felt so much like some of the experience I've had with my own in the past. It really felt like the scenes were taken right out of my past to the point of it being eerie. But that only helped me relate to Antoine even more.The young Jean-Pierre Léaud's performance is extraordinary. He completely became Antoine to the point where it was impossible to tell that he was even acting. It felt like we were just following this young boy and watching his natural reactions. This is a truly rare gift for actor's four times his age, so that just makes his work even more impressive. In short it's a simple, beautiful, poetic film with a great, relatable story and a phenomenal performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an extremely down to earth film about a young boy living in Paris, France with his mother, Gilberte Doinel, (Claire Maurier) and his father Julien Doinel, (Albert Remy). This young boy is Antoine Doinel, (Jean-Pierre Leaud) who is a rather rebellious young man in school and causes all kinds of problems with his teachers. Antoine steals money from his parents, skips school and pals around with his friends who are not much better than he is. This young man proceeds to almost burn his apartment house down and is constantly hearing his father and mother fighting among each other. One day, Antoine cuts school and sees his mother kissing passionately another man on a Paris street. This story clearly shows what can happen to a child who is not really loved and has mental problems trying to fit into society and has no ambitions to better himself in life and is always looking for any easy way out of the routine of living. There is lots of laughs in this film and some very sad and heart breaking events that continue to drive Antoine to a complete dead end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A simple, lucid story which, with a lightness so natural that it almost seems unintentional, gradually unravels into a full-blown masterpiece. Tragic as the story is, it still keeps this charming, luminous allure, like a breath of fresh air in the shape of a movie. Jean-Pierre Léaud's performance is nothing short of fantastic. Yet it's exactly on his casting for the part that I would like to comment. On the one hand, the choice is perfect - he IS Antoine Doinel, he lives and breathes this part as if it were his own life. On the other hand, the lead was obviously supposed to be a charismatic actor with a charming personality, able to make the audience feel for him. And that he does incredibly well.. but in fact, Antoine-Jean-Pierre is even TOO good. He is supposed to portray a troubled boy falling deeper and deeper down the social scale, and that in reality is a way darker, uglier sight than the one we see. Léaud conveys a strange sense of well-being and invincibility even in the hardest moments of Antoine's life, which renders the movie even more "watchable", but at the expense of psychological accuracy. I also find it hard to believe as a spectator that someone as heartrendingly adorable as this child could suffer such amounts of neglect and abuse from the grown-ups who surround him. The scenes with his family who couldn't care less about him come across as slightly unconvincing at moments. It's hard to imagine a mother so cold or a father so ruthless in the face of the exceptionally charming little human being that is Léaud-Doinel. Yet it's probably this uncanny supernaturally natural charisma that gives us a sense of hope at the end of the movie and a feeling that in spite of everything that has happened at the end of the day he'll do well.I gave it 9 out of 10, and am still in doubts, 'cos it could have been a perfect ten. Still, as great a movie as it is, I wouldn't recommend it to everybody. In a few words - pure cinema at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truffaut's autobiographical masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Fellini's "8 1/2" was a reflection of his own torment as a director, "The 400 Blows" was Francois Truffaut's exorcism of personal demons. Antoine Doinel is allegedly Truffaut's own projection of himself at an early age, and this movie was a very important project for the director as an adult.Jean-Pierre Léaud plays Antoine remarkably well, as a thoughtful but rebellious Parisian student who skips school and goes to the movies with his friends. His mother (Claire Maurier) shows no interest in the boy, nor does his father. He retreats home every day sullenly and sits on his bed, daydreaming.Beautifully filmed and still poignant after all these years, Truffaut's masterpiece is a moving and engaging study of youth that continues to retain its significance today. Definitely worth seeing, perhaps even worth buying if you're a film buff. The Criterion Collection DVD is excellent and provides a very insightful glimpse into both the movie and Truffaut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Our hero is a delinquent - he hates his mother and teacher. He is a liar, and he is an exquisitely vulnerable child of 10. His mother is either a prostitute or very promiscuous, his father is ineffectual of disciplining his son, or even mentioning his wife's betrayal.The film, shot is black and white, and situated in Paris, presents the frenetic escape of a youth - alienated at once by his bizarre parents, and his malignant teacher who displays only revulsion at the child's expressions.Accused of plagiarism la gar de 400 coups escapes to a wealthy friends house, where we encounter yet another disinterested parent, preoccupied with his career.La gar de 400 coups is eventually sent to a school for delinquents, where the isolation of his situation trembles from the screen. A lost child, in a world of promiscuous mom's, deadbeat dads, and uncaring adults. What form of solace can be found among those often "blows"? The plot is not structured into acts, indeed, it progresses like weight accumulating on an overladen beast of burden. We wait for the collapse. We also cannot totally sympathize for the gar de 400 coups - he is shown to be a thief - repented only for the lack of a sale - we see him read Balzac, and dream big.No, he is not a humanist, spawning wisdom from some future novel - but one of us, caught in the trenches of this terminable battle against the forces that oppress us - be it our mundane jobs or our unfaithful wives. The child, and THIS IS THE TRAGEDY - has glimpsed this bleakness, and his only consolation is two feet in the sea.He has traveled the earth, and found nothing but vacancy - moral, existential - it's up to you. And the beach goes on... and the sand erodes... there's no mercy for the living.A superb film, that deserves multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first film from the Antoine Doinel series, this movie is the beginning of a long journey of adolescent discovery. A true coming of age story that depicts the idiosyncratic difficulties of growing up. Set in a 1950's France, the main character, Antoine goes through a series of events that eventually result in displinary action. His precocious wit frustrates the elders around him and his parents become restless with the numerous attempts to keep him out of trouble. Anotine Doinel played by Jean-Pierre Léaud, gives an endering and outstanding performance. The movie keep's a steady vibe and is entertaining visually for its realism. A true classic and one of François Truffaut best films!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will never forget the look on Antoine Doinel's face as he is being transported to prison. It is a look of fear, loss of innocence and recognition of betrayal. Truffaut's first feature length is, in my opinion, his finest. It never fails to make me laugh and cry without feeling manipulated. The French (well, pretty much all European countries, really) are famous for making realistic movies about children. If you're used to seeing American films like Home Alone, you'll definitely want to check this one out. Jean-Pierre Leaud in his first film role, is totally believable as Antoine. He's not cutesy and not too smart--just a complete portrait of a normal, if wounded, little boy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Francois Truffaut said that: "This life creates that solitude. That's it. It would have sounded a false note to have a cheerful or a pessimistic ending. At the edge of the water, I had this child come forward, look straight into the eyes of the public and, in effect, say, 'Well, here I am. The story's over.' There's a refusal to judge." A perfect film that ends on the perfect note. See Studs Terkel, The Spectator:Talk about movies and plays with the people that make them. 1999 [great book]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Occasionally, one views a film, and comes away feeling enlightened, in the truest sense of the word. Truffaut's 'Quatre Cents Coups' epitomizes this echelon of cinema. It delves into the chaotic and uninhibited life of young Antoine Doinel. This film chronicles his strive for intellectual acceptance, of his yearning for freedom, and the tumultuous life hurled before him by derelict and apathetic parents. Replete with symbolism and autobiographical aspects, the 400 blows shows the triumph of young Doinel despite the seemingly insurmountable obstacles he must face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mesmerizing début for Truffaut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Voil??the New Wave has reached the shore. At times dazzling and tragic, Francois Truffaut's bleak look at French society and juvenile delinquents is markedly different than other films of the era. While some directors were looking outward at America or making edgy films, Truffaut explores the interior life of Antoine Doinel. Antoine Doinel?played by Jean-Pierre Léaud, who reprises this role in later Truffaut films?is a misbehaving boy. At school, he is caught passing a lewd photo of a woman. He is without remorse, playing tricks behind the teacher's class (played by Guy Decomble from Melville's "Bob le Flambeur"). He is the class clown in a rigid school where any malfeasance is not tolerated. The schoolteacher pauses his lesson and says, "Poor France, what a future!" When he skips school one day with co-conspirator and sidekick René, he sees his mother kissing a man. This man is not her husband. She sees him, he definitely sees her, and the two scurry away. A jazzy score quickens the melancholy pace of the film, matching the mood and pulse of Paris quite nicely. It's not a stretch to assign this film social critique status. At two points in the film, teachers lead children on forced exercise walks on the streets. In pairs of two, the children break apart from the group unbeknownst to the teacher until none remain. Truffaut?a rebel who created Doinel as a two parts himself one part his friends?is poking fun at the establishment. The nation's future?its children?are rebelling against the rigidity and discipline of their elders, the teachers. It's not loud, it's not overt, but it is happening steadily. This tension between the older generation and the younger generation defined the New Wave directors and drives this film. Understandably, many critics think this film champions cause cél?bre of sorts?the severity with which juvenile delinquents are treated. I tend to agree. Doinel is sent away without so much as a fair seat at the table. He is mixed in with petty thieves and worse. The plot of the film is irrelevant. Doinel cannot sit still because he yearns for adventure and cheap thrills?arcade, movies, 'Gravitron' ride?and his truant behavior catches up with him. Eventually, he is shipped away to a reform school where he is to straighten up. Doinel is the soul of the film. He is not a bad boy. He is a real boy. Marcel Moussy and Truffaut wanted to paint a more realistic, complex portrait of a boy (with a mind, a heart, and often conflicting emotions), and they have succeeded brilliantly. He knows right from wrong. He just can't be bothered. He sets the table for dinner, then steals money. He gets a thrill out of breaking the rules. But he has a conscience?he can't get the professor's harsh voice out of his head. When Doinel plays hooky, he overhears another woman talking at the bakery about an unwanted child. Doinel pauses to listen, then winces. In some ways, Doinel is the product of his parents. His mother is strict, serious, unwavering. But his father?with whom we emphasize?is funny, loose, and proud of Doinel. He knows Doinel stole his Michelin guide, but he would rather hope for the best than outright accuse him. Truffaut has an eye for domesticities and quotidian life. The relationship between his mother and father is similarly strained. Their marriage is so familiar, they are both weary of it. When disputes arise, we see Doinel wrapped in his sleeping blanket on his mattress, listening. The plot quickens when Doinel admits to a shrink that his mother wanted an abortion, and it was his grandmother who convinced her otherwise. The catch: he made up that last bit, and ad-libbed the whole interview. This powerful scene?in which Doinel is speaking actually to Truffaut because the actress wasn't available?has outlived 400 Blows. He fidgets, he shrugs, he uhhs?Léaud *is* Doinel. Chilling. Like other films of this era, all shots are taken at real locations. Henri Decea, the cinematographer who is as much of a staple of the New Wave as Truffaut and Godard, provides a revealing capture of a child without seeming condescending, too close, or too far. We are invited into Doinel's world like a silent co-conspirator, a witness to his every act, capture, and punishment. This film is at once marvelous and poignant. Even if you elect not to see the movie (a mistake), you must catch the last scene on YouTube. Doinel has escaped the confines of his reform school, and runs to the sea. The final shot of Doinel is "as famous as the Odessa steps in Battleship Potempkin, or the snow globe from Citizen Kane" according to critic Richard Neupart. A must-see for any film major, buff, or appreciator. If you liked this film, you should consider Truffaut's earlier work Les mistons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this on a double bill about 25 years ago with my sister who guided my early interest in film. We both though it was overrated. Despite our good intentions, I'd say we were both too immature to get it.12 year old Doinel is a pretty good kid by today's standards. He's at the stage in his development where his youthful desperation can devise quasi-criminal diversions quicker than his yet-to-develop conscience can reject them. He has no comprehension of repercussions or other people's emotional interest in his whereabouts. Doinel live via a series of lies and self-complicated situations, and the parents depicted have their own deceits; secret trysts, facts they'd rather not acknowledge, etc.. The message he has to parse is that his poor choices are unacceptable but his mothers are to be swept under the rug. Making this movie sweeter is the sheer mildness of the problems which lead to his parents disavowal. With his characteristic care-free, neutral viewpoint, he'll never be able to play ball with his mom &amp; step-dad. The mother here is an essay in self-serving abuse, but it's parents that have the power in 1959 and so Doinel has to callously be sent away. Jean-Pierre Leaud is such a charming natural in front of the camera that I can never forget this performance. His audition tape suggests, as has been confirmed, that major portions of Antoine Doinel are Leaud's personal qualities shining through. Like a parent, you don't want him to grow up, because life has a way of stripping away the pure qualities of childhood. Adulthood might bring maturity but it can never equal the naturalism and comfort he feels.* His performance made me think of some greater goals in life than where you end up. I wish I was this comfortable as an adult. The calmness with which Truffaut lets a scene and a shot play out is refreshing.*And sure enough the featurette Antoine et Collette from Love at Twenty pursues Doinel onto shakier ground. It's a mixed blessing. Truffaut knows we don't want to let Doinel go, but watching him become gangly over-serious and awkward as he negotiates love poorly is painful. "Doinel loses his confidence" is not the place I wanted this character to go.</fullReview>

But if everyone else can add their 2 cents, here's my three...I find it ridiculous that we hold these movies as such classics, that aren't really as brilliant as we claim. Don't get me wrong, I actually loved the movie as a story, it was a real slice of life and as I writer...to keep an audience tuned in for the entire movie without actually having a "story" other than a kid being a hard head...you have done your job well as a film maker...but I give it a 2 because it is held at such high regard, then you go and see it and it's just another movie that could easily be forgotten about in a couple of years, if people didn't boast about how great it was. I think we need to reconsider "What a classic really is." And stop falling in with the crowd because it's enjoyed by the masses and a good print is still available to be restored.

		<shortDescription>a brilliant masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antoine Doinel is a 12 years old boy who is rather well mannered and sensible but his childish naiveness is enough for him to become an arbitrary victim of the machineries of parental disfunctionality and criminalization.He is exposed to the ignorance of his mother who doesn't like him and on the other hand the oldfashioned schoolsystem that pays no attention to the specific circumstances in Antoines life. Even though he tries to satisfy the demands of both of these institutions the improved solutions that he thought up in childish naiveity lead to fatal consequences. once he is classified a troublemaker by his teacher and parents there is no escape from the process where at its end family and educational system arrange his deportation to a working camp for juvenile delinquents.Truffauts approach to the subject becomes clear in a scene where dozens of little children excitedly follow a puppetshow, pointing out how children all react alike to a well intended input from the grown up world, at the same time indicating that children enter the world with a pure mind and soul and consequently showing how grown ups settled Antoines fate as a juvenile delinquent.without clumsy sentimentality but a very sharp sense for Antoine's in the beginning uncritical and naive perception of the process of his criminalization during that he gradually develops an understanding for what is happening to him, Truffaut depicts the drama that culminates in the final scene where Antoine runs away from the working camp to the nearby sea as an attempt to escape from the criminal identity and emotional pain imposed on him by parents and educational institutions.Truffaut more or less portrays his own youth in this movie. And maybe that is the reason why he is able to describe the story of his protagonist with unmatched sensibleness and humanism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving, beautiful, and ultimately heartbreaking in a way few films can be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many films that are proclaimed to be masterpieces in academic circles are effective on a technical level but often cold and alienating on a story level. "The 400 Blows" is anything but cold. It doesn't matter what your political or social background is, you will relate and eventually feel sorry for Antoine Doinel. This is the power of François Truffaut's masterpiece, which still remains one of the best films ever made on the subject of youth. Truffant was one of the best directors for films such as this. He displayed enough virtuosity and skill but never became self-indulgent or too flashy as to detract us from the style. As much as I love "Breathless", Goddard would never be able to make a film such as this with his post-modern style.The character of Doinel remains innocent through out because his crimes are so petty. Goddard is thankfully never judgmental towards his protagonist (mainly because the film is largely autobiographical). He is basically plagued by bad luck and always managing to be caught in situations involving groups of people (the pin-up in the beginning introduces us to this aspect). The scene with the psychiatrist shows that he doesn't really belong with the other delinquents at the reformatory. Credit for the films greatness is as much due to Jean-Pierre Léaud's performance as Truffant's direction.The film's open-ended conclusion is masterful and the final shot is as magnificent as the one in "Casablanca". Doinel's life was further explored in other films by Truffant, but this remains the director's most compelling film. Its moving, beautiful, and ultimately heartbreaking in a way few films can be.

		<shortDescription>Portrait of the artist as a young hellraiser</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many artists and writers, director François Truffaut began his career with an autobiographical piece based on his unhappy childhood. Sometimes these works are just self-indulgent ways for their creators to exorcise their personal demons?and sometimes, like Truffaut's "The 400 Blows," they go far beyond that. This movie allows those of us who were never young hellraisers like Truffaut or his protagonist Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) to understand him and discover the universality of his story. The way that Antoine's family alternates between loudly arguing and pretending that everything is happy is very recognizable. So is the way that Antoine is stuck somewhere between childhood and adolescence and expected to take responsibility for his actions, even though the adults' rules don't make sense."The 400 Blows" is basically a character study of Antoine, a lower-middle-class Parisian boy. Occasionally, his willful disaffectedness reminded me of a French Holden Caulfield, but he lacks Holden's cynical, superior attitude. The movie shows us that other characters think of Antoine as a rage-fueled delinquent, but that in reality he is an aimless youth who always chooses the wrong moments to act defiant. Léaud gives an amazing performance that perfectly matches the movie's tone: sympathetic to Antoine's plight, yet resisting the temptation to make him into a downtrodden victim. I have seen a few other Truffaut films, and one of the things I like best about his style is his skillful use of long wordless sequences, often set to music. "The 400 Blows" is full of these, conveying everything from the joy of skipping school and going to the movies, to the panic and exhilaration of a spinning carnival ride, to the poignancy of riding through late-night Paris in a police van. The famous, marvelously ambiguous ending tops them all. This innovative style was groundbreaking in its time and started what became known as the "French New Wave." But "The 400 Blows" is not just a bag of cinematic tricks or an arty, inaccessible critics' darling. Instead, it's a wonderful movie about childhood, highly recommended for its lyricism, its emotional range, and its sympathetic but not sentimental look at a misunderstood boy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the crown jewels of the nouvelle vague</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Francois Truffaut and this film unabashedly. I've never once disliked anything that man has had a hand in creating. I even enjoy L'Infant Sauvage. With his debut film, Truffaut created one of the greatest paeans to childhood and Paris committed to celluloid. The camera and director are absolutely punch-drunk in love with everything they lay their eyes on. It's an incredible experience. Truffaut would go on to make more competent films (this is very much the work of a young man) but none would ever match the energy and unbridled joy here. There would be moments when he came close, but nothing would top this film. There's so much to shout about--Antoine Doinel smoking, the schoolboys sneaking off as they are led through the streets of Paris, Antoine stealing milk, Antoine talking to the psychologist, and, of course, the closing shot as Antoine faces the sea. It's a superbly brilliant closing moment and the perfect finale for this film. I really cannot say a single negative thing about 400 Blows. It's magnificent. I also cannot say a single negative thing about its director. Truffaut is my personal favorite of all the directors that developed out of Cahiers du Cinema. By far. He has a humanity that Godard lacks, and he's simply a more interesting filmmaker than Rohmer or Bresson or Melville. He's wonderful and so is this movie--a Romantic ode to childhood that steers clear of the sentimentality that often bogs down American films dealing with a similar subject. It's simply brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little humorous touches shine with nostalgic brilliance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's those little extra touches that make Truffaut's work rather special and so appealing. The film depicts memories of school life in the early part of last century. A frustrated schoolmaster bellows at an unruly classroom as he seeks to maintain discipline and the schoolboys mimic him behind his back. Antoine (Jeanne-Pierre Leaud)seems to be the unfortunate one who always gets caught and is punished accordingly. I was surprised to find that the schoolmaster did not resort to physical violence. Caning was rife in my day.Home life for Antoine gave little relief from his problems at school and his mother was more interested in her secret love affair than help for her son. Antoine's chores at home included setting the table for the evening meal and putting out the garbage can before bedtime. It is said that Truffaut based his story on his own early life.In one funny little episode a teacher guides a group of up to 20 students (all trailing behind him)through the winding streets. Every little while two or three students drop off from the end of the line and dart up a side street. It is rather comical to see the students disappearing while the teacher is quite oblivious to his shrinking numbers and continues to walk ahead with just two students at his side.Students are always short of money (particularly if they want to enjoy themselves in the amusement arcades) so Antoine and his friend steal money from the public toilets. They also resort to an occasional cigarette which makes them feel really grown up! It's little details like this that will revive memories for all of us.As for the ending....some may think it is rather abrupt. I like to think that it is a moment in Antoine's life where he has come to another "crossroad" and where a decision has to be made. How Antoine resolves it is left entirely to my imagination. Trust Truffaut to provide an enigmatic ending!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of a new age in world cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beauty of Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows is not found in terms of its technical merit (even though, in technical terms, it is still a brilliant piece), but in the heart and soul of the film, the shear love with which it was made. Truffaut said time and time again that the cinema saved his life, and you get the impression that the only way he felt he could repay his sanctuary was by committing himself to it. He did so in many ways! Not only did the auteur commit his time to movies, by being a lover of film and a critic, he soon became a director, producing this inspired masterpiece. Perhaps, that is what makes it a masterpiece. The film truly is inspired; inspired by Truffaut's life, his passion for cinema, and his theories about how films should be created. The result is amazing! Antoine Doinel, played by Jean-Pierre Leaud, is a misunderstood young boy, trying to keep his head above water, despite being caught up in what seems to be a predestined downward spiral. His teacher and his parents do not trust him, and he knows this. Seeing no trust to betray, he does whatever he can to try to compensate for how miserable he is treated. His mother (Claire Maurier) is busy working and trying to be a housewife, despite an affair she is having with another man. His father (Albert Remy) seems nice enough, but loses his temper when he is disappointed in the young man. Because of an already-existent lack of trust the parents have for their son, everything he does is perceived as wrong. No one ever takes the time (not his parents, certainly not his despicable teacher) to actually look at the boy, to determine whether there is any malice in his actions, or if he is simply a misguided little boy, searching for something he cannot describe or define. This is Truffaut's gift - He allows us to look through the screen, to see this young man, to study him, maybe for only one hundred minutes, but we are given the time to see the truth in this child that few probably ever saw in the young, tormented Truffaut.

		<shortDescription>Triumph and tragedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the first time I saw the 400 blows in 1960. I got then a very strong impression. Then, there was interval of more than 40 years, during which I never watched it, though not forgot. Recently I bought DVD and saw it again. I got the same huge impression. But now I have understood the cause of it. It is not only the greatness of Truffaut, excellent photography of Anri Decaee, charming musical score of Jean Constantine, performance of wonderful children Jean-Pierre Leaud and Patrick Auffray. All these were not enough. But, in addition to these qualities of the movie, I had a strong feeling of identification with Antoine, and that identification had come because many facts and events of my childhood were coinciding with what had happened with him. Even surroundings of my childhood was almost the same - not in Paris, but in one of the greatest capital cities. I think many people on whom the film made so strong impression had that sense of identification.The tragedy of J.P. Leaud is that he came to perfection TOO EARLY, at his teens. But one who had come to perfection stops his development. In other movies of the A.D. circle (Stolen Kisses and so on), he is, IMHO, incomparably weaker than in the first film. So, the endearing boy - Antoine Doinel of the 400 blows - became for J.P. Leaud a kind of a monster, with whom he had to contend all his life, and whom he could never overtake, not mention to leave behind. Genius in his childhood, he lowered to just a good (sometimes not so good) actor in his adulthood. A learned artistic craft of his later films could never substitute the freshness and vitality of the 400 blows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best among All-Time Coming-of-Age Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truffaut's debut feature, which presents an adolescent's despairing search of his place in the cruel world, is arguably his best work, as well as one of the best among all-time coming-of-age films.The film contains one of the best ending scenes in the cinema. Within reflective, meditative, and a little sentimental long takes, Jean-Pierre Leaud keeps running, running, running, he turns around on the beach, the motion stops precisely at a very vulnerable moment, and the picture zooms-in to Leaud's face.Made in the midst of the French New Wave, the film's cinematic technique is comparatively conservative. While location shooting vividly captures lively Paris, camera work and editing are quite orthodox.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adolescence capture perfectly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can one not love this movie? There is simply no way to describe the special moments in this movie which capture what it is to be a child bordering on becoming a man. This is France's Catcher in the Rye, but put on the screen rather than in text. There are numerous images from the film which I ultimately return to. There is the physical education class run through the streets with the teacher losing students, the carnival wheel and finally the best ending scene to any movie ever put on film. Now that's just the film itself. Words cannot describe how good the young lead in the movie is. He simply puts other child actors to shame, and he wasn't even an actor. I've watched this movie over 10 times, and each time I am glad I took the time to do it. This falls into the same category as I put other movies such as The Seven Samurai, The Sacrifice and Citizen Kane. This is movie making genius, and most importantly, it's the pitfalls and triumphs of humanity as seen through an adolescent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>C'est magnifique!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film journalist and critic Francois Truffaut became disenchanted with the films of the late 1950s. He held great admiration for Sir Alfred Hitchcock (whom at this time was shooting 'The Birds,') and Akira Kurosawa (working on 'Saga of the Vagabonds.') Both of these directors displayed technical innovation, enthusiasm and interest-captivating techniques in the production of their films. Truffaut believed in the ideals of the theatre scholar Bertolt Brecht who claimed that stages (and ultimately films) are not exclusively for the entertainment value. Audiences wanted to feel involved and learn from the experience - films had to be rational (at least to a degree) and hold some validity in the real world (this is not fully applicable to the recently created 'Children's films.') I agree that a boring film is not a 'bad film' for it can be educational purposes or to display interesting cinematic or technical achievements. Brecht would argue that "when an audience enters an auditorium, they do not merely discard their brain in the Foyer." With this I certainly agree - films with little or no explanation, evoke limited thought and interest from the audience - whilst a film or stage performance which is over-explanatory renders the imagination obsolete.The key is sustaining equilibrium - something that Truffaut manages beautifully. The cinematography and scenery were magnificent, the acting was apt for this warm film and yet the story is deliberately vague in various parts and punctuated with humour, which I for one certainly did not expect in a 1959 family film. There is no surprise that this writer became a director and an actor in a hope to alter the face of cinema for decades to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You don't need a big budget to make a great film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched 400 Blows and for the first time with the commentary running with English subtitles. It was very effective. This movie is definitely different. It is the first of what is to be called the `New Wave', where there are no sets. The picture is shot in real life situations. It was very effective. The photography, and directing in this film was outstanding. I think this film is called low budget but it is not low quality.Les quatre cents coup roughly translates to `paint the town red'. It is a story of a young lad who gets in trouble in school and, instead of getting out of it; he manages to fall into a spiral of more and more trouble.I was also in school during the period of this film and really relate to it, even if I wasn't in Paris. The pen and ink, we used fountain pens, dressing up, coat and ties in school. I felt Antoine's pain because I had been there. Truffant did a magnificent job of putting the feeling into this movie. I liked the change of pace at the end even though I was thinking ? slow down, I don't want this to end.If you like realism in movies this one is a must see. I really enjoyed it.</fullReview>

It's a pity that many Americans have an aversion to foreign films. It's a pity that more people have not seen this masterpiece. The depth of emotion conveyed in the final moments of this film must be seen to be believed. I only wish that more filmmakers managed to convey the intensity of that one moment as the boy stands on the beach and sees the ocean for the first time. The contrast between that one moment and all of his previous existence, sad and oppressive as it is, completely overwhelms me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so Truffaut started here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francois Truffaut made his mark on the cinematic world with "Les quart cents coups" (called "The 400 Blows" in English). Semi-autobiographical, the movie tells the story of Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Leaud), a misunderstood schoolboy. Everyone hears rumors about him and assumes things about him. Finally, at the end of the movie, Doinel escapes from a seaside cottage and runs out to the shore, and an ambiguous future.The movie was very well done in every aspect. The black and white helps to emphasize Doinel's somewhat dreary existence. I recommend this movie to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very relaxed and natural look at growing up in the life of Antonie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antonie Doinel is a typical young boy living in Paris. His mother and father are rather distant and pay him little attention when he is around the house. Fed up with school he decides to just skive off and spend the day hanging around, playing with his friends in the local theme park. It is while he is doing this that he spies his mother kissing someone other than his father. This marks the start of a chain of events that see him getting into more trouble both at home and at school.Although I have written a rough plot summary, I must note that I think this film is more about Antonie than it is any more traditional narrative. The film follows Antonie through the troubles he has in his young life, always painting him as a realistic character ? never too simplistic so as to be totally likable (what child is!?) but not a brat like some kids are in American movies. This is crucial to the film because it is so observational that it could almost be a documentary due to its style. This is down to the natural direction from Truffaut, a skill that is only helped by his excellent use of the locations, in particular the streets of Paris. Although his story is extreme in its fate, it is still engaging and touching to see Antonie's story and be involved in his young struggles ? whether it be school, distant parents or a lack of direction in life. The complex feelings around this time are well delivered, right down to the ambiguous ending where we are not told how Antonie actually feels.The playing from Leaud is excellent and I only wish that more child actors would be like him; natural, confident, vulnerable and convincing in front of the camera. He is well supported by people like Remy, Maurier, Decomble and Flamant but the film is his and I was very impressed by his performance. Of course, aside from him the other star is Truffaut himself and (as well as a cameo) his direction is great, natural, intimate and painting a convincing world for this story to occur within.Overall this is a small little film that succeeds in making the life of Antonie be very interesting and engaging. The plot may require the story to go beyond the day-to-day experiences of most of us did at that age but it is still emotionally involving thanks to a great combination of a superb and natural performance from Leaud, the direction of Truffaut and the great use of locations throughout.</fullReview>

The low angles looking up in the downtown city in France shows the audience that it is the views of the world scene through the eyes of a child. Powerful, strong, and correct, the opening sets the stage for the story. Like the start if the film, the end is just as powerful. The freeze frame of Antoine looking into the camera makes the audience uncomfortable. It is over, but is it the end. Is Antoine happy? Is he sad? He is tired from running, he has come a long way in both the run and from the start of the film, no emotion except for being tired, he could not fit in any of the societies offered to him. He is left alone on the edge of the world with a choice he has to answer for himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truffaut's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think "The 400 Blows" (****) is the best thing Truffaut ever did. It makes up for a lot of the ones that have an overinflated reputation. It's about an unwanted, hard-luck 12-year old boy's helpless slide into juvenile delinquency, but the director is remarkably evenhanded about distributing the blame. His mother and stepfather are portrayed as preoccupied and uncaring, and the schoolteachers are hostile, impatient and inept, but the kid himself is no angelic Oliver Twist. A lazy student, he plagiarizes his homework when he isn't cutting classes altogether, nearly burns down the family's apartment due to his thoughtlessness, and steals a typewriter out of his stepfather's office during one of his prolonged absences away from home. Amazingly, Truffaut manages to blend a great deal of charm and humor into this sad situation, and the city of Paris becomes practically another character. I saw this in a fine widescreen remastering on video, with the subtitles occupying the black border underneath the visual area. What a great concept!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1950's Parisian teen suffers in uncaring environment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francois Truffaut's 1959 debut film may well be his Masterpiece. With "The 400 Blows" he delivers a disturbing story about a misunderstood and uncared-for 14-year old, immersed in a cold-shoulder world of erratic pleasures and pains. The main character, Antoine, seems to be singled out for every kind of exaggerated discipline. A disagreeable school teacher indulges in sending pupils to the corner, or slapping them for silly transgressions. At home Antoine never knows what to expect. Will he be treated to the movies today, or yelled at and told he will end up in a Military Academy for being "difficult".Truffaut's unflinching realism points at the fact that we live in an adult-run world, where children have to follow all rules and orders, even if such directions may change without notice or cause. Antoine is in a "catch 22", where no matter what he may do will result in some kind of punishment. Minor offenses, which many will not consider very serious at all, are blown out of proportion.Without giving away any more of the story, it is obvious that here is a kid who has been dealt a pretty rotten hand. Even if Antoine's story is on the extreme end of a scale, there are surely millions of people who can relate to a life like his. Adults can be very unfair, especially when using children for their convenience, to cover their own wrong actions, or simply to seek a scape goat or whipping-boy to relieve their frustrations. The film is testimony to the fact that some people should not be parents at all.A big winner at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, "The 400 Blows" is a landmark piece of International Cinema, and by many critics' accounts ranks among the finest films ever made. An added treat is the extensive black and white camera-panning of the back-streets of Paris. See the city the way the milk-man sees it at day break, and you can appreciate how the working class lives. You can then understand how much more difficult life is for the children of those who work hard for a simple living. This is a must-see Classic, highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.With this film began an experiment that was to ultimately fail after dozens of notable films. It was much like the experiment in art nouveau in architecture seventy years earlier. I suppose that every art has cycles which begin with a collapse of the passion in artifice and a resulting call to the spontaneously natural.In this case, we have a camera acting as a selfaware human voyeur. There is no story: we simply enter and leave one life at arbitrary points. There is no drama, instead the `natural' drama of life. There are in fact none of the theatrics traditionally used to exaggerate so that things convey as real. The philosophy here is that REAL is real.Seeing this film again after my first viewing 35 years ago shocks me at the naivete of both Truffaut and myself then. I still celebrate nature, but I no longer believe it can be found in a zoo, where someone like Truffault can walk me through, pointing out what he thinks is interesting.Film, I believe, is something new still. Something that is beginning to change the way we conceptualize the most basic elements of life. Our bodies have stopped evolving, and that evolution has shifted to the level of tropes -- some in visual grammar -- that act selfishly to embed and promote themselves. Part of their defense is to periodically prompt us to believe that film is a mere window to reality. But that notion always collapses.This film is important because one can trace that collapse of induced naivete from its beginning here to an end. A complete cycle, whose final end I might place in Malick's ` Thin Red Line.' (`Moulin Rouge' likely begins a cycle on the other side.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly unremarkable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hailed as a masterpiece by critics this film is an average coming of age drama, and a reasonable foray into foreign cinema for those not used to subtitled films. It is charming enough, although seems for the most part to have all the emotional impact of a haddock. The central character, Doinel, is played well, and is likeable, but hardly a master criminal, and certainly doesn't descend into the life of violence the tag-lines would have you believe. Good acting, stylish direction and likeable characters aren't enough to classify this as a masterpiece though. As coming of age dramas go, this is hardly groundbreaking. I didn't dislike the film, it simply failed to grab me. I sympathised with Doinel, and found him to be an enjoyable character, although his story seemed to fumble along with very little meaning or direction. If you are looking for groundbreaking, Los Olvidados is more "punchy", and states its case far better. Not being from France in the late 50's it is difficult to say exactly how realistic this is, though I am guessing it is pretty accurate for the time. It's certainly worth checking out, but ultimately it is overhyped, and falls short of the expectation one is given. All in all, an enjoyable, if unremarkable story, that is charming enough in it's own way, with an above average cast, though it is ultimately, somewhat forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not something I'd recommend for entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film about five times over the last twenty-five years. As narrative, this film is quite boring. I can never become involved with or care much for its characters. It is a depressing picture of a twelve-year-old boy who is trapped by parents and teachers, by public school, and by reform school. An American film about this subject in 1959--the year of this film--would either have tried to squeeze a tear from the audience's eye or would have tried to arouse the audience to action, and would have been presented to the audience as a sensational expose of juvenile delinquency. This film just presents its story in a straightforward, objective, slice-of-life manner. I think that's why it's so depressing.Since I know Truffaut is a fan of Hitchcock, I thought some of the narrative line might have grown out of an episode Hitchcock often related--how his father had him locked up in jail overnight as a youth to teach him a lesson.I feel this film is worth more as an historical item than as entertainment. For this reason, it should be taught in film courses and will have a certain impact on young, first-time viewers. Historically, it's important (1) as a film that helped form the French New Wave; (2) because Truffaut went on to become an important film director and this film is autobiographical; (3) as the first of the Antoine Doinel series, Doinel being a cinematic semi-autobiographical figure for Truffaut. Actually, I have been bored to varying degrees by all the Doinel films and find Jean-Pierre Leaud, who plays Doniel in "The 400 Blows" as well as the other films in the series, to be a nincompoop.The technique in this film is very like the Italian neo-realist films, especially a film like "Open City." It's shot in low-contrast black and white, it's shot in actual locations around Paris; it presents a slice of life.Despite all I've written above, I've seen many Truffaut films that I've liked very much (Shoot the Piano Player, Jules and Jim, The Soft Skin, The Bride Wore Black, Mississippi Mermaid (complete version), The Woman Next Door, among others) but not the Antoine Doniel films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Francois Truffaut's "The 400 Blows" (1959) is one of the most intensely touching stories ever made about a young adolescent. Inspired by Truffaut's own early life, it shows a resourceful boy growing up in Paris and apparently dashing headlong into a life of crime. Adults see him as a troublemaker. We are allowed to share some of his private moments, as when he lights a candle before a little shrine to Balzac in his bedroom. The film's famous final shot, a zoom in to a freeze frame, shows him looking directly into the camera. He has just run away from a house of detention, and is on the beach, caught between land and water, between past and future. It is the first time he has seen the sea."The 400 Blows," with all its simplicity and feeling, is in a class by itself. It was Truffaut's first feature, and one of the founding films of the French New Wave. We sense that it was drawn directly out of Truffaut's heart. Little is done in the film for pure effect. Everything adds to the impact of the final shot. We meet Antoine when he is in his early teens, and living with his mother and stepfather in a crowded walk-up where they always seem to be squeezing out of each other's way. At school, Antoine has been typecast by his teacher (Guy Decombie) as a troublemaker. As the movie rolls on more and more, it leads to more trouble and eventually to a downward spiral: He and a friend steal a typewriter, he gets caught trying to return it and is sent to the juvenile detention home.There is a lot of movie-going in "The 400 Blows," with Antoine's solemn face turned up to the screen. We know that young Truffaut himself escaped to the movies whenever he could, and there is a shot here that he quotes later in his career. As Antoine and a friend emerge from a cinema, Antoine steals one of the lobby photos of a star</fullReview>

It is the story of Antoine trying to find his way with his family, friends, and society as he is quite the misfit. I enjoyed the way this film changed vantage points from different camera angle: an example of this is someone running left to right, then on another frame right to left. It gives it more of a moving feel as if you are moving along with the story itself. All around good acting from the whole cast, as it must have been difficult going through almost seemingly bipolar emotions throughout the period of the movie. Several close up shots help express these emotions thoroughly. I would highly recommend this feature film as I believe it is one of the best feature films I've seen yet!</fullReview>

It is perhaps among the best films of the 1950's, even though, from my personal opinion, the top films of the 1960's and 1970's were better on average and this film pales in comparison to true masterpieces such as 8 1/2, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and 2001: A Space Odyssey or even more "contemporary" (1950's) masterpieces such as Seven Samurai. Still, it is a solid film, but nothing that one should think as a masterpiece.Highly recommended for those that like a well executed solid drama film about the coming of age. Though this film relies a bit too heavily on melodrama and on exaggerated situations: the main character goes through something that could hardly happen in real life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Story about a sweet gentle 15 year old French kid named Antoine (Jean-Pierre Leaud).

It's not very shocking or surprising now but it must have hit hard in 1959. Even though I saw everything coming I kept watching. The black and white cinematography is stunning, Francois Truffaut direction assured and Leaud (who was actually only 15 at the time) gives a great performance. Despite the story the film never becomes maudlin, preachy or sad. It's made pretty clear that Antoine will survive despite the way the adults treat him. Also it perfectly captures the innocence of youth and the way they act. Supposedly this was the start of New Wave cinema. Well-done and worth catching. It DOES bog down a little during the last 30 minutes but everything before it is great. I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twenty-five years have passed since I last saw this film. I remember my fascination with this snotty boy who skipped school, showed disdain for authority, and made a general nuisance of himself. Those questions are still there but the answers are a little easier. Truffaut didn't go for the over-dramatic. He showed the day to day activities of a person who felt disconnected from a goal or place in life. He has disdain for his parents though they aren't all that horrible. His mother is sleeping around and he knows it. His father is an ineffectual boob who is terribly in love with the woman who really doesn't have any respect for him. They treat the boy OK. When they are angry with him they are probably justified. He is getting a good education and he is "betraying" them. There are great scenes on the streets. The weird attempt to steal and then return a typewriter is priceless and sets the young man in another direction. Also, the reform school scenes are quite striking. The sad thing about this is that the boy is running but where is he running? That's the question we must keep in mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unadorned, Pure and Personal Debut Feature for Francois Truffaut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This unadorned, pure and personal debut feature is one of the most profoundly relatable tales ever made about a young adolescent, because we can all identify with it to some extent. It shows the defenselessness of being a kid. Nothing you do necessarily sobers an adult. Influenced by Truffaut's own early life, it shows an able boy growing up in Paris and seemingly diving foolhardy into a life of crime. Adults see him as an agent provocateur. We are afforded some of his personal time alone, as when he lights a candle before a small tribute mausoleum to Balzac in his bedroom. The film's famous final shot, a zoom in to a freeze frame, shows him looking straight into the camera. He has a comparable countenance at other times in the film, which is shot in black and white in Paris in a frigid season. He always has the collar of his jacket unfolded against the wind. Antoine and his delinquent friend have so much character in their young faces, and that is perhaps the most immediate force behind the final shot.I like how, when he's among his friends, Antoine betrays the feelings of inadequacy with which his everyday life endows him. He is played by Jean-Pierre Leaud, who has a kind of downbeat disengagement, as if his heart had undergone complicated pain long before the film began. The 400 Blows, with all its clarity and sensitivity, is in a class by itself despite being among the establishing films of the French New Wave. We realize that it materialized straightaway out of Truffaut's heart.Little is done in the film just for impact. It's guileless, and when it isn't it's still seamless. Everything complements the effect of the final shot. We meet Antoine when he is in his early teens, and living with the conditional love of his mother and stepfather in a cramped space where they constantly seem to be wringing out of each other's way. The mother is a blonde who likes tight sweaters and is troubled by financial need, by her exasperating son, and by goings-on with a man from work. The stepfather is a pleasant enough guy, complacent, and handles the boy in a fond manner even if he is not very close to him. Both parents are away from home a lot, and neither has the composure to pay enough attention to the boy. They assess him by appearances, and by the accounts of others who do the same.At school, Antoine has been categorized by his teacher as a nuisance. His fate is not lucky. When a pinup calendar is being snuck from desk to desk, his is the desk behind the teacher finds it. Sent to stand in the corner, he makes faces for his classmates and writes on the wall. The teacher orders him to take back the incendiary defense he has written, as further strong- arming. Here is one that's the story of my life: He feels too preoccupied to finish his homework and instead of returning to school without it, he plays hooky. His story is that he was sick. After he skips again, he says his mother has died. When she shows at his school, apparently revived and deeply angry, he is pegged as a liar.Truffaut's film is not a lament or as hard-hitting as a social melodrama. There are a few instants where you find yourself laughing in quite the same way you would during a Billy Wilder movie. One moment in particular, which you might go as far as to call a sight gag, shot from above the street, shows a physical education teacher leading the boys on a routine run around a few blocks in town. Two by two they scramble into truancy, until the teacher is the leader of a rank and file of only two or three boys. There is a wonderful mostly wordless runaway bout with Antoine and his delinquent friend, who's afforded such freewheeling freedom that he has a daily life that thrives on impulsive chaos and spontaneous theft, which of course infatuates our angry young hero. The most relief in the film comes after one of Antoine's dumber screw-ups. He lights a candle to Balzac, which sets the shrine on fire. His parents put out the flames, but then, because one supposes they happen to be in a decent mood, their frustration turns into a dismissive bygone, and the whole family goes to the movies and laughs the way home.There is an ample amount of movie-going in this movie itself, with Antoine's intense face hypnotized by the screen. We know that young Truffaut himself fled to the movies whenever he could. The cinema saved Francois Truffaut's life, he apparently pointed out frequently. It took a student flirting with crime and gave him something to love. If the New Wave is the turnstile between classic and modern cinema, and quite a lot believe it is, then Truffaut is the participant whose films perpetuated the most earnest and personal passion for film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Wave film offers warning to parents and caregivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Has there ever been a better first film? Film enthusiast, critic for the influential French periodical Caheirs du Cinema ("Notebooks on Cinema"), and author of the auteur theory, Truffaut had already left a permanent impact on the cinema before he ever stepped behind the camera. As a critic, Truffaut passionately railed against what he considered the staid state of French cinema. Rather than critique from a safe distance, Truffaut entered the fray and changed cinema through iconoclastic example. He would become one of the leaders of the French New Wave" ("Nouvelle Vauge") which rejected traditional cinematic technique and subject matter.After seeing Orson Welles' "Touch of Evil," Truffaut was inspired to channel his love of film into a directing career. His first film is a cinematic treasure and is an indisputable part of the canon. Want to begin your own cinema appreciation journey? Start here.Like many a first time novelist, Truffaut looked to his own past to create an autobiographical tale. The film's subject Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Leaud) would reappear in four Truffaut films each time played by the same actor. Antoine's story is very similar to the director's own life. A fatherless child, Truffaut was passed around from family member to family member then eventually reclaimed by his birth mother and stepfather. His guardians would tire of him, irritated by his delinquency, and hand him over to state custody and incarceration until he reached adulthood. Doinel, like Truffaut, would also spend a brief and and troubled stint in the French army."The 400 Blows" opens with an uninterrupted tracking shot that travels down a Paris street and escorts us into Antoine's world. It's an elliptical moment that will later be repeated in reverse when Antoine is taken away from home to become a ward of the state. It also prepares us for the film's continual restless movement. Doinel is always on the run away from home and school and onto the streets of Paris. This tracking shot is accompanied by a jaunty theme that increasingly becomes more sad and wistful. In these simple opening moments we are given clues to the arc of the entire film.Like the film's musical theme, the first moments of "The 400 Blows" are playful. They resemble an "Our Gang" comedy as a classroom of pre-teens engage in mischief and are confounded by ruthless teachers and malfunctioning ink pens. Antoine, in a classroom full of goofballs, is repeatedly singled out by his teacher for correction and punishment. This continues at home where his mother and father are constant critics of Antoine and rarely offer positive reinforcement. Doinel, unhappy at home and at school, chooses truancy and constantly attempts to run away from his troubles. Antoine's early experiences, forced marching by gym teachers, running from authority figures, being confined by exasperated by adults, are later repeated in the more sinister setting of juvenile detention. In the film's haunting final moments, we glimpse toddler wards of the state placed in outdoor cages during recess at the juvenile detention facility. This, disturbingly, mirrors an earlier scene of adult prostitutes staring out from a holding cell as they await sentencing. "The child is the father of the man." Antoine's mishaps are amusing at first, but as he is buffeted by adults at every turn, we begin to feel sympathy for the boy followed by pity and finally hopelessness. Doinel is an unwanted child. No wonder he runs. He is always a problem, never a blessing. There is, however, a brief respite for Antoine when he goes to the cinema with his parents. For Antoine, as for Truffaut, the movies offer a magical escape and a momentary chance for happiness."The 400 Blows" is a warning for parents and caregivers. It shows how neglect and constant negative reinforcement necessarily leads to a troubled adulthood. We are impacted by the tale, but not lectured. The film's final moments are haunting and leave Antoine stranded and alone. As he once again runs away from confinement, Truffaut keeps Doinel trapped in the frame. Antoine is moving but he is always in the center of the screen. He is running away, but still confined. And as the film reaches its conclusion, the film freezes on Antoine's face, trapped with nowhere to go. It's a disturbing moment and creates a feeling of hopelessness in the viewer.If you haven't seen "The 400 Blows" do so as soon as possible. A masterpiece deserving of the superlative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Birth of French New Wave Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A 13-year-old Parisian boy, Antoine Doinel, neglected by his derelict parents, spends his days skipping school and sneaking into lots of movies. His life is on somewhat of a downward spiral as teen angst catches up with him and he begins to be seen as only a trouble maker by the adults in his life. Antoine runs away from home, is a failed thief and suffers through believing he is in the right as he continues to do wrong. Living in between arcades, abandoned factories and Paris flats he sees the city as opportunity and hope, but his vision is still only that of a child.The films most analyzed shots involve Antoine after he has run away from the detention home and ends up on the beach. Truffaut ends the film on a freeze frame with Antoine looking into the camera. He has finally made it to the sea for the first time in his young life and he is seemingly caught between past and future.This will not be the only time Leaud will play Antoine as he and Truffaut will have a long collaboration. Leaud will play the on screen youthful biographical Truffaut through four more films. The most notable is Stolen Kisses. However, none of the films come close to this first feature of Truffaut. This film was his release and breakthrough of the French New Wave.The film is simple movie making, while at the same time showing layers of feeling and longing for something more. Jean-Pierre Leaud is stunning in his role and his innocence breathes right on the screen. The film, at times, almost takes on a feeling of documentary because of the vividly personal scenes. The story is told with deliberate measure.At the beginning Antoine is living with his mother and stepfather in a elbow-room-only flat. They are literally stepping over one another. The mother (Claire Maurier) is attractive beyond her means while the stepfather (Albert Remy) is doing is best in a bad situation. Both struggle in their own way to keep everything together but nothing keeps Antoine's trouble from their doorstep and their over the top reactions.Once Antoine has hit the streets adult hope is lost and he is at the mercy of social services. While on the streets Antoine hovers around trouble and close to disaster. He goes to the movies a lot which is clearly a force that he uses to stave off the tragedies that come his way. There are times when he is genuinely happy but the cold chill is always there threatening to break through his jacket with turned up collar - his shield against the bad over his shoulder. This film is François Truffaut's savior from himself. His ability to bring his wild child story to the screen with such feeling and honesty has made him a directing legend and started the New Wave from classic to modern French cinema. Like Antoine, Truffaut was saved by movies and once this first and legendary film was made by the time he was 27 years old, he would never have to look back on that bad kid except through a lens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1959 a pair French films were released that became the twin pillars of the New Wave (Nouvelle Vague), and were instantly hailed as classics. One, Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless (A Bout de Soufflé), was a bad film, and the other, François Truffaut's The 400 Blows (Les Quatre Cents Coups), was a good film. Neither, however, can really be called great cinema, despite their reputations. That said, Truffaut's film is far better than Godard's because it mostly avoids overt clichés, even as its screenplay- its weakest element, written by Truffaut and Marcel Moussey, often bogs down in anomy. Like Godard, Truffaut shot his film in black and white, and indulged the real world, as well as doing long takes, to try to feign naturalism, even though these were often outcomes of necessity not choice, borne out of lack of financing rather than artistic vision.While both films achieved a feel closer to cinema verité with these technical contrivances, neither could really be thought of as narratively innovative, for Breathless is a string of unsubverted clichés while The 400 Blows is a rather familiar tale of misspent youth. It is, in a sense, an updated and less colorful, if not watered down, Charles Dickens tale transplanted across the English Channel. Also, the film's hero- the lower class fourteen year old Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud), who sleeps in tattered pajamas- claimed to be Truffaut in this autobiographic film, is quite a bit less colorful than Dickens' young protagonist con men. Even though he is constantly in trouble, and called a thief, arsonist, liar, and plagiarist, these are clearly things almost all young boys do in their formative years, with few ever becoming major criminals. The 400 Blows is merely a good film with some great moments- like Antoine in the Gravitron or when his gym class starts thinning out as they jog with their teacher. Yet, its flaws highlight why most schools, movements, or -isms fail. They do so because they naturally must break free from the artificial constraints such ideas and ideals impose. Delimited art is generally bad art. And this film's formlessness, plus some corny moments as a single tear in Doinel's eye as he is taken away in a prison truck, doom the film from reaching a greatness it may have attained with a better screenplay and more experienced eye behind the camera and in the editing room. But, it is a worthwhile film, nonetheless, which held out the potential for later and greater works. That's more than many first films, New Wave or not, have ever done, and something Antoine Doinel may embody, if never achieve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Authentic coming-of-age story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film distinguishes itself in many ways: it is wonderfully filmed in black and white; it rings true (being semi-autobiographical); it has an inspiring performance by a young actor; it is not overly sentimental; it is not played for comic effect.Jean-Pierre Léaud plays Antione Doinel, a young Parisian adolescent who lives with his stepfather and mother in a *small* apartment. Antione's stepfather is a decent sort but seems more interested in auto rallies than in Antione and his mother is preoccupied with the family's state of near poverty as well as with an extramarital affair. As Antione drifts toward juvenile delinquency the movie achieves it poignancy from our being able to see so clearly how this tough, independent, spirited kid comes to his undeserved fate. Between the neglectful parents, the despotism of his school masters, and the unsparing harshness of the justice system, Antione is bucking some heavy odds. He gets by with very little - the thing that finally lands him in a correctional institution is his being caught *returning* a typewriter he has stolen from his father's office.Many often criticize a movie with the comment that, "I didn't like any people in this movie." It will be the unusual person who can say this about "The 400 Blows." You are immediately drawn to Antione and identify with him throughout.As captivating as the filming is (it's actually shot in widescreen, unusual for a 50s movie), it is Léaud who really carries this. He is so believable that you can't help but be awed by his performance. His interview with the psychologist is outstanding for its realism.The musical score is near perfect. I can only describe it as producing a feeling of hopeful melancholy.The final several minutes are enough to send chills up the spine and anyone who appreciates this film will never forget the final freeze-frame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>400 blows is a film that offers multiple interpretations to cinema lovers.For many it will remain a motion picture that pioneered the concept of French new wave (Nouvelle Vague Française).For others it will remain a film that got François Truffaut worldwide attention and universal fame.This film is entirely based on young Antoine Doinel's exploits.The key element of 400 blows is the depiction of his misery caused due to gross neglect by his parents.His character is so strongly portrayed that other protagonists of the film pale in comparison.It is precisely this strong characterization that helps in settling scores with French school system which was critical of young students' ability.It is true that Truffaut borrows heavily from his personal life nevertheless the interest in the film does not suffer due to his skillful direction and an interesting screenplay which shows city of Paris in a positive light.400 blows is a cinematographic masterpiece that will always remain a reference point from which the successes and failures of delinquent children will be measured.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously this kid was born into a situation that didn't fit his needs as a young adolescent boy, and I don't even think that he was a bad kid. But he didn't have a role model to show him how to be good, at no point in the movie do we see his mother or father doing anything positive. So it wasn't like he was always doing wrong, it was more like he didn't know how to do right. For example when he stole the typewriter if was for survival, and when he realized he couldn't do anything with it he didn't just leave it in the street, he tried to do good and got severely punished for it. It was a lesson for him, don't do good. For some reason I would back that kid every day of the week, and if he were a real kid I would want to be his big brother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless "coming of age" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truffaut's Quatre cents coups is an excellent film from the French New Wave era. This film is about a boy name Antoine(somewhat of a Truffaut alter-ego), who is seen as a trouble maker at school and at home. Although his "hell-raising" is no more extreme than an average 14 year old boy, he seems to have bad luck and always gets caught. Even when he tries to be good, he somehow gets in trouble. On one occasion, Antoine becomes very inspired by famed Balzac and turns an essay in that is so reflective of his hero that it is deemed plagiarism. By the end of the film, Antoine's parents lose hope in him and send him to a reform school. Finally, Antoine becomes very depressed and escapes.Stylistically, this film is amusing because it was shot in widescreen, which gives a very different feel. Another style this film popularized is the famous freeze frame shot of Antoine's face, which closes the film. Watch this film and you will not be sorry!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truffaut's Halloween?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>François Truffaut got his nomination for Best Director some years after this film for Day for Night. This film got him a screenplay nomination, in which, unbelievably, he was beaten by the Rock Hudson/Doris day film Pillow Talk. Well, we all know the Academy can crash sometimes.By asking if this is Truffaut's Halloween, I am not suggesting a horror film, although some would consider the pervasive juvenile delinquency in our society to be a horror.I would not tend to describe Antoine, the 12-year-old main character of the film as a juvenile delinquent. He is more just stretching and spreading as he finds his limits and comes of age. He does this in an atmosphere of constant bickering by his parents, and finding out that his mother really didn't want him, and that she is having an affair. All this could, in different circumstance, create a Michael Myers character.Truffaut presents a film that, while devoid of startling action, keeps us transfixed as we observe the mundane life of Antoine. That, my friends, is great writing and great direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not to be overanalyzed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Les 400 coups did not strike me as a work of staggering genius. Perhaps it is the naturalistic approach of the film, the type of approach that does not beg to be called "genius" but "realistic", that inspires many to call it a masterpiece. The problem with calling it that is it makes you want to analyze and take apart the film, but it does not reward those who do, if what they're looking for are complex themes or keys to deeper meanings. By creating the world of young Antoine, the hero of Truffaut's film, in a very lifelike way, the film bypasses dense symbolism and other such artistic ploys for a truly realistic feel. Example: Antoine's family. In a film wanting to make clearer statements about humanity, there would be more consistency shown in the characterization of the mom and dad. As is, they can be rough, they can be loving, they can be dysfunctional, they can make a loving family - they are complex like normal people, forcing us to sometimes reconsider how we feel about them.This film interested me in the way it showed us the troubles a young boy can go through, but is that what it is about? Antoine's problems can be traced not only to the school system and his parents but also himself. I don't think this is a bad thing, it just means the movie is not about how a criminal develops, it's about life and people and how they can develop in general. It's a semi-autobiographical slice-of-life film skillfully created and filled with very interesting moments (the classroom, life as a runaway from home). It has nice cinematography, good acting, a good score, and it is certainly a worthy debut for its director. However, it is does not blow you away, so do not come with preconceived notions of what it must be like considering its fame. Let its interesting moments impress you and enjoy it for what it is.One final note: the very interesting ending provides a great topic for discussion after the film is over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was not only the best Truffaut film, but also one of the best crime films ever, and images haunt me, petrify me, and in a strange way as I grow older comfort me. Even though I was never as much of a juvenile delinquent as Antoine (at least to his extent), I connected to this character very strongly the first time I saw the film- the intelligence but disillusionment, the cutting from school, the love of cinema, a disconnect from the parents at that most unGodly of ages- 13. I love this movie so, even as I've only seen it once all the way through. One scene I have rewatched many times, for some reason or another, is one of my favorites from Truffaut where the teacher leads the kids out of the school in the line, and one by three they all leave the line escaping to other places.Look for Francois as a man in the funfair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Portrait of a restless young man yearning for freedom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the fist chapter of the saga of Antoine Doinel, performed in a masterly manner during a long period of his life (twenty years) by the surprising Jean-Pierre Léaud, followed step by step by the pygmalion Truffaut during the whole course of his full physical maturity, beginning from the actor's early years.The present movie deals with the topic of unquiet and misunderstood adolescence, clearly inspired by Edmund' character, the young boy who lives in the destructed Germany doing all kinds of work in Rossellini's "Germania anno zero". Antoine and Edmund are two young human beings at the mercy of the waves, without any help or control, living on the fringe of society, unable to cope with the hypocrisy of grown-up people that guess they are no good for anything. But differently from Rossellini's character, Antoine is endowed with more resolution than him. Furthermore, the will to succeed will help him a great deal in his life, especially to come unsmirched from the manifold difficulties of existence, because he's a stubborn boy who prefers the real thing to the phony stuff and doesn't want to give grown-up people the satisfaction of knowing that their choices have worked on him.With the same incomparable style you expect by an author that has made him beloved by many cinephiles far and wide, Truffaut describes the portrait of a restless young man yearning for freedom, in open rebellion with his familiar environment and with the whole adult world. Scenes from an unhappy existence, outlined in the script with sometimes disenchanted frankness, clearly following the inspiration of autobiographically conceived ideas, while the repeated use of long focal length lens during movie shooting conveys an anonymous sense of uneasiness.The rebellious character Antoine Doinel, unamenable to discipline, is included in a metropolitan context described in a very impersonal way, plunged in melancholy and echoing a meaningless platitude, according to a disenchanting, strictly objective conception of the reality. Truffaut doesn't "ask" us to identify with his subject, no wonder his psychological motivations point out to us in a disturbing way the complete downfall of individual certainties as far as the difficult route to adulthood is concerned. The purpose of this generational conflict created by him is to prove that boys aren't guiltier than adults; both of them in his opinion are victims of a society whose uneasy feelings spread over their lives with undesired consequences.</fullReview>

A poetic but also very sad tale of a young boy and his troubled life. It is a classic movie! However, I don't think it is Truffaut's best film as I am aware of many do believe. Truffaut (1932-1984) was perhaps THE director in the entire history of motion pictures that was able of, truly and profoundly, conveying love as an idea or an emotion on the silver screen. I know that he was not the only one who achieved making great love stories, but perhaps only he knew how to do it the best way. And that brings me to my reason for not regarding this as his best film: I think it lacks that kind of true emotion and sentiment that shines so bright in his later films. But hey: it's his first movie! You can't expect the innovation to explode right of the bat.</fullReview>

Our anti-hero is unrepentant, unintelligent, and most perilously -- boring! There could have been a good film here, if the director had decided to include a plot and not just follow a kid around the streets of Paris in 1959 with a camera.Yeah yeah, it's French New Wave, it's Truffaunt, let's fawn over it! Or, not. Good for students of film and the pretentious, but folks looking for an interesting story or characters they care about should look elsewhere.The cinematography had some high points, and it was fun to see Paris on the cusp of the 60s. Other than that: skip it.If you absolutely must see a great story about kids in trouble with the law, watch City of God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 400 Blows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was naturally one I knew nothing about from its recommendation in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and I was hoping of course knowing that and seeing critics give it five out of five stars that it would live it to this good reputation, from director François Truffaut (Jules et Jim). Basically twelve year old Antoine Doinel (BAFTA nominated Jean-Pierre Léaud) is the boy growing up in Paris during the early 1950's, misunderstood by his parents at home and at school tormented by his insensitive French teacher (Guy Decomble), and to get away from both these problems he frequently runs away. He finally decides to quit school after his teacher accuses him of plagiarism, and to finance his plans to leave home and get away from everything he steals the typewriter from his father Julien (Albert Rémy), but when he finds out he has his son arrested. Antoine spends the night in the police cell locked up with prostitutes, thieves and hardened criminals, and being interviewed by a judge his mother Gilberte Doinel (Claire Maurier) confesses that Julien is not the boy's biological father. This causes the young man to be placed with other troubled children in an observation centre near the shore, this is his mother's wish, and his unhappiness is brought out during his probing by a psychiatrist, and we see these troubles told in fragmented monologues. Antoine is then one day playing football with the boys in the centre, and under the fence he manages to escape and reach the ocean, which he had always wanted to visit through his life, and the film freezes and zooms on the face of the boy as he looks directly into the camera. Also starring Patrick Auffay as René Bigey and Georges Flamant as Mr. Bigey. Young Léaud gives a very good performance as the boy who runs away from the things he hates and causes trouble for others, it is an interesting choice for the debut film for director Truffaut as it is very close to autobiographical, I admit that I couldn't fully agree with the five out of five star rating from the critics as at times it could be complicated and I couldn't follow it, but as a film I can see it is a most worthwhile drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Good, in my opinion!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>un film merveilleux de François Truffaut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) in his school, in his home, in the streets of Paris. This is the story of a boy entering in a new world, for him, leaving his family behind. Every time Antoine is at a different place we see more of his personality and every time he is at a different place he is doing something that of course will bring consequences. In the school he does a bad thing to later be at home thinking in the things he needs to do in order to repair the things in his school to later be near the school thinking in how he could forget to do those things. The film begins with the typical problematic kid at school and soon we find that Antoine has his own preferences at home. Is clear that he has a better relation with his father (Albert Rémy) but everything will change soon. The main problem is that everything is like a secret between family members. There is not that thing called trust, not from Antoine to his parents and neither from the parents to Antoine. On the other hand we have his best friend René (Patrick Auffay), together with him Antoine will began to have his life in the streets of Paris. For a day they leaved the school tools in order to have a fun day by going to the movies and some other places. During that "fun day" we will watch not the beginning of all the problems but sure the beginning of a new stage for the Doinel family. Sure Antoine was doing a bad thing so as his mother (Claire Maurier), both discovered the other, nobody said a word. Now everything changes and now at Antoine's home you even feel sorry for Antoine's father. That day the mother of Antoine died but just for Antoine. But also the mother is quite worried and now suddenly she is very kind with Antoine. Their case can be resume in once act: the mother needs to make an offer to Antoine, you know if he makes a good work at school she will give him money. Obviously that's a problem, a clear example of the problems of Antoine at school but also is a clear example of how the mother wants to resolve the things. Of course everything is a secret between Antoine and his mother so if the kid does a bad thing that will annoy his father the kid will have the protection of his mother since she knows everything is for the school. Eventually Antoine will make a work that is not what the teacher asked and also that will have some strong consequences so now the escape is the only thing in Antoine's mind and what's he eventually will do. In short, Antoine's mother became "good" with him so her secret can stay like that but the deep problems never changed. One of the many reasons I loved this film is that it is unpredictable. One day you see Antoine working for his school project and the other you see him living in a friend's house. By the end you know that maybe the entire story is somehow predictable since you see how was the relation between Antoine and his mother even before he was born so you see that this problem was somehow old and maybe some good things cover it a little but after all we always watched a broken family and in the end we just watch a kid running and running?This is just my first François Truffaut film and I'm just realizing about the fact that there are more films about the character Antoine. Now I really want to check those films. On this one Jean-Pierre Léaud did his screen debut at the age of 14. He did such a terrific and realistic work with a character that is just great and unique since in the film we watch him as the troubled kid, the film lover, the unwanted son, the loved son, the tramp, the friend, the prisoner, the runner. Jean-Pierre Léaud steals the film of course however everyone else did also a magnificent and realistic acting work. Many claims that Antoine is not a likable character but I'm not one of them, I mean I loved the character and probably my favourite parts of the film are when he is in the streets of Paris but that doesn't mean that there are some "weak" parts in it. I loved every shot of the film, in short.Finally, this film is very important so sooner or later, as the film lover I suppose you are, you will want to watch it. But in this case we have not only an important piece of cinema but also a marvelous piece of cinema. It is a unique film, a masterpiece, etc. Since I don't speak French sorry if my title is bad written, I wanted to write: A marvelous film of François Truffaut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Non-English Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This marvelous film from one of my favorite foreign directors, Francois Truffaut, remains one of the best foreign-language films ever made.To many, the word "foreign" as it applies to movies means difficult, but "The 400 Blows" is actually a very simple tale simply told about a young man who turns to a life of petty crime for a lack of anything better to do with his life. It's a picaresque tale that is refreshingly free of a moral. We don't necessarily watch the film to see that the young boy eventually sees the error of his ways; we watch simply to see what will happen to him, because we care about him. Truffaut gets his audience to feel for the boy exactly what the society in which he lives doesn't -- compassion -- and which, more than anything, would likely be most effective in convincing him to give up his delinquent ways.And there's that wonderful closing shot, the freeze on the boy's face, careless and free, qualities that the audience recognize as luxuries only the young can afford.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard so much about this movie, and when I finally do see it, it's about some delinquent whose parents are on the outs with one another? This is a classic?Speaking as a man who grew up with parents who were always in love with one another, up until they both passed away, all I can say is this film, and specifically Truffaut, had and have issues.You don't smack your kids like that, and you certainly don't teach them to lie with acts of infidelity. If this makes for a classic film, then count me as one of the philistines who don't get "great cinema". Heck, why not just watch an episode of COPs? You'd probably see more action and interesting situations there.Look, the film is finely shot and scripted, but I didn't get why this kid went behind his parents' back to do all the things in this film. This movie glamorizes juvenile delinquency. Where's the art in that?Oh well. Just call me the boorish American out to show how snobbish French films are, because, well, they are.Enough said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very good but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie twice. The first time, I thought it was an okay picture. However, because it is such an important French New Wave film and had a big impact on future projects and because so much positive stuff has been written about it, I thought I'd give it another try. Well, it did improve some with the second watching--particularly since I have also seen the rest of the "Antoine Doinel" films. But, was it "great",...not really, though it still was a very very good film. There is very little negative about it other than the occasionally poor sound track. As many New Wave films are supposed to have a "home-made" quality about them, much of the time this wasn't a problem. But, there were times when the amateurish quality of the music was distracting. Also, a smaller complaint was the abrupt ending, though this is only a small complaint since the director returned to his alter-ego in follow-up films. When all seen together, now THAT is a fascinating thing-and something I recommend you try to do if you see "The 400 Blows".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe good if you study film, otherwise very boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie bewilders me. It may be that I'm just a stupid American, but I really just don't get 400 Blows. Everything I've read about this movie has been a total rave, but I just couldn't stay interested. I'm sure that it was as revolutionary in film-making as all the critics say, but when it boils right down to it, it's just really really boring. Maybe it's the language barrier, may I'm just not "sensitive" or "artsy" enough, but whatever the case is, I hated this movie. The story itself isn't bad; it's about a young French boy who is treated unfairly by his parents and his teachers, and eventually he ends up in a juvenile facility. That in itself ought to be interesting, and it was, at first. There was nothing wrong with the dialogue, but then again it's hard to say because half of the conversations weren't subtitled and for no apparent reason, so I didn't always know what was going on. But for the dialogue we could understand, it made enough sense. The actors were believable enough, but it's hard to say what a real person would do in these situations. So you feel for the main character, but only in the sense that when he gets into trouble you think, well that sucks. The plot isn't even your typical plot. Each time he gets in trouble, he gets into more trouble than the last time, but the reasons never vary too much. And through the entire film you realize that there's nothing the main character can really do about it. So it's more like just waiting to see how it ends. The ending, by the way, was completely over my head. It's way too artsy for me, and I just didn't get it. Leading up to the end was easy enough to follow. The structure was certainly there, and it made sense as well, but everything was really drawn out. For the amount of dialogue and significant moments, the movie could have been an hour shorter. It just didn't end. Part of it was the unnecessarily long shots, none of which were especially memorable; for example, the ending was a clip of the main character running down a country road that lasted a good thirty seconds. Now, I'm sure that had some deeper meaning in it somewhere, but for the average viewer, I'd rather have gotten up to get some more food during that time. Or at least done something a little more useful than sit and watch this boy running, like doing my laundry, or taking a nap. Final Verdict The feeling throughout the whole movie was that this probably would be very moving and just amazing and that it would teach me some great life lesson, if I could only get what the director was trying to say by his? unique decisions. As it was, I just felt cheated out of a good two hours of my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nouvelle MERDE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My title ought to be enough.It baffles me that a culture so rich in literary excellence (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant) would churn out such tosh as the "nouvelle vague" cinematic movement. Until the 20th century, France had a great tradition of artistic lucidity and clever philosophy. But the minute you hand them a movie camera they start acting like WOOOHOOO LOOK HOW WEIRD I CAN BE! PLOT? THEME? PSHAW! LET'S FILM AN AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE GOING ROUND &amp; ROUND! At least this is not as bad as Godard (who has an unhealthy fascination with the backs of peoples' heads. Oh-la-la, quel artiste.). No, Truffaut maintains a degree of visual clarity. But so does the security camera at a quickie-mart. The two are indistinguishable.Haha, just as an aside to all you dweeby film school nerds: I bet the vein is popping out the side of your neck right now. But don't leave without reading the last sentence of my review.Anyway, if you like French literature, you will HATE this. People who like this movie probably have never read any books other than the ramblings of Jack Kerouac or maybe "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". Or maybe they have read the lyrics to The Doors songs, and they think that's profoundly moving. Whatever floats yer boat. I find it ironic that this film injects some (weak) allusions to Balzac, one of the finest and most meaningful writers who ever lived. Nice try, Truffles. But you're nowhere near the ballpark.Avoid this film like an aids-infected syringe.If you're the type of person who likes to think, then stick to Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and the Japanese masters Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara (SUNA NO ONNA).If you're an idiot, enjoy your Truffaut, Godard, and Andy Worhol. And for pete's sake push that vein back in your neck. You look like a cabbage.</fullReview>
