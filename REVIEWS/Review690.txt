		<shortDescription>One Of The All-Time Best Noirs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of film noir, owning many of them, and this one is right about at the top of the list and climbing each time I view it. It might even have passed Double Indemnity for the number one spot. It's that good.For anyone who has not seen it: the poster art and the video/DVD cover are both misleading. They usually feature Marilyn Monroe in publicizing this movie, but she only has a small role. Many times they feature Monroe, Jean Hagen and Sterling Hayden all together....and those three are never on screen at the same time. My point being: what you see on the outside is not what's on the inside.Hayden is the star of the film but Sam Jaffe and Louis Calhern are not far behind. In fact, the more I watch this film, the more I see the latter two as the real stars here, and I especially have begun to appreciate the great acting by Calhern in here.Actually, everyone performs at a very high level. The diverse and interesting characters are really fun to watch, one of the big reasons I rate this film so high. Hayden, with his big body and tough demeanor, was perfect for film noir. He is a legitimate tough guy, nobody to fool with. Jaffe was fascinating as the little German "doctor" but until I got the DVD and put on the English subtitles, I never understood all his dialog, which is terrific, and "Doc" is my favorite character in this film. Kudos also go to James Whitmore and Marc Lawrence for great supporting role performances.The two women, Hagen and Monroe, also do their bits nicely. I never understood people who criticized Monroe's acting. I thought she was pretty good right from the start, with this film as an example. I also liked seeing her thin and in shape. This movie is a gritty, tough, no-nonsense crime story concerning a jewel robbery where things go wrong and eventually does everybody in. Actually, it isn't just a botched robbery that ruins some of them - it's character weakness, from greed to sexual lust."You reap what you sow" could be a moral of this story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Asphalt Jungle" is one of the greatest crime films. The movie has its roots in several great film noir projects, such as "Double Indemnity", "The Killers", "Criss Cross", and "Out of the Past". Its lasting impression over time is based upon its quality and its unprecedentedly brilliant use of the "caper" as a plot device. As stated in other comments, this film noir's influence can be seen in hundreds of disparate "caper" movies - "Rififi", "A Simple Plan", "The Guns of Navarone", "The Usual Suspects", and "How to Steal a Million", just to name a few. I will not give away the results of the "caper", but the film is truly superior in how it explores relationships and deception. This is one of John Huston's greatest works, and the script lays down the tension from the first moment and doesn't let up. Huston uses multiple closeups to literally drain the emotion out of the characters. Hayden, Calhern, Lawrence, Hagen, and Whitmore turn in superb performances with many memorable moments, but Sam Jaffe steals the film in an Oscar-worthy performance as the brain behind the caper. Marilyn Monroe makes an indelible impression in a fairly brief but pivotal role.Please do not miss this - an easy 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of a kind !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess the great John Huston knew what he was doing when making this film. Get the right cast and so he did.! The timeless touches in this film make it so watchable so often that we forget that a studio like MGM rarley made a gutty film like this. Every character in the " Asphalt Jungle" has his/her moments! When Angela Phinley says to Emerich( Calhern) what will happen and Emerich responds the appropriate " you'll have lots of vacation".Marc Lawrence as cobby has never been better since his part as Ziggy in "Key Largo" Jean Hagen shows some real ability and we wonder why she was used in future films to a lessor effect.Hayden, as Dix Hanley has a warped credo for a man on the edge.Sam Jaffe steals the show as doc..smart enough in most items save for your girls dancing in bars.Even the supporting cast shines under Huston, Mcintre and the police chief , Brad Dexter as the crooked investigator, Barry Kelly as the corrupt cop with James Whitmore playing a man whose body is warped but whose soul is still intact.Thanks goodness there is no music( film score) during the jewel heist. This fact alone lets us know this is a real film..unlike the ones being released today.Mikos Rosza's score is emotional for sure..and the final in a Kentucky field is very poetic a la Huston Perfection...C Pope</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant crime thriller that had a profound influence on the caper genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a sucker for a good heist film, and three of the best I've ever seen were made around 1955/56 - 'Rififi', 'Bob le flambeur' and 'The Killing'. Now they are still three of the greatest crime thrillers ever made, but now that I've finally seen 'The Asphalt Jungle' it's obvious what source those movies were drawing on! Not that I'm saying they're rip offs, they're not, but they are kind of three (excellent) variations on Huston's theme. 'The Asphalt Jungle' must therefore be seen as the most influential crime movie of the modern era, and the blueprint for every subsequent caper movie ('The Anderson Tapes', 'Thief', 'Reservoir Dogs', 'The Usual Suspects', 'The Score',etc.etc.) This superb film noir is almost impossible to fault. The script is first rate, John Huston's direction is inspired, Sterling Hayden - possibly America's most underrated actor - is fantastic as troubled ex-con Dix Handley, and the ensemble cast are all excellent, especially James Whitmore ('Them!'), Louis Calhern ('Notorious'), Sam Jaffe ('The Day The Earth Stood Still') and John McIntire ('Psycho'). The early role for Marilyn Monroe made a strong impact on a lot of people, but I was even more impressed by Jean Hagen as Doll. She is unforgettable and her scenes with Hayden are wonderful. Why did she never become a major star? This is a crime classic and brilliant entertainment. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Sublime Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming at the end of the decade in 1950 - which effectively ended Hollywood's much cherished Golden Age - was MGM's THE ASPHALT JUNGLE. A superbly structured gritty crime drama it was one of the last of the great Noir thrillers. Produced for the studio by Arthur Hornblow Jr. from a novel by W.R. Burnett it was beautifully written for the screen by Ben Maddow and John Huston and outstandingly directed by Huston. The assembled cast couldn't be better even down to the smallest parts such as Ray Teal turning up as a patrolling policeman. The picture is notable also for an early appearance of Marilyn Monroe as the kittenish ingenue of shady lawyer Louis Calhern. Stylishly photographed in stunning black &amp; white by Harold Rosson THE ASPHALT JUNGLE has joined the ranks, alongside "The Killers" (1946) and "Out Of The Past" (1947), as the finest Noir ever made.An old time criminal Doc Redinschneider (Sam Jaffe) has just been released from prison and has devised a plan for the "perfect" caper ("I could sell it on the open market for $100,000"). He approaches a small time racing "fixer" Cobby (a brilliant Marc Lawrence) who in turn arranges with dishonest lawyer Alonzo Emmerich (Calhern) to finance the heist of a million dollar diamond haul from a major jewellery firm. Emmerich is also to act as a "fence" to offload the gems. Hired is expert safe-cracker Louis Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso), the humpback Gus (James Whitmore) as the driver and a small time hoodlum Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden) as the group's strong arm. The robbery itself is a success (a riveting intense sequence) but things start to go terribly wrong. First Ciavelli is accidentally shot and then Emmerich, along with an accomplice (an impressive Brad Dexter) attempt a double cross which is thwarted by Dix after a shootout. With the loot now just so much junk Reidinschneider and Dix must go on the run. The movie culminates with Emmerich committing suicide, Redinschneider, Cobby and Gus being arrested and ends with the fatally wounded Dix making a dash out of the city to reach his family farm in the country.Performances are terrific! Hayden was never better and only came close to matching this portrayal six years later in Kubrick's brilliant "The Killing" (1956). Outstanding also is Sam Jaffe as the master criminal, Louis Calhern as the crooked lawyer, Marc Lawrence as the "fixer" ("I always sweat when I count money - it's the way I am") and John McIntire as the determined Police Commissioner. All things considered THE ASPHALT JUNGLE is probably the most perfectly cast film ever. The only minor disappointment is the sparse music score by the great Miklos Rozsa. There is a splendid dramatic main title and continues after the credits for a short while but then no more music is heard until the final six or seven minutes of the picture when there is a hectic rhythmic orchestral statement to accompany the mortally wounded Dix and his frantic drive to his family's farm. Then as he reaches home, collapses and lays dying in a pasture the music segues into a reflective melodic theme for the end title. The lack of a full score however is but a minor quibble and does little to alter the fact that THE ASPHALT JUNGLE remains an exercise in meticulous motion picture making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darkly absorbing Jungle Caper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't seen The Asphalt Jungle for nearly 30 years until tonight, I think I must have (wrongly) considered it to be a "modern film", ie post rock'n'roll and dismissed it as too earthy as a result. Well I was wrong, it's certainly a Golden Age film made with high production values, with all the right actors, direction, music and story the Golden Age had produced. The music especially links it back to Double Indemnity and of course Huston to The Maltese Falcon, Jaffe to Lost Horizon etc. It was simply a signpost to the type of films to come , the ones I avoid.It's gritty, as realistic as a gritty fantasy could be in 1950, as realistic as I want. The multi character interplay sticks in the mind, everyone's grafting and ready to dump on the next guy, apart from The Hooligan who dumb as he is really has a heart. It's Sam Jaffe's film though, his calculating but flawed dirty old man character was a classic perv-ormance, nowadays we would not have been spared the sleaze, but he walked a fine line successfully.And again, the sleazy relationship between Uncle Louis Calhern and young Marilyn Monroe was perfectly handled.All in all a marvellous film from the twilight years of the Golden Age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Noir in Full Force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ASPHALT JUNGLE epitomizes Film Noir. It's dark, grim and it's not afraid to show us seedy, down-and-out characters who are nevertheless complex and deeply human. This film has men and women who inhabit the underworld, that 'city under the city'. Most of their needs are spelled out, and the backgrounds are painted in memorable detail. We see little men like Cobby (the late Marc Lawrence in a sweaty, realistic performance) and Gus (James Whitmore); a woman with nothing but a romantic illusion to cling to (the great Jean Hagen as Doll); men whose lives have been crippled by crime and who persevere only through their own folly-laden dreams: Doc (who sets it all in motion, expertly played by Sam Jaffe) and Dix (Sterling Hayden). There is also family-man safe-cracker Louis Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso), whose motivations are understandable to us all and whose desperation is painful to watch at times. While Dix is often seen as the central protagonist in JUNGLE, he really shares that position with Alonzo Emmerich. Emmerich is a corrupt lawyer: a formerly wealthy, urbane man reduced to the same doomed schemes as his cohorts, men to whom he feels superior and whom he ultimately intends to double-cross. Emmerich is almost tragic in the Greek or Shakespearean mold: he has farther to fall than Dix and the rest, but he has already met the ground halfway as the film begins. He's broke, and no more debts can be called in to support the new scheme. Unlike the younger men, who could possibly take other paths, there is really nowhere for him to go but down. Emmerich's scenes--rendered immortal by Louis Calhern's performance, the greatest in the film--are the most interestingly complex. He pretends he is smarter than everyone else, but he knows that hubris has brought his life past the crisis point. He is painfully aware that neither the money from the stolen jewels, nor the foolish romantic escape with his mistress (Marilyn Monroe) will ever redeem him. The robbery sequence, around which the film ostensibly revolves, is very brief and anti-climactic. This is surely Huston's intention: it's all over in a few minutes and nobody actually gets what they want. The stolen jewels are brought to Emmerich and a violent scene leads to a foil of the rich man's double-crossing scheme. In the end, everyone can see that this particular gleaming treasure--like the gold dust in TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE or the 'black bird' in THE MALTESE FALCON--is ultimately worthless: the jewels are too hot and no one dares fence them. So Doc ends up with most of them in his black bag. He begins pursuit of his dream of a tropical isle, surrounded with dancing girls and ends up in a roadside bar where he feeds nickels into a jukebox as a pretty teenager bops around for him. The waiting cops close in quickly, and all is over for Doc. Emmerich, too, is soon caught. The alibi plan with the mistress doesn't hold water. And the police make a direct connection to him and his dead henchman Brannom (Brad Dexter). Making short work of it, he goes into his private office and shoots himself in the head.Other characters meet their ends behind bars (Cobby and Gus) or with ironic justice (corrupt detective Barry Kelley, who tries to play both sides), or in death (Ciavelli). At the close of the film, we are left with a mortally wounded Dix, driving toward his dreamed-of horse farm. At his side is the faithful Doll, who knows the jig is up. Dix has never given up his illusions, where the other characters probably never believed their own. He dies, with poetic rightness, in a field surrounded by curious horses, as poor Doll is left to her own devices. The film, which opened on a dim stretch of urban asphalt, closes on a sunny rural vision.What makes THE ASPHALT JUNGLE a great Film Noir? The wide array of doomed characters and a persistent feeling of encroaching doom go a long way to take it in that direction. In this way, the film exemplifies the strong fatalism that is essential to Noir. Along the way, we hear some of the most intelligent, yet convincing dialog in all of Noir (by Huston and Ben Maddow) characters who sound real, who say what someone might actually say or be thinking. This realism is enhanced by the look of the film, starkly, yet vividly shot in black-and-white by Harold Rosson. It's worth noting that Rosson uses some sophisticated camera techniques, such as deep focus and and the extreme foregrounding of a single character. If, while watching, the viewer imagines a B-movie version of this story, with conventional camera work and a lackluster cast and script, the greatness of THE ASPHALT JUNGLE becomes even more evident. The consummate technical work and artistry involved elevate the film far above any genre or pulp limitations. Underlining the bleakness of Huston's vision right from the opening credits is the music score by Miklos Rozsa (who also scored CRISS CROSS) in a departure from from his scores for DOUBLE INDEMNITY and SPELLBOUND, Rozsa places his cues sparingly. The score only calls attention to itself under the main titles and during Dix's wild death ride. As for the robbery scene, Rozsa provides no music for it, and dialog is minimal. While it's far briefer, we can see this scene as the true precursor of the robbery scene in Jules Dassin's RIFIFI (1955), famed for its nearly complete silence. But John Huston himself may deserve the lion's share of credit for this film. Taking the advice of an older director he had known (possibly Josef Von Sternberg?), he directs each scene as if it were the most important one in the film. This gives every scene its own sense of urgency and keeps a consistent tone, making the film one long, tragic descent into doom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Huston defines the caper.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston, one of the great film makers of all times, was at the top of his craft when he undertook the direction of "The Asphalt Jungle". The book by W.R. Barnett was brilliantly adapted by Mr. Huston and Ben Maddox and the result stunned everyone. In fact, the film has been so influential one sees parts of it in other movies of the genre. The magnificent cinematography created by Harold Rosson speaks by itself. The music score by Miklos Rozsa stays in the background and never interferes with the action.This is a film that looks as good today, as when it first was released. In fact, one discovers more nuances as one watches it again, when it's shown on cable. The cast of the film is one of its best assets going for "The Asphalt Jungle". Mr. Huston assembled some of the best talent working in the American cinema of that time.Sterling Hayden, as Dix, gives a tremendous performance. The excellent Louis Calhern, though, steals the picture with his take on Lon Emmerich, the man who finds he is broke and wants to be at the center of the caper, without risking anything. Marilyn Monroe has only two scenes in the movie, but she shines in them. Also Jean Hagen, an actress that should have gone far, but didn't, makes a valuable contribution with her Doll Conovan.The supporting cast is amazing. James Whitmore, Sam Jaffe, Anthony Caruso, Brad Dexter, and the rest, play well together to give the film a seamless look."The Asphalt Jungle" shows why John Huston was one of the most influential men in pictures. His films are a must see for all movie lovers and studied by his successors and people working today owe a lot to this master, who pioneered a style that stands as his legacy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No stars and perfect casting make this a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose the only reason why this movie can be purchased on video (not on DVD though, it seems) is the fact that Marilyn Monroe plays a part in it. If I am right, this shows how much the movie industry has to rely on big names. Sometimes this is a real shame. No movie proves this better than Asphalt Jungle.This caper movie is one of my all time favorites and frankly the best of its genre. Its brilliance lies for me in the fact that no big name of the Hollywood acting community was involved ? Monroe was small fries then. Instead John Huston worked with a cast of reliable, mostly very experienced character actors many people will know as "supports" from numerous other movies of the period. And many of those actors probably gave here the best performances of their lives. Everybody is cast dead right, this is what is so magnificent about Asphalt Jungle. The balance is perfect, the chemistry works all ways. Maybe just one miscast actor or actress would have spoiled the whole atmosphere. No one is overacting at any time, and there are many, many very moving moments as one can observe these characters struggling on the sidelines of urban society.One is always tempted to name an actress or an actor whose performance one liked best in a movie. Here, I could not do it ? I liked them all. Yet I want to mention one actor: Louis Calhern. Seldom has a sudden change of mood and countenance in a character had such an impact on me as a viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great movie. For once I agree with the critics. But they may have missed the point. They saw in it "a superior thriller". I saw in it a touching homage to the humanity of the outlaw. For the first time criminals are presented as human beings, with their broken dreams, their yearnings for The Ultimate Experience that would make life meaningful. There is no justification of crime. It is rather a call for compassion and understanding for all the misunderstood and unpopular people of this world. The ending is heart-breaking. A fugitive whom society has branded a cold-blooded killer arrives at the ranch where he grew up, to die of his bullet wounds. There are no heroes and no villains in this movie. Compassion is the only character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the very best heist films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one of John Huston's best told stories as a director, Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden) gets involved with a group of jewel thieves in on a deal to score half a million dollars in the Midwest. But things get complicated, as they usually do, but in some unexpected ways. This is a crime story that has 'film-noir' written all over it, with stark, striking cinematography (some great close-ups of Hayden in a few key moments), slick, bare-bones direction from Huston, and the best cast of character actors one could hope to see- Hayden is terrific as Handley, a kind of archetype for the tough guy in many hard-boiled crime stories; Jaffee and Calhern are perfect as the Doc Riedenschneider, quirky but smart mastermind behind the caper, and the scheming rich man Emmerich fronting the money for the caper. Marilyn Monroe, in her first scenes in any movie, is a highlight as well as the sort of ditsy dame of the story. The climax is a knockout, and the robbery scenes themselves are quite tense, but the details leading up to the robbery and the aftermath are the best parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Human Hooligan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took over 40 years until Goodfellas was made to make a film interesting and realistic about criminals as The Asphalt Jungle. The power in the characters that John Huston brings to life is so vivid and you root for them, yet you never forget they are criminals.Sam Jaffe, a cool and calculating planner, brings a scheme to big time lawyer Louis Calhern about a jewel robbery. Calhern is a criminal attorney who really does work both sides of the fence. But he's also got some high living expenses and a young mistress in the shape of Marilyn Monroe in the first film that got her notice. Jaffe needs three to help pull off the job, a safe cracker, a driver, and a strong arm guy, a 'hooligan' as he calls it. Calhern provides them in the persons of Anthony Caruso, James Whitmore, and Sterling Hayden.You wouldn't think it, but Jaffe and Hayden bond in this. The educated criminal mastermind and a man who might not have finished grade school. Jaffe sees in Hayden a reliable sort.Sterling Hayden did not think too much of most of the action/adventure stuff he did, but he liked The Asphalt Jungle as well he should. He's a country kid, his nickname is 'Dix' short for Dixie. His family owned a farm and bad luck hit them as it did so many in The Great Depression. Hayden turns to criminal enterprise because his skills for making an honest living are limited. His biggest accomplishment is having a B girl from a clip joint fall hard for him in the person of Jean Hagen. Both of their characterizations ring well and true, dare I say it, sterling performances.Of course after the job is done, fallible and corrupt human beings like bookmaker Marc Lawrence, corrupt police lieutenant Barry Kelley, strong arm man Brad Dexter, and Calhern himself bring the whole thing crashing down. One of the reasons you root so hard for the criminals to succeed is the magnificent and unheralded performance of John McIntire as the police commissioner. Imagine if Charles Laughton as Inspector Javert, had not gotten so tangled up in searching for Jean Valjean and rose to become the head of the Surete in France. You've got McIntire. I don't think any honest cop has been made so unpleasant on the screen before or since. At one point he's telling the press that he'll get Hayden and Hayden is a callous brute. The most callous person in the cast is McIntire and we go through 112 minutes of The Asphalt Jungle and know how very human Sterling Hayden is.Sam Jaffe got an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, but lost to George Sanders in All About Eve. The film itself got three other nominations including for Huston as Best Director. It had the bad luck to run up against another classic film in All About Eve, in it's own way as cynical a film as The Asphalt Jungle.John Huston took a cast and got perfect performances out of the lot of them and The Asphalt Jungle holds up every bit over fifty years later. Should really be seen beside Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas to get a full appreciation for today's generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crime of Being too Human</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Asphalt Jungle (1950)One after another, the criminals in this metaphoric Asphalt Jungle meet their necessary demise. It isn't the jewel heist, functional and classic, that matters. It's the personalities that wind themselves up and then wind back down through the raspy knot where they intersect, and where they fall to unexpected side effects.What do we make of the clichés here? The mastermind of the heist is not such a bad guy, the getaway driver is a sweetie who loves cats, the safecracker has a wife and young baby, the "hooligan" is a misplaced sentimentalist who only wants the old farm his family lost to bigger forces. In fact, these "bad guys" are really just you and me, and bigger forces are always out there ready to squash us. So conniving a little jewel theft is not going to hurt a soul, and the presumed victory over inconsequence is huge.Or would have been. Maybe it's not coincidence that the biggest impediment of all comes mostly from a duplicitous lawyer, and here we have a character actor, Louis Calhern, sharpened and amplified by director John Huston, a master at making the ordinary just acceptably larger than life. So the man has a cash flow problem, and his suffering and his hapless conniving is alone enough to recommend the film. The small, sad part of his wife, played by the ruefully cheerful Dorothy Tree, only twists the knife, reminding him, and us, of what this man could have had, ordinary happiness. But no one in the movie wants to be ordinary, Calhern has a young Marilyn Monroe, no less, for his diversion. Then there are the core contract players in the gang, including a sweaty Marc Lawrence as the fumbling lynchpin connecting them all. As the requisite hooligan, Sterling Hayden is convincing enough, but maybe it is the pathetic desperation of his sometimes girlfriend, played by Jean Hagen, that rips your heart out. At least until Hayden falls in the grass and the horses come to graze by his head, as if we have entered a dream, a thousand miles from from any asphalt or jungle, far far from tension and sorrow of any kind.Considered a major film noir, it can also be seen as a major ensemble heist film. Though the gloom is noir enough, it lacks what I think of as the core quality of noir--alienation-- though there is, at least, Hayden's sad listlessness. But it's a great movie with a plot that is useful for bringing out the vivid characters. Everyone talks about how the cast is perfect, and the cast really is perfect. And the cast is perfectly directed, which is a whole other wonder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the intelligent criminal Erwin "Doc" Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe) is released from prison, he seeks a fifty thousand-dollar investment from the bookmaker Cobby (Marc Lawrence) to recruit a small gang of specialists for a million-dollar heist of jewels from a jewelry. Doc is introduced to the lawyer Alonzo D. Emmerich (Louis Calhern) that offers to finance the whole operation and buy the gems immediately after the burglary. Doc hires the safecracker Louis Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso), the driver Gus Minissi (James Whitmore)and the gunman Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden) to the heist. His plan works perfectly but bad luck and betrayals compromise the steps after the heist and the gangsters need to flee from the police."The Asphalt Jungle" is a fantastic film-noir by the legendary director John Huston and with magnificent performances. The brilliant story of bad luck and betrayal in a heist was nominated to four Oscars, three Golden Globes and nominated and winner of several other prizes. Marilyn Monroe is sexy and gorgeous in a minor but important role. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "O Segredo das Jóias" ("The Secret of the Jewels")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A major heist goes off as planned , an ex-convict (Sam Jaffe) gathering a gang (Sterling Hayden , Marc Lawrence , James Withmore , Anthony Caruso ..) to pull it off until bad luck and double crosses cause everything to unravel.This is a realistic study heist ; dealing with the plotting and the gathering of a misfit band that sours , building suspense , intrigue , emotion in Crescendo for any unexpected surprises that might pop up . Plenty of excellent characterization and tautly made , resulting one of the greatest crime movies of all time . The picture is well paced with an electric current that never let up . The movie has the thematic unity of 'Key Largo' , ' We were strangers' , ' Maltese Falcon' or ' The treasure of Sierra Madre' the John Huston's best . This thrilling story is stunningly scripted by Ben Maddow and the same John Huston from a W.R. Burnett novel ; letting the audience in early on what the outcome will be and increasing in power as they scheme the path closer to their destination . Both Director John Huston and ex-communist star Sterling Hayden were members of the Committee for the First Amendment, which stood against the blacklisting of alleged communists working in the film industry during the Red Scare . The main credit for this masterpiece must be shared among Sterling Hayden as a tough criminal , Louis Calhern as a mean lawyer and especially Sam Jaffe as an old ex-con . Furthermore , top-notch support cast , Jean Hagen as Doll Conovan , James Whitmore as Gus Minissi , John McIntire as Police Commissioner Hardy , Marc Lawrence as Cobby , Barry Kelley as Lt. Ditrich , Anthony Caruso as Ciavelli and debut of Strother Martin and Jack Warden. And of course a splendid bit by Marilyn Monroe as Angela , John Huston originally intended the role of Angela Phinlay for Lola Albright . The musical scoring by Miklós Rózsa is magnificent , being perfectly attuned but extremely scant, occurring only for the main titles, continuing through the opening sequence up to the point where Handley enters the café, and then returns some 107 minutes later when Handley and Doll return to his boyhood farm , total scoring just under 6 minutesRating : Above average , this is one of John Huston's best films , a model of his kind , definitely a must see if you are aficionado to Noir Film . Huston broke a new ground with this landmark movie , providing classic scenes and unforgettable dialogs . Also shown in horrible computer-colorized adaptation . Frequentely imitated and remade no less than five times in different styles such as Western in ¨Badlands¨¨ by Delmer Daves with Alan Ladd , Katy Jurado and Ernest Borgnine , set in Egypt titled ¨Cairo¨ by Wolf Rilla with George Sanders , Richard Johnson , Eric Pohlmann and Blaxploitation ¨Cool Breeze¨ by Barry Pollack with Thalmus Rasulala , Judy Pace , Lincoln Kilpatrick , Margaret Avery and Pam Grier .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet Another Huston Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Asphalt Jungle" is a classic "film noire" caper movie directed by the legendary John Houston. Except for the opening and closing scenes, the story takes place entirely at night.As in most films of this genre, there are no heroes or villains, only a collection of tragic losers who are trying to better themselves through one last big caper.Doc Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe) has just been released from prison. He has plans for a major jewel heist but needs financial backing and a crew to assist him. He goes to a small time bookie named Cobby (Marc Lawrence) who in turn puts him in touch with money man Emmerich (Louis Calhern). Doc assembles his crew, Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden) a small time thug, a driver Gus (James Whitmore) and explosives man Louis Ciavelli (Anthony Carouso). But it seems that Emmerlich is broke what with his high living and young mistress Angela (Marily Monroe). So Cobb is convinced to back the job.Along the way we meet Doll Conovan (Jean Hagen) who carries a torch for Dix who doesn't really care. There's the corrupt cop Lt. Ditrich (Barry Kelley) and an unscrupulous private eye Bob Brannon (Brad Dexter) trying to get in on the action. While the caper seems to be going along nicely, several chance events occur which change the whole outlook of the event.Even though filming at the prestigious M-G-M, Huston wisely cast his film with largely (at the time) relative unknowns. Hayden is excellent as the doomed anti-hero Dix and Hagen superb as the tragic Doll. But it is veteran Sam Jaffe as the cultured, German-accented and very cool Doc who steals the picture. Marilyn Monroe on the verge of stardom (Why didn't M-G-M sign her?), is very good as the "femme fatale" of the piece.Also in the excellent cast are John McIntyre as the Police Commissioner, Don Haggerty and James Seay as a couple of detectives and Ray Teal as the policeman who causes grief for two of the escaping thieves. Watch for Strother Martin and Frank Cady (of TV's "Petticoat Junction")in the line-up sequence at the beginning.Huston made only one more film for M-G-M, "The Red Badge of Courage" (1951) which he blamed the studio for butchering. Nevertheless, he left us with another classic in "The Asphalt Jungle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of MGM, The Asphalt Jungle is directed by John Huston and based on the novel of the same name by W.R. Burnett. It stars Sterling Hayden, Jean Hagen, Sam Jaffe, Louis Calhern, James Whitmore, Teresa Celli, and in a minor but important role, Marilyn Monroe. Miklós Rózsa scores the music and Harold Rosson photographs it in black &amp; white. Plot sees Erwin "Doc" Riedenschneider (Jaffe) leave prison and quickly assemble a gang to execute a long in gestation jewellery heist. However, with suspicion rife and fate waiting to take a hand, the carefully constructed caper starts to come apart at the seams.John Huston liked a tough movie, having given film noir in America a jump start with The Maltese Falcon in 1941, he also that same year adapted W.R. Burnett's novel High Sierra. Burnett also had on his CV crime classic stories Little Caesar &amp; Scarface, so it's no surprise that Huston was drawn to The Asphalt Jungle. As it turned out, it was a match made in gritty urban heaven.The Asphalt Jungle was one of the first crime films to break with convention and tell its story from the side of the criminals. Where once the pursuing law officers/private detectives were the heavy part of the plotting, now under Huston's crafty guidance we have a study in crime and a daring for us to empathise with a bunch of criminals/villains/anti-heroes. As a group the gang consists of very differing characters yet they have a common bond, they strive for a better life. Be it Hayden's luggish Dix who dreams of buying back his father's horse ranch back in Kentucky, or Jaffe's Doc who wants to retire to Mexico and surround himself with girls: it's greed and yearning that binds them together. With alienation and bleakness, in true film noir traditions, featuring heavily as the plot (and gang) unravels.With gritty dialogue and oozing a naturalistic feel, it's also no surprise that Huston's movie would go on to influence a ream of similar type films. Some good, some bad, but very few of them have been able to capture the suspense that is wrung out for the actual heist sequence here. Fabulous in its authenticity, and with that out of the way, it sets the decaying tone for the rest of the piece. Interesting to note that although we are now firmly in the lives of the "gang", including their respective women (Hagen, Monroe &amp; Celli all shining in what is a very macho movie), we still know that the society outside of their circle is hardly nice either. This is stripped down brutalistic film noir. Merciless to its characters and thriving on ill fate, with a finale that is as perfect as it gets in this most wonderful of film genres. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We all work for our vices"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once a key part of the mighty battle between Louis B. Mayer and head of production Dore Schary for creative control at MGM, John Huston's classic 1950 heist movie The Asphalt Jungle is good ? very good ? but at times it feels like it would have benefited from a lower budget and a tighter running time. Even though it was a comparatively low budget picture for the studio there's still a feeling that it's a film about people with no money made by people with rather a lot of it even if it was part of a conscious move by the studio to tackle grittier subject matter to compete with television. But then, with a track record that included Little Caesar, Scarface and High Sierra, the screen rights to W. R. Burnett's novel were never likely to go to one of the more cash-strapped studios that churned out film noir thrillers for their bread-and-butter.It's that old favorite, the perfect heist that goes wrong, not because of bad luck or any overlooked detail but because of the inherent character flaws of the men carrying it out: for Sam Jaffe's meticulous and brilliant planner Doc Riedenschneider, it's very young girls ("We all work for our vices"), for Louis Calhern's crooked lawyer it's his belief that he can talk his way in and out of anything, for Marc Lawrence's bookie it's his desire to be seen as the equal of more socially 'legitimate' criminals and for Sterling Hayden's not-too-bright hooligan it's his exaggerated sense of his own honor. Although executed with skill, most of the film's pleasures come from the performances, not least Jaffe's uncharacteristic Teutonic precision that earned him an Oscar nomination and Louis Calhern's free-spending but bankrupt criminal lawyer who simply regards crime as "a left-handed form of human endeavor" and who gets much of the best dialogue. But the supporting cast is memorable too, from Jean Hagen's hooker in love with Hayden, eager to please but living on her nerves in a performance completely devoid of vanity, Marc Lawrence's sweaty bookie and James Whitmore's cat-loving but tough-as-nails hunchback barkeep to Brad Dexter's unscrupulous private eye trying to cut himself into the deal, while Dorothy Tree's neglected wife puts a lifetime of desperation to recapture old times in her two scenes. Definitely worthwhile, though it doesn't leave as lasting an impression as many a cheaper film noir. Incidentally, someone really should tell whoever wrote the sleeve blurb for WHV's DVD release what 'gunsel' really means?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Rat-In-A-Maze Feeling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Characters are as harsh as their physical surroundings in this bleak story about a group of men who plan, then attempt to carry out, a jewel heist in Cincinnati, Ohio, in the late 1940s. It's a story of cheap booze, bookies, a corrupt police officer, and sleazy, desperate criminals.Dix (Sterling Hayden) is a smalltime gambler; he's tall, rarely smiles, and has a girlfriend named "Doll" (Jean Hagen). Cigar-smoking Doc (Sam Jaffe) is the group's brain; he's just out of prison, and has a weakness for pretty young girls. Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso) is a middle-aged man with a wife and sick baby. And Lon Emmerich (Louis Calhern) is the smooth-talking lawyer who functions as the group's respectable front man; he has a whiny wife and a voluptuous blonde girl-on-the-side named Angela (Marilyn Monroe). None of these characters or anyone else in the story is sympathetic. But they're all unique, with their own dreams, motivations, and flaws.Despite Doc's well-laid plans and the competence of the other players, unforeseen events, accidents, and bad luck make their robbery scheme fraught with peril. That "stuff" happens is not their fault. It's fate. And the story's outcome is a forceful reminder that much of what happens in life is random and to some extent meaningless. The film's message is thus highly existential.What makes the overall story interesting is that it is told from the POV of each of the criminal participants. We get to know these characters as individuals, and then watch them under pressure, as they react to unplanned events.Their individual predicaments make for good drama. And the film's noirish, high-contrast B&amp;W lighting ups the drama even more. Most of the plot takes place at night, or in dimly lit, rundown, seedy back-rooms. "The Asphalt Jungle" has an oppressive, claustrophobic, rat-in-a-maze feel to it.Casting and acting are fine. I especially liked the performance of Louis Calhern. Arguably, the best element of the film is the cinematography. Those stark visuals in some scenes are just terrific. My only complaints, both minor, are that the script has several characters too many, and the film lacks appropriate background music.Although visually bleak and dreary, "The Asphalt Jungle" is a high quality film with a thoughtful story about desperate people living on the underbelly of society. The script is good, and the direction from John Huston is excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Crime Film, Leaving Troubling Questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ASPHALT JUNGLE comes close to being the best film of the film noir style. A study of a complex, well planned jewelry robbery that is destroyed by double crosses it is a model for later films like THE KILLING, RIFIFI, TOPKAPI, and THE USUAL SUSPECTS. Sterling Hayden, Jean Hagen, Sam Jaffe (whose sole mistake is giving into a weakness to watch pretty young girls dance for too long), Louis Calhern (whose death scene is shattering), Marc Lawrence, and Marilyn Monroe all did first rate work under John Huston's direction. For these reasons alone I recommend the film.But I can't avoid commenting on one irony that Huston (and his screenplay writers, including W. R. Burnett) may have intentionally included. John McIntyre plays the local Police Commissioner Hardy, who comes across as a hard-nosed S.O.B., fully pushing law and order as the safety of the community. He has tightened down on the town, making the plans for the robbery more difficult. When a policeman is shot in the escape of the thieves McIntyre goes ballistic, guaranteeing that the criminals are really going to be captured.And (no real revelation here) they are. But what is ironic is the smug, self-congratulatory way McIntyre tells the media about the triumph of the police and law and order over the criminals - which he fully takes credit for. This triumph involved several crooked cops beating up on at least one suspect. And when I say crooked, the one in charge of the beating knew about the robbery. That officer (Lt. Det. Ditrich - Barry Kelly) is seen standing just in back of McIntyre during the news conference! McIntyre, for all of his self-congratulating and self-publicity, is still a puppet himself of the very corruption he claims he is conquering.To me that moment near the conclusion of the film is one of the most realistic bits in all film noir. How successful can we be in conquering crime? How can we be when depend upon it by not asking too many questions that should be asked?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Here's to the drink habit. It's the only one I got that don't get me into trouble."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was only a few weeks ago that I described 'Du rififi chez les hommes (1955)' as the film that pioneered the traditional crime caper, carving a narrative mould that would continue to be reused in films of its sort for decades to come. While Jules Dassin's picture is undoubtedly the finest in a sub-genre affectionately known as "the heist flick," I have now discovered that the concept stretches back at least another five years, to one of Hollywood's most revered adventure directors, John Huston. Revealing a seedy underbelly of society, overflowing with smarmy criminal figures and crooked authorities, the film is a potent film-noir thriller, employing dark, shadowy black-and-white cinematography, and a selection of suitably sordid characters, whose greed, obsession and violent temperaments ultimately lead to their own demise. The film's success would trigger a considerable boom in the popularity of heist thrillers, most notably in Crichton's 'The Lavender Hill Mob (1951),' Dassin's 'Rififi (1955),' Mackendrick's 'The Ladykillers (1955)' and Kubrick's breakthrough picture, 'The Killing (1956),' which also starred Sterling Hayden.Recently-released criminal mastermind, Doc Erwin Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe), has, for the last seven years of his incarceration, protected the plans for the most ambitious and profitable heist of his "distinguished" career. He arrives in a dreary, smoggy, crime-ridden city, where low-lifes patrol the darkened streets and law officers, some honest and some crooked, do their best to control the escalating crime-rates. The Doc hires a diverse assortment of essential criminals to ensure the success of his caper ? a "boxman," or a safecracker (Anthony Caruso) with a young family, a "top-notch" getaway driver (James Whitmore) with a twisted back, and a small-time "hooligan" (Sterling Hayden) with a costly passion for horses. Also involved in the elaborate scheme is Cobby (Marc Lawrence), a sleazy, treacherous bookie, and Alonzo D. Emmerich (Louis Calhern), a bankrupt professional businessman who agrees to finance the operation but houses plans for a disastrous double-crossing. The film's female protagonists come in the form of innocent Doll Conovan (Jean Hagen, prior to her career-defining performance in 'Singin' in the Rain (1952)') and an upcoming Marilyn Monroe as Emmerich's sexy, playful and naive young mistress.As was typical in film-noir films of the era, whose contents were dictated by the meddlesome Production/Hays Code, the ultimate moral of the story is that crime doesn't pay. Each of the thieves receive punishment for their involvement in the robbery, either through conviction or death, as does the fraudulent detective (Barry Kelley) whose corruption is described as a "one in a hundred" case. Nevertheless, Huston succeeds in creating a certain amount of empathy towards the criminals, sympathetically presenting the audience with each man's reasonable motivations towards breaking the law. By recruiting our support, Huston invariably places the audience in the shoes of the criminals, suggesting, as the perfect scheme begins to unravel, that our own fates lie in the balance. This evocation of realism is certainly complemented by Harold Rosson's gritty, documentary-like cinematography, and the heist sequence itself ? while falling well short of Jules Dassin's breathless 30-minute counterpart ? is tense, intriguing and authentic. As Huston himself explains in a pre-film introduction on the DVD release, each of his characters is immoral, largely unlikable and driven by a debilitating vice; however, despite this, or perhaps because of it, we can't take our eyes off them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Jungle Wins'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston directed this film two years after making KEY LARGO (1948) and one year before THE African QUEEN (1951). The film is chiefly of importance for the sizzling performance of the young Marilyn Munroe in a supporting role as the mistress of Louis Calhern, whom she kisses in the film, despite his prickly moustache, with a good deal of ardour, despite his being zillions of years older than her and certainly being one of the least kissable screen actors of his day. Munroe's affectation of jaw-dropping naiveté and simple-mindedness is shockingly convincing, as all her dumb blonde characteristics always were in films. She really stands out in this film despite still being an unknown actress. The script of this film is brilliant, and the dialogue is crisp and effective at all times. Everyone in the film except for the Police Commissioner (a lone, honest figure in a sea of sewage), and a pathetic girl who is in love with Sterling Hayden without his noticing, is amoral, corrupt, vicious, avaricious, violent, unfeeling, dishonest, double-crossing or triple-crossing, selfish, egotistical, greedy, and despicable in every way. One wonders why anyone wants to make films about such people, but then it is done every day to great popular acclaim, which says a lot about humanity. The film is, therefore, truly about a jungle. All the beasts of prey are on the loose and eating each other. Huston was always a talented director, and he makes this film compelling and fascinating to watch, a bit like a visit to the Reptile House in the zoo. Huston was a sadistic personality who liked to watch people suffer, and here he has an entire cast to torment, so he must have been very happy. (At least no one cuts off her nipples with scissors, as Julie Harris did in REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE (1967), which is a relief, and also no horses are tortured as in THE MISFITS (1961), and the masochistic Montgomery Clift was not in the cast for Huston to hospitalize and then visit afterwards with flowers as he liked to do, or a masochistic James Agee to drive to a premature heart attack.) Sam Jaffe does an excellent job of playing a brilliant criminal who has just been released after seven years 'behind the walls' in prison, and immediately plans an ingenious heist. He dresses impeccably and affects the airs of a gentleman. His performance is truly remarkable, especially the scene where he loses all track of time because he becomes entranced with a young girl doing the jitterbug to a juke box, with tragic results. The film is littered with rich irony, much of it very subtle indeed. In a way, it is an intellectual work, though unquestionably a study in evil which ends up apologizing for much of it. As Louis Calhern says in a sober reflective moment: 'Crime is really just a left-handed form of human endeavour.' I fear this moral relativism is at the basis of this entire film, and seems to have been accepted by writers, producer, and director. In other words, this film is rotten at its heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that should get far more credit and attention than it does: people need to be reminded that it exists. This is one of those films - like Citizen Kane or Sunset Boulevard - in which just about every scene is a classic. It is made up of countless brilliant parts - the cast, the music by Miklos Rozsa, the direction by John Huston, the photography, the script, etc, etc - which come together to form the best crime film of the fifties, and possibly of all time. It's certainly one of the most influential; Stanley Kubrick's The Killing is a great film, but without The Asphalt Jungle it probably wouldn't have been made - the same goes for any number of thrillers that followed it, including the three direct re-makes. The Asphalt Jungle is necessary viewing for any serious filmgoer, and a landmark in cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Look for Tarzan and Jane Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lately, I've been watching so many mediocre and, yes, really bad films that I needed to sit down and write out a short list of the essential elements in exceptional movie-making. Even after many viewings, this movie is exceptional and actually improves with each look. No, they don't make them like this anymore. Here is the brief list that I composed:1. Good writing: In this case, the screenplay by Ben Maddow and John Huston, the director, provides outstanding dialogue that is both lean and powerful. Almost every word has a purpose, revealing important information about each character or explaining the background as well as the action that is to follow.2. Careful casting and a successful delivery by very talented cast: Without exception, every member of this cast has an important contribution to the overall success of the product. As a viewer, I sense that they are energized by each other as a team, in addition to their positive interaction with excellent writing and direction.3. Direction: In this, having written the script so flawlessly with Maddow, John Huston gets his second gold star. He was responsible for bringing all of the components, including all of the different people mentioned in the credits, together in order to create one seamless product. The technical skills behind the effective use of the camera and the lighting should never be taken for granted.This is by no means the jungle of Tarzan and Jane. This is a jungle exclusively inhabited by flawed human beings who are doomed to self-destruction from the very start. Although the extremely bleak opening scenes are of the City of Cincinnati, I did not hear the name of this city mentioned even once during the film. Did I get that right? Perhaps the director believed that it was unfair to single out one particular American city because the locale could have been any number of cities in the US in 1950. Take your pick! I never once considered the many unsavory characters and shabby neighborhoods depicted here to be a reflection of any one city, but it's nevertheless an interesting bit of movie trivia to me. The fact that Doc asks the taxi driver to drive him to Cleveland is another hint at the film's locale. The fuzzy locale in this instance reminded me that Kazan never revealed that "On the Waterfront" was shot in Hudson County, NJ and not in New York City, as many still believe. You can't see Manhattan across the Hudson from Manhattan, you know, but that is the subject for another (glowing) review.As to the superb acting in this film, who stands above the rest? This is a very difficult decision, but my vote goes to Louis Calhern as Emmerich, the sleazy lawyer who is bankrupt not only morally and spiritually but financially as well. As disagreeable as this character is, Calhern's performance allows the viewer to experience up close the defeat and despair of a man who was once regarded as "respectable" by his community. His own adoring, bed-ridden wife, well played by Dorothy Tree, seems totally clueless about the true extent of his corruption. To me, Calhern conveys so well a sense of ruin within a man once highly esteemed but suddenly reduced to the lowest depth of utter humiliation.The acting accolades could go one and on, including James Whitmore as the disabled getaway man who is simmering internally with violent rage, Jean Hagen as Doll, the devoted but very lonely girlfriend of Dix (Sterling Hayden), and Mark Lawrence as Cobby, the small-time criminal and weasel who finds himself way over his head, possibly for the first time in his slimy life. No review should omit the work of Sterling Hayden, the "hick hooligan" with the exploding inner rage of a man who despises his fate, having been thrust into a hostile, urban world that he never wanted but in which he nevertheless must struggle to survive by the only means that he knows. Then there is Sam Jaffe as Doc, the sophisticated, highly educated mastermind of the caper who is very smart but not smart enough to have waited to execute his plan at a time when he is no longer a recently released, high profile prisoner. "Oh, the girls in Mexico!" he exclaims to his new partners in crime. Only because of the overall sense of doom and gloom do we somehow know early that he will never make it to Mexico and must instead settle for the fleeting, seductive 1950 jitterbug dance of a small town Ohio teenager in front of a roadside jukebox. "Oh, the girls of Westerville!" would be more like it for Doc. More sadness and failure follows for yet another doomed inhabitant of the human jungle. And what about Marilyn Monroe, who literally lights up the screen, albeit briefly, in an otherwise dark, drab, and depressing world? Don't think for a moment that she doesn't provide the soothing relief that Huston deliberately sought for his audience, regardless of their gender. God bless Marilyn and watch over her forever.Other reviewers have mentioned the absence of music, especially during the caper itself. How else would we hear the early sounds of the police sirens in the distance that so ominously announce the approaching outcome that would impact so many lives, both the guilty and the innocent? The most important music of the film surges at the end when Dix, the urban misfit, finally comes home to Kentucky, surrounded by the beautiful horses of his dreams, in a serene, pastoral scene that deliberately contrasts the ugliness and alienation of the asphalt jungle that he so despised.</fullReview>

Marilyn Monroe has a smaller part, but no big stars like Robert Mitchum or Rita Hayworth carrying the picture.If you have not seen this, see it.

A movie that surely influenced Stanley Kubrick (the Killing, which came 6 years later feels so similar, and not just for the common presence of Sterling Hayden), and ultimately directors like Marin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino.Solid plot. Good set up, introducing the main characters, the plan...and then we see how it unfolds. From the word go Huston creates a seedy, moody, fatalistic atmosphere. The use of black &amp; white goes a long way to creating this atmosphere. However, while the pacing and focus is spot-on for the first 60% of the movie, it does feel like it drifts a bit towards the end. Too many unnecessary detours, or lingering on certain scenes.Solid performances all round.

		<fullReview>THE FILM: 1950. John Huston isn't exactly "hot stuff". His new project has no big name actors, and a plot that could have depressed anyone. It is about a bank robbery, and it's after effects. Not exactly box-office gold. Another problem. Star Sterling Hayden was a communist, and both him and Huston are on The Committee for the First Amendment. It seemed as if the studio just wanted to see what would happen. Good thing Huston pulled it off.THE PLOT: "Doc" Riedenschnieder has just been released from prison. He is considered one of the foremost criminal masterminds of the time.Immediately after his release he is itching to pull of another heist, his last. Then he plans to retire to Mexico, he recruits heavy Dix. It's a Jewellery store robbery, and he knows he can do it, he just needs someone who will be able to sell the Jewels after the Robbery. He turns to Emmerich, a rich family man, who runs little things on the side, like having an affair with a beautiful blonde.Unfortunately for Doc, Emmerich plans to double-cross him after the heist, and Doc knows it, but he goes on anyways. He recruits some other men, and at the same time Dix finds himself in a relationship with a woman whom he doesn't love, but who is devoted to him. SPOILERS. The heist doesn't come off the way Doc planned and he is faced with multiple double crosses and the cops on his trail. In other words, it's a typical Noir.THE CRITICISM:John Huston was born for Noir. He defined the genre with The Maltese Falcon, and his sharp wit and attention to detail was a perfect match to that film's sharp and direct dialog. Here he works in the genre, but not in the tradition of films like The Big Sleep or Falcon, where there is some happiness. No, here no one is happy. They are greedy and selfish, and perhaps only Jean Hagen is the only non-cynical character, yet even she has an unhealthy selfish desire to nurture, to love Dix.There is no hope in The Asphalt Jungle, it is one of the most depressing things I've ever seen. It is also one of the most realistic films ever to come out of Hollywood. The gritty, hopeless city presented here could be any major city in the US. New York, Los Angeles, Miami, it could be set in any of those. These characters have been rotting from the inside out, and their insatiable greed and lust can only lead to their destruction.Yet you feel sorrow, you want them to have some kind of happy ending, and that is one thing that these people will never have. That brings me to the performances, uniformly excellent. Huston had a great knack for getting great performances out of actors, and this is no exception. Hayden has always been a unique actor. On his face is etched the pain and suffering of thirty odd years in the crime racket. You get the sense that he is running on fumes.Hagen is, as I mentioned above terrific, she is one-minded in her obsession with Dix. Louis Calhern is slimy and, despite his good-guy act, he is rotting from the inside. His affair with Marilyn Monroe is just a way for him to embrace his true slimy nature. When he is questioned by the police, you can see him desperately trying to get himself out of the situation, lying until he can lie no more.Also good is Sam Jaffe as Doc and James Whitmore. The film barely has a score, which may be due to artistic intent or laziness, but the lack of score reinforces the gritty reality of the film. The cinematography is amazing, delving in the shadows and murky depths that define Noir.And finally the direction. As I mentioned above, Huston keeps it realistic, with little to no artistic flourishes, and it works completely. Huston was the perfect match for the material, and it certainly pays off.The Asphalt Jungle, 1950, Starring: Sterling Hayden, Jean Hagen and Louis Calhern Directed by John Huston 9.5/10 (A)(This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie, you can find this and other reviews at http://everyjohnhustonmovie.blogspot.ca/)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realism, Suspense &amp; Memorable Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston's classic heist movie is a fascinating study of how a group of criminals work together to plan, execute and deal with the aftermath of a major jewellery robbery. The action depicted is uncompromisingly realistic, full of suspense and unusually for its time, told from the perspective of the criminals. Its greatest strength, however, is the way in which it establishes and develops the story's characters providing the audience with information about their backgrounds, their motivations and their weaknesses. The acting performances and the screenplay are consistently good and together further enhance the quality and power of the characterisations and also the authenticity of the interactions between the various personalities involved.When Doc Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe) is released from prison. he's already formulated a plan for a jewellery heist and contacts a bookie called Cobby (Marc Lawrence) so that the necessary funding ($50,000) can be arranged. This involves Cobby's contact, a corrupt and very successful lawyer named Alonzo D Emmerich (Louis Calhern). Emmerich is impressed with the plan and agrees to provide the funding and to arrange for the jewels to be fenced. It emerges later, however, that he's actually broke due to the fact that he's got a very expensive mistress called Angela Phinlay (Marilyn Monroe) and together with private detective, Bob Brannom (Brad Dexter), he plans to double cross Doc and keep the stolen jewels for himself.Cobby eventually supplies the $50,000 himself and Doc and he recruit safe-cracker Louis Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso), tough guy Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden) and driver Gus Minissi (James Whitmore). The robbery is carried out but when the gang get interrupted by a night-watchman, Ciavelli is accidentally shot and is then taken to his home where he subsequently dies.Doc and Dix go to meet Emmerich as planned but soon realise his treacherous intentions and this leads to an exchange of shots between Dix and Brannom which leaves Brannom dead and Dix injured. Emmerich disposes of Brannom's body but when it's later found with evidence on it which links Brannom to the lawyer, Emmerich knows that the game is up. Doc and Dix initially go into hiding but soon come to recognise that their entire plan is doomed to failure.It's particularly striking that regardless of which side of the law that they're on, there's little to distinguish between the standards of morality and integrity shown by the characters that populate "The Asphalt Jungle". The story features a lawyer, a police detective, a café owner and a private detective who are all dangerously corrupt and a thug who is an inherently decent man with aspirations to return to horse farming. Ciavelli takes a professional pride in his work and is a committed family man and Doc is an intelligent, well mannered man with a genuine talent for thorough and methodical planning.Sam Jaffe and Louis Calhern provide the stand out performances and Marilyn Monroe makes a great impact in her minor role. The movie's top class standards of cinematography and direction were also justifiably recognised by both Harold Rosson and John Huston being nominated for Academy Awards for their respective contributions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crime On Their Hands</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston's 1950 movie adaptation of W.R. Burnett's excellent crime novel The Asphalt Jungle is one of the director's better efforts. It falls just a little short of his absolute best; awfully downbeat, full of people who are unhappy, unfulfilled in one way or another or simply unwilling or unable to make an honest living, it's an impressive achievement and yet a hard movie to love. Then again, I suppose it wasn't the director's intention to make a lovable movie. It's a Wonderful Life it's not. More like It's a Terrible Life.A bunch of criminals of varying degrees of psychopathy pool their talents for a big heist in the jewelry district of an unnamed mid-western city. If they pull the massive undertaking off some of them will be set for life. The mastermind is a German immigrant known as Doc. A small, unprepossessing man, he's a brilliant strategist of crime; had he lived his life differently one can easily imagine him as a field marshal. He hooks up with an assortment of mostly minor criminals, his deal bankrolled by a prominent lawyer, who, though still living large is in reality broke and desperate, a fact he for obvious reasons keeps from his partners in crime. One of the most prominent members of this motley crew is Dix, the "muscle guy", who, though huge, tough talking and no nonsense on the outside has an introspective side that consists of a code of honor and a love of horses. He's a farm boy from Kentucky adrift in a cold, northern city where he feels like a stranger. Doc takes a liking to Dix, as he senses the man's personal qualities beneath his brusque exterior, and indeed these two are atypical of the general run of criminals we see in the film, as each is somewhat of an aristocrat.A corrupt policeman figures prominently in the story, and indeed the police don't come off well at all in the film. They are portrayed as either corrupt or cold blooded. The criminals, for all their flaws, have a humanity to them, and a measure of loyalty to one another. We get to know the various members of this criminal gang as the movie progresses. Their dialog is good, unfancy, not too stylized, without the wisecracking one often finds in crime pictures from the 30's. The film is starkly photographed, and while the product of a major studio, it doesn't particularly look like a Hollywood movie.There's no need to spoil this one by giving away the ending, or even its last part. I'll simply say that things don't go according to plan and leave it at that. Too many variables, loose cannons and the like. Director Huston and screenwriter Ben Maddow don't shrink from unpleasantness; and not just the unpleasantness of crime but of everyday life. This is an unflattering picture of America, and I wouldn't be surprised in the least if the State department held up its worldwide release, as it presents America in a nasty light and might, as the saying goes, send the wrong message. It's an impressive movie just the same. There's a feeling for the working poor, society's outcasts, the square pegs who can never seem to find the right holes to fit in, that comes from people who know real life inside out. I can't find much wrong with it except maybe that it doesn't give much in the way of pleasure. Marilyn Monroe has a small part, which perks things up a bit. Louis Calhern, as the lawyer at the end of his tether, is excellent, and he underplays his part skillfully, letting the dialog and the camera do the heavy lifting. Sterling Hayden, as Dix, the hoodlum with a sentimental streak, is nearly as good. He'd been a minor, pretty boy leading man for several years prior to making this picture, which enabled him to reinvent himself as an urban tough guy. Sam Jaffe comes off as convincingly European as Doc, a man who, like Dix, seems to have one foot in a dream world. James Whitmore, Anthony Caruso and John McIntrye are all fine in smaller roles. Only Marc Lawrence seems out of place. His performance as the cowardly bookie is good, but it belongs in a different film, and seems to come from another era. Jean Hagen does nicely in her underwritten role as Hayden's (shall we say) woman friend. The ending is calculated, for sure, and yet haunting none the less. Huston gets the viewer where he wants him. He has things to say, and like all good directors he shows us rather than tells us what it is. A brilliant film, moving and sad. It's not for children, and unlikely to become a holiday favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the Jungle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? John Huston knows, and here he proves it yet again. "The Asphalt Jungle" is at once a gripping crime drama, a shadowy film noir, and a multiple-character study. It starts out with images of Dix (Sterling Hayden), having just done another hold-up, racing through an empty part of town, in and around corners, to a little place where he can drop off his gun. Gorgeous lighting, the picture of a man on the run. But the running's not over yet.Bit by bit, we're introduced to a big cast of characters. Criminal genius Doc (Sam Jaffe) is just out of jail, there's Cobby, the bookie organizer, Lon Emmerich, the crooked lawyer, Ditrich, the crooked cop, and Gus and Louis and Doll and more. Everybody wants something, and they know just how they're gonna get it: the biggest heist the Middle West has ever seen, with a take as big as half a mil. Jaffe's Doc is a home run. He's got both hubris and pathos at the same time. You love the man- you can't help yourself- even though you know he's nothing but a crook, like all the rest. But he's an old man, and all he wants is to be around the Mexican girls in Mexico City, so he's okay. Plus, he takes a shine to Dix, who just wants to be back on the farm with his father's black colt. Dix may be a hooligan and a brute, but he tries to take care of Doll, and he may be stubborn, but he comes by everything naturally. I didn't want to like Dix- I know I didn't look favorably at Hayden in "The Killing" or "Dr. Strangelove," but here he's got this sympathetic idiocy, even if he is a hood.The plan is next to perfect. But crime doesn't pay- it's an incontrovertible fact of the movies (at least under the Production Code), and this wouldn't be the same gritty, low-down, inherently pessimistic film if they all got away with it. There is no honor among thieves, as Emmerich proves- and his PI friend Brannom reinforces the point. These are the respectable characters, with licenses and all, but they're still grimier and more despicable than the convicted criminals who populate the rest of the cast. Emmerich still gets your sympathy, because he's got a sick wife whom (despite the Marilyn Monroe he keeps as a mistress) he truly loves, and he's broke and desperate. Brannom, however, is just a jerk. He ruins the whole deal, especially by getting killed. His body turning up in the river is one of the first tip-offs to the cops, connecting it all with Emmerich and breaking down all the careful planning. Brannom is the greedy, honorless human element that Doc couldn't plan for.Well, Louis gets it on the night of the job, shot in the belly by a security guard's errant gun. Burglar alarms go off for no reason and soon the coppers are hot on their trail. Ditrich, even on Cobby's pay, has got his supervisor breathing down his neck, so he roughs Cobby up until he spills the beans. So we have Doc and Dix hiding out together, eventually going their separate ways. Dix has a bullet wound from Brannom, which is slowly killing him. (He doesn't trust doctors so he dresses it himself.) Doll wants to go with him. He doesn't want her to. She does. Emmerich blows his brains out when he's about to be arrested. This scene is done with a master's touch. You think you can tell what's coming, but you're not sure. Emmerich gets away from the police for a moment to go to his study and write out a note apologizing to his wife. Then he tears up the note, opening up a desk drawer whose contents are obscured by his head. The viewer is briefly distracted, we hear a bang, and the torn-up shreds of the note are swept off the table. It's really shocking.The end comes soon but you grieve for the characters as it does. Doc meets a fellow German who's a taxi driver, and asks him for a ride to Cleveland. They stop in a little diner and Doc gives a teenage girl plenty of nickels so she can dance for a while before his eyes, and before the eyes of the watching police. Time runs out, Doc and the hackie must leave, and the cops accost them as they do. I think Doc knew what was coming. Then Dix arrives at his farm and, with Doll close behind, he slumps down into a field and dies, his beloved horses nuzzling his head. The end, and a powerful end. From beginning to end we see Dix's slow migration from the dark asphalt jungle that is this anonymous, placeless city back to the bucolic countryside of his youth. He is a vessel through which the currents of nature flow. He is a blank slate of a hooligan onto whom we project our care and emotion. Oh, Dix. We hardly knew ye.In the final analysis, "The Asphalt Jungle" is all in the title. It's about a sad and dirty city, brimming with corruption and huddled masses yearning to breathe free. A few of them do more than yearn- they act. But it's a dead end: action leads only to the grave and to the slammer. Don't watch it unless you're willing to care for the little B&amp;W people gracing the screen for a two hours' traffic, then disappearing into the air around you. It's a movie that's both ethereal and very, very real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best laid plans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston has given cinema one of the truly great films in "The Ashphalt Jungle," a story about a jewel heist and a bunch of losers sliding downhill fast. Can't say there's an appealing character in the bunch, nor any major star, both of which are unusual and brave choices. The film is a perfect example of the right director paired with the right film. Other films, such as "Freud," were not quite suited to the talents of this marvelous director.I will take issue with a couple of things. I did glance at the other comments, so I know I'm in murky waters here. I always thought Sterling Hayden was a terrible actor. He did nothing in this film to convince me otherwise. His line readings are all the same - barked - right along with his facial expression. Perhaps he was supposed to be a sympathetic character but for me, he wasn't. He was, however, pathetic, so he was successful there. I found Jean Hagen a bit too overwrought. In the midst of the restrained performances of Louis Calhern and Sam Jaffe, she seemed out of place. That couple did not work for me.The rest of the cast, however, is sensational. The film contains an early appearance by Marilyn Monroe, who pays Emmerich's mistress. She is super gorgeous. One of my favorite parts of the film occurs when one of the detectives is sent to interrogate her about her alibi. When he returns, John McIntyre asks, "Was she convincing?" "Oh, yes, sir, she convinced me very much," he answers.The Asphalt Jungle is a great example of film noir in the hands of a master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensational movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is sensational. It is an outstanding example of expressionist cinema which captures perfectly the mood of foreboding and anger associated with modern urban society. Everyone is damaged; and everyone is trying to survive in the grim world where one's life isn't worth much. Every character is flawed and nobody's wishes come true. Nobody can be trusted and the double-cross is the rule, and something to be expected. The women are damaged, the men are angry and manipulative. The big shot is a wimp and the heavy a sentimentalist years for better days, which are gone forever. Nobody shows any love because there is none to show. Sterling Hayden is terrific has the guy who takes no guff from anyone and Jean Hagen is surprisingly effective as his girl with a past. But the strongest performance is by Sam Jaffe (that's right, the same actor who plays the benign and whimsical Dr. Zorba in Ben Casey) as a conniving and manipulative ex-con.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A standard-setter of the noir genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To gain a full appreciation of film noir, you'll have to see 'The Asphalt Jungle' at least once. The John Huston-directed thriller is considered an archetype of the hard-boiled crime genre and has been imitated several times, including as a western.'The Asphalt Jungle' was made in the thick of Hollywood's Production Code, which placed firm limits on content. Considering the restrictions that Huston and co-writer Ben Maddow had to deal with, 'Jungle' is eye-catching in how it moves against the grain of crime films from its era. Huston and Maddow wrote a faithful adaptation of W.R. Burnett's bestselling novel that treats its criminals with an unusual sensitivity as they try to restore order in their confused lives.'Jungle' centers on a gem heist plotted by 'Doc' Erwin Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe), an aging German crook who has been released from prison. Riedenschneider, who is itching to make one final score and ease into retirement, has spent his days in jail planning out a robbery that would net thousands of dollars for himself and his cohorts. In the film's unnamed city (allusions are made to Cincinnati), he gains help from Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden), a heavy who is wanted by police and lives with his friend Doll Conovan (Jean Hagen); Gus Minissi (James Whitmore), a hunchbacked restaurant owner who covers for Dix; and Louis Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso), a locksmith who has a knack for cracking safes.Riedenschneider is a meticulous schemer who seems to have everything in place to become a rich man. But he and his colleagues reveal their fatal flaws as matters develop. Riedenschneider, for instance, will forget everything when he sees a good-looking woman and Dix is crazed by his family's loss of their Kentucky horse breeding farm. The story further intertwines with Alonzo Emmerich (Louis Calhern), a once-wealthy businessman who becomes an intermediary for selling off the gems. Marilyn Monroe gives an early career appearance as Angela Phinlay, Emmerich's lover who is cohabiting with his sick wife May (Dorothy Tree). John McIntire (as the police commissioner), Marc Lawrence, Barry Kelley, Teresa Celli (as Louis's wife), and Brad Dexter fill supporting roles in a large cast.Dix and Doll gradually become the focal characters of 'Jungle' as the Kentuckian tries to correct past mistakes and buy his family's farm that was lost years ago. At 6' 5", Sterling Hayden is a physically dominating man on screen yet softened by Dix's feelings of misgiving. Jean Hagen, who later cemented her reputation in 'Singin' in the Rain,' is perhaps the most effective and sympathetic character of all; as a true friend, she supports Dix every step of the way while her affection is mostly ignored.Huston, as he so often achieved in fifty years of directing, gets strong performances from most of his cast. The leads, especially Hayden, Hagen, Jaffe, and Calhern, give sincere efforts and heighten the story's drama. Nearly two hours long, 'Jungle' moves at a steady pace, devoting the first 45 minutes to Doc's planning of the heist and the last hour to its aftermath. There are simply too many characters for them to be developed thoroughly, but Huston and Maddow succeed in giving them depth on screen. The film's ending is satisfying, if fairly predictable under Production Code restraints.'Jungle,' with its progressive script and very good performances, was nominated for four Oscars, including Jaffe for best actor and Huston for best director. It's nowadays regarded as a classic in film circles, although there are detractors, including myself. While above average for its time, much of the dialogue is clichéd and many of the conventions are all too familiar for its era. What gives 'Jungle' added life is its take on the criminal psyche, which was usually a subject of malign in Hollywood. Huston and Maddow succeed in making the felons sympathetic by relating to their inner conflicts.'The Asphalt Jungle' has received an acceptable DVD release as part of a five-disc, boxed set from Warner Bros. and Turner Entertainment. 'Film Noir Classic Collection,' which includes 'Murder, My Sweet' and 'Gun Crazy,' offers 'Jungle' with a short introductory clip of Huston; a commentary track with film scholar Dr. Drew Casper and excerpts of an interview with James Whitmore; and the theatrical trailer. French dubbing is included with subtitles in English, French, and Spanish.'Jungle' is well-presented visually and soundwise. The transfer keeps a sharp contrast between light and dark shades, which helps to preserve the look that is so important in noir films. Sound is fully balanced with clear dialogue and distinct sound effects.Drew Casper, who holds the Hitchcock film chair at USC, gives a commentary that is informative but top-heavy on facts we'd get from an encyclopedia or a Google search. Casper devotes much time to discussing Huston, MGM (particularly Louis B. Mayer's fall from grace), and film noir as a style, which is helpful but overlooks what is happening on screen. He also tends to get wound up on certain elements of the film that I, at least, don't find quite as impressive. The disc jacket plugs his commentary 'with co-star James Whitmore,' but the track only excerpts an older interview of Whitmore at appropriate points.Though not a perfect film and its disc presentation could've been a little more rounded, the Warner/Turner release of 'Jungle' is certainly worth hunting down. Self-proclaimed 'experts' of film noir shouldn't be caught dead without having seen it and the film is likely to entertain anyone with an interest in crime.*** out of 4Roving Reviewer - www.rovingreviewer.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A super-realistic and gritty crime drama--a must for fans of Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an amazing film and one that serious film buffs need to see. However, while it is clearly an example of Film Noir, it represents a very realistic style of Noir--lacking the dramatic excesses of some (such as KISS OF DEATH and its wheelchair scene) or super-snappy dialog (like DRAGNET). I actually like all three types of Noir films but when it comes to realism, this film ranks up there with HE WALKED BY NIGHT and T-MEN--and this is certainly good company.The movie is a step-by-step case study of a crime being organized, executed investigated and resolved. While it could have been shot documentary-style (like a few Noir films, such as NAKED CITY), it was handled like a traditional crime drama except that the focus tended to shift back and forth between the criminals and the police--though the focus tended to be on the criminals a bit more often. This really helped make the movie exciting and worked very well. What also helped the movie was the exceptional acting by mostly unknowns or long-time character actors. Good Noir usually does NOT star big names and having the film anchored by Sterling Hayden (who was amazing), Sam Jaffe and Louis Calhern was an excellent move. To assist them were some other exceptional actors, such as James Whitmore and Marilyn Monroe (in a small but exceptional role).However, despite the amazing acting, the biggest star of the film was the taut script. From start to finish, it sparkled and abounded with realism and an unflinching message that crime doesn't ultimately pay. The total package is one of the best Noir films ever--only exceeded by a small number of movies (such as my favorite Noir, THE KILLERS). See this film!By the way, please take a look at the very amazing biography of Sterling Hayden on IMDb. I did and was totally blown away--what an amazing life he led. It all sounded so amazing that if they turned it into a film, many would think it was fiction!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read a review once that claims this film had all the right ingredients but just didn't pay off. The reviewer went on to say that had he seen it at the time he might of enjoyed it more, but after seeing so many clever heist films, like Ocean's Eleven, this one lacked a sense of humor. I'd have to agree wholeheartedly. I as well have been spoiled by clever heist films. 'The Lavender Hill Mob' or 'Big Deal on Madonna Street' are just so much fun, I found 'The Asphalt Jungle' hard to sit through. It took itself too seriously. The surprises are not that surprising and the one or two twists that should grab you get lost upon delivery, as the viewer is apathetic towards the cause. I've heard this was one of the trendsetting caper films, and if so kudos to John Huston for creating a genre. Beyond that I'd say take it or leave it. Rating : 18 out of 40</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nasty People Doing Nasty Things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most highly praised movies ever but Louie B. Mayer, who was beginning to lose his grip on MGM and favored family fare like "Lassie Come Home", hated it. He said it was "Full of Nasty Ugly People Doing Nasty Ugly Things". He's right of course, but that was the intent. John Huston had been working at Warner Brothers for years and they first made their reputation making hard boiled gangster pictures that were full of ugly people doing ugly things. "The Asphalt Jungle" was a departure for MGM and also a harbinger of things to come. It's full of good stuff, from a wonderful cast of recognizable character actors, (some of them in small roles). If you watch a lot of 50's and 60's TV, you'll recognize virtually the entire cast, many of whom were just breaking into Hollywood at the time, James Whitmore, John McIntyre, Anthony Caruso, Brad Dexter, Ray Teal- even Gene Evans and Strother Martin are in there somewhere, according to the cast listing. There are lots of close-ups, often with the main action going on behind the face, and a lot of nice touches like the horse player winding up among the horses. It's clearly a very influential film. It's also a long, dreary, sad ride. The characters, except Jaffe, who is a fatalist, have a desperate air to them. One by one they manufacture their own demise, as if they never had any hope to begin with. This is often described as the first "caper film" but it lacks the charm and fun of a good caper film, in which the characters are clever and confident. it's a crime film but lacks the over the top performances of something like the same year's "White Heat". Despite the clever touches, it just lacks entertainment value. I think I'd rather watch "Ocean's Eleven", one of the many "copies" of "The Asphalt Jungle" but one with a sense of fun. The critics are not necessarily wrong about what they say about this film but maybe Louie had a point, too.  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heist with Noir Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Doc" (played by Sam Jaffe), fresh out of prison, provides the plan for stealing some jewels. "Cobby" (played by Marc Lawrence), a bookie, and Alonzo Emmerich (played by Louis Calhern), a successful attorney, invest in the plan. With that financial backing, Doc hires his crew: safecracker Louis Ciavelli (played by Anthony Caruso), driver Gus (played by James Whitmore) and hooligan Dix Handley (played by Sterling Hayden). "The Asphalt Jungle", based on W.R. Burnett's book, helped set the mold for numerous imitations and variations on the heist theme.This forerunner commendably doesn't waste time showing us how grand the burglary is, or how brilliant the masterminds and craftsmen behind it are--modesty I wish some copycats would have learned. This movie is best in the burglary sequence (I especially liked watching them slide under the detection of the sensory alarm) and the proceeding outcomes of the characters. Director John Huston and cinematographer Harold Rosson show added discernment by using noir style, for which they got Oscar nominations.Jaffe's genial performance, as a German with a penchant for young girls, landed him an Oscar nod, too. The ensemble cast includes the nubile Marilyn Monroe in an early bit part. I liked the addition of contrasting cops: Ditrich who's on the take (played by Barry Kelley) and the harsh commissioner Hardy (played by John McIntire). I couldn't accept, however, Doll (played by Jean Hagen) as being just a neurotic hopelessly in love with Dix. The character should have been further developed, or removed, as she wasn't vital to the story (failure in adaptation, I suspect).The performance, or character, that impinged the most was Calhern's morose turn; because there was no attempt to pass his character off as something he wasn't. This is where the movie falls to a common error of crime genre; for example, Hayden's character is made into a sort of honorable thug--more intelligent than the stereotype would suggest--as displayed in IMDb comments, some viewers still thought the character was a dolt. He's similar to Russell Crowe's character in "L.A. Confidential". Crowe pulled it off; nobody did here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A sublime caper film driven by superior casting, character development, and ensemble work. Against the gray, gritty backdrop of the city, I couldn't take my eyes off of Sterling Hayden. Such a masculine, ruggedly sexy guy! One sensed he almost had a heart somewhere in scenes with the tremulous Doll, played expertly by Jean Hagen. Louis Calhern oozes slime as a corruptible lawyer placating his bedridden wife while keeping a strikingly young and winsome Marilyn Monroe tucked away as a mistress. One squirms a little, observing the "Kid" and "Uncle Joe" in their moments alone. The jewel-heist crew is perfection itself, its mastermind, German-born Doc (Sam Jaffe), operating with exquisite elegance, calculation, and aplomb. Masterful!Marc Lawrence, as pockmark-faced Cobby, makes his every jitter contagious. A weak man who plies tougher thugs with booze but gets kicked around anyway, he pitifully goes kicking toward his demise (and perhaps presages the equally pathetic Freddie, much later, in "The Godfather"). Barry Kelley as a cynical, look-the-other-way lieutenant, is the worst kind of cop -- and his arrow-straight commissioner, played stirringly by John McIntyre, gets it. Both are fascinating to watch.This film is a rousingly supportive paean to police work, portraying it as the thin blue line -- albeit not unassailable -- between civilization and mayhem. Yet "The Asphalt Jungle" hints that psychology is an even more powerful force. Even if the coppers don't always get their man, then the hooligans' character flaws will. Dix would not slow down and accept a good woman's love. Emmerich thought he was smarter than everyone else. Cobby couldn't, or wouldn't, grow a backbone. And Doc, intelligent as he was, fell victim to lust. In all, this film is a stunning credit to director John Huston. They sure don't make movies like this much anymore...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a Closer Look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a subversive movie in a conformist decade. Asphalt Jungle stands the conventional business enterprise on its head. Instead of portraying law-abiding people acting cooperatively and intelligently to advance a profit-making venture, John Huston &amp; Co. show professional criminals acting intelligently and cooperatively for ill-gotten gains. Not that this is so unusual. Other gangster films going as far back as Cagney's Public Enemy have made similar points. Jungle, however, goes two steps further.First, unlike other crime films from that era, it thoroughly humanizes the culprits. Each gang member, including double-crosser Louis Calhern, acts on recognizably human motives, and though each has a fatal weakness, all are treated in subtly sympathetic fashion by director-co- writer Huston. The evolving bond between Sterling Hayden's muscle and Sam Jaffe's brain is especially affecting -- ditto, Louis Calhern's genuine regard for both wife and mistress. Moreover, the bank heist develops from a raw criminal undertaking into an model of professional expertise, encouraging viewers at the same time to root for its success. On the other hand, law enforcement is treated in unusually cynical fashion. The one overtly brutal character, Barry Kelley's corrupt cop, is clearly dislikable, while John McIntyre's voice of official rectitude is so harshly self-righteous that viewers are likely repelled. As a result, the respectable overworld becomes not so much an opponent of the underworld as its grim and unfeeling seed bed.The movie has many fine touches. Except for attorney Calhern's plush surroundings, the sets are appropriately seedy. The cast is outstanding, as Calhern again shows his capacity for tragic dimensions, while Monroe again proves her flair for kittenish seduction, even as Marc Lawrence (Cobby) faces sudden unemployment as a victim of the Hollywood blacklist. Two scenes are especially worth savoring. Seldom has culture clash been more tantalizingly displayed than in Sam Jaffe's ogling of teenage jitterbug Helene Stanley, his old world intellectualism lost amidst the sensual gyrations of her new world exuberance. The fit is perfect, and the impression is that he gladly gives up his freedom for one tawdry glimpse of earthly delight.The final scene is an oddly moving mixture of pathos and misogyny. Across the horsey fields of Kentntucky, the love- lorn Jean Hagen chases after a dying Hayden as he chases after the dreams of his lost youth, oblivious to her emotional train-wreck. Rarely has a movie treated such a vulnerable victim with such casual indifference. In fact, her punishment may be the most painful of all. Everybody, of course, ends up a loser as the production code of the time dictated and Huston agreeably underscores.This caper film set the style for those to follow, most notably Kubrick's The Killing. Amidst the de-politicized 1950's, this genre comes about as close to a political statement as can be found. Daring people are shown organizing themselves outside the law for collective gain, their emotions and motives thoroughly humanized. And if their goals never get beyond the basely mercenary, they at least establish eye-opening bonds beyond the conventional hypocrisy of the day. As a result, their combined skills demonstrate the powerful potential of collective action among ordinary and not so ordinary people, and therein lies the subtle message of a darn good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moral and physical wasteland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Asphalt Jungle"&nbsp;was not the first film noir to tell its story from the viewpoint of the criminals; "Double Indemnity"; for example, had done the same thing a number of years earlier. The&nbsp;film does, however, point the way to the future in one respect. It is an early example of a "heist movie", that sub-genre of the crime film which deals with the planning, commission and aftermath of a robbery. It is sometimes referred to as a "caper film", but that is not a description I would use as I have always associated that term with films like "The Italian Job" or the recent "Ocean's" franchise which take a much more light-hearted view of the subject than John Huston does here. The action takes place in a Midwestern&nbsp;city, probably Chicago. A criminal mastermind named Erwin Riedenschneider is released from prison and immediately sets about planning his next exploit, a jewel robbery. We see how he goes about obtaining the necessary finance from a lawyer named Alonzo Emmerich, via a bookie&nbsp;named Cobby, and then recruits the three men who will help him carry out the crime, a professional&nbsp;safecracker, a getaway driver and a "hooligan". (The word "hooligan" would seem to have a wider meaning in the United States that it does in Britain, where it means a young thug or vandal. In this film it means the robbers' strong-arm man who in Britain would be referred to as a "heavy"). &nbsp;As one might expect of a film made in the days of the Production Code, which forbade film-makers from romanticising crime and from showing the criminals getting away with it, the robbery ends in failure with all of the gang either dead or under arrest. Unlike some crime dramas from this period, however, (such as "White Heat"), "The Asphalt Jungle"does not really romanticise the police either. The most prominent police officer, Lieutenant Ditrich, is as corrupt as Emmerich, taking bribes to protect Cobby whose bookmaking business is illegal. Moreover, Huston attempts to show the criminals not just as faceless villains but as individuals in their own right, not all of them wholly despicable. Today by far the best known name among the cast would be Marilyn Monroe, but in 1950 she was a little-known young actress and her name did not even appear on the posters. Although her role, that of Emmerich's beautiful young mistress Angela, is a relatively minor one, she makes enough of an impression to allow the discerning viewer to spot an upcoming star in the making. It is interesting to note that in this film, and in some of her other early serious dramas, Monroe speaks with a quite different voice, deeper in tone and less breathless, than the one which she was to use in the comedies which were to become her stock- in-trade during the later part of her career. There is a good performance from Louis Calhern&nbsp;(previously best known to me as Julius Caesar in the 1953 production of Shakespeare's play) as the corrupt, cowardly Emmerich, an intelligent, educated man gone to the bad, but the two best contributions probably come from Sam Jaffe as Riedenschneider and Sterling Hayden as the "hooligan" Dix Handley. Riedenschneider's name and accent clearly mark him out as a foreigner, probably a German. Like Emmerich he is a clearly intelligent man with some formal education- his nickname is "Doc"- who has ended up on the wrong side of the&nbsp;law, but unlike Emmerich, who tries unsuccessfully to double-cross his associates, has a certain code of honour. He dislikes violence, for example, and always refuses to carry a gun. I wondered if his Christian name was borrowed from the German General Rommel, another honourable man who nevertheless ended up on the wrong side. (Audiences in 1950, only five years after the end of the war, would have been more alive to such references than modern ones). Dix Handley, whose real name is William, is another man known by a nickname; "Dix" is probably derived from "Dixie" in a reference to his Southern origins. Dix is motivated by an honourable ambition, that of buying back the family farm in Kentucky that his father lost during the&nbsp;Great Depression. His gambling addiction, however, means that Dix has not been able to raise the necessary cash through honest means, so has turned to crime in desperation. Unlike Riedenschneider Dix is capable of violence, but his tenderness towards his girlfriend Doll suggests a softer side to his nature. The film was nominated for four&nbsp;Academy Awards, including "Best Director" for Huston, "Best Supporting Actor" for Jaffe and "Best Adapted Screenplay", quite an achievement at a time when film noir was not always appreciated as much as it is today. The fourth nomination was for "Best Cinematography, Black and White", and the visual look of the film is certainly impressive, conjuring up a vision of a bleak urban wasteland, the "asphalt jungle" of the title, a wasteland whose physical barrenness hints at the moral barrenness of the men who inhabit it. The film might have lost out in all four categories to "All About Eve", the Big Film of the year, but it remains a powerful and impressive example of the noir style, one of the best in this particular genre. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"One way or another, we all work for our vice."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was thinking about my summary line quote as it applied to the principal characters, and was struck by the way Sterling Hayden's Dix Handley came out of the picture. His vice, if you can call it that, was playing the small time hooligan with a desire to make it back home to reacquire the family horse farm. Yet in parting company with Doc Reidenschneider (Sam Jaffe), he didn't want any part of the stolen loot. There was something almost admirable about that and it puzzled me for the remainder of the story.Many reviewers here call this picture an exceptional example of film noir, and it has those elements to be sure, but I see it more as a caper film, one of the earliest of the genre that would eventually give rise to such modern day flicks as "Inside Man" and the 'Ocean' films. Today, the writing and cinematography produces a much slicker product, but it's hard to replace the kind of gritty realism found in Fifties era filmmaking done in stark black and white, especially with characters who exhibit varying shades of gray. Emmerich (Louis Calhern) would be the best example of that here, a respectable lawyer and citizen on the outside, and a two-timing, conniving crook on the inside.Say, remember that scene when the cops came calling on Emmerich after Brannom's (Brad Dexter) body was fished out of the river. They produced the list of 'clients' that Brannom was strong arming for his boss, but to my thinking, that flimsy piece of paper would have been unreadable after hitting the drink. Ever see a handwritten note after it's gotten wet? As great as all the characters were in the film, wouldn't it have been cool if Strother Martin had more to do here than just show up for the police lineup at the beginning of the picture? And when all was said and done, Marilyn Monroe wasn't on screen for that much longer considering the fact that you see her prominently positioned in promotional pieces for the film. I have to admit, watching her kiss old Emmerich was a little jarring, but probably not as bad as planting one on Sam Giancana a decade later. Seeing a slim Marilyn in this early role was also an interesting contrast to her more full bodied look in 1953's "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" and 1959's "Some Like it Hot".Anyway, this is one of those movies all serious cinema fans should get to see at least one time. Director John Huston gets terrific performances out of his players, as the characters slowly unravel due to the old double cross and unintended consequences. With no disrespect to southpaws, it's a masterful treatment of 'crime as the left handed form of human endeavor'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Centerpiece of Noir's All-Too-Brief Apex</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best-known examples of film noir, John Huston's Asphalt Jungle follows the trail of an infamous heist-meister, fresh out of jail, and his plans to pull off one more big score before retirement. Sam Jaffe is cool-headed and convincing as the brains behind the operation, while a ragtag cast of backup anti-heroes pay the price as the whole thing slowly starts to unravel. A young Marilyn Monroe makes several scant appearances as nothing more than eye candy, still so green she can barely keep from looking straight into the cameras. It's noteworthy that very few characters are as black and white as the film stock, a trademark of the genre, even if their motivations are ultimately sinister and selfish. A worthwhile slant on the heist picture that's crammed full of smoke and atmosphere, it expertly balances several different faces and pays off each story, most with especially dark consequences. Quite good, but not great, it creates some new conventions while bowing to many others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Jungle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like film noir, you'll appreciate The Asphalt Jungle. The lighting, as in most noir movies, sets the tone with emphasis on light and shadows playing over actor's faces. Scenes take on ominous tones with long shadows often shrinking the actor. A must-see classic for fans of vintage noir; it's a gritty and atmospheric portrait of a big-time heist gone awry -- with brooding personalities, double crosses, and a little sex appeal courtesy of Marilyn Monroe. Although it definitely doesn't reach the standard set by the Maltese Falcon. Every member of the heist team is reduced to two essentials: their role in the story and their tragic weakness. Every female character is an archetype: fading floozy with a heart of gold, sexpot attracted to her sugar daddy, lonely wife, doting mother. The thieves are skillful and pull off their crime, but double crosses, chance events and human weaknesses lead to the whole caper unraveling one person at a time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This wasn't that hard to watch because it stayed interesting and a little suspenseful. There were lots of dramatic shadows throughout it and the camera angles were used well. The suicide was interesting in that they didn't even show the gun. I guess it would be against the code to show it or something. The ripped up paper blowing away was good too. This was the first movie I've seen Marilyn Monroe in and I thought she was fairly good. The complexity and well planned crime was also engaging and made it easier to watch. I also liked how most of the criminals died at the end, also probably adhering to the code. But I thought it was good for the story too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was pretty good, not the best, but pretty good. The story was really good but throughout the whole movie I couldn't tell who the main character was, it seemed to be switching the whole time. Sterling Hayden I suppose is the main character because he is in the last shot and the climax kinda falls around him, but I think the main character is the doctor who he was partners with. He does such an amazing job acting in this movie and steals every scene he is put into. I know this movie is a film noir but it didn't feel dark enough to me. The plot just followed around a heist and people trying to scam one another but there wasn't any real darkness or betrayal in this movie, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When thieves fall out...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best noir/heist movies ever and I speak as an aficionado of both genres. Peopled with gritty, believable character it's a study in greed and broken dreams on the one hand and love and camaraderie (even amongst thieves), on the other. Of the members of the criminal gang carrying out the heist, three wind up dead and the rest get caught and go to jail ample evidence that crime indeed doesn't pay.You suspect all the characters in the film know this and never convince the viewer that they're going to get away with it, which while giving the events a fatalistic turn, only make the film more compelling to watch.The ensemble acting is great. There's no star here big enough to get their name above the title but I wouldn't change a single role or performance. If I had to highlight any of the cast, I'd have to single out Sterling Hayden as the apparently cold-hearted heavy who, mollified by the love of an I won't say good woman and a childhood dream of taking back his parents' old farmstead. There are also great turns by Sam Jaffe as the jailbird mastermind who comes up with the idea for the job, Louis Calhern as the corrupt and broke scheming lawyer approached to bank-roll the operation and of course, as the DVD cover now makes plain, although she doesn't even make the first roll of title credits, Marilyn Monroe as the latter's young mistress. She only gets about three scenes but definitely makes an impression leaving no doubt that she could wreck any happily married home she chooses! Really, however, all the playing is great, which only further reinforces the realism of the piece, these are real people in desperate situations and you believe their stories completely.Naturally it's all down to great direction from John Huston. He rarely gives us an "on the level" camera angle and often employs the device of overlapping portraits of his characters, three deep at times, as they jostle for our attention. The dialogue is sharp and natural-sounding, while the handling of the large cast and their interrelated stories are expertly handled. He's clever too in the way he shows up their peccadilloes - notably Calhern and especially Jaffe's less than wholesome interest in young girls, which ultimately leads to both their downfalls.This, in summary then, is a must-see movie, as good as any this great director ever made. More than just a crime movie, it's a superb study of the human condition from multiple viewpoints.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Heist Film Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Asphalt Jungle" (1950), directed by John Huston and starring Sterling Hayden, Louis Calhern, Sam Jaffe and a small role for Marilyn Monroe, this is a classic film noir and heist movie, and one that continues to exert its influence to this day.Based on the 1949 novel by W. R. Burnett, Huston and his co-screenwriter Ben Maddow, concoct a script that has been endlessly copied: criminal mastermind Erwin "Doc" Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe) plans and executes a daring jewel robbery with the aid of the tough Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden), getaway driver Gus Minissi (James Whitmore) and Louie Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso), a professional safecracker. The robbery is a success, but things soon spiral out of control as the devious backer and "fence" of the operation, the crooked criminal lawyer Alonzo Emmerich (Louis Calhern) seeks to betray them.The film has a harsh, pessimistic ending that echoed through to Stanley Kubrick's later "The Killing" (1956), both sharing the excellent Hayden, directed with unerring clear, cold precision by Huston. The actors too, most of them mostly seen in movies as character or supporting actors, all gleefully bite into their meaty roles and giving their all. Jaffe and Calhern in particular, are outstanding. The photography by Harold Rosson garnered a deserved Oscar nomination (the picture also got Best Director, Best Supporting Actor: Sam Jaffe and Best Screenplay nominations), all shadowy interiors and slick, dazzling night time scenes; it was unfortunate that the he was nominated in the same year as Robert Krasker's breathtaking work on Carol Reed's iconic "The Third Man" (1949), which won. This film noir is a classic in the fullest sense of the word, and one that all film buffs should watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A master criminal, German Doc Erwin Riedenschneider(..a fantastic Sam Jaffe, often puffing his cigar, highly confident in his mental capabilities, with an uncanny reserve in his preparation for the heist)enlists the aid of a "hooligan" small-time hood Dix Handley(Sterling Hayden), whose dreams of hitting a major payday betting on the horses(..so his dream of re-purchasing his family's old farm can be realized), bartender, "crooked-back" Gus Minissi(a terrific James Whitmore, whose diner "loud radio" scene when cops enter the joint asking questions is now legendary)as the driver, and Louis Ciavelli(Anthony Caruso)as the safe cracker, goes awry when it looks like their attempts at robbing a bank seem successful. Their main mistake is making a deal with crooked businessman, Alonzo Emmerich(..a sly Louis Calhern whose balance of desperation and treachery is quite impressive as the elegant, affluent world he has always known is in ruin seeking a way to remain in his class through any means possible)who is juggling bad financial decisions such as attending to the needs and desires of his high- maintenance play-pretty(Marilyn Monroe)whose young enough to be his granddaughter and an ill bedridden wife who only wants his time. Jean Hagen has a plum part as a lonely and miserable down-on-her-luck woman who becomes a quiet item with Dix, both needing someone to cling to due to a cruel world that has treated them unkindly. I've seen a ton of caper films modeled after the successful robbery that falls apart at the seems due to a ripple effects of circumstances, such as a gun hitting the floor, going off, and plugging Louis, or Emmerich's plan to kill Doc and his team and take the stolen diamonds, or the money supplier, the weaselly, weak turncoat Cobby(Marc Lawrence, wonderful as the two-faced scoundrel who sweats easily). I think the real star is director John Huston and cinematographer Harold Rosson's eye-popping B&amp;W photography and abilities to capture the fascinating faces of a first-rate cast. Jaffe's scene, where it appears he's about to get away, only to become transfixed with a "beautiful young girl" dancing to a tune on a jukebox, or Hayden's unflinching, unwavering goal to make it home to Kentucky, about bled out from a nasty bullet wound, are truly memorable set-pieces. Monroe is va-va-voom, as gorgeous and good-looking as the photography. The use of shadow/night and how characters are presented/framed, these astounding visual touches enhance the rather straight-forward plot. The complications that ensue will probably seem familiar because of how often they were used in others films in the same vein as "The Asphalt Jungle".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 110 minutes Marilyn Monroe isn't on the screen are excellent too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a merely serviceable heist caper at the fore, The Asphalt Jungle could easily be just another standard '50s noir offering: worth watching, but lacking enough original angles to make it stand apart from the glut of noir films lovers of classic black-and-whites have undoubtedly consumed. However, with some great character actors in the fold and a nice set of twists leading to the climax, this film manages to edge its way ahead of many of its contemporaries.The set-up is very simple: Sam Jaffe's Doc (who steals the show), enlists a group of skilled thugs to pull off a heist, which of course goes awry when the plan is foiled by an unexpected security officer, and gets further complicated by the scheming machinations of the caper's financier. Variations of this formula are noir keystones, but Huston injects fresh energy into his casting and execution, which elevates The Asphalt Jungle into the ranks of the better films of the genre.Of course, one of the major selling points for classic film fans is an early appearance by Marilyn Monroe, which is a bit deceptive. (If you note the stills at the top of this IMDb entry, you'll see that Monroe appears in almost all of them). However, Monroe's presence in the film is limited to a pair of scenes and nearly as few minutes, so Marilyn completists won't find much here to supply their fix. But Monroe does excel in this role, and despite her limited screen time, she is certainly breathtaking every time we see her, easily outshining her experienced co-stars by sheer magnetic personality alone. Her more-than-slightly creepy relationship with Louis Calhern's Emmerich (who appears to be about thrice her age) adds an unsettling element to his character, which actually works in the film's favor as the series of double-crosses begin to unfold.Strangely, the weakest link in the cast is the first billed. Sterling Hayden's essay of Dix, the thug with solid-brass honor and brains to match his brawn, is so flat and one-dimensional, it's surprising his name in the film wasn't "Hood # 2". I'm not very familiar with Hayden's work, but it's a bit odd that he chose to play this character so brick-faced. While I'm aware that he's supposed to be an intimidating fellow who could shut most men down with a mere glance, the detail and nuance Huston fleshes the character out with as the film goes forward reveals that there is indeed a soul beneath the stony exterior. Hayden never channels that, so even when he's waxing nostalgic about his life as a young farm boy riding horses with his grandpa, he still looks like he's thinking about punching the horse (and maybe grandpa too). To be fair, Dix's most important role in the film is as the heavy who supplies the mettle to Doc's soft-spoken demeanor, and in that capacity, he plays an excellent intimidator.The Asphalt Jungle is certainly not the best offering in the abundant classic noir mold, but it has a lot of heart, and enough clever turns to make it an excellent way to spend a rainy afternoon. Flawed, but still highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Known as the granddaddy of all heist pictures told from the criminals' perspective, "The Asphalt Jungle" is undeniably well produced; that it lacks charm is understandable, but neither can you live vicariously in its characters' lives, during the running time. Imitations add these traits in abundance, which makes "The Asphalt Jungle" seem lacking, in hindsight. What you're left with is pretty much like the reverse of the reality drama done documentary style.Sterling Hayden (as "Dix" Handley), Louis Calhern (as Alonzo D. Emmerich), and Sam Jaffe ("Doc" Riedenschneider) go to the head of the cast. Director John Huston, writer Ben Maddow, and photographer Harold Rosson excel. With a leering, heel-clicking, and unexpectedly introspective characterization, "Best Supporting Actor" nominee Jaffe is especially marvelous to watch. And, Marilyn Monroe (as Angela) adds a glinting permissiveness to the scenery.******** The Asphalt Jungle (5/23/50) John Huston ~ Sterling Hayden, Sam Jaffe, Louis Calhern, Marilyn Monroe</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been many heist films made in the last decade or so, but very few if any are as entertaining and well-done as The Asphalt Jungle. Directed by John Huston, it has a group of people all from different sections of the city, who are brought together to pull off a huge heist that they believe will get them exactly what they want. From rich to poor, every man faces the odds that they will not only be arrested but possibly even murdered. There are affairs, strained relationships, struggle for survival and dreams of a better life all discussed here, which more or less become the focal point rather than the actual heist. In Huston's mind, the heist is simply a method to achieve the goals these people desire. All in all, this is a very fine Golden Age production of Hollywood with great performances by Sterling Hayden, Jean Hagen, James Whitmore, Sam Jeffes, and a young Marilyn Monroe in a small supporting role. The writing isn't as tight as, say The Killing, but it still works on many levels and is good enough to be considered a prelude to the many rip-offs seen today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reidenschneider</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most interesting character in this film is the heist's mastermind, the newly paroled Reidenschneider. With old world urbanity and an implied first rate education, he could easily be a tenured professor at Heidelburg. But occasionally, another side of him surfaces. When he speaks of killing a cop being as being a "bad rap", and suggesting to Emmerich that he contact the insurance company for a ransom to buy back the jewelry, ( a plot point in the much later heist film "Heat"), he seems to have spent most of his life in crime. Of course , there have been many similar characters in movies, but what makes him unique is his obvious predilection for young girls. In the most memorable scene, he dallies too long at a roadhouse because he wants to watch a nubile girl jitterbugging to a jukebox, and is subsequently nabbed by the cops. This psychosexual enigma, expertly delineated by Sam Jaffe, bears a closer look as one of cinema's most intriguing characters. Contrast this character with Emmerich, the corrupt defense attorney. He too is fascinated with much younger women, but he realizes his lusts with a vapid mistress in her 20's. Hardly a unique situation, of course, but Doc's voyeurism and Emmerich's lechery both lead to their downfall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see this movie on the big screen as a double feature with The Killing. This movie deserves a 10 based on the cinematography, let alone every other aspect that made this movie near great. I don't think I have ever seen a film that tosses the dirt and grime of a big city right off the screen and into your popcorn. Sterling Hayden has to be one of the most underrated actors of the genre. All modern directors should be required to watch this movie to understand that overdone music and sound effects (absent in this movie) hurt a production rather than help it. The police procedures shown on screen were right on target for the time and place. Now to the negatives. The one thing that really diminished this movie was the effects of the Hayes Commission which ruled that the bad guys couldn't get away with it as depicted in the movie. The doctor SHOULD have gotten away. That would have been a better ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lessons for today's filmmakers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ASPHALT JUNGLE is an unusually lean and well-structured heist film, remarkable for its depth of characterization. Crime here is portrayed with a realism very unusual for Hollywood -- as a business, run by ordinary people. These thugs and crooks have loved ones and families, backstories and lives like anyone else. The writing, direction, and cast are uniformly outstanding. I've never seen a crime picture that portrayed the relationships between its characters so deeply and effectively.The film avoids traps most films of this type fall into: glamorizing the criminals or making them seem super-human. There are no diabolical geniuses here, just crooks, some smarter, some dumber. The speech at the end about the police probably draws laughs from some cynical modern viewers, but I would say it gives an enriching moral dimension to the story. The story walks a very fine line, allowing one to sympathize with the crooks' human qualities and vulnerabilities while not encouraging sympathy for their predatory activities.THE ASPHALT JUNGLE is vastly superior to the gory, nihilistic neo-noirs of today, where ruthless killers are portrayed just because -- well, because ruthless killers are "sexy" projections of our discreditable human impulse to live free of conscience, scruples, or remorse ... and because shock and blood are easy ways to keep restless audiences in their seats.The violence in the film is discreetly handled, yet much more effective than the buckets of blood directors resort to nowadays. Filmmakers in the 1950s may have wished they could portray violence more frankly, but now that the net is down, we can see explicitness doesn't make violence more realistic. The modern approach to violence actually distracts the audience from the story and characters. Either they're distracted by repulsion -- ick!, nervous laughter -- ha ha! -- or they're distracted by evaluating the special effects. How did they make that guy's face look blown-off? Prosthetics? CGI? It sounds old-fashioned to say it, but no on screen violence can match in realism what audiences imagine off-screen. I hope the current gore-fest approach will go out of fashion soon. Grand Guignol is the opposite of realism, provoking laughter more often than fright. Watching SWEENEY TODD in the theatre recently was interesting -- while the film is in no sense realistic, the over-the-top bloody scenes elicited yawns and groans from some in the hip young audience. Even hipsters seem to be growing tired of Grand Guignol at this point.This is truly a fascinating noir masterpiece and that rare thing, a genuine ensemble movie that works on every level. There is no definite protagonist, just a group of crooks who pull a daring burglary, then a group of cops who hunt them down. The protagonist is the unnamed city itself, where the police struggle endlessly to control the crooks, including the ones in their own ranks. The tone is cold and fairly bleak, but never nihilistic in the modern fashion.The ending, where Sterling Hayden dies in a field on the farm where he grew up, as curious horses sniff at him, is both predictable and unexpectedly moving. A real stroke of poetry, standing for the way we all fail to live up to our youthful dreams and the futility of the dream we all have sometimes of returning to a lost innocence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe this film isn't quite as good as Double Indemnity, but it's damn close. The Asphalt Jungle is great film noir. Sterling Hayden plays a hooligan who is part of a heist masterminded by Sam Jaffe who was just released from prison. Louis Calhern plays a corrupt backer who Jaffe gets to finance the heist. Also in the film are James Whitmore, Marilyn Monroe in a small part, and Jean Hagen as Hayden's girlfriend. It's Hayden who gets to say what I think is one of the best lines in movies: "Why don't you quit cryin' and get me some bourbon?" Directed by the great John Huston. The film looks great, the lines are great, the acting is great. You can't go wrong with this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The two things I liked most about this movie are the calm, confident lack of pretentiousness and the incredible palette of characters all played by brilliantly casted actors.Compared to some of the so-called luminaries of the genre made by ex. Orson Welles, this movie is almost demure. It really makes a minimal amount of noise for itself. Especially the heist itself, which supposedly would be the climax, takes place in an incredibly unceremonious fashion - and this I felt gave me time to enjoy both the detailed and realistic mise-en-scene and the great characters with their constantly varying facial expressions.It is very rare to see a movie with such variation in characters. They all seem to be very different from each other and none of them are stereotypical in any way. This is what really made the movie entertaining to me - it seems like, if this had been a TV series, each one would be material for a spin off :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It all started here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, the gangster movie whose bulk is the elaboration of a break-in and its consequences started here. This is the archetypal gangster film which paved the way for the forthcoming films of this league to come. "Reservoir Dogs" (1992) by Quentin Tarantino, "Face" (1997) by Antonia Bird, "Ni Pour Ni Contre (Bien Au Contraire" (2003) by Cédric Klapisch, Jean Pierre Melville's cold detective films (who used to be a great admirer of the film) owe John Huston's sparkling black diamond a great deal. This giant in American cinema left canonical works in some cinematographic genres, our present film for the detective genre, "the Maltese Falcon" (1941) for the film noir, "the Treasure of Sierra Madre" (1948) for the western. It will probably surprise some if I write that in the fifties the Young Turks of "les Cahiers Du Cinéma" excluded him from the Pantheon of the greatest filmmakers. André Bazin's protégé François Truffaut called him "a shirker"!A doctor "Doc" Riedenschneider who's just been released from prison decides to commit a break-in with the help of a bunch of ruffians and an unscrupulous lawyer Emmerich to finance the affair. In reality, he's ruined. Of course, things won't go as planned and everything will go unravel after the job. This kind of story could only seduce Huston who surely saw it as an opportunity to develop his set of themes centered on failure. Even when he makes his plans, Riedenschneider's affair is bound to fail. Apart from this, Huston shrouded his film with a sultry, sticky atmosphere. Black and white scenery help to give the film its pernicious charm. Huston perfectly succeeds in recreating a town tangled up in bribery, gangster attacks and the police has trouble to maintain law and order. I particularly enjoy the sequence when the police head in front of the journalists turns on the radios which reveal bad news revolving around gangster attacks.Needless to add that all the actors live up to their respective characters. Their delineation is so strong that they nearly count more than the plot itself. "The Asphalt Jungle" is a must-have in your DVD collection if you want to include some John Huston gems in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the one where we begin by assembling a team for a 'caper', carry out the 'caper' and then watch it all unravel. By now we've seen it done many times, notably in Le Cercle Rouge, but also along the way in The Killing (again with Sterling Hayden) and Rififfi but this one got there first. Huston was right on top of his game and the cast is one that film buffs will relish with cameos by the likes of Strother Martin and Ray Teal. The master mind is none other than Gunga Din, Sam Jaffe, who hatches a blueprint for one of those 'perfect' crimes that never are. To bankroll it he goes to lawyer Louis Calhern who has more front than the boardwalk at Atlantic City but in reality hasn't got change of a match so HE comes up with his own plan to keep the jewels boosted by Jaffe, Hayden, Anthony Caruso and James Whitmore, and light out for the territory. In your dreams, pal. Elsewhere Marilyn Monroe appears yet again in her pre-Star days and Brad Dexter is also along for the ride. Sterling Hayden, pining for his old Kentucky home and horses gets top billing and earns it. Go see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Left Handed Form of Human Endeavour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of John Huston's best pictures, this has the same lean, willowy muscularity of "The Maltese Falcon" and "Fat City", whose milieu it shares, (that of hardened men and women existing on the fringes of society), and as a heist movie is comparable to Dassin's "Rififi" and Kubrick's "The Killing". Doc Riedenschneider, 'The Professor' (Sam Jaffe), comes out of prison with a scheme for the perfect heist; all he needs is to be bankrolled. His path takes him first to the nervous, sweaty stoolie Cobby, (Marc Lawerence) and then to Emmerich, (Louis Calhern), a duplicitous lawyer known for funding such capers. But Emmerich is bankrupt and plans to double-cross the professor. Instantly we can see the downward spiral from the crime itself, (alarms that inexplicably go off), to the falling out among thieves.There isn't a wasted moment in this superbly directed, written, (adapted by Huston and Ben Maddows from the W R Burnett novel, the movie is full of the slang of the criminal underworld), photographed (by Harold Rosson), and acted film. It hinges on four superlative performances. Sterling Hayden's instinctive lug, a 'hooligan', hired for his ability to act tough in a tight situation. Sam Jaffe as the German professor, a cultured little career criminal on one last job. Louis Calhern as Emmerich, a magnificent piece of acting that he has almost certainly never bettered. Emmerich is a man who has had it all, wife, mistress, (a kittenish Marilyn Monroe), several homes and has blown them all. He is on his way out and knows it; he has nothing to lose. And best of all, perhaps, Marc Lawerence as the small-time bookie in way over his head. His performance is probably the definitive 'schmo' in crime pictures and one of the finest by a supporting actor in all of American movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huston's Classic Tale of The Asphalt Jungle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Jaffe gets out of stir after having served his time and promptly has plans for another heist. But he needs the usual men of experience: the safe-cracker, the driver, etc. Sterling Hayden, Louis Calhern, James Whitmore, Jean Hagen, and Marilyn Monroe costar in this film noir, that has been hailed as one of the best of its kind. I saw it almost 20 years ago and for some reason I remember not liking it much. Normally any story of criminals on the run come to no good (end) and there's nothing to like about them and nothing (thank goodness) to relate to. Maybe that's why I didn't like it, and I was young? But seeing it today, I recognize all the elements that come together in this story of people gone bad. After all, it's the story of people that make any movie interesting and worth watching. Instead of just taking them at face value and shooting at each other, we are allowed into their private worlds. One man speaks of his wife and little girl. One man longs for his youth and his horse, wanting to go home again. Jean Hagen is a standout as she takes in Sterling Hayden and falls in love with him. She was Oscar-nominated for "Singin' in the Rain" but I think she's just as good if not better here. Marilyn Monroe is memorable in three short scenes and holds her own against real pros. And, Sam Jaffe and Sterling Hayden are good too, but perhaps the biggest impression on the viewers is Louis Calhern, who embodies and conveys his character's eccentricities so well. He's so subdued yet so intense and desperate. He always seems to be picture perfect ? well dressed, in control, calm, when really it's bottled up. The whole production has the John Huston touch and it really packs a wallop. All the key parts are here to make this a must-see film noir. But in fact it's the story of people and choices and wrong turns that makes this transcend all other heist movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Crime Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a fast paced cat and mouse chase in which you find yourself alternately cheering for the cat and the mouse. John Huston walked an amazing tightrope balance getting sympathy for both cops and robbers. But the movie is focused on the robbers, and the unique weakness that each character has and which motivates and ultimately undoes them. Each weakness is exposed: just plain greed, seductive women, unbridled ambition, and addictions of all kinds. Sterling Hayden has a triumphant performance as the 'sociopath with a heart', and if you think that's a contradiction in terms, Mr. Hayden will have you believing the terms are synonymous. This is probably one of John Huston's most underrated film, most likely due to the lack of his usual leading man Humphrey Bogart. But the ensemble cast shines, each adding their piece to this puzzle, none overshadowing the other, with the possible exception of the imposing Hayden. A masterpiece of noir that should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Film Noir and Heist Movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fantastic crime movie and the audience, through brilliant directing by none other than John Huston, is pretty much led into backing the criminals. The cast is superb: Sterling Hayden was never better. He was a decorated war hero, and at 6' 6" could be menacing (in real life, he served as a decorated commando in Greece and Yugoslavia and really did kill people with his bare hands). Sam Jaffe won awards for his portrayal of the master criminal/planner and he is certainly good but I think Hayden has a dimension to his character that is beyond Jaffe's. Louis Calhern, usually MGM's Mr. Debonair, is also splendid as an oily and odious, double-dealing lawyer, who finances the heist. His performance here indicates that he could have provided MGM with much more, had it ever asked for more than the suave and sophisticated, debonair man he usually played. Huston does a superb job in directing him out of his usual role. Also terrific are Jean Hagen, Hayden's love interest (and it is a compelling one); Marilyn Monroe, who shows she really can act; and James Whitmore.In a sense, these "bad guys" are just caught up in the problems of the city and American civilization in the 50's ("The Asphalt Jungle"), trying to make a go of the bad cards they have been dealt and there is little difference between the "good guys" and the bad guys, especially with one cop being a rogue. Terrific, no nonsense script. This film won many major awards but Hayden never got the recognition for his performance that he deserved. He, not Jaffe, in my opinion, held the movie together, just as he physically in the movie, held Jaffe and moved the "little man" around.A great film noire; full of "dark scenes", duplicity, corruption, and wasted and unfilled dreams. Perhaps John Huston's greatest movie and that's saying a lot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Asphalt Jungle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After two misadventures with Huston's more recent films PRIZZI'S HONOR (1985, 5/10) and THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING (1975, 5/10), I turned to his earlier canons to find some redeemed compensation, THE ASPHALT JUNGLE, a Black % White film-noir, scrupulously delves into the ramifications of a bank stick-up in the 1930s depression period of America, which is executed by a slew of criminals whose ill-fated predestination will indubitably resonate after 60 years, since fortunately we haven't been evolving much and its neo-realistic aesthetics is still sitting comfily in the appreciative zone.For me, since I am oft more intrigued by the narrative arc than the comprehensive mise-en- scene a director concocts (at least in this present period), the film excels itself in founding its empathy on several well-depicted characters. Sterling Hayden, the first-billed star of the film, equivocally the leading man among the motley crew, is not the brain, but a trustworthy hooligan, suitably amplifying his simplistic kindheartedness by exposing himself to his girl friend (the moderately-used Jean Hagen) of his stroke of bad luck and his humble-but-never-realized dream (which Huston cleverly opts as the heart-rending culmination) under the veneer of his stalwart physique.Sam Jaffe, who acquired his one and only Oscar nomination (the film altogether got 4 nominations including a BEST DIRECTOR for Huston) for the role of Doc, the constantly behind- the-wall mastermind, has another sort of fatalistic empathy through his non-violent, genteel policy which is simply the otherness for a perpetrator, he is a born leader, who welds a collection of gifted offenders into a real team, the only thing he misses it luck. Louis Calhern, the paymaster and the fence, ostensibly well-off, but bankrupted, is the major mis-step of the heist, Calhern's commonly understated performance finds the right place as he is juggling between his wife and his trophy mistress (a 24-year-old Monroe, whose striking sheen cannot be overlooked even in such a minor role). The film is feasibly an agitprop of police department, although the coppers are neither over- beautified nor disparaging represented (unlike the present mockery trend), it emits a pertinent point-of-view of their functions and liabilities, Huston is the torchbearer of the American neorealism, and I hope this assertion can stand its ground.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peerless Caper Film, Too Late In The Cycle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(FULL DISCLOSURE: My parents, Communist Party members, were blacklisted out of show business in Los Angeles, where I was born ('49) and raised. The others theorize, I know: I was there, I lived it and it was very much more complex than the film school party line would have it)There was a vogue for caper-gone-wrong films mid-late 1940s,dating from THE KILLERS (1946), but since "noir" (hate that term, see my post in "POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE") only had box office legs '45-'47, this one, perhaps the best of the lot, suffered from a fatal flaw: No stars with b.o. muscle.For a late cycle film, that's the kiss of death--- I managed theaters NYC and drive-ins in Connecticut '60s-'70s, and I saw good films, exceptional extraordinary films sink like stones for that very reason. Looked at from the viewpoint of (boxoffice take/tickets sold) vs. (capacity seating-per-showing), everything snaps into sharp focus. Movies are show business, emphasis on the *business*. The only post-'47 "noirs" that earned themselves out at the box office had *stars*: CRISS CROSS, SORRY, WRONG NUMBER etc.*** *** *** The end of the "noir" cycle has been conflated with the onset of the blacklist. This is a primary error in logic---to confuse temporal and proximal similarities with actual cause &amp; effect. That there was a sharp change in American culture was true enough, but "noir" had long since run out of steam at the b.o."...the fifties were baffling, a time...without a dominant accent or form." Arthur Miller (TIMEBENDS, 1987, p.363)"Gut nationalism, all but read out of existence by both Marxist and capitalist rationalism, was now taking center stage." Arthur Miller (op.cit., p.254)As the 50s dawned, Americans were no longer "Waiting For Lefty"---they were waiting for "Ozzie And Harriet". And that's EXACTLY RIGHT: After 25 years of unremitting crisis---the Great Depression, World War II, Cold War with Communist take-over of East Europe and China and the Korean War--- Americans were sick to death of rancorous conflict and casualty lists, tribulation, privation and bloody horror. THEY'D HAD ENOUGH. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR IT. They really meant it *from the guts* when they said "If you don't like it here, move to Russia".Peace, security and yes, conformity in the sense of this was the best it had been in 25 years and what's YOUR problem? America made a choice and they chose Lucy and Ricky over the Hollywood Ten. America craved stability---a balance where the center held. Mom, the flag and apple pie---these are contemptible? I love my mom, salute the flag and devour apple pie with both hands. That makes me contemptible ? OK, I'm cool with that and I'll have another slice of apple pie, with cinnamon, please. Later it became fashionable among writers and academics of a certain type to denigrate the 1950s with dreary memoirs of alienation, hostility and loneliness---all of which was VOLUNTARY. They had no friends, no steady date, didn't go to parties or the prom, never made the team---they were losers by premeditation. For the cold fact is these misery mavens would have been miserable in the 1850s, the 1650s, the 1350s, ANY '50s. They were miserable, by definition and predisposition, because they elected to be miserable, they volunteered for a lifetime enlistment in the Misery Corps. They're the same type who are miserable in the '60s, '70s, '80s right down to today. These characters were chronic malcontents ANY TIME ANYWHERE: Raised in unprecedented comfort and security they had multiple personality disorders which made fulfillment at any level impossible, because THEY were impossible. And they LOVED it---they reveled in their self-created alienation and rejection because it validated their self-image as martyrs to the vast herd. Well, boo-hoo.The greatest 20th century president was General Eisenhower ('52-'60). What happened to make this so ? NOTHING. That's right, NOTHING: After 25 years of crisis-to-crisis existence, America luxuriated in the restful, restorative peace and undisturbed prosperity of the 1950s. THEY EARNED IT: Hundreds of thousands of moms weren't getting Mother's Day cards any more, or have sons to bake pies for. That's not a small thing, to be trivialized or lightly dismissed.And I grew up in L.A. in the '50s answering the door to the F.B.I. But my parents never tried to indoctrinate me, or turn me into a little Robespierre like some blacklistees and their kids. When the time came they didn't send me to "peace" camp or "progressive" schools. For all their Communist fervor, they were culturally conventional: they sent me to Lutheran parochial school in West L.A., and Y.M.C.A. camp.What's this to do with ASPHALT JUNGLE, you ask ? EVERYTHING since it has been turned into a launch pad for another film professor exegesis on the blacklist and how bad the '50s were---this from people who simply weren't there. The blacklist and HUAC were topics of interest to the chattering classes only, in several urban postal codes. PERIOD. I feel blessed that I was born when I was---growing up in L.A. 1950s was the best of all times to be a young boy. And I am doubly blessed to have had MY parents--- they never allowed their problems to become mine. They not only loved me, they PUT UP with me. Later on, when I went wrong for a spell, they loved me still. They were the most forgiving people I ever knew or even heard of, a forgiveness born of strength: they were not soft suckers...EXCEPT for the CP...And thereby hangs a tale: Why the CP, and why them? My mom and dad, as 1950s as Ozzie and Harriet !!!---WHY ? It took a while, but I think I've got it.TO BE CONTINUED --- in posts for other titles 1948-1958.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And all courtesy of the great John Huston in spite of the attentive dictatorial policies of The Hayes Office which oversaw all productions in this era.Huston managed to pull the whole thing off by understatement. I have seen this a few times and am more enlightened with each viewing.This is a story of a jewel heist put together by a bunch of misfits who through the film get to be understandable and even likable, though one knows they are all doomed from the get go. Sterling Hayden, in the lead by a narrow margin, is a sociopathic one note (or grunt) ex con who is incapable of feeling, one thinks, see how it treats the gorgeous Jean Hagen,but an insight into his character comes when he talks of his love of horses on the farm in which he grew up. This accounts for his addiction to the ponies today, he keeps betting and losing. And stealing to feed his habit.Sam Jaffe and Louis Calhern play gang members also and their characters are fully developed, both have a thing for younger women. Louis Calherns' "niece" ( and I can hear this nudge-nudge wink-wink subterfuge being specifically put in the movie for the Hayes Office along with a tongue-in-cheek speech made by the Police Commissioner about corrupt cops - imagine 1 in a 100 is corrupt? - hold the sirens!) In jokes to get around the restrictions.A thinner Marilyn Monroe in an early appearance lights up the screen. Star quality all the way. Even when everyone is going down she wants to know if she still gets her free trip, precious.All are worth watching however as a sympathy and compassion are developed for the little bit of back stories we get. The end is uplifting, Dix finally with his beloved horses, Emmerlich realizing he does love his bed-ridden wife. Schneider delaying his escape to watch a young girl gyrate and being captured - this scene was a little too overstated, we already got the picture with the cops staring in the window. Explicating it all was over the top. One of my few criticisms and oh yes that door in the wall when the jewellery store is broken into, right beside the hole that was created. An architectural foobar for the collection.A great front-runner for the many heist movies that were to follow. Beautiful bleak sterile black and white shots full of empty streets and an edge of desperation. 8 out of 10. A must see for the fans of The Maestro Huston and of film noirs in general.</fullReview>

I attended east it movie a lot of times. One of managing John Huston's best works. It is rare we find a written (of Ben Maddow and John Huston) as exquisite as this ? pays attention to the dialogs. In a scene, Sam Jaffe says: "The crime is a missed form of the human" effort. The characters are excellent:: Doc, mentor of the plan, only wants to contain with "key of gold" its career; Dix, a big, strong man and not very intelligent; Emmerich, experienced, intelligent subject and bad luck; Doll, the pretty and unhappy girl, despised by its dear Dix; Gus, owner of the bar, is always prepared to collaborate with its friends; commissary Hardy, an implacable policeman; Louis, an undecided criminal between the family and the crime; Angela, the lover, ignorant and faithful girl; and May, wife of Emmerich, a very ingenuous woman. The cast is correct, with prominence for veteran Sam Jaffe, Sterling Hayden with its tired face, and Louis Calhern interpreting with excellence lawyer Emmerich. I believe that Marilyn Monroe and Brad Dexter just leave the tone when compared with the rest of the cast. The wonderful illumination should be highlighted in black-and-white of Harold Rosson ? a director of photography that marked time. Perhaps the only scene that I not find very good it is the one of the policeman that is killed by the attackers when they are leaving the bank ? in the rest of the film we see the director it to demonstrate an unquestionable talent. The idyllic end, chosen by Huston, doesn't deteriorate this classic policeman, to the opposite, it only enlarges it. To see and to review always.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huston's Jungle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must take points for creativity and style away from Jules Dassin for his heist film "Rififi" (1955), since I had no idea when I first saw that movie how liberally Dassin borrowed from John Huston's "The Asphalt Jungle," released five years earlier.Not only is the heist sequence itself in "Rififi" reminiscent of the heist sequence in "Jungle," but the entire tone and theme of Dassin's film is lifted in whole from Huston's picture. "The Asphalt Jungle" stands apart from other films in the crime/thriller genre that enjoyed a boom in Hollywood's post-war years, because Huston sets out to humanize his criminals. The characters that pepper his film are not the hard-boiled smooth operators that normally appear in films of this sort, but rather are a batch of very flawed men who, for one reason or another, latch on to a big-time jewelry heist as a last resort. If I had to pick a theme for "The Asphalt Jungle," it would be the theme of middle-aged male desperation.The commentary on the DVD for this film is virtually worthless (as happens far too frequently on DVD commentary tracks, the speaker spends all of his time telling you what a great film "The Asphalt Jungle" is without ever getting around to telling you why), but one point that did strike me was the suggestion that World War II was responsible for making the transition from average citizen to underworld criminal easier, because it blurred moral boundaries, and that's definitely present in Huston's film. These guys are dads, husbands and boyfriends; they have jobs, at least one is a prominent citizen. They have people who depend on them: kids, wives, lovers. But they're also criminals, and they don't seem to have any moral qualms about being so. This more than anything is the most scathing critique "Jungle" makes about post-war American life, and it had to be a bitter and even shocking pill for audiences at the time to swallow.The film's visual style doesn't strike one as overly fancy at a first viewing, but watching it again I was struck more by Huston's mise-en-scene. The opening shots show Sterling Hayden's character walking through an unnamed Midwestern city at dawn---it literally looks bombed out and deserted, hardly a coincidence on Huston's part I'm sure. Huston is fond of claustrophobic compositions: characters' faces are frequently trapped in the frame in extreme close ups. He's also fond of depth of field; there's always some sort of background action competing for attention with what's going on in the foreground. Sometimes I think his style is a bit too grandiose and obvious, like he's trying too hard to create the kind of compositions film classes will study later on, but mostly it's a striking film.As for the acting, Sam Jaffe walked away with the film's only acting nomination granted by the Academy, playing the mastermind of the jewelry heist, but in my mind it's Louis Calhern who gives the best performance, as a high-society social figure desperately trying to hang on to his standard of living despite bankruptcy and an invalid wife. Sterling Hayden is not as good in his role as the small-time thug, though he has some sweet moments with both girlfriend Jean Hagen and Jaffe. James Whitmore shines in a small role as Hayden's friend and driver of the getaway car. There's a fascinating moment involving him, a cat and a rude customer that is just one example of how Huston adds little brush strokes of humanity and idiosyncrasy to these characters. And Marilyn Monroe has a couple of scenes, doing a horrible job with them as usual. I really admire "The Asphalt Jungle" without loving it. I always feel that way about John Huston's movies, I think because his approach to creating a visual style is ever so slightly academic---his films feel very studied. But it is a fine film, and should not be missed by anyone interested in the evolution of post-war cinema.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Along with "The Killers", TAJ is the very best noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both of these films have great set-ups and endings, crucial to successful crime noir, and also crucial slow, tense story development in the middle. The Killers was written by Ernest Hemingway and TAJ was directed by John Huston...what could be better? In both, great stars including Sterling Hayden and(the not-yet star) Marilyn Monroe, great stories, great tension build-up, and the very best chiaroscuro effect through the use of B&amp;W film in high contrast. Just outstanding visuals, also crucial to the best noir.As most know the film and the story from other reviews, I would like to briefly state what makes great noir, in my opinion. The best noirs develop story tension to an achingly painful level and sustain it throughout, even to the viewer's great discomfort, as TAJ did so well. They build the strength of the main character at the expense of the weak even as they detail the strong one's march toward inevitable destruction we all know is coming but hope against it all the same. The weak and unfortunate fall one by one by the wayside as the story progresses, giving us hope that the protagonist will prevail even if he is unredeemable but, he seldom if ever does. And, even if he does, he is typically severely damaged goods forever after and often hardly even alive, so is it really prevailing if he lives but is a mere shadow of his former and powerful self? Then, there is the "gal"....the one so good that it is hard to believe she can love a man so bad or, the one that is worse than the bad man, playing him treacherously all along for her gain only....no in-between types to confuse the issue of goodness v. badness. These films were made in the morality board days of film-making, and noir got around it in the only way they could....making strong characters very strong and weak characters very weak, and letting the character's looks and glances, but not words, carry the subtle sexual nuances that could not be pinned down as "morally bad" enough to censor. The challenge to make great films under those very oppressive circumstances make their accomplishments even that much more impressive.TAJ had all these necessary ingredients for great noir and just the right characters in it......the gal, the brain, the muscle, the weak loser crook trying to look like a big shot, the great and loyal wheel man, the double-crosser, the crooked cop, the crooked private eye, the honest cop....they all were here in spades and made for the best crime noir film made, or at least tied for the award, in my opinion.See TAJ, and see the best of the best crime noir. Also see Sterling Hayden and the great Elijah Cook in The Killing, another terrific noir caper just about as good as this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film noir, one of Huston's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film focuses around Hayden's character, but also gives a lot of time for characterization to many of the other characters. That's one area where it has a lot of charm. This film features the classic "heist" of course, but truly focuses more on the relationships of the characters, which is where it gets its "noir" aspects. Hayden and Hagen's characters have a particularly intriguing relationship. Hagen is great in a very non-"fatale" role -- more reminiscent of the characters that Claire Trevor played for many years. Calhern is at his best here, absolutely convincing us he's the type of pathetic man who would attempt a double-cross. Also features an early cameo by Marilyn Monroe, very attractive here and in a suitable role.p.s. additional comments 10/5/07:This is one of John Huston's best films, admirable for excellent performances and a nearly perfect economy of storytelling. There are many interesting angles to cover when looking at this film ? each character could almost be the star of his or her own movie, right down to minor ones like the cop Ditrich (Barry Kelley) and desperately needy but sweet glamour girl Angela (Marilyn Monroe). In fact in the end the main thing I take from this film, other than the pleasure of the heist and its tragic consequences, is this sense that each character has his or her own great weakness but also great potential, so that in the end the tragedy of the dissolving caper is heightened enormously by these contradicting motives and desires. For example I just love the resolution for Dr. Reidenschneider (Sam Jaffe), taken to prison because he spent a few extra minutes watching a teenage girl shake her hips to the jukebox. And it's absolutely delicious to watch the transition that Louis Calhern affects (as the bankroller/traitor Lon Emmerich) after his accomplice is easily dispatched by "hooligan" Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden). Hayden is thought of by many, perhaps even among his admirers, as a one-note performer. But he plays that one note so well that when the role is right, as it is here, he's absolutely the best thing in the movie. I really like his chemistry with Jean Hagen, who plays a kind of girlfriend of his. I find it intriguing how so many people dismiss him by using the word "hooligan" as a kind of generic sobriquet? also Emmerich's accomplice calls him a "hick." The only characters who treat Dix as an individual instead of a type are Doll (Hagen), Gus (James Whitemore) and Reidenschneider. It was the doctor's idea to involve Dix in the heist, and it's clear he was impressed with Dix's candor and pride when humiliated by the small-time hustler ? He sees Dix right away as someone who will not tolerate foul play and enlists him to help ensure that Emmerich will pay. The upper-class characters speak very derisively about Dix whenever he's not around, almost portraying him in an inhuman way. And then most surprising (and to me, pleasing) of all even the Police Commissioner (John McIntyre) speaks about him in a way that is totally dehumanizing. He gives a long speech towards the very end which sounds very impressive but is thoroughly stupid if you think about it ? basically the whole point of his speech is that we shouldn't complain about corrupt policemen because we'd be a lot worse off if there were no police at all. As if no middle ground exists! Huston actually subverts the direct effect of this speech by having the Commish immediately disparage Dix as a person, saying he is a "hooligan" (there's that word again) and that he has "no feelings, no emotions", something that we the audience know to be completely untrue and which is starkly contradicted by the very next scene. The amount of depth that this type of writing brings to the story is impossible to exaggerate. This film was also somewhat revolutionary in the deliberately relaxed and low-key style of the heist itself, which significantly occurs at about the half-way point in the film and is visually stylized in a way similar to silent film. Rosza's score is pretty unobtrusive throughout the bulk of the film, but even that is silenced for this memorable caper. The subversive speech by the commissioner is really not an anomaly in this film ? it's a closing statement of the film's thesis. I'm sure that some moralists in 1950 would have condemned the film for romanticizing ruthless outlaws. But this perspective would only apply to someone who thinks anything other than fire and brimstone moralizing about crime is romantic. The film does not aggrandize the criminals; it humanizes them. The prominent character flaws for each character do not act, as they do in so many "gangster" films, as a barrier to separate us from the criminal element ? in fact quite the opposite. These people are not, as the commish would have us believe, only a sum total of their violent and anti-social behavior. Nor is their crime itself the sum total or product of their personalities ? I think this is why Huston so carefully de-emphasized their emotions and desires during the heist. Most heist movies before "Asphalt Jungle" would show us the flaws in the characters and then show at the climactic heist how their weaknesses led to failure. But this film was different in that it allowed for a separation between the criminal and the crime, just as there is a difference between say a Janitor and a pile of garbage. Crime is just their job, a means to an end ("the left handed form of human endeavor," as one character aptly puts it) ? their downfall is the direct product of their human frailties, and not directly related to the crime itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic of the film noir style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most hurtful discontinuations in the history of cinema is represented by the style of 'film noir'. While this method of film-making was all the rage in the forties and fifties; it's now all but fizzled out, and all we get nowadays, if anything, is the largely inferior style of 'neo-noir'. However, it's always good to get the chance to see a true classic of the style, and that is certainly what this film is. After contributing massively to the success of the style in 1941 with the classic 'The Maltese Falcon', Huston would prove nine years later that film noir was still his sub-genre. The film is a multi-layered crime spectacle, that works as much from it's plot as it does from the motivations of it's characters. That's the way to a great crime movie - it must have enough plot to ensure that the film remains thrilling, while at the same time it must have enough character to make sure that the audience doesn't become bored. The Asphalt Jungle could be a blueprint for this idea.The film is spectacularly well put together throughout, and it aptly shows the immense talent of it's director and all of the stars. While the cast isn't made up of big names, they all perform to their best and the result is an ensemble cast that are all assured enough in what they're doing to do it well. The Asphalt Jungle is one of those great classic films that work as a result of the acting, and not because of any special effects are shocking plot developments. It's just the sort of movie that modern cinema could use more of. John Huston's direction is flawless and the story moves in a way that is constantly inventive and interesting because of this. The film noir style is most famous for it's foreboding atmosphere and dark character actions, and this entry into the style has more than it's fair share of both. The film breathes a sort of cool that is far more subtle than the cool shown by modern day directors such as Quentin Tarantino, and is much more cool for that reason. On the whole, this is a classic motion picture.</fullReview>

Sterling Hayden, who of course, I only know from Dr. Strangelove, plays such a phenomenal heavy in this movie, that this easily eclipses anything he did in Strangelove. He is part of a gang who tries to pull of heist. The people who are pulling off the heist, which includes the ever amazing Louis Calhern, all play their parts with such gusto. All the secondary parts are great too, including Jean Hagen who almost runs around the entire movie saying 'Sure Dick Sure!" This movie almost cemented John Huston's legacy, and he was just getting started. Wow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The City Under the City</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in Film Noir's heyday, films released in this style were considered B-movies. Not in this case. Fresh off his Oscar win for The Treasure of Sierra Madre, Director John Huston took the helm of The Asphalt Jungle. The budget may not have been high, but the cast; sharp dialog and film technique used by Huston is top notch.TAJ is a caper noir movie. The entire film is shot from the thieves' point of view. Sterling Hayden plays Dix Handley, a real scary bastard. When he shouts "Don't bone me!" to a bookie at the beginning of the movie you can understand why he was hired as the "muscle." Hayden is a mainstay in film noir and he's excellent here. He doesn't seem all that bright. All he seems to care about is the old ranch he grew up on back in his childhood. Between losing money on the ponies and apparently committing small crimes, he and his burger-flipping friend (played by James Whitmore) are hired to help your usual assortment of caper crooks knock over a jewelry store. The heist is great. Shot without music and in real time, Huston not only makes you feel like you're there but you feel like you've just learned how to rob a jewelry store! The great film heist in Rififi was clearly influenced by Asphalt.The movie also features an early appearance by Marilyn Monroe in just her seventh film. She never looked better.Hayden is probably best known by modern film viewers as the scary bastard of a police officer in The Godfather. Can anyone forget Hayden being shot by Michael? His gruesome face twitching while choking on blood will stay with me forever.Without a doubt, The Asphalt Jungle is a classic. I'm trying not to give away too much of the film, because it's worth the rental. TAJ inspired many heist films including Rififi, The Ladykillers, Odds Against Tomorrow and Hayden's The Killing."He hasn't got enough blood left in him to keep a chicken alive."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE ASPHALT JUNGLE is one of those films I had in the back of my mind, as a title only, for the past 50 years or so, but knew nothing about it. I just saw in on the TCM channel. At almost two hours, it is quite the gripping story. Well-acted, shot beautifully in black and white. It tells of a group of crooks who just take pulling off jobs as part of life. This was not Marilyn Monroe's first film, but it was her first role of any note, and she was already a fine actress in her early 20s. A film noir that I think is better than the much-praised CHINATOWN. some SPOILERS follow, please read no further if you want to remain surprised.Sam Jaffe plays a German who just gets out of 7 years in prison, all the while completing his plans for a big jewelery heist. He needs a safe-cracker, a driver, and a "hooligan" who is the tough guy in case a security guard or cop shows up during the heist. It is well-planned and looks like they will get away with it, but a series of little things eventually derails each one.The famous lawyer who was going to help them fence the jewelry tried to cheat them, his man was shot, cops get wise, lawyer shoots himself in his office. A guard shows up at the robbery, in a struggle his gun falls to the floor and discharges, wounding the safe-cracker, who does not recover. The driver is ratted out and ends up in jail. The German found a taxi driver to take him to Cleveland with the jewels but, during the 2 or 3 minutes he lingered at a food joint to watch a young girl dance, two cops noticed him through the window, waited, and arrested him. The "hooligan" (Sterling Hayden, in a perfect role) was wounded, finally makes it back to his home in Kentucky, collapses by the black horses in the field and dies.In the end, crime didn't pay, at least not in this case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>spoilersA serenely good heist film. The acting is first rate considering that everyone is playing stock characters and the storytelling is very sharp even though you know where it's all going. The second the safe-cracker starts fretting about his baby kid during a meeting discussing the job, you know he's gonna be the first to get it - though it's still a bit of a sad surprise when he does and his death sets up one of the best jokes in the film.As befits a noir, everyone is tainted in this film. The hero is a petty crook who's a cheap and convenient hire for gang of more ambitious thieves, `financed' by a spineless lawyer who is planning to double cross them. But Huston invests each of them with some level of honesty and vulnerability that eventually catches up with them. By contrast, the Police Commissioner is never given a moment of kindness for us to relate to. Instead he gives a gives a truly bizarre speech where he shows reporters that people to him are a squawking gibberish of numbers that come out of box when he flips a switch. Compared to that (or the spectacle of his cruel, self-righteous satisfaction arresting Emmerich and intimidating his mistress) even the sordid shootout over the briefcase seems like a deeply touching human drama, esp. when Dix cries out `Are you a man, or what? Trying to gyp and double-cross with no guts for it. What's inside of you? What's keeping you alive?' Latter in the film, a country doctor with the same near-mechanical manner as the Commissioner matter-of-factly notes that Dix hasn't got enough blood in him to keep a chicken alive. Like the Commissioner's earlier claim that Dix is a person `without human feeling or mercy,' it's obvious that the doctor's words reflect more on himself than Dix. One could go on about all the great scenes in this film, but the whole thing is so well put together. The acting is fantastic, the photography is exquisitely ominous, the pacing and direction of the story are very tight. Not sure if I prefer Asphalt Jungle to Melville's work or Dassin's `Riffifi.' Might have to see it a few more times. (It definitely makes Mann's `Heat' look too sentimental and high gloss to be sincere.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic of its kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers. I don't know if this would have the same impact on a viewer watching it for the first time on TV today because this sort of caper movie has been imitated so many times in the years since 1950. There have been a thousand variations it. And they're easy to dream up because the formula has an almost mechanical quality to it. A bunch of people of different backgrounds and personalities are thrown together to endure a common ordeal.It goes back farther than "Stagecoach," itself ripped off from De Maupassant. But what makes this special is the very neat way the changes are rung, and the way the settings and actions are illuminated. Everybody has a tragic weakness, except maybe the Police Commissioner played by John MacIntyre, a snarling self-righteous bore. (Maybe that's a weakness.) "Bear down harder" on the underworld, he orders a corrupt cop; "Bust 'em up! Tear out the phones!" Dix, the "hooligan", is played by Sterling Hayden. Whatever happened to him? He had a bit of talent but threw it away and never joined the Mt. Rushmore ranks of giant he-men like Wayne and Mitchum. I remember reading an ad he had placed in a San Francisco newspaper: "Wanted: a crew to man and woman my yacht. Come along and have a Baltic Ball. No experience necessary." Can you believe it? His autobiographical book, "Wanderer," the name of that yacht, is actually fairly well written, engrossing even. He also wrote one or two seafaring novels later in life, when his recognition quotient had already been spent. In this film, one of the burglars is a family man with a sick kid. Another is the pavid and perspiring financier and so forth. The most interesting is Sam Jaffe as Doc Riemenschneider, contintentally polite, intelligent, eminently pragmatic, just out from "behind ze valls," with a penchant for teenaged girls. When informed that his socially and politically prominent backer has just killed himself rather than be tried and jailed, he muses, "I vunder vy he did such a thing. He vouldn't have gotten more than two years." The next most interesting character is that prominent venture capitalist, Mister Emmerich, Louis Calhern, who does very nicely by the part. A financially exhausted weakling he is finally found out. (The cops beat a confession out of one of the participants -- nice touch.) Calhern is relaxing on his couch, his "niece" Marilyn Monroe curled in his lap, and he's smoking a cigarette and wearing a distracted look as the police begin pounding on his door. "Who can that be at this time of night?" asks Marilyn. "Uncle Lon, I'm afraid." Calhern doesn't even glance at her but continues puffing serenely until he rises in a leisurely way and goes to answer the destiny waiting for him on the other side of the door. There are simply too many good things about this movie to go on at length about them. I will mention one. After a brief introduction, there is a shot of a smoggy city street with a gallery on the right, starkly empty, like a de Chirico painting, everything slightly off kilter. Dix is in long shot walking towards the camera. A police car cruises slowly down a cross street and Dix moves quickly behind one of the posts and waits there until the car disappears. An adumbration of things to come, that smog, that bleak urban void. In 1950 the crooks couldn't get away with it, so they all die or wind up in jail. At the end, the bleeding Dix is again wandering off alone into the Kentucky blue grass he once called home. He dies in long shot. (Imagine that! No close up. No last words in the arms of the lady who loves him: "Looks like I sprung a leak, Baby. We'll -- we'll have to postpone that retirement to Cancun.") Instead, his beloved horses surround him and nudge his corpse curiously. This is a crime movie with four shooting deaths. Know how many shots are fired on screen? Three. Today the ordinance they'd use in filming those deaths would fill an armory, and the bodies would be reduced to shreds. This was Huston's last crime film, and he moved on to other things, but few of them were better than his effort here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Asphalt Jungle has a look and feel that epitomizes the genre. Grimy black and white, rarely does the sun make an appearance and all the principals are rotten to the core. Sure there's enough personality in the characters to make them affable and complex; but bad people doing bad things for bad reasons, for me, defines the essence of Noir. And this movie has it in spades.Houston's morality study has shades of grey that help one to understand the motivations behind criminal acts. Morality isn't simply black and white, right and wrong. These are desperate, thrill seeking people who run with a plan in hopes of solving personal problems of survival or excess; but in the end they are all losers. By running against the grain of society's mores they encounter impediments we all face in life. Some of the fault lies with original intention and intensifies as they make weak decisions that add up to nil. Everyone loses this game.Sterling Hayden makes a suberb dumb hooligan. Doc Redenschnider, the man with the plan, is crafty yet trapped by carnal vices. Emerick is the slimely lawyer you never want to meet. And Marilyn Monroe puts in quite a performance as his mistress. Even the cops are shaded in this tale. Lots of great supporting cast who portray characters from the underbelly of life.Seems everybody is crippled by something. Broken.

		<shortDescription>A Good Crime Movie From Days Gone By</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fresh out of prison a professional burglar by the name of "Erwin Riedenschneider" (Sam Jaffe) goes to see a local gambler named "Cobby" (Marc Lawrence) about setting up a heist worth over $500,000 in gold and gems from a local jewelry store. Cobby immediately sets up a meeting with a rich lawyer named "Alonzo Emmerich" (Louis Calhern) to arrange financing. What neither Dr. Riedenschneider nor Cobby realize is that Mr. Emmerich is broke and not only cannot afford to hire anybody but also cannot buy the merchandise once they bring it to him as planned. As a result Cobby hires the men necessary for the job under the assumption that Mr. Emmerich will reimburse him later and that he will also have the cash necessary to complete the transaction. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a very good jewel caper which has a sterling cast and a fine plot as well. Not only that, but having an actress like Marilyn Monroe (as "Angela Phinlay") certainly didn't hurt the scenery in any way either. In any case, I rate this movie as above average and recommend it to those who enjoy a good crime movie from days gone by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legendary actress Marilyn Monroe plays a minor role in this American heist classic directed by John Huston.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One quick look at director John Huston's career as a director would enable viewers to ascertain that "The Asphalt Jungle" was a minor work in his illustriously long cinematographic career.He is best remembered for two great successes with superstar Humphrey Bogart namely 'The Maltese Falcon' and 'The treasure of the Sierra Madre'.By virtue of being one of the most important American heist film, The Asphalt Jungle is one film which can neither be ignored nor neglected by both critics and viewers whenever one speaks about its association with John Huston.This was also the film with which legendary American actress Marilyn Monroe was associated.She plays an interesting albeit minor role as a young lady who lies in order to save her married lover from an impending prison sentence.'The Asphalt Jungle' provides simple viewing pleasure to its audiences as everything has been told in a prosaic manner.Its actors have done justice to their roles but it becomes an ordinary film as there is no scope for any intrigue. Lastly, "The Asphalt Jungle" may not be voted as the best heist film in the world but it can surely be considered best heist film ever produced by a Hollywood studio.There are not many who would protest when somebody reveals that Jules Dassin's Rififi can rightly be called one of the best heist film ever made in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jukebox fate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Huston is always worthwhile for me, and this is the second of his films that changes before my eyes, the first being my rewatch of Maltese Falcon.In both films actors get together to stage a crime story that is our film, actors in the sense of having to hide their identity from the world and often from each other. Both times the center of attention is some ritual shibboleth, a black enameled bird or here a diamond heist, merely the device, the jukebox that gathers dancers together. Falcon wasn't already a noir, though in retrospect we lump it with that group? its charm was that the actors would recognize and quote each other's role in the music.In Falcon it was a matter of shifting the view from the magician's trick to the wink of performance. Here it is the opposite, a matter of moving the eyes from how the trick is staged to the vanishing act. The heist here is the staging of that vanishing act, the opportunity for players to come together around a plan to bare themselves?one is bankrupt, another fresh out of prison wants one last job before hitting Mexico, another dreams of his father's farm in Kentucky. It matters see that an ominous pall hangs above the whole thing, an existential 'last job' before everyone can attain their idea of peace in the world.Then a gun backfires and the thing slowly falls apart before our eyes. That's when it starts to become a noir, it was not before, and actually helps throw a great deal of light into what noir actually is, not so much a style that suddenly enters the picture but a worldview that emerges in the players. This worldview is on the surface one of weary fatigue and failure, a bit deeper one of losing narrative control and succumbing to hallucination.In particular I am captivated by two scenes here with a very dreamlike air that I want to lift from the film and bring into focus, the fates reserved for the last two members of the gang.One shows the weary old conman who masterminded the story, the author, who stops on the road for one last drink, and there unexpected beauty steals into him, a young girl dancing. The girl's dance is by itself worth the entire film, a marvel?juvenile, spontaneous, naive, true.It's how he holds her in his eyes though for those brief moments by the jukebox that makes it rocket, truly one of the most ecstatic moments in film. Knowing that this whole scene is the old man's dream of Mexico that tauntingly manifests before him, a beautiful girl dancing, knowing at the same time that it reveals in him something that goes beyond sex, a more genuine truth worth staying for, which the girl embodies, the spontaneous capacity for dance that suddenly fills the room, becoming the music for the joy of it.And second is the Kentucky boy's journey back to the farm of childhood, dying on the road and suggestively slipping to that place without ever arriving. It's more simple than the other because he is a more simple soul, but it is the same evocative arriving before oneself.Noir Meter: 3/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although "The Asphalt Jungle" is considered one of the classics of film noir, it isn't always grouped with John Huston's greatest movies such as "The Maltese Falcon", "The Treasure of Sierra Madre" and "The African Queen", but it should be.Doc Riedenschneider, played by Sam Jaffe, a criminal who has masterminded many successful robberies is released from prison. He plans one last heist before retiring. However he needs funds and backing. He finds his way to Alonzo D. Emmerich played by Louis Calhern, a powerful but crooked lawyer who unbeknown to everyone is almost broke. He agrees to bankroll the plan but also schemes to double cross all involved. A web of characters is revealed including strong-arm man, Dix Handley, played by Sterling Hayden. The robbery takes place, but bad luck brings the whole enterprise undone. The weakness of many of the protagonists is exposed, but loyalty and honour is found in some surprising places.Throughout the story, the forces of law and order led by John McIntyre as Commissioner Hardy close in on the lawbreakers. But Hardy also has to deal with corruption within the ranks of the police force. "The Asphalt Jungle" has a superb script. Much of the credit for this belongs to W. R. Burnett's novel. It is surprising how much of the dialogue came straight from the book. There are slight differences in the story, but the movie is very much as Burnett wrote it. To give the film its due, the dialogue plays better than it reads, it has a pattern and rhythm that works very well on the screen, testimony to the shadings Huston and company brought to it.It would be hard to find a film with a more perfect cast. There are a number of career best performances in this film. Although Sterling Hayden was never an actor of great range, he was born to play Dix Handley. Handley is tough and dangerous but guided by a personal code of honour ? he gains sympathy as a man forced by circumstances onto a path of crime.All the characters shine in their roles but it is Louis Calhern who steals the movie. As crooked lawyer Alonzo D. Emmerich he projects power and menace on the one hand and great weakness on the other. The scene where he attempts to double cross Dix and Doc is mesmerizing as his bluster and confidence wilts under their disbelieving gaze. The betrayal of his bedridden wife is also painful to watch as he plans to flee with stolen gems and his mistress ? he feels guilt over his deceit but is too weak to stop. Sam Jaffe was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor ? he was good, but Louis Calhern was better.Marilyn Monroe in an early role gives the film added piquancy. She plays Emmerich's mistress Angela. "Consorting with a woman young enough to be his granddaughter", exhorts a disgusted Commissioner Hardy. The scene where Emmerich kisses her passionately is wince-inducing to say the least. It was a minor part for her, but she is stunning in her few scenes.With classy black and white photography, and location work instead of studio sets, "The Asphalt Jungle" is gritty and immediate. It had a big influence on crime films of the 1950's but none of its imitators ever came close to surpassing the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Primal Pursuit In The Undergrowth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sharply realized crime caper with film-noir elements. Character driven with a taut presentation is overwhelmingly underplayed by all involved. The criminal persona's are perfectly unpretentious and all shine when the spotlight is on.There is a lot of lecherous intergenerational stuff that is disturbing, yet fitting, for these hoodlum types and adds an atmosphere of primal pursuit along with the greed, double-cross, and hard-boiled nature of life in the undergrowth.An influential film that perpetuated the noir cycle while veering only slightly off the path to present an amalgamation that pure film-noir would rarely recover. It is sort of a maturation process from the raw beginnings of the genre to a more sophisticated, slick, and somewhat diluted degeneration of a style that was probably too dark for the emerging brightly lit 1950's.</fullReview>

My main observation of Asphalt Jungle is that it's probably one of the few or the ONLY movie,where MOST of the cast at one point or the other...STEALS the Film from the other actors,THAT is how Great the casting of the actors is. However,MY vote for the best "Actor Larcenist" goes to the underrated Marc Lawrence as the Nervous,Greedy,Cowardice COBBY !

		<fullReview>I think what caught my attention the most in this film was the idea of developing 6 unique characters that all hold an important roll in the film. Not only do you learn their struggles as the film goes on, but you get the feeling that the combination of these six people are what hold this film together. However Sterling Hayden does an well job at creating a very feared character. His ending scene was one of my favorites because it was as if he finally made it to his destination before he passed away. The horse range was all he wanted. This realistic, documentary-like, urban heist film has amazing cinematography where the deeper shadows help hide the night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After all, crime is only... a left-handed form of human endeavor ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is from Louis Calerhn as the crooked lawyer Alonzo D. Emmerich, aka 'Uncle Lon' for Marilyn Monroe.This sentence summarizes the very spirit that conducts thieves' actions and alone elevates caper films as probably the most defining of all the crime sub-genres: it's all about finding justifications for selfish actions. Indeed, the basis for crime is less vileness than selfishness, call it greed, personal accomplishment, money, it's always egos talking. A criminal is naturally selfish and the vileness is only the consequence of a visceral absence of empathy.This is why "honor among thieves" works as an oxymoron, honor is by essence deprived from anything money-oriented or egotistical, therefore even the most meticulously set-up and ingenuously constructed plan, is meant to fail sooner or later, a criminal can't get over his true nature, which implies the lack of honor. Take all the classic dramatic heist movies (I won't list them to avoid spoilers), they ALL fail, it's not a golden rule, but otherwise, it would contradict the very essence of crime (getting money for noble cause is hardly what motivates gangsters and thieves when they steal jewels).Now, how can this doom be such an obligatory element without providing a sense of predictability? Simply because it's never about heists, it's all about characters, Melville knew that, Kubrick did and before them, Huston. The element of failure is the only redeeming quality a criminal can afford, without it, there couldn't become sympathetic antiheroes. A gangster can only inspire by the way he tries to rise himself above his condition with morality and principles, only be betrayed by less ethical persons, villains within villain plot-wise. The big sister of failure is a notion always cherished by the film-noir genre: fatality. So, it's not surprising that the greatest caper films belong to the noir genre and that "The Asphalt Jungle" is a landmark since there is no heist film that you can't connect with it. It's not surprising either that it's precisely John Huston who introduced all the formulas of the perfect-crime-that-ultimately-fails, since most of his films dealt directly or indirectly with failures and losers: "The Maltese Falcon", "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre", "The Misfits", "The Night of the Iguana" ... Huston had a unique ability to provide an extraordinarily tragic dimension to low-life characters. Emmerich's quote foreshadows a treachery, even more saddening, because it's caused by the greed of one person, and worsened when the intermediary, Cobby, the weakling bookie played by Mark Lawrence, rats about the heist.Still, and this is what transcends "The Asphalt Jungle" into a gripping masterpiece of realism, is that it never falls in the trap of Manichaeism, Huston's writing and directing provides to each character a human touch inviting us to feel some sympathy. Emmerich is the most heart breaking because he only betrays the team by necessity not by personal greed, what's more; encouraged by a unscrupulous detective played by Brad Dexter. Emmerich is broke after having wasted money by loaning money and make a sweet kid played by Marilyn Monroe -in one of her first roles, as the doll face who'd call hum 'Uncle Lon'- feel like a man, who still 'had it', whatever it was. Her unforgettable alibi couldn't fool the cops. Unable to get his money back, and to match his reputation, he was doom. They all were.In this film so rich of distinct personalities, the one who managed to get himself an Oscar nomination, the great character actor Sam Jaffe as Erwin 'Doc' Riedenschneider, dreamed of Mexico, a paradise of sun and pretty girls, a benign and comprehensible appetite that would cause his demise. He who was the mastermind, anticipating Emmerich's double-cross and every single detail, let a small weakness cause his demise. Starting from his very choice of intermediary, Cobby as the one whose lack of honor made him put the deathblow when threatened by a corrupt officer, he resigned himself to give all the names: Louis Ciavelli, the safe-cracker (Anthony Caruso), Gus, the hunchbacked getaway driver (James Whitmore in a remarkable performance), 'Doc', and the pillar of the film: Sterling Hayden as Dix Handley.Sterling Hayden, with his gravelly voice and sensual lower-lip, embodies all the torment that can ravage the heart of a hooligan, the bad-conscience in a good heart. Heart is important because it commands love and empathy, therefore principles and honor, elements that lacked in Cobby, the snitch, who didn't even have enough love to his own self-esteem to shut his mouth. And the tragedy of men like Gus, Dix, Louis and Doc is that they were no less criminal than Cobby, Emmerich or his detective, but they somewhat conveyed the idea of 'honor among thieves', that a man should respect his word, and their doom is that we were ahead of them, anticipating the human factor.Naturally, beyond these existential undertones, the film features a long heist sequence, with no score, no special effects, and an almost documentary-like value that probably remind of Melville's "Cercle Rouge", but these ten minutes still foreshadowed the tragedy. After all the precautions taken to avoid the alarm, the explosion caused by the soup (nitro-glycerine) activated other alarms, and cause the intervention of a cop who wounded Ciavelli in an almost tragicomic way. "The Asphalt Jungle" is about a failure to come, and John Huston transcends the failure by making a film not about a heist, but about characters.Dix wanted the money to buy back the farm of horses lost by his family during the Depression in Kentucky, that's what meant to him the most ? he'll end up surrounded by horses (a scene mirrored in another Melville's masterpiece "Le Doulos"), dead while he could have escaped the Police with enough money to live with his girl (Jean Hagen). That's not bad luck, but simply the ironic expression of fatality, the stuff the greatest caper and noir films are made of ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect cast of characters...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film never ages. The theme behind works well today, the bleak city, a group of assorted criminals and fringe characters, trying to survive.James Whitmore as "Gus Minissi" is the first character we are introduced to, he runs a down and out café, helps Dix (Sterling Hayden) hide his gun when he comes in to hide after a robbery. He tells Dix to ..."watch out for the happiness boys"...(cops).The sets are believable and dreary. Sam Jaffe as "Doc Reidenschneider", a man who wants to plan his final jewel heist so he may live in Mexico to chase the pretty girls and live out his few remaining years.Louis Calhern as crooked attorney Alonzo ("Lon") Emmerich. Marilyn Monroe in a small bit part as his mistress Angela. The part of Emmerich's wife is well portrayed also by Dorothy Tree, ..."oh Lon, can't we just stay home and play casino"..., she begs him for some attention as he goes out to see his mistress, or plan yet another heist Sterling Hayden, as a guy just trying to get back to his farm in Kentucky, if he can only just get money to get back there. His father died, and his favorite coal black mare died. There is a sadness to this, the desperation. Jean Hagen as "Doll Canavan", a woman who works a cheesy clip joints just to make a dollar.Overall the characters here assemble a perfect cast. The American noir landscape at this time was stark, there was little future for any of these characters. This art of this film-making is lost.Having recently watched a noir imitation "The Black Dahlia" just reminds us how actors today cannot recreate the indelible era and feelings of the 1940's and 1950's. This is a must see, directed by John Huston. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's a matter of temperament"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All cinema, whether it be funny or serious, exciting or atmospheric, light-hearted or gritty, should be an experience of some sort, and one which draws the audience into its world. The set of stylings known as film noir are often analysed for their amoral subversiveness, their vivid and often quotable dialogue, and their chiaroscuro lighting amongst other things. However, if properly put together, a good film noir will also draw the audience into the experience of that world of loose ethics, dark interiors and overwhelming pessimism. The Asphalt Jungle is a pretty fine example.Director John Huston made quite a few of the best-known and most highly regarded film noirs, and it is in the noirs that his strengths as a director seem to shine through strongest. In The Asphalt Jungle we first encounter Sam Jaffe, a modest yet fully culpable criminal, in a narrow and dimly-lit corridor, the camera tracking along behind him. From that point on the whole visual scheme of the picture is based on narrowness and movement in depth. Almost every shot has one character looming in the foreground, while someone else is in the background, often with an open door or window behind them to give an even more distant vanishing point. This effectively presents us with both a close-up and a mid-shot simultaneously, something often done with the advantage of widescreen, but which Huston did all the time in fullscreen. The closeness of foreground and background figures and the massive depth of the image help to create this feeling of being in a tunnel. The camera is often still, with the only movement being pans and tilts. This means that, if for example the camera is at the level of someone seated, when they stand up the camera tilts back so that they appear to be standing over us. The effect is palpably disconcerting, but also gives us a feeling of being within the action, as if the characters were right in our faces and the walls were all around us.The effect that these actors have upon us is a powerful one, because they portray extremely colourful and disturbing characters, but do so in a very understated and believable manner. Sterling Hayden gives what is probably his career best, displaying menace in a way that seems very over-the-top because it is so powerful, and yet is really composed of very small gestures and inflections. The glare he gives the witness in the ID parade scene is genuinely intimidating. Louis Calhern gives a typically steady performance. As the only member of the gang not a hardened criminal, he is in some ways a gateway for the audience into empathising with the gangsters, and he neatly handles the important job of making us understand his motivations and feel his concerns. The other great player here is Sam Jaffe. It's nice to see Jaffe in a (relatively) normal and human role rather than one that takes advantage of his small and wizened appearance. He plays the heist's sophisticated mastermind with a casualness that makes him passable as an ordinary citizen, and yet the love for money and young women that drives him to darker deeds is also noticeably close to the surface.The final facet that makes The Asphalt Jungle such a compelling picture for audiences is that, despite all its pessimism, it is in fact not entirely a bombardment of cynicism. The thuggish Hayden's cherished childhood memory of horse riding, Calhern's love for his bedridden wife, James Whitmore's endurance of taunts about his disability ? these things all serve to give the picture a touch of the bittersweet. Granted, it has no true moments of happiness or peace, but it is the suggestion that these characters could have enjoyed happier lives gives The Asphalt Jungle a sense of tragedy which holds our interest and gives some meaning to the story as it unfolds before us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another John Huston Noir Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just less than ten years after helping giving birth to the film noir genre with The Maltese Falcon, John Huston crafted another masterpiece with The Asphalt Jungle and took the genre to new heights.Genius criminal Doc Erwin Riedenschneider (amusingly played by Sam Jaffe) comes out of prison and already has a plan to pull off a caper on an insurance company. He just needs a few partners and a fence. This gets him involved with two-bit hooligan Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden) and greedy, double-crossing fence Alonzo D. Emmerich (Louis Calhern).Like all John Huston movies, The Asphalt Jungle has smart plot twists, likable, rounded characters and cool dialogue. It's hard not to enjoy this movie since it seems to be trying so effortlessly to please the viewer.As an ensemble movie, the whole is bigger than the parts. But special praise is due to Sterling Hayden for his sympathetic performance as a small-time criminal who dreams of going back to his old family ranch; Sam Jaffe for playing one of the funniest and smartest criminals in cinema; and Louis Calhern for playing a ruthless fence trying to get out of bankruptcy through betrayal. Few villains are as cool as he was in this movie.Finally, Miklos Rozsa's scarcely-used (just at the start and at the end) but powerful score deserves a mention for the way it quickly sets up the atmosphere of doom the characters will soon find themselves in. It's this combination of good writing, cool performance and music that makes The Asphalt Jungle a joy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Credit where credit is due</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's give credit where credit is due: this is one of the most expertly produced classic film noirs ever made. John Huston, who got his start at no-nonsense Warner Bros. in the 1930s, had all the lavish studio resources of the MGM dream factory at hand when he made this spectacularly staged B&amp;W film in 1950. Most impressive of all is the contribution of long-time studio staff cinematographer Harold Rosson, whose deep-shadow lighting and the use of camera, particularly in low- angle looking up at the faces of the criminals framed in foreground and background, gives the film a look rarely seen before or after in this genre. The ensemble casting has often been cited: Louis Calhern, the suave and corrupt attorney; Marc Lawrence, the squeamish pock-marked bookie; Sam Jaffe, the elegant, cool-headed master-mind with a surprising flaw; Marilyn Monroe as the baby-faced mistress; Sterling Hayden as the homicidal killer with a dream; Jean Hagen as his loving but not too smart girl-friend. They are all perfect. Perhaps the unsung hero of all of this is the man least remembered, the writer W.R. Burnett whose novel was the source of Huston's screenplay with Ben Maddow. Burnett, who wrote the original book, the screenplay or both of many crime classics including this film, Scarface and High Sierra, had an amazing talent for humanizing society's criminals, managing to make us sympathize and understand the most unsavory characters. No better example of this is the character Hayden plays. This film undoubtedly influenced Stanley Kubrick--not only in the way the story is told, but in its startling photography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Made Chauvinist Male Bonding Heist Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just been paroled, a legendary burglar played by Sam Jaffe with a perfect film noir criminal mastermind's name, Doc Riedenschneider, with funding from a tragic crooked lawyer, gathers a small assembly of career street crooks in the Midwest for a big jewel heist.The film encompasses subject matter to which I am definitely partial, but it is particularly joyous for me to see because it was partially shot in my home town of Cincinnati, and there are particular shots in which I can tell that I am looking at a moving document of my city in 1950. There is even a point where I feel like I can comprehend what is just around the corner from what is being filmed.Jaffe's Doc Riedenschneider becomes a very charming character, a German man with a great penchant for seeing right through people, as he organizes this job in a very professional and steady manner. Sterling Hayden, in his usual mediocrity, plays a hardened and unhappy thug from Kentucky with gambling trouble who sees the job as a way to bankroll his dream of buying back the horse farm that he lost in the Great Depression. A hunchbacked Italian diner owner is hired as the getaway driver, Anthony Caruso plays a professional safecracker and loyal family man, and Marc Lawrence plays a bookie functioning as the mediator.In a taut 11-minute heist sequence, the criminals confidently carry out the heist in a patient and calm manner. Caruso climbs down into a manhole, pounds his way through a brick wall, climbs the basement stairs to the jewelry store, deactivates the door's alarm and lets in the other thieves, and then heads to the main safe. With care, he slides flat on his back under the electric-eye system, picks the gate's lock, drills holes into the safe's door, gingerly opens a corked bottle of nitroglycerin, and sets off a charge on the jewelry store safe. This is not all technical stuff, as the script is spiced up with some streetwise poetry, such as when they refer to the nitroglycerin as "the soup." And it takes talent to build upon a heist the way The Asphalt Jungle does. As the crooks do all of this, it seems well-planned just as Doc's arrangement of the operation is impressive, really a clever way of building his character. But, though I won't give anything away, we realize despite the thieves' mindsets of desperation and instinct after the heist goes down that these are not wise or reasonable men, or at least that is not the state of mind in which they have operated recently.On the whole, this well-made, hard-boiled crime flick is quite good, and every male character is fashioned well through the actors, script and direction. The females, however, are not granted the same justice. Jean Hagen is a silly token weakling woman for the male character with whom she is coupled to boss her around. And thus my gripe with John Huston. The Asphalt Jungle, yes, is about hardened male criminals, and it is a male bonding picture, neither of which are bad, but there's a difference between a film like The Godfather in which the women "know their place" in the depicted traditional hierarchy and film like The Asphalt Jungle in which the only female characters---Marilyn Monroe's blonde squeaky bimbo who one could say ultimately screws things up for one character, Jean Hagen's lapdog of a blindly loyal and submissive quasi-girlfriend of Sterling Hayden's and Teresa Celli, an Italian housewife who only begins to take guff from another male character---are subjugated only because the filmmakers have decided for them to be.There is great instant camaraderie between Sam Jaffe's ideological German mastermind and Sterling Hayden's compulsive Kentucky roughneck. Again, terrific depiction of male bonding, but couldn't there have at least been some depth to the female stick figures squeezed in just for the patronizing reason that the macho realm of the story seems a little dry and insulated without them? The reasons I am blaming Huston for this and not the writers are because I have not read W.R. Burnett's original novel and because Huston, as the director and co- screenwriter, he had every ability to flesh out these wasted women. Nonetheless, The Asphalt Jungle is a decent and entertaining noir that set the standards that Jules Dassin's Rififi would totally shatter only five years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong heist film gets a boost from striking use of film noir photography...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from the striking B&amp;W photography and the interesting use of shadows, THE ASPHALT JUNGLE is a surprisingly authentic heist caper for a studio like MGM to produce--a studio associated so much with the glittering musicals and lightweight romantic comedies. As directed by John Huston, it comes across as the kind of crime melodrama you might expect from a studio like Warner Bros. rather than MGM.And Huston has picked a perfect cast for all of the roles in this character-driven crime melodrama--beginning with his three top players, LOUIS CALHERN, STERLING HAYDEN and SAM JAFFE. Each delivers a forceful, completely believable performance that ranks among their best screen work. Calhern manages to inject sympathy into his characterization of a greedy man turning to crime to ward off bankruptcy; Hayden is the hooligan who dreams of returning to his country hick roots and passion for horses; and Jaffe is the extremely well organized ex-con who has an insight into people's strength and weaknesses but is eventually trapped because of his own selfish interest in a young woman that allows police time to track him down.All of them meet their fate in a series of plot turns that are fascinating to watch as the well planned heist eventually goes wrong. MARC LAWRENCE does a stand-out job as a man who sweats when he has to handle money and JEAN HAGEN does an exceptional job as Hayden's girlfriend who just wants to be with him until the end. A winsome looking MARILYN MONROE shines briefly as Calhern's mistress in a role that made fans sit up and take notice. Even at this early stage, the camera clearly loved her mixture of innocence and sexuality.The tension is sustained throughout, even though the Miklos Rozsa score is seldom underscoring the most suspenseful moments. Instead, it's the camera-work and forceful performances that hold center stage throughout and keep the crime caper riveting to watch.Summing up: One of the best heist films you're ever likely to see. It stands the test of time beautifully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fine screenplay, evocatively photographed, with excellent performances. The ending is particularly brilliant, as it doesn't sit complacently on John McIntire's law--and-order speech - it suddenly goes beyond the asphalt.I've read a comment here about lack of humour: I can't agree with that. It's full of subtle stuff, particularly in Sam Jaffe's dry observations, and Marc Lawrence's sweaty over-reactions.The film is more of a moral fable than anything else. Jaffe's character makes it very clear that he could have got away had he not given in to a certain weakness, while Sterling Hayden's character is stuck in childhood trauma. Jean Hagen is terrific - she is so obviously in love, demonstrates it in everything she does, but daren't say it in case she is pushed away.If it's dated in any respect, it is in the heist itself - the electronic eye stuff is not really credible today. But otherwise, a great credit to John Huston, very different to The Maltese Falcon, but of an equally high calibre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-made Fifties heist film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A schematic but well-made and entertaining film from John Huston. As is usual with Huston, it doesn't knock you out at any given instant but is cumulatively impressive and holds up well to repeat viewings. It's one of the few crime films written from the criminals' point of view in which the police are as interesting, individually drawn, and intelligent as the criminals. There isn't a lot of action and the details of the crime don't dominate the film. Instead room is left for setpieces that give the huge cast of characters time to talk. "Jungle" plays very much like Kazan's "Panic In the Streets," another gritty postwar crime film with a lot of talk and strong performances from a big cast of second-string players. Sam Jaffe, Louis Cahern, and Marc Lawrence are particularly good here but maybe it's the writing. Even the bit roles (like the taxi driver) are idiosyncratically written. The only part which doesn't really work is the hanger-on of a girlfriend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might very well be the best heist movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one real classic and great heist movie. It has all the typical genre elements present and a great, oh so important, dark and gritty atmosphere. This is crime/film-noir at its very best!"The Asphalt Jungle" is a quite typical heist movie with all the formulaic characters and elements present in it. I however really like the approach of this movie on its story. It provides us a view in the dark violent criminal underworld of the '50's and it chooses to not really have a main character. Instead the story focuses on all of the major players that are involved in the heist; before, during and after. It makes every plot line and character just as engaging and interesting as the other. It makes "The Asphalt Jungle" a consistently powerful crime/film-noir that is filled with all the necessary elements, such as backstabbing characters and honor amongst thieves. Combine that with a perfectly dark and gritty atmosphere and the end result is one of the most consistent and engaging heist movies ever created, if not the best of all time.The story is told really well. Instead of having only fast paced action sequences, the movie maintains a steady pace during its entire running time. It doesn't make one moment slow or the other fast, it instead is a very consistent movie that thanks to its steady pace doesn't ever have any boring or too slow moments, like often is the case with movies from the same period. Also the fact that it focuses on more than one storyline or character, makes the movie even more interesting to follow. Due to this, every event and character in the movie becomes just as interesting and engaging as the other. The formulaic screenplay is made really interesting and powerful thanks to John Huston his refreshing directing and take on the story. He makes the story look more exciting, tense and engaging than it was on paper. It makes the character introductions, the heist itself and its aftermath work all extremely well and the one just as powerful and interesting as the other. It's certainly one of the most consistently great movies I have ever seen.Like you would expect from a genre movie like this, the atmosphere plays a very important role for the movie. This particular movie does have a great atmosphere. It's deliciously dark and gritty and has some great cinematography and use of light, done by Harold Rosson, who was one of the very best cinematographers of his period. The musical score by Miklós Rózsa is also wonderful, though its unfortunately not often enough present in the movie.Film-noir's always are very straight-forward and have a certain feel of realism. The movie is not only realistic due to it's atmosphere but it's also mainly very realistic, due to its character treatment, dialog and well cast actors.The acting in this movie is great. The actors in this movie are by no means some of the greatest that ever lived but they all suite their roles extremely well. Especially Sterling Hayden as Dix Handley is fantastic. Very raw and tough. Also really well cast were Sam Jaffe, Louis Calhern and Jean Hagen. Marilyn Monroe is also really good in this movie. She doesn't play a very large role but her presence is big and impressive enough to leave a lasting impression.Impressive, realistic, gritty heist movie in typical film-noir style brilliantly directed by John Huston. An absolute must-see for the fans of the genre.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes it bothers me that people only go to the video stores to rent the Hollywood new releases. Quite often these mainstream productions are just updates, re-makes or variations of such classic originals such as the Asphalt Jungle. Asphalt Jungle is the original 'heist' movie. Tarantino saw this film before he wrote Reservoir Dogs. Hollywood ripped off Asphalt Jungle when making Deniro and Brando's mediocre heist movie 'the Score.' It only scored points for having the setting the film in Montreal.Asphalt Jungle takes the now familiar, if not cliched formula, of a single man hiring a team of organized crime members to break into a vault and swipe it's riches. However, the characters that featured are much more human and fleshed out than your modern day heist film. Sterling Hayden's character, a dim-witted yet loyal goon is particularly sweet and unforgettable. He has a certain charm that jumps out at the screen and makes the viewer root him on in the crime even though you know they'd never get away with it. That's just the way Hollywood was at the time. Asphalt Jungle is not an action thriller, just the way Hollywood has turned everything into these days. It is a tragedy filled with human characters that you actually understand. Even the rigidly German employer who has lead a lifetime of crime seems somewhat honest. In a time when Hitchcock was just beginning his campaign on suspense with films like Rebecca and Notorious, the Asphalt Jungle was the epidemy of drama, tragedy and nail biting, leather chair fidgeting, living room silencing suspense.Brilliant and honest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Doc Riedenschneider is looking to hit a big jewel heist worth $1million or more. He gets backing from rich lawyer Alonzo D. Emmerich. They get safe cracker 'box man' Louis Ciavelli, getaway driver Gus Minissi and gunman Dix Handley for the heist. However not everything goes as plan and there is no honor among thieves.This movie has some nice dialog and noir style. I wish it followed one character as the protagonist instead of so many people. It also needs some musical scoring to keep the energy up. The quietness is really noticeable and takes away some of the tension. Marilyn Monroe makes an amazing entrance all curled up on the couch. The heist is good and the double cross is even better. It needs music to drive up the tension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been tighter but is still a tough and professional heist movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being recently released from prison, Doc Riedenschneider wants to raise funds to pull off a job that he has been planning for years. Getting a small gang together with a backer to put up money and arrange for a fence is no problem and soon the job approaches. However when the time comes to pull the caper things are not what they seem; a double-cross in planned and things get messed up in the mix. Soon the gang are trying to get out from under the cops (clean and dirty) and other players.Although it will seem tame by those raised on Reservoir Dogs, Killing Zoe and similar films, Asphalt Jungle stands up today as a tough and classy heist movie. The plot is the standard "job gone wrong" fare but it is classy, patient and enjoyable. I would have liked it to be a bit shorter and slicker but it is still good, taking its time with each character to plot the collapse of the gang. Despite not being as graphic or as tight as, say, Reservoir Dogs the film is still tough and gritty. The dialogue is where it is at most of the time but the direction also helps ? lots of atmosphere in the lighting and lots of tension produced by Huston's tight direction.The cast is far from being starry but are still very impressive. The ever-underrated Hayden is typically strong although he has been better in other films. He is tough and imposing and he makes a big impact in one of the main roles. Jaffe is good and the criminals are well rounded out by Calhern, Whitmore and a few others. McIntire is good as the Commissioner but Kelley is better as the corrupt cop. Monroe has a minor role but she isn't worth tuning in for to be honest.Overall a classy and professional heist movie that has stood the test of time really well. It may not be as shocking or fast as modern versions but it is still tough and engaging. The direction is strong and the cast make up for a lack of star power by turning in strong genre performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is a crime about this film, is that it is NOT on the AFI list of the hundred greatest American films of all time. What a bunch of idiots they are to have overlooked this one. It is the best photographed noir of them all. Pound for pound I prefer its angles over Kane or anything else by even Siodmak. The Camera simply disappears in this one and never did it more beautifully. The dialogue is probably the best of its kind: also just right. Great lingo, right up there with some of the best of George V. Higgins say in the book the Friends of Eddie Coyle. But the best is Louis Calhern. Calhern should have won an Academy Award for this one. Not even nominated of course, but Edward G Robinson was never even nominated during his entire career, so what does that mean. Calhern gives the most nuanced, modulated, believable performance of a corrupt lawyer on screen: just watch him play with his mustache and smoke: he handles his cigarettes better than the best. Huston was a great, great director. Maltese Falcon was his first and one of his best, a tighter film than this, since towards the end Jungle falls off a little due to some incredibly stupid stuff that Sam Jaffe pulls that is just not like his character: but that is quibbling: this is a much more beautifully photographed film than Falcon. Huston made three great movies. Falcon, this, and Treasure of Sierra Madre.What a talent. After that he got lazy, but it didn't matter: these three early ones were some of the best things any American ever turned out, pound for pound. And Calherns performance in this one is equal to Bogarts in Falcon and his dads in Treasure. (though frankly Tim Holt was very good in Treasure, very natural performance.}Asphalt is THE miracle of Noir. Endlessly viewable. John Ford never shot a more beautiful black and white movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Asphalt Jungle is one of those movies that you don't realize just how good it is till long after the credits have rolled. Sure there are some scenes that when you are watching them you know it is classic cinema, such as the heist scene, the scene with the pedophile in the restaurant watching the young girl dance, and the final scene in the rural landscape. But the movie really settles in long after. The cumulative power of the film is impressive.I loved Marilyn Monroe in this movie. Being the naive idiot that I am, I didn't even realize it was her until I checked on IMDB. I was completely enraptured with her. Now I know what my father and grandfather were talking about all these years. She has a sexual presence unlike any other actress alive or dead. Classic.Overall, the quintessential heist flick with all that makes a good noir film great: amoral characters, bleak landscapes, claustrophobic camera angles, and women hopelessly in love with tormented men. Great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** Just released from prison after serving a seven year stretch for breaking and entering, without permission, into a Midwest bank that he and his fellow gangsters, a word he hates to be called, knocked off criminal master-mind Erwin "Doc" Riedenschneider, Sam Jaffe,is back in business planning to rob just for starters a city jewelry store's safe of a cool $500,000.00 in hot ice. Being the brains of this operation "Doc" needs three more associates to help him pull this caper off a driver the hunchback feline lover Gus, James Whitmore, a top notch safe cracker caring family man Louis Ciavelli, Anthony Caruso, and cool and level headed hit-man the sick &amp; degenerate gambler Dix Handley, played by the not so "Sterling" Sterling Hayden, to pull this all off. And not end up getting caught by the police with his pants pulled way down!The hitch to "Doc's" perfect crime in that he needs $50,000.00 in expense money to pull it all off and that's where mob lawyer or mouth-piece the "Right &amp; and not so Honorable" shyster Alonzo D. Emmerich,Louis Calhern, comes in. Alonzo is not only to provide the 50 G' s but also with his mob connections fence the jewels for as much as half of their value! There's just one big problem in all this in that "Doc" and his fellow crooks have completely overlooked. Alonzo is flat broke, on women &amp; horses, and doesn't have the cash- Much less a pot to pi** in- to get this "Perfect Crime" off the ground or on its feet. This becomes evident to "Doc" and the boys-Dix Gus &amp; Ciavelli-after the job was pulled with Ciavelli in critical condition by being shot by a security guard during the break in. With a sweaty Alonzo planning to double-cross "Doc" and the boys with the help of fellow two timing hood Bob Brannom,Brad Dexter, his plans backfires with an into tuned on to what's going on Dix blasts Brannom into the world beyond with Dix getting hit from a stray bullet from Bannom's gun as well.***SPOILERS*** It doesn't take long for the police to find Bannom's body, that Alonzo dumped into the Ohio River, and trace him back to Alonzo's pad where he spent his last hour on earth before he was iced by Dix. A now panic stricken Alonzo using his personal squeeze the clueless in what's going on Algela Phinlay, Marilyn Monroe,whom he's also her sugar daddy or Uncle Don to serve as an alibi for him in being far far away from the murder scene. Angela soon breaks down-in her facing time behind bars-and spills the beans on Uncle Don who, in seeing the light or 2 to 5 years behind bars, then excuses himself and goes into his office and , before anyone can stop him, blows his brains out!As for "Doc" he takes it on the lamb with a $100.00 cab ride to Cleveland, to attend the Republican National Convention no less, but stops at a diner to cool his heels and play the a couple of songs on the jukebox and is caught by a couple of state troopers who were tipped off that he'd be there. With Gus arrested in a police road block it's only the badly wounded Dix who's now on the loose or lamb but with him on the point of bleeding to death he doesn't have that long to go anyway. With Dix ending up driven by his girlfriend "Doll" Conovan, Jean Hagen, to his home in Kentucky blue grass country where he lives just long enough to see both the horses as well as get a whiff of the sweet and pungent smell the horse manure that he used to pitch for a living that he loved so much.</fullReview>

The Asphalt Jungle is also brilliantly scripted, very sophisticated and witty, the direction from John Huston is right on the money and the plot is gripping.

		<shortDescription>It all falls apart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marilyn Monroe lights up the screen in The Asphalt Jungle. Unfortunately she's only on the screen for around five minutes. And the rest of the film disappoints. It's a simple heist film. We see the plotting of the caper, we see the caper take place, we see the aftermath. None of this is particularly interesting. The caper is meticulously planned. All that planning doesn't make for much entertainment, you really wish the film would hurry itself along to some action. Then the action comes and just as quickly goes. The execution of the caper has its moments, there is some tension and drama. But afterwards the drama drains away as we just wait for each conspirator to meet his fate. The caper was not executed perfectly, there were some problems. And even more problems await our burglars. Their little caper seems to have fallen apart. And the movie falls apart too.For a heist film there is very little excitement to be had here. The whole thing is very dry. Sterling Hayden plays Dix, the member of the gang the film ends up focusing on most of all. And Hayden is dry as dry can be, there is no personality or life in the role. In playing Doc, who masterminds the heist, Sam Jaffe is a little more interesting. But he, like everyone else in the film, is encumbered with some rather lousy dialogue. Everything is clipped and clunky and highly unnatural. The third key player is Louis Calhern, playing a lawyer who agrees to finance the caper even though he is actually completely broke. This of course ends up causing all kinds of complications. At least this character brings Monroe into the picture, playing his young mistress. Monroe adds a little spark into the proceedings but it's not nearly enough to salvage the film. The whole last half of the film plods along with a sense of inevitability to it. It turns into a 1950s morality play, look at what happens to dastardly criminals. The one detective we meet in the film is totally corrupt. But that doesn't stop the police commissioner from late on in the film launching into a ridiculously preachy speech about how wonderful the police are. By this point in the film you might be stifling yawns. The film really drags as it heads for the finish. The Asphalt Jungle is a highly regarded film but honestly it is hard to see why. There is very little entertainment on offer in this incredibly overrated film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Huston's THE ASPHALT JUNGLE seems to have divided opinion somewhat . There's a small vocal minority who claim it's both boring and overrated while a large number of people claim it should be very high up the IMDb's top 250 movies chart . I'm somewhere in the middle . It's by no means a bad movie but other classic not dissimilar movies like WHITE HEAT aren't in the top 250 so why should this one be ? Huston has certainly hired an impressive cast with pride of place going to Sterling Hayden as Dix Handley . Most people will forever remember Hayden for his role in THE GODFATHER but everyone seems to forget that he had a very pronounced physical presence in his earlier films , unlike some actors better known for playing gangsters you certainly could believe that a Hayden character was physically able to kill someone . We also get to see an early role by Marilyn Monroe The plot itself is both exciting and intriguing once it gets going but that's the problem with every heist movie - The formuliac structure . The first third is spent introducing the characters and planning , the middle third with the robbery itself and the final third taken up with double cross , triple cross and rough justice being served and THE ASPHALT JUNGLE plays out in exactly the same manner , almost certainly better than many of the films that followed it but it's not the masterpiece many people claim it is</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am willing to try all the films in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and this was one from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director John Huston (The African Queen, The Man Who Would Be King). Basically Doc Erwin Riedenschneider (Bedknobs and Broomsticks' Oscar nominated Sam Jaffe) has been recently released from prison, and he is already planning the next great robbery in a jewellery. He begins by gathering a crack team of criminals to assist him, including tough guy Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden), bar owner and driver Gus Minissi (James Whitmore), and family man and safe-cracker Louis Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso). Then the robbery plan is put in motion starting with how things will play out on the night, and the Doc turns to financial backer Alonzo D. Emmerich (Louis Calhern) to help pay for everything they will need for the robbery. So it comes to the night, and everything goes according to plan, they manage to get away with the jewels with only one being wounded. The next day Doc wants Emmerich to buy the jewels, but he doesn't have the money to pay them, and he did try to convince them he can look after them until he can pay. Slowly each member of the robbery team are double crossing each other as the police begin their enquiries, with alibis and whereabouts not all matching, and one by one, each will be eventually caught or killed. Also starring Jean Hagen as Doll Conovan, John McIntire as Police Commissioner Hardy, Marc Lawrence as Cobby, Barry Kelley as Lt. Ditrich, Teresa Celli as Maria Ciavelli, a slowly rising Marilyn Monroe as Angela Phinlay, William 'Wee Willie' Davis as Timmons, Dorothy Tree as May Emmerich, Brad Dexter as Bob Brannom and John Maxwell as Dr. Swanson. All the performances are perfect, Jaffe stands out as the robbery mastermind, Hagen is a great husky moll, and Monroe is beautiful with her not very blonde hair and timid character, an important role for her. As for the film itself, there is enough action and some good thrills to keep you hooked, it is described as the film that inspires all heist movies, and I can see why, a great near film noir crime thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Writing, Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Cinematography and Best Screenplay. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a great example of the genre, then this is the film for you. Shot in low light, containing double-dealing crooks, and superb acting, this one is a winner.Looking at it with modern eye, you will find a lot to laugh at. The electric eye for example, was a hoot. They crawled under it, but passed things over it. Why didn't they just step over it? The dialog was another hoot. "I'm packing a heater." "i'm on the lam." Do you have the soup?" "Don't bone me!" And, of course, the police commissioner's speech at the end. Is that a requirement of the genre? Some of the greats are here: Director John Huston; Sam Jaffe, who went on to a long television career; Harold Rosson, who was nominated five times for his cinematography; Sterling Hayden, James Whitmore, and, of course, the lovely Marilyn Monroe.Super entertainment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Asphalt Jungle" invented the heist genre. However, it was certainly later outdone by both "The Killing" and "Rififi" (and years later by "Reservoir Dogs"). In my mind, its slightly overrated and a bit of a let down from John Huston. That being said, its still an entertaining crime drama with several very enjoyable performances. I guess my main problem with the film is actually John Huston. The film is more leisurely paced than his earlier works and it needs to be much slicker. The problem with making such a realistic portrait of a crime is that it can sometimes take away the entertainment value. Fortunately, his screenplay is good and has some clever dialog.The acting all around is very good also. Sterling Hayden isn't at his best here but is a suitable tough guy (hes been much worse, just see "Suddenly"). The rest of the cast is superb, especially Sam Jaffe in a delightful scene-stealing performance and the always watchable Louis Calhern, Jean Hagen (who's occasionally a bit over the top), and James Whitmore (the film needs more of him). This was also the film that gave prominence to Marilyn Monroe. I was just slightly disappointed by "The Asphalt Jungle" (it falls short of its classic status) but its still an entertaining caper film. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost in the Jungle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regarded by many as one the greatest films of its kind, it concerns a group planning a heist and having things go awry during the execution. It just is not very good. The story tends to get bogged down. The acting is uneven. Huston was a competent director who lucked into making a couple of great movies but who did not have the talent to rise above an uninteresting screenplay such as this. This film can't hold a candle to a couple of other heist films from the 1950s: "Rififi" and "The Killing," in which Kubrick managed to get a much better performance out of Sterling Hayden than what Huston does here. At least we get to see Marilyn Monroe in one of her earliest roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely agree with Mark Cousins, but he once compared John Huston unfavourably with Howard Hawks, suggesting he would never include a scene like Lauren Bacall's wiggle in 'To Have and Have Not'. Watching 'The Asphalt Jungle', you can see his point. 'Jungle' is a perfect film - form brilliantly serves content, as Huston creates a bleak urban environment where all humanity is ironed out, and sleazy violence is the norm: a modern Inferno, where existence is a sterile rondelay of torment. But as Truffaut once said of Renoir, flawed films are often more satisfying than perfect ones - Huston's deterministic vision is narrow and narrowly expressed. 'Jungle' is vitally important, however, as the source of all Jean-Pierre Melville's towering gangster films - Melville borrows everything from his master (scenes, images, character, motifs, clothes), yet always surpasses him - he recognises life is more complex than Huston's schema will ever allow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is listed as a Noir by IMDb which I found very disappointing, though this film is filmed between 45 and 55 and deals with tough characters, and even a double cross, it is NOT film noir. This is a heist film, and a good heist film to watch if you like heist films. Upon watching this film I was surprised how similar Michaels Mann's Heat was to this film. If you liked Heat then I strongly recommend watching this title, if you like noir then watch Sunset Blvd, the Killing, the Grifters, or Memento. I may have enjoyed this picture more had I not been lead to expect a noir by IMDb. ten lines...
