		<shortDescription>Powerful landmark film on alcoholism has lost none of its status...Ray Milland deserved his Oscar...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I take exception to previous comments that call the film "daring for its time" or "dated". It's still a very powerful film and there is nothing dated about the theme of a man who loses his soul to the bottle. It was a landmark film in its time and still is--there is no question about its holding power and the excellence of writing, acting and direction. Yes, even by today's standards! It outclasses more recent films dealing with alcoholism as it focuses on one man's problem with the bottle--a problem that affects all of the people whose lives he touches--particularly his loyal girlfriend (Jane Wyman in one of her best roles) and Philip Terry as his more conventional brother. The emotions are stark and real. The pity we feel for Milland's character is also mixed with disgust for his weakness. It's an accurate depiction of an alcoholic's struggle for the next fix--a never ending search for the next bottle. The pseudo-babble of a previous commentator attempts to inject disdain for the film as outdated and outclassed by more serious works. Nonsense! This was a stark and powerful film in 1945 and I have news for you--it is just as powerful and timely today! No other American film comes close to it. It is as searing an indictment of alcoholism as you are ever likely to see and Milland fully deserved his Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad end to the life of author Charles Jackson (The Lost Weekend)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1968, I was just 22 years old and driving a taxi part-time in Ft. Lee, New Jersey. One day, I drove Charles Jackson (author of "The Lost Weekend") from Englewood Cliffs, NJ to a run-down hotel in Times Square, New York City. I had seen and really liked the movie of the same name, starring Ray Milland, who did a wonderful job portraying an alcoholic on a weekend binge. The film was so realistic, I had a strong feeling that Charles Jackson had written the book based on his own life. I got up the nerve to ask him, and he told me that....yes, he indeed was the alcoholic portrayed in his book. We talked quite a bit about his life on the way into Times Square. He seemed like a very nice person, although he seemed quite depressed. However, it still came as quite a shock when, shortly after having him in my cab, I read in the papers that he had hung himself in his hotel room in NYC. That's an experience I will never forget!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Textbook drama about addiction powerfully told...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first shot of a bottle hanging from a drunk's apartment, we realize we are about to see a clever addict and a weekend of his demented exploits. Ray Milland has an honest face, not unlike Jimmy Stewart's, however, with this character it is only skin-deep. The great thing about his performance and the film as a whole, is that his face will gradually change, becoming dark and chilly, just like Stewart's in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. Stewart had lost his life momentarily. Milland has lost his soul to the bottle and he will stop at nothing to quench his thirst.This really is a textbook example of the alcoholic's lies and schemes, a precursor to LEAVING LAS VEGAS, although there are people in this film who care about the drinker from the beginning. He just can't stop and we start to lose whatever sympathy we had for him because of how he treats other people. This is a drunk with a sober man wanting to come out, but Wilder's script dives deeply into the unpredictable outcomes of most alcoholics.LOST WEEKEND was innovative and was almost never released because test audiences could not take the film's realism. The hospital sequence retains its horror, and Milland's withdrawal-induced hallucination of a rat in the wall was like him looking in the mirror. See this movie and you will come away with a completely informed and scary anthology of the antics of a hopeless alcoholic. This is amazing considering it came out of the old Hollywood system.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seedy bars, pawnshops, and an array of elaborate hiding places are the overriding images from this film. The Lost Weekend is a grimly realistic account of four days in the life of a chronic alcoholic, played by Ray Milland. In films of this quality one always takes away unforgettable images. The most striking is Milland's drunken efforts to remember where in his apartment the last hiding place he used is. Degraded and thoroughly beaten by his addiction, his last refuge is to try and keep it a secret from those who still love him. Billy Wilder's direction and script is brilliant - sympathetic, but unpatronising in his handling of a delicate and rarely dealt with affliction. Not until Nicolas Cage's portrayal of a man determined to drink himself to death in Leaving Las Vegas, has alcoholism been dealt with so well. Milland's performance is first rate - no hammy shlurring of words - and the atmosphere is dark and seedy like the bars he frequents. The scene where he spends several hours trying to find an open pawnshop on a public holiday is both harrowing and dazzling - it is remeniscent of the filmic image of a parched man trying to cross the desert.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Days of wine and Four Roses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American cinema can count itself lucky with the wave of arrival of the best European talent in the days prior to World War II. Among the most distinguished directors that came to Hollywood was Billy Wilder who left a legacy, not only as a director, but in the many screen plays he wrote. One of his great works was "The Lost Week-end". Written with Charles Brackett, one of his most frequent collaborators, this is a film that dared to talk about a thing that no one dared to speak before: alcoholism.If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading now.On the opening scene of the picture we watch Don Birman, and his brother Wick packing suitcases for a long weekend in the country. We realize not everything is all right as we watch a bottle tied with a piece of string hanging out of a window. It's clear to see what was wrong with that picture, Don is an alcoholic! Wick, having enough common sense, wants to keep his brother near him, in order to control the situation.Things get complicated with the arrival of Helen, the woman in love with Don. Helen St. James has been in a relationship with Don that has gone nowhere because of his drinking problem. Helen, as well as Wick, don't have the courage to have him committed to have him cured of his addiction. In fact, both are to blame about the condition affecting Don, but neither realize how deep is the problem. In 1945 themes involving addiction were never told to the movie going public. Alcoholism was a vice that affected a lot of people in the country, but those were the days where people with drinking problems stayed in the closet, not daring to recognize how their lives were being ruined by the heavy use of alcohol.We watch in horror as Don spends a weekend in hell going from one scheme to the next trying to get money to support his nasty habit. We also see Don Birman experience the worst night of his life when he is taken to a hospital, after falling down from a staircase. There, he sees first hand the horrors his addictions will bring to him. In a way, the exposure to the men in the hospital is a wake up call for Don, who decides to end it all because drinking has taken over his life. The movie should be seen by anyone suffering from this terrible social disease. Ray Milland transforms himself into this troubled man. He gives an incredible performance. Mr. Milland has to be given credit in undertaking the portrayal of this lost soul in such a convincing fashion. By Hollywood standards, Ray Milland, an actor better known for his work in comedies, transforms himself into this Don Birman. The supporting cast was excellent as well. Jane Wyman as Helen St. James is seen in one of her better roles of her career. Phillip Terry, as Wick, the kind brother is also good. Howard DaSilva, the bartender Nat, makes an impressive appearance in the film. Doris Dowling, as Gloria the friendly prostitute is equally effective.Of course, this is a movie that shows Billy Wilder at his best. By filming on location in Manhattan, a rich texture is added. From Nat's bar we can watch the trams that circulated on Third Ave. at that time, as well as the 3rd. Av. El. The excellent black and white cinematography of John Seitz looks as good today, as it must have looked in 1945, when the film was released. The music score by the great Milos Rozsa is haunting without being too obvious.This is, without a doubt, one of Billy Wilder's best movies, one that endures the passing of time. Mr. Wilder dared to speak out loud about something no one wanted to talk about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is on my list of 50 best of all time....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script and score are superb and the acting flawless. Ray Milland is riveting in the role of a man who is as consumed by alcohol as it is consuming him. He lives and breathes for it and all around him become secondary including his long suffering girlfriend.There is always a girl like this in the life of a good looking useless purposeless alcoholic kept afloat by either a wife or other family member, in this case a brother who pays the bills and tries to sober him up and dry him out periodically.The score is relentless and highly avant Gard for its time, featuring music normally backing sci-fi flicks. Some of the scenes are profoundly frightening, his stay in the drunk tank with a sadistic feminine male nurse outlining all the horrors that await him and his DTs which feature a bat biting the head off a bird.Very well done. I felt the ending was a little too pat, that would be my only fault with this.9 out of 10. Excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Before 'Weekend', alcoholism was treated as something funny. There were character actors who only played drunks, and always for laughs.There's nothing funny about a drunk."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The often stated belief that alcoholism is a mere bodily addiction does not do the truth any justice. Alcoholism is more. It's a state of mind. It's addictive escapism for those who feel cheated by life, a way of avoiding fears and unhappiness, an illusionary method to make up for ones failures. Maybe that's why most therapies do not succeed. They solely concentrate on the illness, rather than on the cause of it. Of course, in many cases the cause cannot be helped...In The Lost Weekend we accompany the failed writer Don Birnam (Ray Milland) surrendering to the self-destructive nature of his addiction. Despite being good-looking and intelligent, Don is a hopeless alcoholic filled with self-loathing ("The reason is me. What I am. Or rather what I am not.") The brand doesn't matter, the cheaper the better ? to him it's all the same. Drinking seems to be his only way to escape from his misery and low self-esteem. "Suddenly I'm above the ordinary. I'm competent. I'm walking a tightrope over Niagara Falls. I'm one of the great ones. I'm Michaelangelo, molding the beard of Moses. I'm Van Gogh painting pure sunlight. [...]" That's what a drunk Don tells his favourite barkeeper Nat (Howard Da Silva).Yet, in one aspect he is lucky. Unlike many of his fellow sufferers he is not alone. After years of abuse, his faithful girlfriend Helen (Jane Wyman) and his brother Wick (Phillip Terry) have still not deserted him. Compassionately they do their utmost to protect Don from himself by keeping him under close observation. With great effort they determined the most inventive hiding-places of his bottles and they even visited nearby liquor stores and bars, begging not to accept Don as a customer. There is nothing they haven't tried, but Don appears to be beyond salvation ("I am not a drinker. I'm a drunk." he tells them.). Just before the three of them are about to go on a weekend trip, Don devises a cunning plan to temporarily get rid of the two persons who care about him, giving him time to acquire the liquid he treasures the most. Soon he is stone drunk, staggering through the streets, always on the lookout for the next drink. For Don there will be no weekend trip. Only the bottle and the desperate humiliations connected with attaining it.The Lost Weekend is a a drama of great emotional vehemence, lacking the light heartedness of Billy Wilder's later works. It gives unclouded insight into the darkest corners of alcoholism and depicts the powerlessness of the alcoholic over himself. Wilder created great controversy at that time by letting the lead actor succumb to his addiction. He didn't shy away from showing the addict's humiliations when begging for money or booze. Neither did he hesitate to point out the addict's loss of all self-respect when stealing and lying to pay for his one need. The horrifying hallucination scene only adds up to the disturbing decline of Don Birnam's humanity, proving that the greatest horrors lie within our imagination.This is an excellent film of lasting relevance. It is technically brilliant and shines with great dialogue (which is typical for Wilder). Its storytelling (flashbacks) is superior. Furthermore Ray Millard (Dial M for Murder) gives a terrific and equally courageous performance as the the self-destructive alcoholic. You can see the desperate self-loathing and calculating slyness of a true addict written on his face. In the end it comes down to two choices. Don can give in to alcoholism and thereby give up on life. Or he can try to overcome his addiction and face his fears and discontentment. Although sheer will-power may not be enough to achieve the latter, it is essential for succeeding. And the cause isn't lost, for there is Helen to help and care for him. Don is not alone. May someone have mercy on those who are...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Risk-Taking Film-Making at Its Finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Uncompromising, dark and definitely disturbing Best Picture Oscar winner from 1945 that deals with a writer's (Ray Milland in one of the very best performances ever shown on the silver which deservedly landed him his only Oscar) alcoholism and the effects that his problem has on himself, his work and those closest to him. The love of his life (Jane Wyman) and his very supportive brother (Phillip Terry) try to save Milland from a habit that has gotten terribly out-of-hand. Heart-wrenching flashbacks into Milland's demise are sometimes difficult sequences to get through. In the end it is not a sure thing if Milland can distance himself from his disease and return to a normal life. Billy Wilder's uncompromising direction and screenplay yielded him Oscars in this film that scared many studios away in the early-1940s due to its intense subject matter and the question of whether the film could create interest. Made during a time when patriotic movies and romantic comedic farces dominated the cinema, "The Lost Weekend" was truly unlike anything ever experienced before. A very well-made production that is first class all the way. A real classic in every sense of the term. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective, Sobering Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very sobering story, pun somewhat intended but not to make light of a serious problem. Stories about alcoholism can be really depressing but I found this simply a fascinating account of what an alcoholic goes through. I doubt if any film since this as been as effective in telling its sordid story, but not in a sordid manner.The acting is excellent, led by Ray Milland's performance and complemented by memorable supporting turns by Howard da Silva, Doris Dowling, Frank Faylen, Phillip Terry and Jane Wyman.I particularly enjoyed the characters played by Faylen, da Silva and Dowling. Faylen had only one scene, but it's a beauty. As a hospital aide, he gives Milland a short but riveting speech that still haunts me when I recall it. Dowling served up some great film noir-type dialog and was a sexy woman, at least in this picture, and da Silva was perfect as the bartender.This is an involving story and has a few spots with some good cinematography, too. Another plus is the fact that it doesn't appear dated even though it is 60 years old. How many films can say that? The only flaw, I thought, was the ending. Anyone has hooked on booze to the degree Milland was in this film, would not be able to just quit like that....but happy-ending movies are usually what work. Speaking of happy, what man wouldn't want a woman as loyal and supportive as Wyman's character was in here? In an age in which commitment and loyalty are not considered valuable character traits as they used to be, she was inspiring to watchI hope this film's reputation encourages a few people who need to see and hear this message, to take a look. They don't have to worry about a boring, heavy- handed message. This is just plain interesting and always entertaining. It earned all the awards it received.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once Upon A Time There Was A Bat And A Mouse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Weekend for 1945 was a pretty grim and realistic look at the problem of alcoholism. We've seen some pretty good films since like I'll Cry Tomorrow right up to Barfly, but The Lost Weekend still has the power to hold the audiences attention 61 years after it came out.It was a breakthrough film for its star Ray Milland. Previously someone who had done light leading man roles, Milland plumbed some real hidden demons in the role of Don Birnam. A guy much like the characters Ray Milland played on screen, Birnam is a charming fellow and would be writer who can't leave the alcohol alone.Billy Wilder was going to originally cast an unknown character actor in the lead role. However Paramount producer Buddy DeSylva said that in this part you wanted a likable leading man so the audiences had a rooting interest. Wilder who usually did not suffer interference from the front office with any grace, took DeSylva's advice and got Ray Milland with whom he'd worked with in The Major and the Minor.Milland prepared for this part by spending a couple of nights in an alcoholic ward. Certainly showed in his performance. You will not forget Milland and his reaction to seeing the bat and the mouse while in delirium tremors.Jane Wyman was Wilder's third choice after not getting Katharine Hepburn or Jean Arthur. She came over to Paramount from Warner Brothers on a loan out and got her first really good notices for a serious acting role as Milland's long suffering girl friend.A recent biography of Billy Wilder said that The Lost Weekend was timed perfectly for an audience that swelled up with returning servicemen some of whom developed alcoholic problems after being through the horror of a World War. After being panned in previews with a little editing it opened to rave reviews on release.It did good at the box office too and it won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor for Milland, Best Screenplay for Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett and Best Director for Wilder. After this triumph Wilder and Brackett both had their pick of good film properties.I'm surprised that someone like Robert DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman or Al Pacino has never tried to remake this one. Seems like just the kind of film for them.Milland's character is a writer and a key sequence is when he attempts to pawn his typewriter for a bottle of booze. Can you imagine doing that today with a laptop computer which is not only the tool he uses, but also has a memory of all the attempts the protagonist has made to write. Might even be more powerful today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more than just a simple "message" movie, Wilder tries to make addiction as human a crisis as possible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although in some respects some of the conditions and dialog from the Lost Weekend have become dated, the performances and the ideas behind it- plus the heightened style of it- make it work many years down the line. Oscar winning director Billy Wilder makes Don Birnem's struggle something that is unmistakable, especially if you've been around these kinds of people. Most of us have seen the drunk at the end of the bar with grandiose ideas and romanticized visions amid that need (nevermind enjoyment) of the booze. But the film is successful if only because it makes this obsession with the flailing writer Don as his major internal conflict, and that it goes deeper to something that is in many of us, even if we don't drink.Basically, Don wants to get off alcohol so he can write his great book. Despite some advice from the "friendly enemy" (as I would call one) local bartender, and the girl Gloria, there is little hope for him it seems. He goes on a four-day bender, looking frantically all over the apartment when it's not in easy reach. This all leads up to going clean, which involves a truly paranoid-filmed sequence by Wilder (one of his very best).It is almost all harrowing drama, and only in the minute moments when Don is completely unsympathetic does the film lose some of its momentum. But really, the film is as much about the psychology of this man, of the writer in desperation (though never wanting to admit it), and Ray Milland's performance (at least for the time) was daring enough to show as much as could be shown at the time. The film probes just enough into the subject matter to not become very preachy (I don't think Wilder's message is to never drink ever as much as one of keeping control of one's life and system), and at the core is just entertaining drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***** SPOILER IN FIFTH PARAGRAPH ***** It's hard to imagine what people must have thought upon seeing this movie in 1945, depictions of alcoholism are so prevalent in our media today that it's practically a brand name. We have serious drunks, comical drunks, pathetic drunks, and all manner of drunks in-between. In many ways we may have progressed but I'm not sure I've ever seen a movie that treats alcoholism with the honesty it gets here.But The Lost Weekend isn't just a message movie, it's superbly crafted as well, easily the equal of Billy Wilder's other films (Double Indemnity, Sunset Blvd., Stalag 17, Sabrina, etc.). According to the production notes Wilder read the novel by Charles R. Jackson and took it upon himself to convince his producers to let him make the film, knowing it would be a hit and win the leading man an Oscar. That's vision coupled with uncanny film-making skill.Ray Milland never gave a finer performance, the progression of his character throughout the movie is extraordinary and a lesser actor simply wouldn't have been able to pull it off. I doubt he was Hollywood's first alcoholic would-be writer, but he certainly raised the bar for the many who'd follow in his footsteps. He never once resorts to stereotypical "drunk" stock-character. His eye movements and high-flown, self-delusional, speeches alone make the film worth watching.While this film is imminently deserving of the four major Oscars it scooped up (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor) it didn't win for Best Cinematography, which is a shame. John F. Seitz's black-and-white cinematography is a visual feast. Seitz was nominated for the Oscar seven times between 1930 and 1955 (including four Wilder pictures) but regrettably never won. In all he was the principal cinematographer for 159 films, including such other classics such as: Sullivan's Travels, This Gun for Hire, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, The Big Clock, Night Has A Thousand Eyes, and When Worlds Collide.***** DANGER! SPOILER AHEAD! ***** I'm not nearly so optimistic about Don's recovery as most other reviewers seem to be. Overtly the the Hollywood ending is all there; Don drops a cigarette into a glass of whiskey, he and Helen have the big kiss, he sits down to finally crank out his big book. Call it pessimism but I think it's all tied up so neatly that it can't help but unravel for him five minutes after the cameras leave. I see plenty of potential for more weekends just like this one, and I think that's the way Wilder wanted it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you've experienced addiction, you know this movie's true</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very first shot of a bottle dangling from a window, to the last shots of a (hallucinated) bat eating a mouse (with accompanying blood running down the wall, one of the most gruesome and horrifying things I've ever seen on film, and we're talking 1945 here!), TLW is as dark as it gets - and, happily, as smart as it gets, too. But this IS a Billy Wilder film, so dark/smart, though appreciated, aren't that much of a surprise.This is one of those beautiful movies where everything makes sense, from the Academy Awards it received to the well-deserved mantle it rests upon in movie history. And it's not pretty, not in the slightest, dealing as it does in alcoholism's terrifying DTs, as well as basic addiction's I-can't-shake-you-I-can-only-think-of-you whiskey/heroin/cocaine/cigarettes (merely plug the drug of choice into the movie's template and you have flaming, righteous addict's Hell for your spellbound perusal). I was fascinated by the fact that TLW operates as a kind of corrective to the typical 20s, 30s and 40s depiction of alcohol as social lubricant - you know, "Hey, how's it going, glad you could come by, want a drink?" And that could be at noon, 3 in the afternoon, whenever...sometimes, even the morning. TLW grabs you by throat and drags you through the gutter with Ray Milland, stooping to the lowest human levels imaginable to wet his lips and come alive - and it's there, in the fleshing-out of the addict's "coming alive, feeling great" post-drug-use bliss-begotten rush, that TLW really gets it, and I say that as someone who knows. The detail of Milland being a writer who doesn't write, and who can't even THINK of writing before liquor's in his system, is spot-on, absolutely true. It truly gives the lie to the romantic ideal of, say, Raymond Chandler, or the myth of the alcoholic writer in general. Many, many, many writers have shriveled their livers via Milland's character's route, and the fact they may have been more prolific and functional doesn't really matter, once said livers are analyzed...really, pretty sad.See this movie. Own it. It's crucial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Up to THE LOST WEEKEND, Billy Wilder was a talented script writer from Austria, who had done (after some noise and badgering) several movies that he and Charles Brackett wrote the scripts for, but the way he felt they were intended. So Paramount let him go ahead and produce and direct their own films, and he proved the studio was wise to do so.By 1945 Wilder had done a wacky comedy, THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR about a military academy. The film was a box office success. It was followed by FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO, which gave a fictional account of the war in North Africa, and gave a stunningly good performance by Eric Von Stroheim as General Erwin Rommel. But Wilder and Brackett wanted to tackle a "message" picture. They found one in the best selling novel THE LOST WEEKEND by Charles Jackson. It tackled the issue of alcoholism. Alcoholism had actually been noted in motion pictures almost from the start, usually in comedies where a character (possibly the star, like Chaplin in ONE A.M.) would do his or her business while tanked. The 19th Century drama, THE DRUNKARD, was used by W.C. Fields in THE OLD FASHIONED WAY as the play Fields' troop is putting on. Another version of THE DRUNKARD was made into a full movie in 1940 called THE VILLAIN STILL PURSUES HER, with Alan Mowbray and Buster Keaton. Now and then a more serious problem would be shown. D.W.Griffith made his last film in 1931 about alcoholism, THE STRUGGLE (which was a flop). In SADIE MCGEE, Joan Crawford marries Edward Arnold who is an alcoholic (she eventually helps on this problem). Aside from Griffith's flop nobody made a serious film about the disease. Wilder and Brackett turned in a good screenplay that did just that.Don Birnan is a young man who claims to be a writer, but has published very little. Three people are aware of his weakness: Don's older brother Wic, the local bartender Nat, and Don's girlfriend Helen.The crisis occurs the last weekend of the summer. Don is to go with Wic and work on his novel. But he disappears when he is supposed to be ready to leave. Wic has rearranged his own life for Don and is fed up. He leaves to go to the country house alone. He tells Helen not to waste her own life with Don, as Don is so far gone that he is not worth it. Helen (more troubled than Wic) does make herself scarce too. So Don, when he gets home, finds that he is really all alone on that long weekend. Well not totally alone - he's inventive, our Don. He hides bottles of liquor all over the house (the old joke about the whiskey bottle hidden in a chandelier comes from this film). Wic does try to find the hiding places, but Don comes up with new ones (including suspending a bottle from a window by a string. However even this is of little use, as Don's demons drive him deeper and deeper into drinking. He has little money left, and soon is out of credit at Nat's (who hates to give him credit for drink because it's harmful to Don). He even steals a purse at one point. He tries to hock his typewriter. All for the money for a drink. And then he ends up in Bellevue's "Drunk Tank" where he meets the cynical nurse Bim, who has heard all the remorseful stories of reform from Don and his ilk forever.There is far more to the screenplay than this synopsis suggests. Don's behavior is centered only on getting the sauce into him - and he does not care who is "inconvenienced" along the way, so that he finds himself quite isolated by the conclusion of the film. The movie's ending is hopeful, but just vaguely that. Somehow Don is such a weak character we can not be sure if he will ever turn his life around again.Wilder used Ray Milland in this film, and it is usually pointed out that Milland was normally in comedies like EASY LIVING, SKYLARK, or Wilder's own THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR. But he had played serious parts, most notably in BEAU GESTE, I WANTED WINGS, and (more recently) THE MINISTRY OF FEAR and THE UNINVITED. But Don Birnan was the first three dimensional figure he tackled, and he did splendidly in it. His Oscar guaranteed a decade of stardom, and a really interesting career afterward in directing and character parts. Jane Wyman plays Helen as a character who struggles to recall the man she loves up to the conclusion of the film - his weakness constantly threatening the relationship. Philip Terry's Wic is equally good, putting on the best face possible, until the straw breaks the camel's back. As Bim, Frank Faylen is understandably fed up with his ward charges at Bellevue - all claiming they aren't ill, but quite evidently recurring so. And Howard Da Silva, normally playing villains in the 1940s, played the understanding Nat as harsh but compassionate - he wants Don to straighten up and write as he claims he can. How real is the story here? There is an anecdote that Milland mentions in WILD EYED IN BABYLON, where he and Da Silva were in the set of the bar rehearsing a scene. They were interrupted by a bowler hatted little man with a familiar face, who came in and ordered a shot of whiskey. He paid for it, gulped it down before the two actors, and left the bar. They watched him go and did not say a word. It was Robert Benchley, working on another picture at Paramount at the next set. And Benchley had his own alcohol problems too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder's lost film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people talk about Billy Wilder, it's always films like Sunset Blvd, Double Indemnity and The Apartment that get the praise. There is a good reason for this, as these films are out and out masterpieces; but The Lost Weekend is at least on par with them. The Lost Weekend is a film about addiction and it's tribulations; shown through the story of an alcoholic. Through a fantastic screenplay, Wilder is able to make the audience feel all the stress and pain of the central characters; which makes for a very powerful film to watch. It's even uncomfortable at times. Wilder presents the central character of Don Birnam as a likable character; he's a talented writer and he comes across as being funny and charismatic, the only problem is that he has a drink problem, and the problem consumes him. The character is flawed, but he's not flawed due to his personality; the flaw is in the addiction, and that's the key to this film. By differentiating between the two, we can like the character, but we hate the problem; thus allowing the potency of the film's premise to be increased by our empathy for the character.Billy Wilder is well known for great screenplays; his films are some of the most well rounded ever made, and that trademark is more than evident in this film. Every scene serves some importance and lets us delve deeper into the character and his situation. Some scenes really stand out, such as the sequence that sees Birnam and his girlfriend to be, Helen St James, meeting after mistakenly picking up each other's coats. The scene that set's up the pair's relationship is simple, but believable and also very funny. The acting in the film is truly first rate, especially that coming from Ray Milland in the lead role. Millard is sublime in the role of an alcoholic; his every word and mannerism are perfectly suited to the character of a drunk. Wilder tends to get the best from his actors, and that is definitely true of this film. I dare say that if you put Milland next to an actual alcoholic, you'd have trouble telling who is and who isn't the true addict.Wilder's direction, like his screenplay, is magnificent. The cinematography is superb and really captures the seedy atmosphere of a drunken man's city. Wilder's use of music is superb; he has opted for a theme that sounds almost like something that would be played in a Sci-Fi film when the flying saucers come down. This music might sound like it would be out of place in a film of this nature, but it actually works brilliantly. Never doubt a decision made by Billy Wilder; the music creates a foreboding and apprehensive atmosphere, and coupled with Birnam's drunkenness; the two come together to great effect.Don't pass this film over; despite it's lack of recognition, this is one of Wilder's best films. A masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a recovering alcoholic (14 years sober) this remains as the first great film dealing with alcoholism. Ray Milland"s great performance shows realistically the insanity of drinking and the struggles. The promises and hidden bottles will ring true to anyone who has dealt with the problem. Billy Wilder's career was noted for his comedies but he showed in "Lost Weekend" that he knew how to deal with serious matter as well. The ending shot is a classic and will be memorable for anyone seeing the film. Check out "Days of Wine &amp; Roses" as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don Birnam (Ray Milland, in an outstanding performance) is an alcoholic writer spending a weekend in New York without the presence of his controller brother Wick Birnam (Phillip Terry) and escaping from his fiancée Helen St. James (Jane Wyman). This Billy Wilder's movie is a great and touching movie, since the first long distance shot of New York approaching Don Birnam 's room (and the Rye whiskey bottle hanging on the window) to the end of the plot. Wonderful performance of an inspired cast, marvelous black &amp; white photography, a fantastic direction and screenplay makes this movie a masterpiece. Even the moralist end is acceptable for such an excellent movie. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Farrapo Humano" ("Human Rag")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great ones - dark, depressing, bleak, uncompromising and an important statement on alcoholism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't imagine how this got greenlit back in 1945. It's almost impossible to imagine a film like this being made back then - the era where women weren't allowed to have their dresses crease around their buttocks and "show the shape of their behinds" (as Carl Reiner put it on commentary for the Dick Van Dyke show).Seen sixty (!) years later, it still holds up amazingly well. A great deal of films from the 1940s and '50s seem outdated today, but the issue of alcoholism will probably never die... and as long as it exists, this movie will remain prescient.Ray Milland delivers a powerful performance as Don Birnem, a recovering alcoholic whose girlfriend Helen (Jane Wyman) and brother Wick (Phillip Terry) have planned a weekend getaway to the country, to take his mind off the booze.Don makes up an excuse not to go - he says he wants to be alone. His brother is suspicious of his decision, but nevertheless leaves without him. After the two leave, Don pulls a bottle of alcohol through his window, which was tied to a string by the window sill, hidden from view outside the apartment.Don makes his daily visit to the bar where Nat (Da Silva) the Bartender serves his drinks. The more he drinks, the more Don spirals downwards into a hellish nightmare, complete with flashbacks to his past where he is reminded of the destructive patterns of his addiction.I bought this movie a few months ago out of curiosity, mainly because I saw it had been directed by Billy Wilder. Wilder is most commonly known for his comedies like "The Apartment" and "Some Like It Hot," but here he shows he has a great eye for drama.This is a superb film on all levels. The themes are gripping and important, the acting is totally uncompromising and the direction is top notch. I'd say it's one of the best and most underrated films of the 1940s; I had personally never heard of it before... I'm glad I stumbled across it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delirium is a disease that only comes at night.,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don Birnham is not a drinker, he is in fact a drunk, he is left alone for the weekend by those who love him under the proviso that he gets stuck into his writing, thus the hope is that he stays away from the booze that is killing his life and the loving foundation that his life is built on.Billy Wilder directs this with brilliant hands, he pulls his first masterstroke by casting Ray Milland in the lead role of Don Birnham, at the time Milland was better known for light and airy roles, so for audiences of the time it was quite something to see someone so normally affable descend into a real dark shadow of their perceived persona. It was a formula that Blake Edwards would repeat some 17 years later with Days Of Wine And Roses, there, comedy great Jack Lemmon would wow the viewers with his own descent into alcoholic hell.It's no different here in 1945, Milland (and Wilder) drag us into an airy, almost jaunty first reel, and the foundation is set here for us to firmly stand by Don as he spirals thru a series of nightmares that is acted with genuine brilliance from the leading man. The journey has us rapidly trying to hock a typewriter if only we could just find a pawnbrokers open, we will beg in touchingly heart breaking fashion for a drink from the trusted barkeep, we will find ourselves in a dry out ward where the night terrors take over, we will be terrified by the delirium as sobriety threatens to unhinge this vile addiction....We will be part of this film for it's simply magnetic in how it draws you in, it's not just Milland's quite stunning show, Wilder the crafty sod uses deep focus to emphasise anything that will steer us to the demon drink, be it escalating water rings as each shot of Rye is consumed, or shots thru the bottles themselves, Wilder doesn't let up with knowing reminders of the core subject. The score is just terrific, Miklos Roza scores it to perfection because the music leads you into a swirling nightmare as Don's functional mind gives way to the haven of numbness, in short, the work on the film is incredible.The back story to this now revered masterpiece is somewhat hilarious, Paramount didn't want to release the film after temperance groups protested the film championed drinking (lol). One strong arm group even offered 5 Million Dollars to have the films negative destroyed, Wilder stood by his guns and thankfully the movie watching world still has a dark and poignant classic to view with resonance in any decade. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With every glass of whisky that Don Birnam drinks, a little part of him dies. This ever-expanding rift in his soul only increases his thirst, as though only through alcohol can he recover the parts of himself that he abandoned a long time ago. Drinking is his means of escaping reality, of creating a debilitating illusion of happiness and satisfaction; "it tosses the sandbags overboard so the balloon can soar. Suddenly I'm above the ordinary. I'm competent. I'm walking a tightrope over Niagara Falls. I'm one of the great ones?" Similarly, Ray Milland's portrayal of a chronic alcoholic, in Billy Wilder's Oscar-winning 'The Lost Weekend (1945),' is one of the great performances of its era, and the film itself is one five-day-long nightmare of obsession and desperation. Prior to 1945, Hollywood had shied away from confronting alcohol addiction in a serious light, more content with exploiting the issue for comedic effect {take Nick Charles of 'The Thin Man' series, for example, or any movie featuring the stereotypical, clumsy and amusing drunkard}. It took a promising newcomer in Billy Wilder {fresh from the classic film-noir 'Double Indemnity (1944)} to finally bring alcoholism into the open for all to see.'The Lost Weekend' was adapted {by Wilder and Charles Brackett} from Charles R. Jackson's novel of the same name, itself a rather daring and provocative piece of literature. The film follows alcoholic Don Birnam throughout a torturous five-day long weekend, as he futilely battles his addiction to the bottle and suffers the consequences of his excessive drinking. The film borrows a thing or two from German Expressionism, and much of the film has a peculiar, dream-like atmosphere to it, accentuated by stark lighting and shadows, beautifully shot by cinematographer John F. Seitz. This hazy, otherworldly ambiance is further emphasised by the inspired decision to film some scenes through glass liquor bottles, and Miklós Rózsa's eerie soundtrack, which made extensive use of the oscillating wail of the theremin {nowadays mostly associated with films dealing with extraterrestrials and UFOs}. One particular hallucinatory sequence, featuring a mouse and a bat, has undoubtedly left its mark on all who watch the film, and Birnam's frenzied scream of absolute horror will continue to resonate in your eardrums long after it's all over.Along with Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining (1980)' and the Coen Brothers' 'Barton Fink (1991),' 'The Lost Weekend' is probably the most disturbing film about writer's block that I've seen, a genuinely unsettling profile of a troubled and mentally-ill man. The film doesn't merely present us with Don Birnam, but takes us into his world, where slipping your fingers around that next shot of whisky is a matter of life or death. Though the Production Code forced Wilder to supply a more optimistic ending than I think he would have liked, he nonetheless manages to slip some ambiguity into the final moments, and, on second look, the conclusion isn't perhaps as hopeful as we might initially have presumed. In an earlier scene, Birnam refers to his alcohol addiction as "my little vicious circle? no end, no beginning." Indeed, throughout the weekend, he experiences a continuous sequence of cycles, circulating between debilitating drunkenness, an attempt at recovery and a frantic search for more alcohol. The film opens with a left-to-right slow pan from the New York cityscape to Birnam's apartment; it closes with an identical pan in the opposite direction. Despite his apparent resolve to finally emerge from his rut and complete "The Bottle," it appears that Birnam is simply trapped in a vicious cycle from which he may never escape, except perhaps in death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Portrait Of An Alcoholic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much acclaimed for its searing indictment of alcoholism, "The Lost Weekend" features Ray Milland, in his Oscar winning performance, as Don Birnam, a man whose dependence on the bottle is so overwhelming that it takes over his life. Set in Manhattan in the 1940s, the film covers only a few days in the life of Birnam, a man who dreams of being a novelist. But writing is out of the question when your brain is drowning in alcohol. And despite the best efforts of his girlfriend, Helen (Jane Wyman), to get him to stop, Birnam obsesses.While I applaud the film's intent, and Milland's excellent performance, the film's plot is too overwrought. Birnam's actions are so over-the-top as to be campy. Much of the plot takes place in his apartment where Birnam drinks. But when his supply dries up, we see him at a bar, multiple times; we see him at a liquor store; we see him walking the sidewalks in search of liquor. The plot belabors this point over and over and over. Maybe these exaggerated, overdone actions were necessary in the 1940s, to hit people over the head with what alcoholism is. But today, the plot seems contrived, and way too melodramatic to be believable.The screen story also suffers from too much dialogue. One would think that at least part of Birnam's problem is that he suffers in silence, alone. But throughout the film, it's talk, talk, talk, which further weakens both the believability and the emotional impact of the story.The film's music features the eerie sounds of the theremin. I suppose it is to remind us of Birnam's haunted mind. All it reminds me of are those dreadful 1950's sci-fi films. While the film's story to some extent lacks credibility, the B&amp;W cinematography is quite good. And those 1940's clothing styles, especially women's hats, are certainly ... interesting.Milland deserved his Oscar for his performance here, for a character that is gut-wrenchingly pained. And surely one must offer congratulations to the filmmakers for daring to show a side of human nature that was not fashionable during the 1940s. I just wished the screen story had been more believable, and not so melodramatic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>... and the weekend stretches on into days, weeks, years...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lost Weekend" is obviously a reference to what can happen to the confirmed alcoholic when they feel compelled by their bodies to embark on the mother of all benders. As this is an addiction - or a disease, however you prefer to label it - gaps in time tend to occur quite frequently. The drunk will not remember nor care about the depths they have sunk to, but Wilder the dispassionate observer is able to capture all of the squalor on film for his audience.Cravings and detox afford the potential for some memorable scenes which have a definite 'nightmarish' quality about them, as when he hallucinates, or desperately tries to hawk his possessions for money to buy booze. The acting is good enough to mostly elicit concern from we the viewer. Its only real flaw from my perspective was that, being one of the first to address such a stigmatized issue, at times the story seemed to be more about the illness than the character - a problem which had lessened considerably by the time we got to treatments such as "Leaving Las Vegas", for example. Still, it's worth a look if you want to see an early film that genuinely tries to be daring and different, or if you're searching for proper hard evidence that Billy Wilder was capable of producing an awful lot more than just fluffy screwball comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>groundbreaking in its day, hopelessly inaccurate now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up until The Lost Weekend, alcoholism was seldom seriously addressed by Hollywood. So, in that sense, it is an important groundbreaking film. Also, unlike past portrayals of drinking (such as W. C. Fields) in films, this is much more realistic and gritty--particularly when they show people in the hospital going through the agonies of withdrawal. This is the BEST aspect of the movie, along with all the broken promises and games Milland plays with those around him.Unfortunately, the movie HAD to slap a pat ending on the film, as movies seldom were allowed to end on a sour or indefinite note in the 1940s. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE cinema of the 1940s (far more than recent movies), but this was one serious shortcoming films of that era had--the Hollywood ending even when it was not realistic or sometimes compromised the integrity of the film (as in this case). Milland, after a long weekend bender, announces he's now "got it licked" and everything is peachy! Give me a break--this sure sounds like the phony self-serving thinking I so often encountered when I worked with addicts in a substance abuse program!! This is only the first step in a long, difficult road to recovery.For an even better film about alcoholism, try Days of Wine and Roses.</fullReview>

As my experience proves you don't have to have personal experience of the exact situations (at the time, anyway) to respond instinctively.Since then I have always watched films looking for the same reactions. When I get them, I don't care what critics say, it's real for me.And that's why IMDb is a great resource. You can check out every film (as I do, while I'm watching) just to see if it's just you that's gone crazy, or do all the other enthusiasts agree.Keep up the good work.Davo Shannon Ireland</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alky Writer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lost Weekend" is almost beyond reproach--it sends a strong no-preach message; has a wonderful, sometimes offbeat, script, a wide character range underscored by a marvelous supporting cast (kudos to Phillip Terry) and an often moving lead (Ray Milland) who projects despair and cynicism; its subtle humor never detracts, while its Manhattan setting always adds. But despite its wide appeal--or perhaps because of, it does tend to hug the surface, not delving too deeply or generalizing too much the downward spiral of an alcoholic.One senses this in the ending--if not in the movie's general drift. Don Birnam is not the typical alcoholic. Not by status, nor by class. He is a writer first, an alcoholic second or, more pointedly, he is the alcoholic writer--a unique if not an elite individual. He is not part of the "concrete jungle." His novel, "The Bottle," may reach alcoholics of his own class (although more likely not if it truly is a "horror story",) but not the hoi polloi of his imaginings--for "Don Birnham, Esquire" is as apart from them as he is from Gloria. And his alcoholic ordeal is essentially private. He can hide away in his comfortable digs, pass for a gentleman, pass for normal, dwell on his inadequacies, torment himself over his failures, and escape AA type meetings--and hospital/jails too. Individuation is what sets him apart, which is why his "merry go round" can stop with his will to art, and not through any social program or institution. In finding his Self, he has gotten to his core--which is not a "sponge" but a mind no longer "suspended outside his window," one that knows itself as a novelist. In a word, he is secure and valued, an unusual position for an alcoholic.As a writer the causes of his alcoholism are also atypical. For the artist's identity can exact a heavy penalty on its members. On the other side of success, genius, and talent, is failure, madness, and doubt. Fame may be a phony and distasteful social construct, but it is no less real for that. The basic set up is the spotlight or bust. Winner or loser, known or unknown--these shape and inform the writer's role. And, no doubt, Don Birnam's alcoholism is rooted in this role---it goes with the territory. Writers--especially the losing--and male, take to it--at least that's the myth, and it's still strong today. Suicide is also part of that identity: on his 30th birthday, Don buys a gun for after ten years in the city he came to conquer--he was a hot, young genius at Cornell writing in the Hemingway mode--he still hadn't finished a novel or a short story. His drama is precisely this: creation is salvation, failure to create is damnation. This ugly dichotomy is entrenched in him to the point of drink and suicide. And a whole lot of self-doubt along the way. "I passed as a genius," he says, and "if I'd gotten a job, I'd be married." The painful scene at the Manhattan Hotel with Helen's parents accentuates this. "There are two Dons, the drinker and the writer," he says, but there is only one Don, the failed artist---his alcoholism being of that rare kind that only writing can cure.Finally, a special alcoholic needs special support, and Don is hardly cheated. Helen's support is unconditional, emotional, and romantic--a little sappy at times, given the drain, but real and convincing in the final scenes where she almost wills his transformation in rain-drenched muse fashion. Wick provides a decade's worth of room and board and puts up with all the lies, moanings, and self-absorption of his talented brother. Don has to admit of his conventional brother: "It is a big heart." Nat, the bartender, offers warmth, friendship, chides, realism--and the typewriter on which "The Bottle" will be written. (He also rejects Don's shabby treatment of Helen--and Gloria). Gloria, of the hex sign, gives far more to Don than she receives--including style/laughs more lost on him than her money. Only Bim of "Hangover Plaza" sees our wretch objectively and with his big time cynicism... who knows... maybe puts one more lousy drunk back on his feet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning Screen Depiction Of Alcoholism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A landmark film at it's time of release for it's stark depiction of alcoholism, 'The Lost Weekend' has been somewhat forgotten over the years, even labelled 'dated'. My theory is that every film becomes dated after it's first day of release- nothing ever stays the same. 'The Lost Weekend' is hardly an old relic from a bygone era, though. Alcoholism is still a major problem for many 'ordinary folk' out there. Milland's stunning performance and Wilder's assured directorial skills combine to make a film that is as relevant today as it was back in 1945.It's relevant because Milland's dive into the depths of drinking hell is treated so carefully, so earnestly. Every scene has a realistic feel-the alcoholics ward at the hospital and Milland's desperate search for a drink could have been played up to add to the drama, but they are kept in measure instead. While 'Days Of Wine and Roses' thrusts the problem in our faces somewhat, Wilder's film asks the viewer to think and make their own judgement. It was a revolutionary film at the time of it's release for the portrayal of the alcoholic writer, Don Birnam (Milland). Before this film, alcoholics on screen were usually one of two sorts: 1. Dirty, slovenly, lecherous layabouts 2. Jovial, hefty old men who took a swing always in a merry and gregarious manner Birnam shatters the myth. This man could be your next-door neighbour, your brother, your college chum, because he feels so REAL. He's a talented guy (We hear how he was touted as being the next Hemingway), but he's ultimately an ordinary guy, the "nice young man who drinks". Milland is rather like James Stewart here, both in looks and acting style. He's the everyman, which makes his downfall even more painful and harrowing to watch.There is a nice contrast here between the boozy romanticism of addiction and the awful aftermath. Birnam tells how he has delusions of grandeur when he drinks- he's confident, assured, ready to take on the whole world. We are drawn into Don's hazy, alcoholic dreams- until the morning after, when he is slumped, broken and unable to function. Both sides of the coin are being shown, which makes it easier to empathise with Don's position.Don's drinking is not presented as his largest problem here- it is his lack of self-esteem, his inability to believe in himself and his own self-worth that make him turn to drink. So we look at the causes of alcoholism here also, not just the results. Wilder maintains an appropriately gloomy, moody atmosphere throughout with some very nice camera work. Note the foggy haze that envelops the screen when Birnam sinks into despair, the use of superimposition with the coats and bottle etc. The 'mouse and bat' scene is painful to watch, as is Milland's reaction. Wilder's view of life on the edge is enough to turn anyone off alcohol, to see the bigger picture.Milland gives one of the best male acting performances you'll ever see as Don Birnam. He deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Actor for an amazing turn. Wyman is also great as Don's sympathetic girlfriend Helen, who has more faith and determination that anyone I've seen. To some she may seem a forceful character, very cliché and sentimental, but the role and Wyman's performance is one of the things I just love about this film. Fine supporting work from Phillip Terry, Howard Da Silva and Doris Dowling round out the cast. Dowling's Gloria is obviously a call-girl, but with the Production Code in place this is skirted around. Excellent film 10/10.</fullReview>

Milland really gets into his role; at times, you forget that you're watching a movie. Overall, I can't stress enough how good this movie is; you have to see it to understand.

		<fullReview>Writer-director Billy Wilder has worked in a number of genres and produced certified classics in each. The sheer number of great films this man made in diverse genres - war (Stalag 17), comedy (Some Like it Hot), noir (Double Indemnity), court-room drama (Witness for the Prosecution) and The Lost Weekend, the definitive film on alcoholism. Forget Days of Wine and Roses, Trainspotting and Leaving Las Vegas. This is the best film on addiction and the most watchable as well.Ray Milland is superb as the drunken failure Don Birnam and won a well-deserved Oscar for a career best performance. He is actually two people - an unpleasant and rude writer, and a jovial, friendly drunk. You can see his eyes gleam and his tongue loosen every time he sits down in the bar. But when not drinking, he is rude and unpleasant. His entire mentality is geared towards having some 'stock' handy in case he needs it - and he always needs it. He confesses early on in the picture that its easy to stop drinking, but not forever. And that is essentially his dilemma. Birnam is the centre piece of the film and there in most frames. The bulk of the action takes place in Birnam's flat or in the bar where he can still get a drink.A very intelligent script is only slightly marred by a production code forced ending but till that point this entire film is decades ahead of its time.</fullReview>

I loved "Double Indemnity", "Some Like It Hot", "Sunset Boulevard", "The Big Carnival" and "The Apartment", but "The Lost Weekend" is way too far from these others. Billy Wilder is definitely one of my 5 favorite directors of all-time Hollywood, and this is mainly because of this film.It's hard even to know where to start. The actors couldn't be better, specially Ray Milland, one of my favorite actors of all time, as the greatest drunk on the motion picture history. The screenplay is attractive, ambiguous, shocking, mature and intelligent, wrote by Wilder and Charles Brackett, based on the Charles Jackson novel. The cinematography? Well, it's a noir film, so that is just flattering enough. The editing gives the exact amount of speed needed at the scenes, intercalating slow ones with dynamic ones. A great sequence: Milland's hallucinations in the hospital. Do I still need to talk about the direction? Is there anything that wasn't said yet about Billy Wilder? No, he's one of the masters in the business, and what he touches become gold.This is also one of the most revolutionary films of Hollywood history, bringing up a theme that wasn't treated seriously so far. It has earned several Oscars, including Best Picture, Actor for Milland, Director for Wilder and Screenplay. In my opinion, it deserved too much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the five best films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allow me to begin by saying that I will not list the other four. This film is as perfect a presentation of the disease of alcoholism as one can expect from any film. Upon its unspooling in 1945 those ignorant of alcoholism sought reasons why the character drank. Viewers do to this day. They fail to realize a simple fact of life. Alcoholism is a condition that exists on its own. The alcoholic does not drink because he or she is "frustrated" by something or has been shocked by some misfortune. Most likely, the misfortune is the result of the alcoholism. For those aware of the horrors of this disease one will see that this drama is more a fictional, but clinically accurate and thorough, case study than anything else. This film frightens me every time I see it. People often wonder why the character played by Jane Wyman stuck with this very sick man. In real life this is common. Both she and the main character's brother are enablers who commonly surround the active alcoholic. The brother, Wick, rescues Don from his misfortunes. Helen (Jane Wyman)is not his fiancée but is identified in the film as his "best girl". Don flirts arrogantly with the poor soul of a bar fly girl named Gloria (Why nach Gloria, Nach!)who he sarcastically insults right and left. However, he takes much abuse from the bartender. All very typical in the world of the active alcoholic. One should note that the ending is as it is because Billy Wilder had to bow to the nincompoops in Hollywood in order to get this film out at all. The novel, written by Charley Jackson, has Don getting another bottle of booze at the end. Jackson was also technical adviser on this film. Jackson died of TB at New Yrok City's Bellevue Hospital while in restraints from suffering from the DT's. Again, if you want to understand alcoholism, just watch this film. Do not try to analyze it, you do not need to. This film will never be outdated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only One Flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally got a chance to completely see this movie. It is great. It is realistic as it shows all the symptoms of alcholism. If you are not a alcoholic then you are likely to have one in your family or to see it in someone else's. For these reasons "Lost Weekend" is not dated and should be given a lot of credit for its realism not not white washing the character or the problem. Thank God the drunk does not drive. There is only one flaw in the movie though and this is its ending. The gutless guy suddenly gets the strength to stop and this is totally unrealistic based on all that occurred previously in the movie. A better ending was in "Days of Wine and Roses" in which the drunk finally went to AA. Nevertheless, "Lost Weekend" is not only great but a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Below Wilder's Usual Standard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps it's inevitable that a film that appeared so shocking and candid 60 years ago would seem so hopelessly out of touch with reality today, but I don't think the ultimate failure of this film can be blamed on the passing of time alone. Billy Wilder was a fantastic director, making movies that at the time were so much more intelligent and sophisticated than their peers, so I think he simply stumbled when making this overly-simplified message movie.To be sure, Wilder does bring some creative vision to this story of a raging alcoholic struggling through his addictive demons for one long weekend. He uses the cinematic equivalent of first-person narrative to get you into Ray Milland's mind, and tries to make the audience feel what it's like when alcohol is the focus of your world. Thus, at a performance of "La Traviata," instead of filming the stage as it might appear to the audience watching the opera, Wilder cuts from shots of Milland's face to close-ups of the fake drinks the actors are holding as they perform. At other times, he even shoots scenes from the perspective of the alcohol, so when Milland tries to hide his booze from himself, we'll get shots of him storming around the room from the vantage point of the hidden bottles. But Milland gives a histrionic performance in the lead role, as cartoonish in its own way as Nicolas Cage's was in "Leaving Las Vegas," playing another hopeless alcoholic, and he undermines any effort at seriousness on Wilder's part. The alcohol itself is nearly personified to the point of caricature; I half expected to see a bottle of gin stand up and twirl its silent-film villain mustache while giving a dastardly laugh. And to top everything off, Milland delivers a ridiculous inspirational speech at the film's end, a call-to-arms for other silent alcoholics to emerge and begin overcoming their disease. After a whole movie in which alcoholism is depicted as a form of demonic possession, the ending makes it seem that the decision to quit drinking is as easy as changing from 2% milk to skim.Still, this film should be commended for admitting that alcoholism IS a disease, and that it's not simply a lack of will power or self control that causes people to abuse. I can't think of a film before this one that really treated alcoholism seriously, or even addressed it at all. Think of all those 30s comedies ("The Thin Man" comes to mind) where hardly a scene goes by without the leading man holding a martini, or where the stumbling drunk is a stock character included for his comic potential.So "The Lost Weekend" is a film that I can't whole-heartedly pan, because I do feel that points should be rewarded for trying to use cinema as a communication device for addressing social concerns, but if you know an alcoholic, I doubt you'll be able to do anything but laugh at the silly version of alcoholism you'll see here. Compared to other Billy Wilder films, this one seems almost bad.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply dissatisfying melodrama with a predictable arc</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I followed the line of good reviews and a high IMDb rating to this flick and feel I've been misled by the readership here. This story about one alcoholic's weekend binge merits a few props as it touches on the psychology of an ambitious would-be writer who never was. However, the core of this character study is marred fatally by overwrought dialogue, half-baked character development, a bland story arc, and a melodramatic Theramin-saturated score that would have fit more comfortably in a sci-fi shocker about nuclear swamp mutants than a closely studied psychological drama. The film shines most as the protagonist's brother, played subtly and richly by Phillip Terry, appears alternately as a care-taker either fed up and through with it all or empathetic enough to lie valiantly in order to cover up his brother's shame. Unfortunately, this performance gets little screen time. For the most part we are forced to trudge through a miserable weekend with our protagonist as if it were a rote lesson in "Alcoholism and its Downward Spiral 101." To cap it all off, we get in the end a reversal as facile, unconvincing, and dissatisfying as Tofurkey for a Thanksgiving dinner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"That's the nice young man who drinks."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exploitation flicks of the Thirties and Forties often went way over the top in depicting the evil of social ills like drug use, alcoholism and prostitution. "Reefer Madness" is probably the one that most often comes to mind for it's treatment of marijuana use and how it can presumably lead to harder drugs and a life of crime. So imagine what movie audiences must have thought about "The Lost Weekend". Here was an unflinching, no holds barred look at the depths to which an individual would go to score just one more drink. Compared to this, 1931's "Ten Nights in a Barroom" is like a walk in the park.You know, I get a kick out of some of the message board posts asking if this film was just a little too unbelievable; one that caught my eye was titled 'Does it REALLY get this bad'? This must come from a younger poster who hasn't gotten to see much of the world yet, because back in my youth in the mid Sixties, I managed to get an eye and earful of plenty of town drunks. They had colorful nicknames like Rabbit Lempka and Hank Decker; there was even an older couple I remember - Tootsie and Floyd. Saturday night on Main Street could often turn into a real show time when these two got going. Tootsie had a shiner once that was so bad it was starting to turn silver, yet it wouldn't be out of the question to have her hit you up for some spare change to start up all over again. For some, it wasn't the good old days.Interestingly, what I expected from "The Lost Weekend" was a bender by our friend Don Birnam (Ray Milland) where he got so polluted that he passed out and woke up a few days later with no recollection of what he got into. Instead, he remained relatively functional until that segue into the alcohol ward. You know, if this were a horror film, I don't think you could have gotten any creepier than that bat ripping into the mouse in the hole in the wall. Here was a Don Birnam a far cry removed from the affable neighborhood tippler who could regale patrons with flights into rhetorical wit and fancy. Credit director Billy Wilder with a realistic but scathing portrayal of alcoholism here, one that pulls no punches in showing just how low an individual can go to compromise family, friendship and a loved one. I'm sure audiences of 1945 weren't quite ready for something like this, and even to this day, the film packs a powerful warning about the excesses of alcohol abuse. Ray Milland is effective as the would be 'Man of the Year' who can't get a grip, a failed writer who's only consolation is summed up by his daily motto - "Pour it softly, pour it gently, and pour it to the brim".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good to the Last Drop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Best Picture of 1945, director Billy Wilder's gritty melodrama "The Lost Weekend" ranks as one of the all-time notable movies about alcoholism. This Paramount Pictures' release received seven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Screenplay, Best Black &amp; White Cinematography, Best Editing, and Best Music. Unfortunately, "The Lost Weekend" lost out on photography, musical score, and editing. Nevertheless, Ray Milland landed the Best Acting Oscar; Wilder took home Best Director, while Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett shared the statuette for Best Screenplay. What sets apart composer Miklós Rózsa's orchestral score from other films of the time was his use of the theremin, the musical sound that everybody remembers from classic 1956 sci-fi film "Forbidden Planet." Reportedly, Wilder picked up Charles R. Jackson's novel from a railway depot and read it while riding across country! A Cornel University drop-out, wannabe author Don Birnam (Ray Milland), who lives with his brother, runs into a cute little number, Helen St. James (Jane Wyman), at a matinée performance at the Metropolitan Opera of "La Traviata." All Don is thinking about is the bottle of liquor that he stashed in his raincoat that is now in the coat-check room when he leaves the performance and tries to retrieve his apparel. Unfortunately for desperate Don, he has the check for another person's coat. An impatient Don waits around until the opera has let out and meets Helen. He swaps her leopard skin coat for his raincoat. Eventually, arrogant Don and pretty Helen go to a cocktail party and three years elapse. Don is still a stinker and shows little inclination to deal with his addiction.Initially, Helen doesn't know about Don's drinking problem until she invites her parents to New York to meet him. Don arrives as the Hotel Manhattan before Helen. While he is waiting for her, he eavesdrops on a conversation between an older, married couple on the other side of the lobby sofa who just happen to be talking about him. He scrams before Helen shows up and goes back to his apartment. Don's brother Whit tries to cover for him when she shows up at their upstairs apartment. Don comes clean, but Helen refuses to abandon him. Whit and he are about to depart for a weekend in the country when Don backs out. Whit washes his hands clean of him and heads off for his weekend in the country. Poor Don winds up in a night club where he buys too many drinks that he cannot pay for and steals from a woman's purse. Miraculously, Don weasels out of this predicament, but his luck doesn't hold up when he visits Gloria and he falls down the stairs and awakens in an alcoholic's ward. Somehow, he escapes from the ward by stealing a physician's jacket. Before he gets away, Don wakes up to a man screaming about imaginary beetles crawling over his body. Later, Don hallucinates that he sees a mouse peeking out of a hole in the wall of his brother's apartment. To his horror, he sees a bat enter the room, fly around him, and then attack the mouse in the wall. This is truly a gruesome sight because a rivulet of blood drips down the wall from where the bat is biting the tiny rodent."The Lost Weekend" towers as a damning indictment about drinking. Reportedly, the alcohol industry wanted to bribe the studio to hold up release of this incisive melodrama. Ray Milland's performance is unforgettable and he sinks into the role with vigor. Frank Faylen makes quite an impression as 'Bim' Nolan, a medical nurse in the Bellevue hospital ward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Lost Weekend" portrays alcoholism in such a harrowing and uncomfortable manner by todays standards; in 1945, with Prohibition fresh in the mind, it must have been nothing short of socially monumental in its portrayal of addiction.Having made the noir classic "Double Indemnity" just a year earlier, Billy Wilder brings some of that genre's striking visual style to this tale of a writer lost in an alcoholic fog. The mystery of "The Lost Weekend," however, is of an entirely different nature. Although Don Birnam (Ray Milland) has a straightforward problem, it's the solution that can't be found easily.Birnam is a conundrum of a character in that his actions and behaviors are so predictable yet so hard to sympathize with and understand. His motivation is clear as day: find his next drink, but his persistent lying and unwillingness to take steps toward recovery is ever the mystery to the sober among us.The script focuses on providing Wilder the framework to paint a portrait of alcoholism at its worst. If Wilder weren't so talented at his craft and Milland so utterly convincing in spite of the stagy nature of his character, "The Lost Weekend" would've been an exaggerated public service announcement at best.Wilder allows us to ? with the very best of tactics available to him in the '40s ? experience sensorily the nature of Don's condition. A modern take would likely have employed a trippy Terry Gilliam-style approach to more easily achieve that effect, but Wilder did not have the luxury, effectively putting the weight entirely on Milland.Don is at first quite detestable, but the more we see him, the more we begin to understand rather than scold his complete lack of self-control. Toward the end, Milland's performance verges on squeezing pity from us, but the film's strength turns out to be the shift in consciousness that it creates in all those who see it. No one could finish this movie and not understand alcoholism as a disease, not just a person's utter disregard for the wellness of themselves and those around them.Jane Wyman's Helen provides that entry point into the film, as does the way she clashes with Wick (Phillip Terry), Don's brother. Helen believes that with a little guidance Don can get better, but Wick sees him as hopeless. We know today which one of them is right, but it doesn't hinder the effectiveness of the debate between them. Through them we start to form our own opinions about if and how Don can beat his condition.Visually, however, not enough praise can be given to how Wilder approaches the film, especially the way everything fits into the frame so gracefully while being both suspenseful and hard-hitting. Even with the many scattered moments in which it drags, the film keeps our attention on Don's every move.Outside of the '40s, "The Lost Weekend" is more of a feat of strong visual storytelling and memorable imagery, but put the context back into it and you have a bold and daring film that makes a real statement. Regardless, there's plenty to praise about "The Lost Weekend." ~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit my site, moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Descended by alcoholism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Occasionally this is Billy Wilder's best film, and I felt this much because of the performance Ray Milland lends - he's loose and limber, and at the same time has got a cynical and despairing thorn, and it's a performance that deservedly got awarded. But THE LOST WEEKEND is only occasionally Wilder's best film, because it doesn't have the fluency of some of his other work, and it becomes very self-solemnly in those many serious, talky scenes. It lacks that ironic nerve that runs through THE APARTMENT, and it doesn't have the immediate highlights of SOME LIKE IT HOT, and so it goes on with its heavy handed topic as something of a downer, despite its uplifting end. The dialogs are good, and very good when Milland raves and goes off the deep end. The darkness of this film was important for its time, as it was the first American film to deal unrelentingly serious with alcoholism, so kudos for Wilder and fellow writer Charles Brackett, based off the novel by Charles R. Jackson, for doing it their own way. The only slight comedic touch I picked up, was the many nifty ways Milland hides his bottles of whiskey and liquor around in his brother's apartment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grungy, Edgy, Emotional, and Inherently Violent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Weekend is a film about an alcoholic writer who goes on a four-day drinking binge, and it's dark, creepy even, the way hardly any old films ever are. It's grungy, edgy, emotional, and inherently violent. The music is very off-putting at first, using fluctuating female high tones as if it were a film about UFOs, but it works to the advantage of the movie's feeling.I've hardly seen a film for a long time that has had so many highlight scenes, standing out to be remembered specifically. There's the scene where Ray Milland, who delves into the dark, pressure-filled depths of the angry, powerfully self-destructive alcoholic character and projects a haunting performance, is sitting in a performance of La Traviata, seeming somehow to be cramped without really being, a mysteriously abstract claustrophobic feeling, and is hardly able to contain himself during the first act when they perform "Libiamo," and everyone on stage has a glass of wine. Another scene has him in a bar, drunker than I'm sure I've ever been, boosting ten dollars from the purse from the lady sitting next to him while she's busy giggling with her boyfriend. What happens next is something we've only imagined in our heads as something we'd ever see ourselves do. The key scene in the film takes place in the ward, with a sadistic little man named Bim as the nurse, played very effectively by Frank Faylen, where we learn in a scene more frightening than anything I've seen in a movie before the 1960s, brilliantly lacking any lighting, that one would much rather be an alcoholic than be in that place.I think each of these scenes stands out so much and glues to the memory because each scene is written and directed as effectively as it could ever be. No scene is a token scene and every scene is treated with hard concentration and interest by director Billy Wilder.Milland carries the entire cast. The fact that he's English helps his performance. Look at the man in The Lost Weekend and tell me you would ever guess in a million years that he's English. However, Jane Wyman doesn't even come close to matching him. She doesn't seem comfortable on screen at all. For instance, in one scene, her gestures are either very visibly planned or very indecisive. Doris Dowling, who plays the woman in the bar who asks Milland for a date, gives a very unusual performance for a film from the 1940s in that she has a latently manic physical side that one doesn't often see in films from that time. And Phillip Terry is very likable as Milland's very grounded brother.Billy Wilder is perhaps the greatest director who spanned the decades from the '40s to the '60s, because his films are consistent with this one, a very diverting, uncompromising telling of the darkness and lack of self-control existent in the human condition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Memorable Ray Milland film where he showed Hollywood that he could really act. After playing numerous cads and other Hollywood types, in 1945 Milland gave a well deserved Oscared performance as a writer who is a hopeless drunk.In conveying what a drunk goes through during binge drinking, Milland fully captured the aspects of alcoholism and was honored by Hollywood's highest acting award.The film also gave Jane Wyman an opportunity to break through from her usual silly inane parts up until this film. As the long suffering but dedicated girl friend, Wyman showed that she could handle problem parts adeptly.New York of the 1940s is also well shown. Director Wilder handled details brilliantly here depicting the pawn shops and other stores that are closed on Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement.Milland's scenes of delirium and utter despair are memorably shown. He is able to bring us, in a vivid portrayal, what alcoholics go through. His performance showed that alcoholism is a disease.This break through film of 1945 is memorable in that Wilder took on the problem of alcohol addiction. The film would serve as a trail blazer for "Smash Up: The Story of A Woman," and "I'll Cry Tomorrow."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ray Milland plays an inspiring writer, who has two personalities. One personality stays up and writes. The other turns to the bottle. This movie brilliantly portrays the "holocaust" that severe alcoholics bring upon themselves. Ray Milland has never been better. He is a kind, gentle, polite man, who is too weak to face pain, and turns to the bottle when "unpleasantness" turns the corner. However, the movie is inspiring. People really do care about him - his fiancé, his brother, his landlady, the bar tender. It is they who have the strength to love him, despite his terrible plight. I have to say that things have gotten worse. At least, 60 years ago, there were people there for people. People in the 60s started to despise "authority", but by doing so contributed the erosion of community and common decency. I fear today, that people are too cynical and jaded to have been there for Ray Milland's character. That's my opinion, however.</fullReview>

I just want to draw attention to the drunk tank scene and report a tendency about alcoholism. Frank Faylen as Bim is just great. I love when he says "What kind of Birnam"? and "This is nothing. You should have seen the place during prohibition. Standing room only". And of course, "That stuff about pink elephants. It's the bunk. Its little animals, tiny turkeys in straw hats". Finally, there have been some observations that the girlfriend sticking by Birnam through all of this mess is unbelievable, unrealistic, why would she and so forth. The facts of alcoholism are quite different however. Sticking around is quite common. The film portrays their continuing relationship quite accurately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to "Hangover Plaza"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about this movie is its unsentimental depiction of addiction.Don is handsome and urbane and he has the cool goal of wanting to be a novelist, but he's also an overgrown baby who indulges in hissy-fits and treats people as a means to an end, and it's always the same end -- to get him booze or to get out of the way so he can get the booze. "I've got to have it around so I know I have it if I want it," he whines.His girlfriend is the ultimate enabler -- Helen sees only the potential in Don and seems dissociated from the pain he constantly inflicts. It's pathetic to see her wasting her time with him. You just want to shake her. But the paces she puts herself through are familiar to many co-dependents who minimize and make excuses for the alcoholics they inexplicably love. Helen sees Don as having a curable disease, while his brother calls him a "hopeless alcoholic." I found it hard to believe that Don had met Helen at the opera. He is such a single-minded addict that it seems an unlikely past time for him, despite his worldly affectations. (The extended excerpt from "La Traviata" is one of the film's best segments.) Though good in the role, Milland overacts at times, and this problem is exacerbated by a soundtrack that underscores the uglier elements of his addiction with the use of spooky music reminiscent of B sci-fi flicks. In addition, the semi-happy ending to this film seems a cop-out. Given what has come before, it's obvious Don won't change. Still, the movie's worth watching for its insights into the psychodynamics of problem drinking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Choosing the single best movie directed by the great Billy Wilder would be a task. And, really, there's no reason to try to choose such a movie. If, however, I were pressed, I might pick this brilliant moving.A few things seem dated. The fairyish "male nurse" grates, but such stereotypes were very much of this movie's time. I believe, too, that the original novel dealt with a man drinking to battle his homosexual urges; and the nurse in the brutal, but not sensationalized drunk tank is only one of several allusions to this theme throughout.Many message pictures of the 1940s are dated today. "Crossfire," the ludicrous "Gentleman's Agreement," "Pinky" ... But I have a friend who's an alcoholic and this could easily be a weekend in his life, in 2005.The early scene at the opera is beautifully done and hardly surprising from such a cultivated man as Wilder. Ray Milland turns in a performance every inch worthy of the Oscar he received, and Jane Wyman is excellent as well.OK, the happy ending in which Milland stops drinking cold turkey is implausible. Surely it was not Wilder's, but Hollywood's, idea. And it doesn't take away much from the overall impact.Amazingly, for decades after this, movies continued to treat alcoholics as hilarious. There were some depictions of its evils, like the heavy-handed "Days of Wine And Roses." But look at "Arthur," almost three decades after this! I am blessed with the ability to have a glass or two of wine with dinner and not crave more; but I've seen many a nasty drunk. If ever a movie could take a step toward sobering these people up, surely, it was "The Lost Weekend."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Find it this weekend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been watching a lot of movies recently that are considered classics, but which haven't really engaged me. I had this movie for a while before I put it on.Here is one of the most fascinating movies about drug addiction that I have seen for a long time. Very few movies of this genre really engage me. Jesus Son and The lost weekend are both great movies because they take you into the reality of the addict. Many others try but fail "requim for a dream being a pretentious wannabe".Back to the story. We meet Don, a alcoholic whose life has only been kept together by the help of his brother and the care of his love. One weekend his brother plans to take him away to the country, but Don misses the train for the want of a drink.Now there is no one to hold him back from the brink. We follow his journey into lying, cheating, broken promises, hospitalization/imprisonment and despair. If only he could work as hard on a novel as he does to try and get one drink he could be famous.Will he overcome his addiction or be destroyed by it. Of course you want him to overcome everything and succeed for Don is a likable guy, honest, kind, caring and motivated except when he is not desperate for a drink.This is a very dark movie featuring an innovative sound track including the theremin (the world's first electronic musical instrument) that was featured in many later 1950s sci-fi movies and of course the beach boys song (good vibrations if I am not mistaken). There is also an interesting sound scape as Don falls into the despairs and DTs associated with alcoholism.There are some errors in fact about how alcohol addiction operates but it stays true to the experience and is relevant today to modern substance abuse as it was in 1945.The style of the movie is classic 1940s Hollywood. However for the modern audience this actually helps heighten Don's experience. For example in older movies most extras do or feel exactly the same thing which in modern movies the extras often do very different things. When everyone is staring at Don in the same way it highlights not what people are doing but what Don's experience is.For those who think the ending is too simplistic....I agree, but it is his journey into despair that the movie is about and the end result is just has to be accepted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Early Film About Alcoholism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a recovering alcoholic and addict, I found this movie very frightfully real, even tho it was made in the '40's. Ray Milland was nothing but stunning in his portrayal of a frustrated writer/alcoholic. The scenes containing his alcohol withdrawals were terrifying beyond belief, as I have gone thru the same ordeal. The support cast, music, and the rest were nothing short of perfect. It was rumored that Bill Wilson, co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, was the prototype for Milland's character. Though considered too realistic at time of it's release, it did garner Ray Milland an Oscar nomination and also won the Best Picture for 1945. A must-see for any recovering alcoholic/addict.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harsh drama that observes 48 hours in the life of a severes alcoholic. It was a total formula breaker for its time, and injected much needed artisitc freedom of movement for filmmakers. I think this film is one of the reasons I had to live in New York. No director was able to capture the feel of this town better than Billy Wilder. Used as a backdrop for his great stories, and wonderful scene creation, his films just always seem to be winners. There is an awful lot to take in when viewing The Lost Weekend, and thats exactly what a typical day in New York is all about. Everything, and I mean everything as soon as your feet hit the sidewalk, is just somehow interesting. And I find this to be one of the very few old movies that still plays new. Most people just cant handle watching old films, and its understandable. Even for me, some of the so called great ones cant rise above their quaintness or old age. Not this. It has some annoying vernacular, but not too much, Milland's toupee is a trifle distracting, and this wasnt the era for special effects. But its fantastic, and while I know the message is a sobering one, (sorry) I find this movie irrestibly entertaining. When you contemplate rewatching a film, your mind plays over as best as it is able to, the individual scenes and and tells you whether its worth it or not to spend all that time on something you have already seen. As I write this, I find myself hungry for yet another viewing. Watch it and see for yourself. Its in the Peevis Collection, and thats a very select gathering as you all know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Booze Cruise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Best Picture Oscar winner about an alcoholic failed writer from 1945 still packs a punch. Billy Wilder's direction is mercilessly realistic, and the script he wrote with Charles Brackett is masterful, though I wish the writer were more articulate. Maybe in the novel he was. In the movie, Don Birnam is a pleasing, refined gent who lives with his brother, does not work, and dreams of writing a great book some day. He never quite gets around to writing, and spends most of his time in drunken daydreams. When brother Wick goes away for the weekend, Don, who has promised Wick he'll remain sober, spirals downward into such pathetic drunkenness as to require hospitalization. This strikes me as somewhat unrealistic, as it is an obvious telescoping of events that would normally take months or years. Experienced drinkers generally have a flair for mico-managing their boozing, which Birnam in the relatively short time-span of the movie is clearly incapable of. In this sense the film is clinical rather than artistic, charting its protagonist's inebriation as if the movie were the doctor and Birnam the patient. No matter. Once one accepts this the story moves along well enough.Although Birnam has a girl-friend who believes in him, and a brother who cares for him, the relationship that matters the most to Don is that which he has with the bottle. Until he can give this up, his real relationships are essentially false, virtual fantasies, as it were, while the only one that matters, Don and the bottle, is the reality. It is the scenes of Birnam's love of boozing, his anticipation of it, his need to get back to it, the desperate acts he will commit in order to continue with it, that are the most powerful and haunting. The bottle is the love of his life, and he'll lie, cheat, steal a woman's purse or hold up a liquor store, in order to keep it going. He is a man incapable of healthy human relationships.Good as the movie is, I wish that there were more to it. One is continually reminded of Birnam's wasted potential, and yet one never sees the potential he wastes. For a man well into his thirties, he has precious few ideas. The one time he fully expresses himself, and especially his love of drinking, to a bartender, he sounds sophomoric, like a much younger man than he is. One gets no sense of a person who has truly experienced life, as even alcoholics do. Then again, maybe that's the point.Ray Milland plays Birnam exquisitely. His natural refinement, contrasted with the prosaic, nasty, ugly business of finding a drink, makes the film much more interesting and dramatic than it would be with a more "regular" actor; and his Britishness is scarcely noticeable. The rest of the cast is for the most part more than adequate, with Jane Wyman competent, if unexceptional, as his journalist girl-friend. Philip Terry is interesting and believable as Wick, and I wish he had more dialogue. Frank Faylen's brief, inspired performance as a sadistic male nurse enables him to steal his few scenes with Milland. I especially like his description of the d.t.'s ("little turkeys in straw hats"). Overall, a fine film, though not Wilder's best. The previous year's Double Indemnity showed that his caustic style of film-making was better suited to operatic melodrama; and of his later films I can think of none so emotionally brutal as this one, as they are more mix and match, a little seriousness, a little humor, an outrageous idea or two, but nothing so rugged as Birnam's escape from the drunk ward, clad in a stolen institutional bathrobe, as he meanders about in the freezing morning air.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Billy Wilder masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before "Sunset Boulevard" there was this great movie! There were striking chords of resemblance but this one struck deeper with me. "Double Indemnity", "Witness for the Prosecution" and "Some Like it Hot" were in their own right, masterpieces, but of them all, this is probably the one most overlooked. It hasn't the humourous comedy of "Some Like It Hot", nor the suspenseful dilemma of "Double Indemnity" or the compelling wonderings of "Witness for the Prosecution". Its theme, the brutal, hard hitting effects of alcoholism. What makes it fresh after almost 60 years in release is the continual lurking problem itself. The obsession with the bottle was as dark and gritty a Hollywood film as it could have been. In a time where gaudy musicals and cheesy comedies ruled the Tinseltown roost, the arrival of a film like "The Lost Weekend" could not have come at a better time. The best picture of 1945 is still as effective as ever, compelling in its mastery, delivering on its promises without a waste of words or a waste of the Paramount megabucks.Ray Milland, as the tormented writer gave one of the best performances I have ever seen. Watching his suffering, his confusion, his discontent made it a nail biting experience. His Academy Award that year was extremely well deserved. Alone as the sole subject of this film, it could still make a great movie. It also introduced me to Jane Wyman. Her part was not as large, but it brought forward the point of the reason of being a person around a man self destroyed which in turn hurt all those close to him, a desperate woman so wanting to help him. Some parts of the film disturbed me, notably the hallucination mouse and bat sequence, I could not even bring myself to watch the whole thing and that's the first time in years that has happened which has not incorporated the aid of a remote control.The confused writer theme was also something to which I could relate. The struggle to deliver words to paper which can be dreamed of in greatness but cannot be brought is often an ongoing struggle. At least I don't have the other problems. I'm not unemployed, addicted to drink and an adult. I'm only fourteen. The cream of the crop, and a golden Hollywood great. One of the best dramas I have ever seen. Highly recommended for the thinking person. This movie should be enough to turn people off excessive drinking.Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

The fact that this film does not gloss over as most films do, the fact that only through groups like AA can someone hope to break from its clutches, makes up for the fact that it seems dated today.

		<shortDescription>Delirium is a disease of the Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) Classic alcoholic film that took alcoholism out of the closet and put it right smack dab on the silver screen back in 1945 that's as shocking and nerve wracking as any horror or war movie released back then and far more personal with alcoholism being an illness that can strike both man and woman rich or poor as well as young and old alike.Don Brinam, Ray Milland, recovering from his latest drunken binge has agreed with his caring but frustrated brother Wick, Phillip Terry,to go to the country to dry out over the weekend. With Don's Girl Helen, Jane Wyman,coming over to wish her sick and troubled boyfriend a good time. Don jumps at the first opportunity to postponed his trip, from the 3:15PM to 6:00PM train leaving Penn Station, by getting his brother to go with Helen to the concert so she won't be alone. Wick quickly sees through Don's generosity by finding a bottle hanging outside the window, that Wick empties into the sink. Telling Don that he just about had it with him and his drinking and if he doesn't show up at the train station Wick will just as well leave without him.Finding $10.00 that Wick left for the cleaning lady, in the sugar jar, Don goes outside to the liquor store to stock up. After buying two bottles of cheap booze Don shoots down to the local and friendly bar Nat's ,Howard Da Silva, place and juices himself up with 12 shots of rye whiskey passing out altogether. When Don comes to he finds out that he missed the train to go, together with his brother Wick, to the country for a weekend of rest and relaxation and most of all away from the bottle. The weekend turned out to be a living nightmare for Don and by the time it was over he was ready to end it all with a bullet in his alcohol soaked brain.Academy Award acting by Ray Milland with a truly haunting and mind bending musical score by Miklos Rozsa makes "The Lost Weekend" a movie to watch over and over again. Without it losing any of the impact that it has in scaring the hell out of you on the dangers and horrors of alcoholism. A disease that kills more people in the USA in any year then all of the drug, prescribed or illegal, related deaths combined!During his lost weekend Don ends up with his neck almost broken by falling down almost dead drunk from a flight of stairs with him almost getting arrested when he lifted the purse of a young lady at a ginmill where he loaded himself up with drinks but didn't have the cash to pay for them. Don then ended up in the tank, the alcohol ward at Bellevue Hospital, where he got to meet the male nurse in charge Bim ,Frank Faylen, who seemed to be immune to the horrors that booze does to people. Probably because he's just about seen it all in the over 20 years he's been handling rummy's and boozers, with countless numbers of them dying,in the tank.Don later taking off from the alcoholic ward during a nighttime disturbance, of one of his fellow inmates, ends up stealing a bottle of rye from a liquor store right in front of the startled owner and then after making it back to his ransacked apartment guzzles it down and ends up getting the DT's. That experience almost drives him out of his mind and back into Bellevue Hospital but this time into it's mental, as well as alcoholic, ward. By the time the weekend is over Don had just about given up any hope of living knowing that he'll never win his battle with the bottle. He just doesn't want to live the life that he's been living the last six years as a stone drunk alcoholic.It's when everything looked hopeless for Don with all those that he loved and cared for deserting him, or Don deserting them, for a bottle of rye whiskey that a miracle happened. It was that he finally found himself, with a lot of help from Helen, and what caused that to happened was the hellish weekend that he just survived from. Don learned that he wasn't the total failure that he always thought that he was by surviving what most people in his condition would have long succumbed to: an alcohol induced and paranoid driven "Lost Weekend".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood's first serious look at addiction isn't perfect but has still aged surprisingly well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Lost Weekend' was Hollywood's first serious look at addiction, and while it is far from perfect it has aged surprisingly well. This was Billy Wilder's follow up to his Film Noir classic 'Double Indemnity', and it is I admit nowhere near as impressive. But I think the few flaws it has (an unconvincing ending, a few contrived moments that don't ring true, some dodgy special effects) aren't enough to ruin what is mostly still a powerful and effective movie close to SIXTY years after it was made. It's flawed true, but still much more believable and less cliched than over hyped nonsense like 'Requiem For A Dream' which was dated sixty MINUTES after it was released. Ray Milland's superb performance is what makes this movie work even today. Milland won an Oscar for it and I believe he deserved it. I haven't seen anything else by him that comes close. I wasn't too knocked out by Jane Wyman ('The Yearling') who played his fiancee, but Phillip Terry ('Born To Kill') was good as his brother, and even better were Doris Dowling (who popped up thirty years later in 1970s trash classic 'The Car'!) as a good time girl, and best of all Howard De Silva ('They Live By Night') as Nat the bartender. His scenes with Milland, and the opera sequence were my favourites. 'The Lost Weekend' is far from Wilder's best work but it's still better than 90% of the crud spewed out by Hollywood these days, so don't overlook it. It's still a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fine movie up to a point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ray Milland plays a very suave drunk in this classic film. The portrayal of alcoholism is simultaneously exaggerated and sanitized, as seems typical for films made under the Hollywood production code, but this is nonetheless a genuinely good movie. It is told out of sequence, and Wilder does a good job mixing plot elements chronologically to slowly reveal to us the nature and history of the relationship between the male and female leads. The flashback to their meeting and courtship period takes us to a period before things got so bad for our character and then shows us just how things got quite so muddled. Yes, the same general comment can be made of many flashback sequences, but this one has a special charm. It reminds me of another famous flashback sequence; I hope I am not being too bold in saying that it foreshadows the Deniro scenes in The Godfather Part II. The big problem with Lost Weekend is the ending, which is weak enough to substantially undermine the overall quality of the movie. The effect is what we would get from a deus ex machina, but Wilder doesn't even give us the satisfaction of showing the machine. Movie goes roughly like this: character is drunk and depressed or hungover and depressed and his life is falling apart; in the final 60 seconds he turns his life around because, well, just because it finally seems like a good idea. Unsatisfying to say the least. Still, the bulk of the movie is quite enjoyable, and ultimately I was happy for our protagonist, scoundrel though he was, even as I was disappointed in the final pages of the script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'm not a drinker; I'm a drunk."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LOST WEEKEND is a film about the state of life of any man. In general, every life is full of ups and downs. Alcoholism, as a kind of escape from his own life is more than stable. Lack of self-confidence, poverty and lack of understanding are just some factors with which the main character struggles. Alcohol is a deadly rescue. The story is quite realistic and morbid. The main protagonist is a split personality. We get to know him through the illustration of a drunk and writer in the attempt. I have to admit that this movie at first viewing fascinating.I have to admit that the minor characters have been pretty naive. I have the impression that the main protagonist and bottles of alcohol tell a story, while minor characters just go and get lost. Practically everything is told in a couple of days where we can see how a man touches a human and moral bottom. Unwritten parts of the novel through flashbacks working perfectlyRay Milland as Don Birnam is simply brilliant. He revealed the ugly nature of man, through the degradation of life, weakness and shame.Jane Wyman as Helen St. James had the demanding role of loyal girls. In this case, love knows no boundaries. The lack of emotion is so obvious and I her character can not imagine as a kind of salvation or the voice of reason.Other characters are "stations" on the road to environmental ruin. Caring and exemplary brother who miraculously evaporate at the beginning of the film. Ironic and gritty bartender, sadistic medic or girl in love at the bar.Lost Weekend is a very honest and disturbing drama. The musical score perfectly corresponded to the theme of the film. I must say that I am not satisfied with the contrived happy ending. The main protagonist in 5 minutes free his life of suffering. It's all in the decision, but the decision came suddenly and utterly illogical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder takes on alcoholism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time when liquor flowed like water. There was such a thing as the three-martini lunch. In James Whale's "Remember the Night," everyone at a party is smashed and the next day can't remember anything about a murder. A woman I interviewed who dated Frank Sinatra said the liquor was everywhere in those days. In the series Mad Men we saw people drinking in the office. Alcohol was part of doing business. As World War II came to an end, many returning soldiers had developed the disease of alcoholism to deal with PTSD.In 1945, Billy Wilder tackled the subject with his film "The Lost Weekend" starring Ray Milland, Jane Wyman, Phillip Terry, Howard da Silva, and Frank Faylen.Ray Milland plays Don, a writer with writers block who, as the film starts, is an alcoholic with 10 days of sobriety. His brother Wick (Terry) is taking him to the country for the weekend. Wick winds up going along as Terry begins his drunken weekend. Desperate for money, he steals the money intended for the cleaning woman. Ten dollars certainly went a lot further then - he goes into a bar and has quite a few drinks.Meanwhile, his girlfriend Helen (Wyman) is determined to help him and is furious with Wick for leaving and not helping him. "If he'd broken his leg, you wouldn't leave him," she cries. "It's the same thing. He has a sickness." He trashes his apartment looking for liquor he's hidden. He steals her coat to pawn it, and finally, in a heartbreaking scene, he pawns his typewriter (something Billy Wilder and other writers did in Berlin to make ends meet). His situation goes from horrible to more horrible as time goes on.Ray Milland gives a searing portrayal of Don, a man who says, "Most men lead lives of quiet desperation. I can't take quiet desperation." Usually a charming, light leading man, he shows Don's disintegration externally and internally, as he cares about nothing, only where to get his next drink.This was also a new kind of role for Jane Wyman, formerly a snappy blond. Here's she's a loyal, devoted woman, determined to help Don overcome something she probably doesn't really understand. As the film goes on, Don becomes even ruder and nastier until you hate him and you don't know why she doesn't leave.The New York outdoor locations are fantastic - one can see the Third Avenue el train, which was eventually taken down. The gray days, the dark bars, the pawn shops, the rain, the drunk ward, all demonstrate the darkness in Don's life. Brackett and Wilder's script is stark, tense, and powerful, and Wilder directed it in his usual focused way, keeping the action going.People laughed at the first showing of this film, but it wasn't funny then, and it isn't funny now. Others found it disgusting. Hopefully we've grown more in our understanding of this disease. With the sad stories of people like Gail Russell, Jeffrey Hunter, and William Holden, to name just a few, we see this self-destructive illness for what he really is - a killer.</fullReview>

(If anything, THE LOST WEEKEND is a relatively TAME depiction of alcoholic addiction.) I had a Mother, but no Father (HE loved one thing, and one thing only: The Bottle, which comforted him and laid him to rest and took him away from Life and all its responsibilities). "Drink responsibly" is an oxymoron you seldom hear any more; like any addiction, alcoholism is a self-inflicted malady, so it's hard to feel sympathy for the hardcore Drunk (at least, it is for ME). In my entire life, I've never seen so much untapped potential wasted as when someone takes up The Bottle (or drugs). Remember always: "Denial is NOT a river in Egypt."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For some reason I can watch this film over and over...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... and not get tired of it. Ray Milland's performance is riveting and, if you are watching for the first time, the first scene will do nothing but raise questions, getting you involved. How did Don (Ray Milland) get to be such an alcoholic? Why does his brother have a right to say how he lives? What does he do for a living? Why does such a seemingly together woman like Helen (Jane Wyman) stay with this guy for three years? All of these questions get answered slowly as the movie unravels over one long weekend that Don was supposed to spend in the country with his brother, but instead spends alone, but thanks to ten dollars that Don's brother left behind, he does not spend it completely alone - he's got money to buy booze.And yet Don doesn't plan ahead. He thinks enough to cover up the two bottles he buys at the liquor store with some apples that he buys to put up on top of the bag as he walks home so neighbors cannot see the booze, but the urgency doesn't come until he is completely out of liquor and out of the ten bucks to get more. And he is willing to do ANYTHING to get that liquor - he'll pretend to be interested in a girl in a local bar who is obviously crazy about him in order to get a few bucks, he tries to trade his typewriter (he's a failed writer) to a local bar owner for a drink, he steals money from a woman's purse in a nightclub to get booze, he even stages a faux hold-up (he has no gun) to get a bottle from a liquor store.And that's it for the entire movie - Don Birnham and his quest for the next bottle eats all of his time and energy. Other characters are just instruments in that quest or are in the form of flashbacks to tell you how Don got to where he was in the first scene. And then there's that haunting score that runs the length of the film. Everything is brutal realism UNTIL the last scene. Maybe it was the censors, but today it could have cost the film some Oscars.A couple of questions never raised. How did Don's brother Wick manage to support himself AND Don all of these years IN New York City? Didn't Wick ever long for a life and family of his own? There's got to be a limit to anybody's patience and charity, even if they are kin. Another question from an old film buff like me - Isn't it odd how the Great Depression and World War II magically disappear from sight in the past that Don is recollecting. 15 years of American history that effected everybody seems to have no place in Don's story. To look at this film, this shiny bustling post-war world has always been there. This is the turn of film from Depression and world war - collective struggles - back to the struggle of the individual with himself, the beginning of noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Painstakingly Realistic Portrait Of Alcohol Dependency</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Billy Wilder's follow-up to his mighty successful Double Indemnity is a deeply unsettling yet painstakingly realistic illustration of alcoholism that takes the subject of alcohol dependency far more seriously than any other Hollywood film before it &amp; is absolutely uncompromising with its content.Based on the novel of the same name, The Lost Weekend tells the story a chronic alcoholic over a four day period which begins with him evading the country weekend planned by his brother &amp; girlfriend and covers his desperate attempts to get himself a drink while flashback reveals the past events of his life, most of which went wrong because of his drinking habits.Co-written &amp; directed by Billy Wilder, The Lost Weekend shows that there is nothing funny about an alcoholic or any sort of addiction for that matter. The film also hits the mark when it comes to depicting the inner struggle &amp; helplessness one feels when attempting to resist a strong urge for what the person is dependent on, and the desperation that follows when it isn't around.The events of the picture are nicely photographed in black-n-white, the pacing is controlled for the most part, background score is wonderfully composed, humour infused in the story is pitch-black and Ray Milland delivers a truly magnificent performance as our protagonist for he sells his character in an extremely convincing manner &amp; his depiction of an addict is highly relatable.On an overall scale, The Lost Weekend is another fabulous piece of filmmaking from Billy Wilder that paints a devastating portrait of addiction, is technically sound in all aspects &amp; benefits greatly from Milland's terrific on-screen work. Entertaining, enlightening &amp; alarming, The Lost Weekend is an essential cinema that deserves a watch or two from every film lover out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lost Weekend takes a surprisingly frank look at alcoholism for a 1940's film. Unlike a lovable alcoholic as in the Pulitzer Prize winning play "Harvey" of the same era, Don Birnam is an alcoholic who lies to and uses everyone who loves him, like real alcoholics, because his next drink is the most important thing to him.There are many intriguing scenes in this movie. There is a scene where Birnam tries to steal a lady's purse and gets thrown out of the bar in humiliation. There is a scene in Bellevue. There is a scene where Birnam gets the DT's.The end, where Birnam suddenly quits drinking and starts writing his novel is perhaps the only hard to accept scene in the movie. It is not that unrealistic?some alcoholics do recover?but it is hard to imagine Birnam quitting without "falling off the wagon" again. Perhaps it is hard to imagine any real alcoholic successfully quitting, because it is so hard for them to do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lost Weekend is a true masterpiece; undoubtedly the best movie of 1945. Ray Milland, as failed author Don Birnam, gives one of the most powerful and sympathetic portrayals of alcoholism ever to grace the screen. And what an alcoholic he plays!He's the kind of drunk who can't stand a single minute without booze. For him, waiting till nine for the bars to open is torture. He downs shot after shot of whiskey until he's broke and the bartender is begging him to stop. There's not a bar in town that will give him credit .At home, he can down an entire bottle in one night. And he doesn't care what he drinks either. "Two bottles of rye", he tells the clerk at the liquor store. "What brand?" "The cheapest, you know that."He drinks with the sole intention of getting drunk, which he is nearly half the time. He's smart, ambitious and witty when he's sober, but that never lasts long. He's never finished a novel or held a steady job. For the last five years, he's lived on the charity of his brother Wick (Phillip Terry). And in his moments of lucidity, he understands all of this.On of the film's best scenes is the flashback to when his girlfriend Helen first discovers his condition. He couldn't stand to meet her parents because he knew that his past would come to light. Now he lays it all out for her in no uncertain detail. He pretty well sums things up when he tells her "I'm nothing, I've never been anything, and I'll never be anything." That was three years ago, but she's still with him. His advice to her is dead on- If she were smart, she'd run away as fast as she can. Yet she refuses to give up on him. But now, left alone for the weekend after he misses a train to the family farm, he hits rock bottom like never before. With no-one to stop him, he drinks like there's no tomorrow, both at home and at his favorite bar. After recounting his past to his bartender Nat, he decides he's finally going to do it. He's going to start- and finish- a novel.But he can't even write the first line before he's desperate for a drink. Still completely wasted, he sets out do the unthinkable: hawk his typewriter for money to buy more booze. But every pawn shop he comes to is closed. Before his odyssey is over, he'll have spent a day and part of a night in the hospital drunk ward and pulled off a daring liquor store robbery without a weapon. And once he's finally home, that's when the hallucinations start, just like the nice man at the hospital told him they would.And from there it gets worse. He finally reaches the point where he doesn't want a drink anymore. He just wants it all to end- forever. In the movie's tensest scene, Helen tries to talk him out of it any way she can, even encouraging him to have another drink. At this point, I didn't see any way that this could end in anything but tragedy. But it's here that the director, Billy Wilder, did the impossible. He not only ended the movie on an uplifting note, he actually did it without making me feel cheated. That is why I give The Lost Weekend a perfect ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie but not really one of Wilder's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For alcoholics there is a lot of lessons to be learned in the film that earned Billy Wilder his first academy award for best director The Lost Weekend. Though not really a film that deserved to win best picture this movie knows a lot about alcoholism and how addicting it could be when people didn't know the effects at the time of it's release. The movie stars Ray Milland as Don Birnam an alcoholic writer who binges on alcohol for exactly 3 days straight, (as well as deserving his Oscar for proving the bad effects.). Though not a great film it also tells us how crazy a drunkard can really be. It's Milland who gives a better performance than anyone else in this film but the Jane Wyman performance is a little tiny problem with it, which that was in the ending scene when Birnam wants to kill himself but Wyman's character does one good thing and that is persuade him not to kill himself but the biggest mistake is that SHE TRIES TO MAKE HIS ALCOHOL ADDICTION A LOT WORSE THAN IT WAS BEFORE. Wilder does a decent job with directing this film, but one thing just leaves me with one question, Why did this film get so much Oscars including best picture that it didn't deserve?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the depths of despair, we see a brilliant mind washed in a sea of Alcohol.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a movie and what a performance by Ray Milland. Don Birnam is an alcoholic writer who just can't get started on anything. He is brilliant and tortured by his own alcoholic demons. This is based on the true life of the writer Charles Jackson. If ever there was a more truthful look at a drunk, this is probably the best. The only other true look would be The Days of Wine and Roses. There are many light moments where Milland goes into line after line of how he wound up this way. How his brother Wick had given him a place to live and a few dollars for shows and smokes. Jane Wyman is the long suffering girlfriend who won't give up on him. Sometimes we feel that she won't give up because she needs to be right for him and herself. I like Howard DeSilva as the bartender Nate. Even though we despise him for giving the booze to Don, we really feel he does in some way care for this man. He along with Wyman see touches of a really wonderful mind being wasted in a bottle. Milland lost a lot of weight to play this part that was turned down by numerous big stars. He is still so handsome that even when he is in the depths of a alcoholic weekend we wish he would clean up and get back to his life. Many people do not realize that the street shots were from hidden cameras in store fronts and vans. So many people really thought that Milland staggering along was really drunk. In fact some people called the studio to warn them about his bender. Magnificent as he was in this film we had always wished that he had more dramatic parts like this one. The industry just never gave him the best of the best. Well deserved Oscar for this great actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When everything... conspires to make a masterpiece....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lost Weekend" is the first film with Ray Milland that I have seen, it is the film that revealed to me this immense actor, until then unknown to me, and yet I was reluctant, until now, to write a review for it. I was afraid that my English would be inadequate in order to do it justice. So it is with great humility that I will try it now...From the very first scene, I knew that this film was a masterpiece, far superior to other Billy Wilder works I had seen, and this impression grew as the film advanced.It deals with a man who is no "hero", who is not involved in earth shattering events or conflicts. It is the story of Don Birnam, a man who drinks and can't stop drinking, although there is no real cause for him to be unhappy or desperate. He is handsome, cultured, intelligent, educated, loved by a beautiful and kind woman and by a devoted brother. Very much qualified to work in a decent job, and make his life very pleasant, happy even. But, he was unfortunate in having a very promising start as a writer, and when this talent proved somewhat short-lived, he could not settle for less and instead, took refuge in drinking. We follow his footsteps as he goes lower and lower, losing his dignity and his self-respect, and all the time we feel no pity for him, only anger. Anger because he throws everything good that life has to offer him, for nothing, for an illusion, for the fake reality of the bottle...The film is superbly written and directed by Billy Wilder, simplicity and lack of pompousness being the key words, designed on the basis of CINEMA VERITE, almost like a documentary, only not about a humdrum individual,but about a gifted child that goes to waste because he refuses to compromise. To say that Ray Milland is magnificent as Don Birnam, is to say very little. He has BECOME that lost man, he lives his misery, minute by minute, and he is even more heart-breaking because he never allows us to forget the quality of the man underneath the surface, which is in direct contradiction with the degrading exterior. And despite the fact that the situations in which Birnam is involved are so excessive, Milland manages admirably to maintain a good measure. He alternates the bitter humor and self sarcasm of the frustrated writer with the dramatic climax some scenes call for, and brings to life this complex and fascinating human being. Milland carries the whole film and makes the experience an unforgettable one for the viewer. One of the most deserved Academy Awards of all time! The other actors are all very good. Jane Wyman is perfect as Helen, the supportive girl friend, Doris Dowling amazing as Gloria, the bar girl in love with Don, Phillip Terry as Don's brother Wick, Howard Da Silva as Nat, the bar-tender and Frank Faylen as Bim, the male nurse. I loved everything in this film, from the atmospheric photography, to the eerie music by Miklos Rozsa, all contributed to make this a very unique film... The ending did not appear unrealistic to me, after all we know that the real Don, the novelist Charles Jackson, managed to control his drinking and write his book, and be there when it was transported to film. The film's happy ending was an.. intermediate one, and it does not exclude the possibility that later on Don might not start again this vicious circle, since we also know that Jackson finally committed suicide. No assurances for a permanent happy ending can be given, anyway. After all, even when the boy marries the girl and they live happily ever after, how can we be sure that they will still be together after some years?One final point that I MUST make, although slightly irrelevant: Apart and beyond the acting, Ray Milland is so sexy in this film, it is unbelievable! Tall and very slender, he is like a horse whip, and so intense and so vulnerable at the same time, that our imagination runs wild.... Poor Gloria, how I understand you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delving into the real issue of alcoholism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Motion picture theaters playing this in 1945 must have been stone dead quiet as the saga of a failed writer suffering from a major drinking problem unfolded. As played by the handsome Ray Milland in his Oscar Winning role, this character is examined thoroughly, as are the people around him-his brother, his girl, and his favorite bartender. The reasons for his drinking are clear. It isn't just that he is a failed writer suffering from one of the greatest causes of any type of addiction (boredom), there is an inner self-hatred that is so great he looses all sense of moral judgment and no crutch can hold him.Jane Wyman shot from being an actress in light comedy with supporting dramatic roles to a full fledged star in this, and the evidence of greater things to come is so prevalent. You'll never forget the sight of her, a kitten in a leopard coat, so filled with unconditional love that she'd risk everything to save him. Phillip Terry is his tough-talking brother who even pretends to be the one with the problem at first to save Milland and Wyman's relationship, but you can only lie for someone for so long. Then there is Howard da Silva as the tough-talking bartender hiding a big heart. It is obvious that he truly cares about Milland even when bashing him verbally about his drinking. Da Silva was robbed of an Oscar Nomination for this, one of the greatest supporting performances of all time.Milland takes you deep into the soul of this likable and despicable man, and if at times his actions seem ridiculous, there is an underlying reason for everything he does. Yes, the withdrawal ward at Bellevue sequences are certainly horrific and difficult to watch, and if you let yourself go, you may find yourself chuckling at Milland's withdrawal visions. There is definitely a comic vibe to some of Milland's efforts to escape from his world through drink, especially the reaction of the piano player in the café where Milland resorts to theft to continue to get plastered.The film cleverly tells its story through several forms of flashback, so the audience is not sure at first why Milland's brother is so hard on him and why Wyman continues to stand by. But the humanity of each character is explored, and the atmosphere of New York City too is given a chance to be revealed with Milland desperately trying to find a pawn shop open on Saturday and learning about an agreement between the Irish and Jewish owners so they don't cut into each other's business. Billy Wilder continued his rise as one of Hollywood's top directors, this following "Double Indemnity" with its gritty look of the lives of sinners and how they attempt to redeem themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have a drink why don't you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Weekend isn't the easiest film to watch and get through. It's made during a transition time in films where the subject matter was becoming a little more heavy and more realistic and I say 'realistic' (pertaining to this film) meaning not so much the over theatrics of the acting, but just with alcoholism and conquering our dependencies and fears. The movie is saying sometimes you have to die(metaphorically speaking) before new growth can happen and that's what Ray Milland's character has to do in order to start 'living' again. Also, I like what the bartender said in the movie where "...You do it like that, or like this...". The bartender is saying that it's that easy, you do it now, not later, now. An example is like quitting smoking. It's amazing how we try all these techniques, pills and patches to quit smoking. But a true fact is, that most people quit for good when they just quit like that. Sure you might have to go through hell and back for weeks and months, but it's always the best way, and that's with anything including drugs, alcohol(of course, with heavy drinking and heavy drugs, one needs to go through the withdrawals at a clinic and take a medicine to get through it). A good movie to see for those that need an epiphany about their addictions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don Birnam is an unemployed man who is at the mercy of his caring brother. He wants to become a writer but as the old saying goes "an idle brain is a devil's workshop", Don chucks his ideas and thoughts by drinking in solitude. He has a girl who believes in his ability to become a successful writer and is unaware of him being an inveterate alcoholic. His brother plans for a weekend in the countryside but Don concocts his plans too- to miss the train and he succeeds. He rummages around and finds cash. He goes on a binge for the next couple of days. He is then sent to a Alcohol Rehabilitation Center where the inmates are regular patients except Don. He feels deranged by listening to the frightening yet true stories of few patients and this further exacerbates his condition. He manages to flee from the hospital and with nothing to drink he recollects his love affair and realizes that his dreams of becoming a writer are nothing but shattered with his brain defunct thanks to alcohol. He decides to write a long-abandoned story but his mind is too weak to overcome the temptation of alcohol and he's again inebriated. He realizes he is nothing but a total failure and decides to commit suicide, only to be interrupted by his ever-loving girl who brainwashes him to write about his story of being an alcoholic.This movie is to alcohol what 'Requiem for a dream' is to drugs. This is one of the movies where Billy Wilder, known for his humor in the films, has deliberately made it a serious film to emphasize on the impact of alcohol on people with great aspirations. The movie has some brilliantly-shot and edited scenes which is a rarity in the films of that era. Ray Milland's role required Method-acting and he didn't upset and rightly claimed the Best Actor Oscar.Winner Best Picture, 1946.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale of two identities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of the greatest and most powerful stories about alcoholism that has even been depicted. This is probably also the most moving film about any kind of addiction, and the daunting struggle to overcome it. The Lost Weekend certainly still carries an enormous message more than 65 years after its first screening.Billy Wilder took up a really hard challenge of adapting Charles Jackson's emotional novel in the times when film studios weren't so keen on producing controversial pictures like this one. He wanted to show the world the disastrous effects of a drinking problem in a very graphic way. I must say that every time I watch it it still sends chills down my spine.As we meet Don Birnam, played brilliantly by Ray Milland, he is already affected by the omnipresent power of alcohol (Rye Whiskey, to be more precise). We don't know how long has he been fighting with this brutal 'cancer', but we find out that he has been 10 days sober as of now. His brother and girlfriend are trying to send him on a trip out of town, so he can rest and forget about his troubles. Oh, if it was ever so easy. His extreme needs and possessed cunningness eventually lead to a moment when his brother goes away all by himself, while Don stays at the nearby bar taking one shot after another. And that's when the 'lost weekend' begins.During his four day drinking rampage he tries everything to put his hands on many of the precious bottles of spirit. At first, he is even able to pay for this murderous pleasure. However, when he pours all of the cash down the drain he resorts to really desperate measures in order to satisfy his deepest cravings. He tries to persuade himself that booze makes him happier, as in the scene when he so poetically explains the way he perceives the world after a few drinks. Under the influence he may become every person that he wants to. He is almost invincible. But then comes the day after and the horrible pain and fear. So he has to tackle another few shots to feel at ease. And round and round it goes. The true power of the movie is contained in the psychological overview of Don and the constant battle that he fights in his mind. There are, in fact, two men locked in one body - The Writer and The Alcoholic. Unfortunately, the latter has got more strength and is slowly killing the former. Even the beautiful Helen isn't able to stop that process, with all her strong heart and tremendous bravery.All of this leads to an unavoidable disaster. When he ends up with no money whatsoever he attempts to sell his properties, even the only thing that still keeps him alive - the writing machine. The next step is even more pathetic, as he starts stealing cash from purses and bottles from local shops. Eventually he ends up in a hospice for addicts.This is where he meets, in my opinion, one of the most memorable characters of the film - 'Bim' Nolan. He so calmly tries to explain to Don that this isn't even the worst stage of them all.The worst stage, and perhaps the most thrilling scene, happens during the chilling and disturbing climax of the movie, when Don starts imagining the mouse coming out of his wall and the bat that flies in to eat it. This horrifying scene carries the true, and at the same time deeply metaphorical, meaning of Don's delusional state of mind. By then he finally realizes what has happened to him and that there may be a way to stop it...Undoubtedly, even in the group of such wonderful pictures (i.e. Spellbound, Mildred Pierce) The Lost Weekend truly deserved all of the four Oscar awards that it got. Great visionary Billy Wilder's genius directing, a fantastic and thrilling script, and excellent work by the cast all combine for a picture that will still be compelling for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harsh and Unflinching Look at Addiction's Power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the heels of his seminal noir classic DOUBLE INDEMNITY, the great Billy Wilder, traveling from New York to Hollywood by train, bought a few books for the trip. One of them was Charles R Jackson's THE LOST WEEKEND, and by the time he arrived in Hollywood, Wilder had decided that the novel would be the basis for his next film.This is one of those productions that was jerky getting started. Cary Grant was offered the plum role of Don Birnam, but turned it down, as did Wilder's next choice, José Ferrer. The role was then offered to Paramount contract player Ray Milland, who had been working in films since 1929 and was a solid and dependable player who had not yet realized his potential as an actor. Milland at first refused to do it, partly because the role intimidated him and partly because studio advisers told him it would be the death of his career. But in the end he decided to do it, and it would prove to be his breakthrough role after more than two decades in Hollywood.Milland did his homework; to prepare for the role he spent a night in Bellevue Hospital as a patient, and stopped eating as much, which is something alcoholics often do. And so the film was made with Milland in the lead, Phillip Terry as his brother Wick, who vacillates between trying to help Don stop drinking and unwittingly enabling him, and Jane Wyman as his loyal girlfriend Helen St James.In the original novel, the thing that drove Don Birnam to drink was a homosexual affair; because of the production code, he was given a massive case of writer's block instead. It seems a weak reason to drink, but the hard-hitting screenplay by Charles Brackett and Wilder, and Wilder's sure-footed direction, plus an all-stops-pulled-out performance by Milland, make the whole thing not just convincing but terrifying.The film opens with the brothers packing for a weekend in the country, the object being to keep Don away from the bottle. Helen is there to see them off and to offer words of encouragement. But Don has other ideas; upon discovering that Helen has a pair of tickets to a concert, to which she was planning to go alone, he convinces Wick to take her on the grounds that he wants some alone time. What he does not tell Wick is that there is a bottle of whiskey hanging from a string out the window. Wick finds it quite by accident, and when Don protests he did not know it was there, pours it down the drain and leaves with Helen for the concert.As luck would have it, the cleaning lady shows up; Don tells her to go away and she asks about the money Wick was supposed to pay her. Turns out it is in the sugar bowl in the kitchen; he pockets it and tells the woman to come back on Monday. He then heads for the liquor store where he buys two quarts of cheap rye, and proceeds to his favorite bar to spend some of the change on shots. The bartender Nat (Howard Da Silva) doesn't like him, but as long as Birnam has money he pours for him.Thus begins a terrifying and intense odyssey into an alcoholic binge, complete with a stay in the drunk ward at Bellevue and a case of the DTs. In the hospital he encounters a male nurse named "Bim" Nolan (Frank Faylen), a vicious and rather obvious homosexual who seems to take delight in needling the patients he is supposed to care for.Don manages to escape from the hospital by stealing a doctor's coat when another patient has an attack of the DTs and has to be dragged out by force. But even his stay in the hospital was not "rock bottom." This is a nightmare of a movie, and the hopeful ending seems just a little too pat. Also, it is interesting that a film dealing with alcoholism in 1945 does not at least mention Alcoholics Anonymous, which at the time had been in existence for ten years. Love of a good woman and a sense of purpose are probably not enough to keep an alcoholic sober, but this is a very minor quibble in what is otherwise a realistic, hard-hitting, and unforgettable film.Milland delivers the performance of his career in this one; it won him a well-deserved Oscar and elevated him to major star status, but while he was always solid and dependable and even showed occasional flair, he would never again plumb the depths of a character the way he does here.Wyman, Terry, and Da Silva supply excellent support, but at the end of the day this is very much Milland's film: just Don Birnam and the bottle. And score yet another brilliant and triumphant creation from the great Billy Wilder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie--and I'll drink to that--but not one that Mrs. Guy would enjoy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great movie. Great acting, across the board, by the five main characters; but I don't understand why some people are complaining about TLW not being better known or more popular. Come on, you know why. Just picture it: Mr. Guy comes home from work, Friday afternoon, and says to Mrs. Guy "Honey, make yourself pretty and dress up, because tonite I'm taking you out to town for a romantic evening. First we'll go see a movie about a poor sap who just couldn't get off the bottle. Oh, BTW...there's a cool scene there, of a bat chomping up a mouse". Uhh, I don't really think Mr. Guy will be getting much love that night, and for that I'll have to blame his movie choice in first place. That's why TLW isn't much of a popular choice for the masses and why it will never be.But it is a very well done cinematographic work anyway. I have been watching lately, just by chance, some of Wilder's films and I got to say he's one of the true masters of American cinema. I saw now Double Indemnity and Ace in a Hole, apart from TLW, and what I find amazing about them all is how well they hold their own against any of today's productions despite the years past. Wilder's trademark seems to be that of well thought, smart, plots structured in a tight, wholesome, package played by well rounded, well defined characters, presented all with impeccable cinematography under his masterful direction--not one single superfluous or vacuous scene, image, line of dialog there; not one inch of footage needing to be cut. And the whole deal running at an overall pace that never lets up, that keeps you enthralled, even during the less intense segments, which make any of these films, even those dated because of their content, thoroughly modern?specially AIAH. And these are not just words. That scene I mentioned above, of the bat attacking the mouse, where all you can see is a little tail waging frantically and some blood running down the wall, is one of the most horrifying, blood curling, I have ever seen in a film. Or remember the image of Leo Minosa slowly dying in the coal mine, his face turning gradually black while the wild party goes on up there--another one that will haunt you for a long time. I think American Wilder fans should make an effort to let the young generation in their country to know better the work of this amazing filmmaker.Concerning TLW, the truly amazing thing is how the movie kept me captivated, even during a 2nd viewing, despite knowing already the end of the story. And after having wondered, when starting watching it, if I would still be there 10 min later. And you bet I was, and I was even for a 2nd viewing as said. I'll chalk that up to all what I have just mentioned, plus the superb acting job of everybody involved, added to the haunting, eerie, musical score--specially during the moments when Don starts retreating to his nightmarish, personal, hell--which some reviewers identified here as produced by a theremin, as they call it, while others talk about female high notes, which I think may be closer to the truth.I'm not an expert on the matter but it seems to me that in the main character here is really a mix of two different kinds of alcoholics. I have known a few, quite well, in my life and because of that I think Don is a composition rather than a stereotype. I have known what I call the more or less heavy drinker; the kind of guy who gets wasted two or three times a month, or every week when receiving his paycheck, but who is a responsible worker and a responsible father and husband. We all know someone like that. This guy usually drinks to forget about his frustrations, his failures, the kind for whom the line "he drowns his sorrows in alcohol" was invented. The other kind is the clinical alcoholic. That's the man who goes in binges that can last several days in a row and who's capable of robbing his own mother to finance his addiction. In his case, alcoholism is a disease, not a simple way to escape the unpleasantness of life, and some medical experts suggest that the causes for it may be deeper than a simple habit or the need to escape reality; even genetic roots for it are mentioned. In this movie, Don typically behaves like the second kind but when trying to explain the causes of his alcoholism he situates himself in the first category, that of a man frustrated by his own failures. If we believe what he's saying, he's not in any way a clinical case, as his drinking started with his failure as a writer so we may assume that, as soon as he gets professionally on the right path, his alcoholism will disappear or at least become more controllable. If we assume this being the case, then the happy end to the film doesn't appear that contrived or artificial. That's what I think also.Even if this is a rather dark, pessimistic film for most of its length; and even if the pure mention of is plot may be enough to dissuade many from wanting to see it, it's not by any means a boring or depressing one. I think most of the merit for that belongs, apart from Wilder's sure hand behind the camera, to the fantastic job Milland does with his character. His Don Birman is so likable, so touching, that it doesn't seem in any way forced or unrealistic the fact that people around him--Nat, Wick, Gloria, Helen--would go to such extent to help him and nurse him. This is one case where the Oscar for best actor surely fell in the good hands. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful movie all the way around. Right out of the gate the drama is set up beautifully and Milland really carries this film with great old school acting. I can't say enough about how timeless the story and the conflicts are in this film.The only real criticism I could offer is that the main female role is a bit dated in that she sticks by her man no matter what. Today's modern feminist would likely recoil at the portrayal of the the two main females as being dependent on Don Birnam, but for the time period both Helen and Gloria come across with strength. The supporting characters, especially the brief aspect with Bim, are very strong in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed Ray Milland in "The Major and the Minor" (among other things), so I was glad to see he returned for "Lost Weekend". When Milland teams up with Billy Wilder, they seem to get a lot done. And Milland really carries this film more than any other film of his to which I am aware.The chronicling of an alcoholic's downward spiral is very well done, with the halfway house and the DTs. The scene with the bat and the mouse is pretty bizarre. Sure, the puppets are awful, but it was still one of the most interesting parts. Other films have criticized social problems like drinking, but they tend to be more exploitative. This one was just a good drama with some romance thrown in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whoever thought it was a good idea to back an edgy drama about a helpless alcoholic in 1945 must have clearly been a few fries shy of a happy meal. And yet I'd like to shake him by the hand one day. Because he's put his money on a timeless masterpiece.You have to consider that this movie was made in a day and age when we were a slight tad less objective about recreational drugs. Cigarettes were seen as manly and almost healthy. Alcohol was either seen as the devil's nectar or as a sort of gasoline for the suave and intellectual. Check out the way Dean Martin is portrayed constantly smoking and drinking whilst being a helluva guy in movies to come years later.Most amazingly of all, genius director Billy Wilder manages to make a movie that's edgy and gripping at the same time. He certainly had that ability to pack every scene and make it count. He is much helped by marvelous performances by Ray Milland, Doris Dowling and Jane Wyman.This is a gripping movie -- nothing less. Don't be put off by it dealing with a "heavy" subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harrowing, Intense &amp;Thought Provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's very impressive that so many years after its initial release, "The Lost Weekend" still has the power to make such an incredible impact on people, whether they're watching it for the first time or seeing a repeat viewing. Its strength undoubtedly comes from the fact that its story is told in a very realistic and uncompromising way with alcoholism and the behaviour of the alcoholic both being portrayed in a style which is completely dispassionate but also very sordid.Much of the content of the movie is quite harrowing but readily resonates with contemporary audiences because, despite the passage of time, the behaviour of addicts and the consequences of their cravings remain so recognisable and unchanged.Don Birnam (Ray Milland) is a writer and an alcoholic who's due to take a weekend break in the country with his brother Wick (Philip Terry) but instead frees himself from this arrangement and goes on a booze fuelled binge which lasts for a few days. During this time, through his actions and recollections it becomes clear that he's instinctively turned to drink as a form of comfort and escape during periods when his self confidence has been particularly low. Examples of this are when he suffers from writer's block and also when he avoids meeting his girlfriend's parents because he becomes aware of their doubts about his suitability as a potential husband for Helen (Jane Wyman).Birnam is an intelligent man but his dependence on alcohol has made him rude, deceitful and inconsiderate to others, especially those who care about him most and also it leads to him stealing money when he doesn't have enough to pay for his drinks. His degradation hits a new low, however, when on one occasion, he's so desperate for a drink that he's shaking but due to his lack of funds, he's even refused service at his regular watering hole (Nat's Bar) and in fact, gets thrown out of the place. His feelings of humiliation and despair then reach an even higher point when he finds himself admitted to a secure hospital ward for alcoholics where he's surrounded by the strange sounds and disturbing behaviour of the other patients and where a male nurse called Bim (Frank Faylen) treats him with disdain and perversely, even seems to find his suffering and misfortune rather amusing. Birnam's time in the alcoholics' ward makes him fearful but even greater terrors follow when he experiences frightening hallucinations during an attack of the DTs."The Lost Weekend" doesn't make for comfortable viewing but it is very thought provoking and invites its audience to contemplate how intractable a problem alcoholism really is and also how devastating its effects are on its victims and their loved ones. This excellent movie was the winner of four Academy Awards in 1946 with Ray Milland justifiably winning the Best Actor category in recognition of his truly exceptional performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true unique and daring movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the '40's drama movies were quite popular. They however also were in one way or another all more or less the same. In that period it was difficult to come up with something original for your movie. "The Lost Weekend" however still succeeds at this by picking a daring subject for its time; alcoholism. Daring since it hadn't been really handled before in such a direct way in a movie and it in general wasn't a very much talked about subject in its time. The the liquor industry even offered the studio lots of money to not release this movie, thinking that this movie would be bad for business. And rightfully so, fore "The Lost Weekend" is a great and powerful movie, showing the extreme downsides of alcoholism and how it can destroy your life and it of those around you.You don't really have to read much into the author or the novel this movie got based on to see that the main character and the overall story got based on his own life. Only a man who has been through alcoholism himself could write such an emotionally detailed and striking story. The why's and how's are all being handled, something that just can't be done if you haven't been through any of these events yourself.It's a real involving movie. Even though the main character seems like a lazy bum who benefits from- and abuses the kindness of others, you still constantly feel for him and want things for him to go well. This is of course also not in the least thanks to Ray Milland's fine acting performance, who deservedly so received an Academy Award for his role.The acting in general within this movie is just great. Each and ever actor in this movie gives one great performance, that works out as powerful for the movie. It uplifts the story and lets it all work out even better. But it's of course also due to Billy Wilder that the story and movie in general works out so effectively. His handling of the story, actors, characters, dialog is all just all done so extremely well. He also received an Acedemy Award for his directing of this movie. The movie even won the award for best picture in the same year movies like "Spellbound" and "Mildred Pierce" were nominated.Basically all that this movie is about is about a failed drunk writer, who spends one entire weekend looking for a way to get his liquor. It's such a simple yet terribly effective concept. Due to its writing, directing and acting it all works out and makes "The Lost Weekend" a truly involving movie. The movie is all the more an accomplishment once you consider that this movie got made in 1945, a time at which it was still a quite controversial subject for a movie to handle. Many though beforehand this movie would destroy the career of those involved but instead most of them flourished afterward and the movie itself also became quite an huge hit, that sweep the awards.What also deserves to be mentioned is Miklós Rózsa's musical score, that just like this movie itself, was quite unique and unusual for its time. It was the first soundtrack to feature a theremin, the instrument that later would get used so much in the sci-fi genre, especially during the '50's of course.A truly brilliant, effective gripping movie about a for its time still controversial and untouched, daring subject.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A subject well handled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just noticed this movie is from 1945, but it still holds water. The movie touches different aspects of alcoholism: the thirst, the craving, the reason, the mental- physical effects, the embarrassments etc and these are all put well in a scene towards the end of the movie. Acting like a drunk is a difficult job since a lot of the actors tend to overdo it but this guy kept it pretty natural throughout. Some of the other aspects pointed to in the movie were how this drunkard's girl friend wants to help him get out of this addiction because usually human beings tend to distance themselves when they have such problems in their love partners but this girl stands next to him rock solid even though his own brother ends up raising his hands. Drunkard's relationship with the bar tender, the bar girl is all done how its done in the real world. The best part of the movie was the bat and the mouse sequence, because I have seen it happening with other people but I could never understand why it happened but this movie is a work of class since it shows the whole process. The scenes have been put together in the perfect sequence and make the movie look smooth and logical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An incredible story. This film deserved every award it received, particularly Ray Milland and Billy Wilder (it should have got one for Music as well, with its gripping score and the haunting sound of the Theremin. Playing a man with obvious intelligence, but yet, an incredible problem: alcoholism. A man who tried, but succumbed to the shot glass and bottle. One of the most tearing scene, is when he walks through the city with his only possession, his typewriter, desperate to pawn it for more booze, only to find they are closed in observance of a religious holiday. The anguish. His adventure into madness in the asylum. The terror of the night, and the desperate wait in the morning. The final torture; his lapse into the nightmare of delirium, which is as tense a scene as you will see in any movie. And the end. Does he succeed? Or is his fate of millions of people, falling into the cliff, and never recovering. Milland is brilliant, he plays this role almost like he really lived it (and it's my understanding that he was a heavy drinker in real life). It has the same drama as "Days of Wine and Roses", but not quite the romantic rope that is constantly interlinked in that particular movie. A movie that that is tense from the very note of the opening title. The brilliant film editing that portrays his hallucinations in a terrorizing fashion. I have seen this movie in recovery, and there are parts that still give me the chills, just like Milland. Get or rent the DVD version, excellently remastered. And the book that this is based on, written by Charles Jackson is equally up to the task, and its writing makes you not want to put the book down. A movie that should be seen in treatment centers. One is too many, a million's not enough, and this movie shows it. See it today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark Look at Life from the Bottom of a Shot Glass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this movie, I spent three days trying how to figure out how to open my review, ultimately deciding to do it by saying I had to spend time to figure out how to write my review. Yes, I know it sounds trite, but hey, this needed some thought first.To apply a quote from a friend of mine, "The Lost Weekend" is "not an upper". It is the sordid tale of a man named Don Birnam (Ray Milland), a self-proclaimed writer who keeps finding inspiration in the bottom of a shot glass, only to get perpetually lost in the bottle. Birnam is an alcoholic, and this movie makes no pretense of it. In one of the earliest examples of a major film taking on addiction, the opening shot of the movie shows Don packing a suitcase for a weekend trip with his brother Wick (Phillip Terry), a bottle of liquor hanging out the window on a string. And it just goes downhill from there.Taking advantage of an opportunity, Don ends up spending the weekend drinking. Granted, that's basically the story, but simply saying Don goes on a three-day bender is oversimplifying the plot. In a memorable (if somewhat melodramatic) performance, Ray Milland takes us inside the mind of an alcoholic (or just about any addict, for that matter), and the lengths he would go through for that next drink, including secret stashes, pawning, lies, and even theft. Milland shows us a man who is beyond contempt, beyond shame, beyond hope. His brother, his landlady, even Nat, his bartender (Howard da Silva), all tell him he needs to get off the sauce, but he continues his unrelenting downward spiral.But it's his girlfriend, Helen St. James (Jane Wyman), who stands by him no matter the circumstances. And it is she who has the strength to hold out hope, even while he's sneaking around behind her back (literally). Whether she reaches him is better left for you, the reader, to see for yourself.Technically, "The Lost Weekend" was shot and edited in a such a way that makes the viewer feel claustrophobic, which was director Billy Wilder's intention. Watching this movie, I began to feel Don Birnam's sense of being trapped in the bottle. To add a sense of realism to the movie, most of the exterior scenes were filmed on location in New York City using hidden cameras. In a manner of speaking, it was an experiment in cinéma vérité before it even had a name.Other films have dealt with the issue of alcoholism (see "The Morning After", starring Jane Fonda, and "Clean and Sober", starring Michael Keaton), but this is among the first to tackle the subject head-on. And addiction-themed films, like "Rush", "Trainspotting", and "The Basketball Diaries", owe a debt to this movie.In a nutshell, "The Lost Weekend" is a dark look at alcoholism that was daring in its time. Though somewhat over-the-top by today's standards, it is still powerful enough to hold your attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking for Its Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw The Lost Weekend again last night, and it doesn't lose any of its luster on repeated viewings. This film seems quite tame by today's 'reality show' standards, but it must have been thought a graphic shocker in 1945. At that time, alcoholism, indeed any sort of addiction problem, was simply not discussed, and there certainly weren't rehab centers on every block as there are now. For the hero to wind up in the drunk tank at Bellevue Hospital in New York would have been considered a terrible disgrace back then. If you had to be admitted to the alky ward or the psychiatric ward at Bellevue, you had hit rock bottom.At this point in the history of this movie, it's no longer necessary to say how terrific every performance is, and how great is the direction. The use of the Theramin, still new at that time, is not overdone. It's entirely fitting that every time Don Birnam looks at a bottle, that eerie music plays in his head.Of course, as most others who comment here have already noted, the "happy" ending is a cop-out, and not very satisfying in light of what has preceded it. Very few people, especially if they are in the state Don Birnam was in, could simply say "OK, I just won't drink any more." But, this was Hollywood, and happy endings were generally required, weren't they.Now, my main comment here is about Frank Faylen. His role as the creepy male nurse at Bellevue is one of the most underrated performances in cinema. After having seen him in countless films and TV shows as the gruff, but kind-hearted working man, it was a revelation to me the first time I saw him in The Lost Weekend. He is the soul of unsavoriness in this movie. The implicit homosexuality, sadism and threatening nature of the character are subtly and masterfully portrayed by Faylen. In fact, in his white nurse's uniform, he looks like he's wearing evening clothes, which is altogether fitting, since he takes such obvious pleasure in the misery of his alcoholic patients. It's a night's entertainment for him. For me, Faylen's brief time on camera is the coup de grace of this film. This is not to denigrate any other performance - Ray Milland is wonderful, and his Oscar was well-deserved. In 1945, this would have been a very risky role for a major star to take on - to play an alcoholic, to be willing to look less than glamorous on camera. And he does it most impressively. But it's Frank Faylen, best know as the exasperated father of TV's Dobie Gillis, who wins my personal best actor award. A true tour de force.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A drunkard's story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don was an unsuccessful writer. Although he wanted to write a novel, he did not write any word. That should be mainly attributed to his alcoholism. It looked like that without drink he could not live. Luckily his family did not abandon him. His younger brother offered him an apartment and paid the rent for him. More luckily he met his true love Helen. Could they separate him from alcohol? The situation was not optimistic because he just spoiled a planned weekend.Everything has a limit. If you walk over the line, that will become a disaster. It not only brings bad effect to yourself but people love you. Although it is difficult to control, you have to face it by yourself.Ray Milland amazingly played a disgusting alcoholic. Although Nicolas Cage's performance in Leaving Las Vegas is good, Milland is better. He deserved the academy award (the best actor).An excellent drama. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following up on his sparkling noiresque masterpiece Double Indemnity from the previous year, legendary director Billy Wilder shocked post-war audiences looking for escapism with this hard bitten and bleak look at alcoholism.In an Oscar winning performance, Ray Milland plays Don Birnam, a frustrated writer whose chronic inability to stop drinking is slowly destroying his life and his relationships with those around him that care. Resentful of the fact that he living is a lie of an existence in flat provided by the generosity of his brother (Phillip Terry) and seething with self pity and disgust for having to rely on the emotional support of his long term socialite girlfriend, Helen (Jane Wyman), he spends his days battling his addiction, finding ingenious places in which to hide his booze and writing the openings to his never-to-be-finished novels.As the film begins, Birnam is preparing for a weekend of recuperation away in the country with his brother, but instead he steals $10 from him and flees. What follows is a harrowing three day odyssey as he crashes spectacularly off the wagon; rapidly turning from the eloquent, jovial drunk at the bar making grandiose speeches about Van Gogh, John Barrymore and Shakespeare into a desperate, aggressive shell of a man totally devoid of dignity and resorting to begging for rye, stealing from womens handbags for loose change and finally trying to sell the typewriter that represents his only way to get his life back.Juxtaposing the narrative with flashbacks to the blossomings of his relationship with Helen, Wilder paints a sympathetic portrait of a man being destroyed by his own insecurities and hurtling uncontrollably towards rock bottom. Naturally charming and ferociously intelligent his illness takes away everything until he is left paralysed by nightmarish hallucinations and on the brink of self-destruction. The stark, shadowy cinematography and imagery adds to the air of fatalism whilst the inclusion of genuinely harrowing scenes such as Birnam ransacking his own apartment for a bottle he knows he has hidden but can't remember where and a particularly hellish scene at an alcoholics hospital have lost none of their power over time.Boasting some fine, edgy supporting turns as well as a gargantuan central performance from Milland, this is an unrelenting film that will linger long in the memory.</fullReview>

Billy Wilder shows a claustrophobic, almost palpable stifling drive (desire?) to show what abstaining from the 'demon drink' feels like. Ray Milland in undoubtedly his finest performance depicts the harrowing trial of a man seduced by Alcohol.watching films since, nowadays more concerned with drug addiction, i still have yet to find a better more realistic performance of a tortured man craving his elixir of life...now partaking of a few alcoholic beverages, now and again, i really must see this again, but still i know every scene by memory!! amazing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today, the theme of this film does not shock; indeed, it may be considered by some as rather mundane. Similarly, its raw, grainy, more real than life atmosphere does not strike us as especially noteworthy. At the time it was made and released, however, movies were just beginning to come to grips with "the elephant in the living room" themes. This film and "Snake Pit" were examples. "The Lost Weekend" sent shock waves throughout the country. The direction, the acting, particularly on the part of Ray Milland who was better known at the time as a suave, slightly cynical society-type actor somewhat in the Cary Grant mold, is exemplary and stands up even today. It made an "in" place for decades out of a grungy old bar on the east side of Manhattan, a place where 95% of the young executive types in their shiny tasseled loafers would not otherwise have been caught dead. Toward the end of its heyday, probably precious few of its clientele even knew why the place had such notoriety. The solid, carefully crafted structure, the story line, and, especially, the acting make this film a classic for all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great inside look of a day to day life of an alcoholic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly the first Hollywood film to treat alcoholism in anything resembling a serious realistic way. The film is almost has a sense of an Orson Welles's an uncompromising look at the devastating effects of alcoholism. Directed by Billy Wilder, and based on Charles R. Jackson's 1944 novel of the same title, 'the Lost Weekend' recounts the weekend life of an alcoholic writer, Don Birnam (Ray Milland) where he went on an extreme alcoholic binge. Ray Milland is just the right actor for the job as he really gives out the character willing to do almost anything for a drink. It was no surprise, that he won Best Actor at the Academy Award in this role, that year. What makes the film so gripping is the way, Billy Wilder shot the film. I love the opening &amp; closing shots of the city. Billy Wilder made great use of John F. Seitz's cinematography camera-work. The scene where Don Birnam is frantic looking a pawn store to sell his typewriter along Third Avenue in New York City on Yom Kippur has this sense of neo-realist morceau d'anthologue to it. You see this copy or reused in other films, where the character walking toward the camera as neon signs pass by camera effect. The drab, gritty black and white cinematography of the expressionistic film emphasized the frightening, twisting, and harrowing power of alcohol. The way, the black and white works on shadows gives it an expressionistic film noir style look. The way, the small bottle appear big in the lamp is a great use of illusion. Some of the booze-soaked scenes were shot through or in the presence of bottles, given a warp illusion of human figures. The way, he shot the staid rings of the shot glasses was great. I love the speech, Birnam gives to the bartender, not to wipe it. The enclosing rings is a symbol of the depth of his drunkenness; little vicious circle. By not wiping it, it will continue to go around and around with no end, no beginning. No end, no beginning. That's how Birnam wants it. While, some people might not his story due to his unlikable; the way, Ray acts makes the film, a little bit more charming, sucking you into the story, more and more. The film's musical score by Miklós Rózsa was among the first to feature the theremin, which was used to create the pathos of alcoholism. It's chilling, and reminds me more a tune to an old school classic horror movie, than anything drama relate at the time. The bat and the mouse scene is a lot scarier than some of these modern day horror movies. That really make the silly notice of pink elephants, scary right there. Wilder was originally drawn to this movie due to his recovering alcoholic screenwriter friend Raymond Chandler who fell off the wagon during the filming of 1944's Double Indemnity. Wilder made the film, in part, to try to help Chandler. The story is well-written with crafty dialogue. I love the whole river Nile speech. I like how Gloria (Doris Downling) cheapens herself by shortening her words with abbreviations. It's a way to say, symbolism how cheap she became as a call girl. I also love how very accurate, the film is to the book. The only different is that novel pointed to a homosexual affair as the root of Birnam's troubles; the film version replaced it with writer's block. I guess, talking about homosexuality was still a little bit more taboo than talking about alcoholism, back then. The pacing is great. Still, I found the Opera flashback to be a bit odd. If Don didn't like the opera, why did he go in the first place? Perhaps the only thing saving Don was girlfriend Helen St. James (Jane Wyman), a selfless and incorruptible woman who tolerates his behavior out of love. Helen still seems to be one-dimension, manic pixie dream girl who hasn't nothing else to do besides help Birnam with his life. Doesn't she has a job as an editorial researcher at Time Magazine or not? Helen does, however, tells him with the words, 'while he trying to stop drinking, she is trying hard not to love him'. One other different from the book is the ending. Although it's somewhat unconvincing, rehabilitative 'happy ending' conclusion. The film did had a more optimistic, upbeat and hopeful than the one in the novel. I thought the film ending was ominous and so true of anyone struggling with addiction in that one never really knows if he has really kick the habit or not. Anybody who knows or is dealing with alcoholism should at least, watch this film. When this movie came out in 1945, the liquor industry tried to sway Paramount from releasing the film, allegedly even going as far to bribe Billy Wilder for the negatives remove it from circulation. On the other hand, the more traditional folks tried to keep it from release for fears it would encourage drinking. The film had enormous impact, especially upon returning combat-fatigued GIs from WW II who were adjusting and struggling with their own difficulties in civilian life and often turning into alcohol dependents. In fact, its success spurred further black and white, post-war dramas dealing with social-problems. While the film hasn't aged well due to the number of scratches and mark abrasion, and some people might not find watching a black and white film, attractive. I have to say, a color film like 2012's Flight couldn't give us the depth, this film does. The film did great a poor DVD transfer and here's hoping they get together to properly restore both the sound and especially the picture quality of this classic film. I felt that this was a great movie with a great script, great acting, great directing and hence overall an excellent work of art with a very good message about life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Very simply: The bottle"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest motion pictures of the war years tended to fall into two categories, both inspired by the pressures of the ongoing conflict. On the one hand there were pictures of sentimental, homespun escapism, and on the other those of blunt, cynical realism. At the 1944 Academy Awards the former won the day with the delightfully innocent Going My Way. In 1945 the latter took the top prize with The Lost Weekend. And although the Oscars are not as accurate a reflection of a picture's success as box office statistics, they represent a success of a different kind, for they reward the achievements of which the industry itself is most proud.Despite its grim subject matter, The Lost Weekend appeals precisely because it also has that humanist edge to it. It is, after all a sympathetic and rather touching portrayal of alcoholism. It is also devastatingly authentic. Compare it to The Struggle (DW Griffith's last film) from 1931, which despite also being a tragic tale of excessive drinking, contains the same kind of stereotypical drunkard performances you can see in any comedy of the era. Ray Milland on the other hand expertly plays a forlorn and dilapidated alcoholic, and there is nothing to be laughed at in his shambolic state.The director is Billy Wilder, who unusually for a writer-director had a very keen eye for effective visual storytelling. Wilder fills Don Birnam's world, not with bottles themselves, but with reminders of bottles. Take the opening scene, where we are first shown the whiskey dangling outside the window. We then move up to the billowing net curtain and the swinging blind cord. As the scene goes on, Wilder occasionally sneaks this window into the shot, but only when there is nothing else important (such as the introduction of Jane Wyman) going on. We are reminded of both the location and, by the dangling cord, the look of the whiskey bottle, and like Birnam its presence gives our minds a little tug every now and then. Wilder can't make us feel the alcoholic's thirst, but he can make us aware of the nagging obsession.For added punch, The Lost Weekend actually does something rarely seen up to this point, and incorporates trappings of the horror genre - for example in the nightmarish cinematography, the haunting theremin score and the eerie screams and burblings of the men in the hospital. While this is all very well, sometimes it is done to excess. Bim, the nurse played by Frank Faylen, is too surreal to be believed, and the hallucination sequence is tacky as anything. These are really the only points where The Lost Weekend comes apart. A picture like this may work through presenting reality in as disturbing a manner as possible, but should never swerve from an unflinching account of what reality is.</fullReview>

Don Birnam is a writer.Hes handsome,he has a beautiful and kind girlfriend,he has a kind and self giving brother ...but he has a big problem that whole of the film belongs to it. Don is an alcoholic man and the films story is about his falling in the alcohols snare and his continual failures in giving up alcohol. Helen is one of the kindest and the most lovely women in all of the movies that I've ever seen.She tolerated Dons problem and in all of the time stayed in love with Don. In a scene of the movie,Don says about their love story.It returns to 3 years ago.When they meet for the firs time.Don gave up the alcohol for sometimes but when they wanted to marry and Helens parents wanted to meet Don,suddenly Don heared Helens fathers sayings.It was about Dons faults.About that he was an unemployed man,about that he wasn't a popular writer ...and all Dons failures except be alcoholic!Don went to home before meet the parents and fell in alcohol again. The movie is about an alcoholic,but its about a writer too,about all of the writers who don't have willpower and think that cant write.The movie is about all of the persons who are weak kneed.The movie is about disappointment,about the persons who dispirit ,loos their self confidence and forget their dreams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie for its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Weekend seems a little dated today when much more explicit and graphic accounts of alcoholism and rehabilitation have been written and when knowledge of the science surrounding addiction is much better understood. For the time (1945) it was daring. It does capture beautifully the desperate rationalizations, delusions and dishonesty of a man who is addicted to alcohol. It also captures the naiveté and exasperation of those who care about him.At the time it was much more common to view drunks as figures of fun and the act of getting drunk as extremely humorous. In contrast this movie shows the truly sinister side of alcoholism with depictions of mice chewing holes in walls and bats in the air and a visit to the alcoholic ward of Bellevue hospital where Ray Milland's character hears from an attendant the cynical and true side of alcoholism in its end stages: with patients screaming because of hallucinations of insect and spiders crawling in the night. The use of the musical instrument, the theramin is perfect for the sense of horror inherent in such scenes.The brother and the girlfriend (Jane Wyman) are clearly a little naive when it comes to dealing with someone suffering from alcoholism. The idea that drink is a moral failing is clear from the way they respond to his behavior. They both turn against the Ray Milland character before it is over. The ending is the only thing I find weak at all about the film. The upbeat ending, when improbably the sun suddenly breaks through and Ray Milland's better self suddenly comes to the fore, seems a bit forced. The obviously autobiographical novel written by Charles R. Jackson was a darker story. Certainly Jackson's life was a darker story. He deliberately ended his life at the age of 66.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the best role of his career, one that nabbed him a well-deserved Oscar, Milland is excellent as a frustrated, alcoholic writer for whom "one's too many an' a hundred's not enough." The acting is solid all around, including Wyman as his supportive girlfriend, Terry as his caring brother, and Da Silva as a bartender. From the great opening scene to the bookend closing scene, Wilder's stark visual style is perfectly suited to the theme and his script (with Brackett) contains some memorable lines. The eerie score by Rozsa is fitting if a bit overused. It was the first notable film to tackle the subject of alcoholism and does so with brutal honesty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ray Milland took home the Oscar for his performance as a struggling writer who also struggles with alcoholism. Jane Wyman is the loving sister who no longer wants to enable her unstable brother. There were many broken promises, and Milland seems to just sink deeper and deeper into despair, unable to conquer his addiction.The scene with "the bat and the mouse" is a gruesome visualization of what true alcoholics go through during "dilirium". Shockingly realistic, this film is an appeal to all who suffer from this disease to seek help rather than drift into living hell. A milestone movie with stellar performances by all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm humbled by this movie. It's the 21st Century but this film is always so relevant - a 1940s interpretation of alcoholism but so perfect, the sentiment is timeless. Strange, maybe, to see such horrid subject matter as perfection, but that's just what it is, I believe. I'm coming to terms with the drink and this movie helps so much. This film appears to end happily and, of course, a life of drinking rarely ends so. But Billy Wilder can make it end happily. I realised life is more important than drink when I began to see Wilder's 1940s streetscapes, rather than thinking about the fact that Milland was staggering towards his next bottle of Scotch. I thought: "I'd pay a lot of money to be there." And I wouldn't be there to drink.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's 'The Lost Weekend' is an excruciatingly perfect investigation into the life of a drunkard. Wilder directs the film in a compact form, not wasting shots nor allowing worthless dialogue. Every shot is meticulously pointed and meaningful, which brings out the best in the magnificent performances by Ray Milland and Jane Wyman. It must be difficult to present a drunkard in a sensitive fashion while avoiding either glorifying or condemning him. Yet Wilder succeeds in doing just that, and the end product is a beautiful film that delivers its message like a punch in the face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was good for it's time. If you think about it, it came out when we were either near the end or the end of World War II. I also found out that it wasn't supposed to be released due to the subject matter. Fortunately, it was released and it ended up winning 4 academy awards. One was for Milland for "best actor" and another was for "best picture." I really like Milland's character in the movie. He made his character really hit home to audiences. I also liked his co-star, the legendary Jane Wyman who, as you all may know by now, was once married to President Ronald Reagan! I would say if you haven't seen this movie, it would be definitely worth watching! Every once in awhile, you have to sit down to watch a classic film from back when movies were really good. This is one of those movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Impressive &amp; Satisfying Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder made other movies that are better-remembered, and other movies that work even better strictly as entertainment, but in its own way "The Lost Weekend" is as impressive an achievement as anything in Wilder's filmography. Starting with some very serious material, the movie not only has some worthwhile things to say, but also tells a very interesting and sometimes engrossing story that has lost nothing over the years.One of the numerous fine features of the film is the way that Wilder uses the cast. Ray Milland is well-cast as the alcoholic would-be writer, and he gives a very good performance. His character remains sympathetic despite making many bad decisions. Avoiding all of the stereotyped portrayals of drunks, Milland and Wilder work together to keep him a genuine character with believable problems, showing enough of what is inside without ever going overboard on the emotion. As his friend, Jane Wyman also works well, despite her rather limited range - Wilder gives her a character that requires exactly those things that she can do well. Likewise, the minor characters work well, with each one doing just enough to serve an important purpose, while keeping the spotlight on the main story.The movie also has many other strengths. The story is very nicely-conceived, because it maintains just the right amount of tension, with a very occasional touch of the bizarre, to keep things interesting without ever becoming artificial. The settings and photography must have been very carefully considered, because they seem to complement the action perfectly. The score likewise fits nicely with the story. It's an impressive display of craftsmanship, and, in view of the seemingly downbeat material, it's a surprisingly satisfying movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straightforward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it's undermined by its silly upbeat conclusion, Billy Wilder's frank depiction of a writer (Ray Milland) struggling with alcoholism is engrossing in a pulpy sort of way, a dime novel come to the screen. Wilder, along with his co-scenarist, Charles Brackett, offers both the romantic and nightmarish aspects of drinking but takes the greatest pleasure in its lurid side, highlighting a grotesque section in a drunk tank (hosted by the effeminately sinister Frank Faylen--he's hilarious) and vividly visualizing Milland's d.t.s (he imagines a bat devouring a mouse). There's very little of Wilder's playfulness on display (what little there is comes from Frank Orth as a cloakroom attendant) and even less of his eloquent foreshadowing; but even without his trademarks, he proves he's more than adept at telling a story in a straightforward, absorbing manner. Milland is quite good, trying his best not to ham it up but, when the time comes, giving it all he's got; he may have limited range but he's a hard worker and gets points for effort. Less appealing is Jane Wyman who plays it so straight that you almost feel Milland's continued drinking is excusable. Wyman's opposite, the prostitute Gloria, is played by Doris Dowling and she gets it right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miklos Rozsa's Score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Composer Miklos Rozsa contributed so many fine scores to film, it is difficult to single out his greatest contribution. However, his score for "The Lost Weekend" must stand as an remarkable achievement. Underlying every scene, Rozsa's music brings out the physical and psychological elements in the drama. His score is like a wonderful wrapping for the entire dramatic package. Interestingly, Rozsa often seemed to use "ancient music" styles in contemporary settings. Notice the stylistic similarity between this score and, for example his 1959 "Ben-Hur." Remarkably, it worked, giving the "ancient" style in a modern film a unique kind of class. It produced a grandeur and nobility, psychologically telling the viewer subconsciiously that this is on a higher level than your typical films of a similar nature. To me, it tended to elevate his dramas to an even greater height of importance--and permanance--than they would otherwise have acheived. Rozsa surely must be counted among the giants of all film composers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film's tag line in advertising it screamed The Screen Dares To Open The Starange And Savage Pages Of Shocking A Best-Seller! but that's not exactly accurate. In the 1944 novel by Charles R. Jackson set in the early 1930's the lead character's alcoholism is triggered by a homosexual incident he had in college and his doubts of his sexual identity in the years since. In the film the writer suffers from writers block which is understandably a problem for a writer but what triggered his writers block isn't explored or resolved. This is the story of that writer's battle with the bottle and the concerns of his brother and girlfriend over his deteriorating mental health and alcohol problem as he then goes on an extended drinking binge. Hollywood dealt with alcoholism as a serious subject in many films to follow and many cite this as a breakthrough film on the subject but they are forgetting about 1932's What Price Hollywood and it's spawn 1937's A Star Is Born that both deal with the fall of a prominent character due to alcoholism. Great cinematography from veteran cinematographer John F. Seitz who enjoyed a 45 year career filming such movies as The Arab, Scaramouche and The Prisoner of Zenda in the silent era and went on to do such films as Sullivan's Travels, This Gun For Hire, Five Graves To Cairo, double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard. This is early in the directorial career of legendary writer/director Billy Wilder who directs and also adapted the screenplay with his long-time collaborator Charles Bracket. Bracket also produced the film and he produced double Indemnity that Wilder directed. They co-wrote together such films as A Foreign Affair, The Emporers Waltz, The Major and the Minor and sunset Boulevard, all of which Wilder also directed and together they co-wrote another 10 films including Ninotchka and Five Graves to Cairo. This film won four major Academy Awards for 1945 for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Ray Miland and Best Screenplay. It received an additional three nominations for Best cinematography, Best Editing and Best Original Music for Miklos Roza in the first electronic music in a major film score. This film also won three Golden Globe Awards and the prestigious Palme d'Or at the 1946 Cannes Film Festival. Ray Milland stars and among the supporting cast are Jane Wyman, Phillip Terry, Howard da Silva and Frank Faylen. The disturbing, depressing and creepy world of an alcoholic on a binge and induced to DT's is effectively brought to screen and would have been very timely to returning WWII vets who were turning to the bottle while facing adjustment back in the states after years at war. The main character here however is not a WWII vet as they adapted his character from the the book set in the 1930's not 1945. I suppose the studio didn't want to associate alcoholism with GI's but it would have made sense as a trigger for both his writers block and alcoholism if he had been cast as a former vet trying to resume his writing career after the war. I'm sure the studio didn't want to deal with the homosexual college experience either. It's ending is a little unrealistic. I would give this an 8.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alcohol addiction has never been more harrowingly depicted on film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As great as Days of Wine and Roses is, to me The Lost Weekend is the more powerful film on the subject of alcohol addiction.What is so striking is how much truth there is in how it deals with a sensitive subject and how ahead of its time it is (at a time where it would be so easy to skim over what is so cruel about alcohol addiction, which The Lost Weekend did not), while also being wholly relevant today at the same time seeing as alcohol addiction is very much a big problem now. It is a simple story told harrowingly (the nightmare sequence is still horrifyingly freaky by today's standards) and incredibly movingly, with nothing incoherent about it, with every aspect of the addiction explored realistically and plausibly (doing a better job than Days of Wine and Roses of showing the desperation and guilt). All in a way that is never sugar-coated or heavy-handed, difficult to do for subjects like alcohol addiction and films with a message.The Lost Weekend is both grittily and sumptuously filmed, with first rate location work, it's a very visually pleasing film while also matching the film's tone perfectly. Billy Wilder's direction is also superb, he is sympathetic rather than patronising but is also uncompromising, it was also surprising that he managed to still bring his characteristic mordant wit to a story so grim, something that almost certainly would have jarred in lesser hands. Miklos Rosza provides one of his most haunting scores, it fits perfectly but is never obvious and repetitive, and the use of the theremin was effectively nightmarish but was equally effective showing the pathos of alcoholism (the main reason apparently for its use.It's very thoughtfully scripted too, making the viewer think long and hard about the subject and motivations from the very first scene, and it also develops the characters compellingly. Nothing is black-and-white or stock, in fact it's straightforward but the characters are the kind that are flawed but with enough room for empathising towards them. The acting is very good. Ray Milland wasn't always the most compelling of leading men at times, however in a piece of casting that was courageous and pretty ingenious he gives a career-best turn, rarely did he show this much range or emotional depth than here. Jane Wyman contrasts beautifully in one of her better and more sympathetic performances, while Phillip Terry brings good realism as the brother. Contrastingly their scenes are more soft-centred, but they do still work.The Lost Weekend's only real pitfall, from personal opinion, was the too pat and too-easily-resolved ending in a film that cried out for the complete opposite considering everything that happened before, it just felt tacked on.Otherwise, The Lost Weekend is a wonderful film that came so close to a masterpiece. Maybe not one of Billy Wilder's best films, but this is only because so many of his films are so outstanding (even his lesser films are worth seeing) which is testament to how great a director Wilder was. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The existential roots of addiction in an artist' mind ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fictional writer, Don Birnam was promised to a brilliant career. But after a successful streak, his path to success was distorted to a slow and unremitting descent into hell.Adapted from Charles R. Jackson's novel, Billy Wilder's "The Lost Weekend" is an intense and insightful journey into the desperateness and loneliness induced by alcoholism, carried by Ray Milland's extraordinary performance as a struggling writer, drowning in alcohol his lost dreams of becoming the next Hemingway during a four day drinking bout, the titular lost weekend.The film won four Oscars, including three for Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Picture, establishing Billy Wilder as one of the most defining directors of his generation while making up for the losses of "Double Indemnity" the year before. Ray Milland won the Oscar for Best Actor the same year than Joan Crawford for "Mildred Pierce", both actors coincidentally won for what would be recognized as their signature's roles. The film is also the first and only Best Picture, along with "Marty" to be awarded the Cannes Festival's Golden Palm, an international recognition that, if ever needed, proves how there's much more than a cinematic depiction of alcoholism in "The Lost Weekend".Till now, when it comes to portray the ravages of any kind of addiction on one soul, the iconic image of a sweaty and unshaved Milland stumbling down Third Avenue, carrying his typewriter to the closest pawnshop, is worth thousand words of psychological study. When Don Birnam is about to trade his working instrument for bottles of whisk, he jeopardizes his reason-to-be for his reason to live, it's his life in microcosm. Alcohol was not just an addiction, but a way to make up for lost ambitions, an artifice to ignite the fire of inspiration, but ending up burning the whole soul.Birnam exposes himself to his brother and girlfriend (Jane Wyman) his duplicity: there is Don the writer, driven by dreams of success and Don, the self-loathing alcoholic chained to the conviction that without the right fuel, his soul would never fully express itself. This is the existential dilemma of most artists: a paradoxical mixture of egomania and low self-esteem. The more Don tries to write, the needier he is for alcohol, the more he drinks, the more persistent is his mental block. The ring left by the wet glass is the metaphor of this vicious circle, and the shot on Birnam carrying the typewriter marks the triumph of the drunk over the writer.But the film gets further in its introspection on alcoholism. As Birnam explains to the bartender, it's not just about drinking but having the assurance of the object's presence. The most blatant illustration of the enslavement lived by alcoholic relies on the bottle more than alcohol, the bottle as the metonymic embodiment of its enslavement, the bottle as the haunting shadow coming from the roof, in one of the film's most memorable shots. And when Birnam convinces his brother to postpone the weekend's departure, it's less for drinking than for buying two bottles. Ironically, he's never as resourceful and creative as when he tries to hide his desperateness. And the merit of "The Lost Weekend" is to intelligently concede the short-term positive effects of addiction on a sick mind.When Birnham buys the two bottles, he happily visits his beloved bartender because he got the necessary supply. A few 'rings' after, it's a whole new character, flamboyant, charismatic, who talks about Shakespeare, the Nile and is capable of both poetry and seduction. We have hints of what Birnam is worth as a man, much more as a writer, and we realize the dilemma of addiction: capable to drive one's own inspiration and imagination, comforting the illusion that it serves some purpose. Much more for writers who can conjure up their impotence to write stories by making new characters off themselves, trading the exhilaration to create for the joy to be 'created' by an external element.Ray Milland's performance is the soul of the contradictions governing an addicted soul, that can't express without drugs, but neither with it. As the bartender sums up "one drink's too many, a hundred's not enough" And ultimately, alcohol becomes the center of his universe, when each second of his life is dedicated to a quest for drinks, to drinking and to a painful waiting. The film features many shots on clocks highlight the sensation of a time wasted, explaining the title since this is one lost weekend that he'll never get back, a painful weekend where every remaining bits of dignity will be thrown to the bottomless pit of his dependence, alienating him from society, his brother and almost the love of his life.The film carries many semi-biographical elements, as Jackson himself endured the agony of alcoholism. But, it's Billy Wilder who transcends the story with a film-noir imagery made of unforgettable close-ups tunneling us in Birnam's soul. When he wakes up, it's a close-up on his eyes to show that the first thing he has in mind, is "where is the damn bottle?" The film-noir with its shadowy atmosphere and introspective take on a man's personality beautifully conveys the existential roots of addiction. The bottle is the tempting femme-fatale attracting the poor soul to its nets, like in "Double Indemnity", reconciling its disillusioned victim with his vision of life.Now, is the concluding shot on the bottle hanging from the window on a thin rope a reminder of the past or a Damocles sword pending on Birnam's head like the bottle he hid in the lamp? Or "The Lost Weekend" worked as both the chronicle of a poisoning dependence, still significant today, and its own cathartic resolution? Maybe it's just as if Jackson and his alter-ego Birnam, the writers, didn't kill the drunks but work with them hand-in-hand, finding between their confidence on their talent, and their low-self esteem, the catalysis of a true artistic talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lost Weekend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Oscar and Golden Globe winning director Billy Wilder (Sunset Boulevard, Some Like It Hot, The Apartment), from the title I assumed it was some kind of film noir, but it was so much more interesting than that, and a worthy film for the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically in New York, Don Birnam (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Ray Milland) is an unsuccessful writer and long-term alcoholic who has been trying to kick his drinking habit, but constantly fails and turns to the bottle on a regular basis. He is supposed to go on a weekend in the country with his brother Wick (Phillip Terry), who he shares an apartment with, and his girlfriend Helen St. James (Jane Wyman), but he stays home, and he finds some money, which he uses to spend on booze at his favourite water. At Nat's Bar on Third Avenue Don drinks and reminisces with Nat (Howard Da Silva) about how he met Helen, who worked for Time magazine, they met at the Metropolitan Opera when there was confusion of their coats, at first he found her rude, but they connect and she invited him to a cocktail party, where he had tomato and avoided alcohol for weeks. One day he was supposed to be meeting Helen's parents, but overheard them talking disapprovingly of him, so he phoned her and he returned to drinking, and he confesses to his problem to her when she finds his bottle, but he says being drunk gives his ideas for writing, but they are forgotten sober. Back in the present, Don cannot find his bottles that he hid, so he goes to bar advertised on a box of matches, and there he steals a woman's handbag, is caught by her, but he is let off by her and simply thrown out. The next day he is getting constant phone calls, but he ignores them assuming it is Helen, and to make some money for booze he tries to pawn off his typewriter, but all the pawn shops are closed, and visiting Nat he is refused service. Don does get a little bit of money from the at first unhappy Gloria (Doris Dowling), but in his bad state he falls down the stairs and is knocked unconscious, waking up in hospital in an alcoholics ward, and those there try to help with with advice and support about DTs (the shakes). Later that night he steals a coat, wearing it over his pyjamas, and in his second attempt he manages to escape while the staff are distracted by another unstable patient causing a disturbance. Helen meanwhile has slept on the stairs to his apartment hoping he will return. the landlady is sure he is one on of his benders, she also says it would probably be better if he was dead. Don meanwhile steals a bottle of whiskey from a liquor store, and when he returns home he still ignores the phone ringing, and in his drunken state he is tormented with the vision of a mouse coming through the wall and being eaten by a bat, 'Bim' Nolan (Frank Faylen) explained this as a symptom, seeing small animals. The landlady had heard his screams and Helen rushes to see and help him, she vows to look after him and stay until he can go without drink and start writing again, but this does not seem to work. Don disappears again and gets money from pawning her coat, returning he claims their relationship is over, and she spots he has hidden a gun in the bathroom, so she distracts him with drink so she can take it and stop him doing anything with it, but he spots her. As Helen tries to convince him to stop drinking, Nat comes round to bring back the typewriter he dropped falling down the stairs, and Don commits to finishing the story he started, The Bottle, recounting his time and the events in the lost weekend, dropping a cigarette in the whiskey instead of drinking it. Also starring Mary Young as Mrs. Deveridge and Anita Sharp-Bolster as Mrs. Foley. Milland gives a powerful, moving, realistic and award worthy performance as a desperate alcoholic who will do anything for a drink, normally the actor is rather bland so it is clever casting, Wyman is also great as the woman who sympathises with him and hopes that he will get over his addiction, and the direction by Wilder is superb as he paces the story well. It is a simple story, mostly just seeing a man drink himself nearly to death as he suffers terrible writer's block, the music throughout using the instrument called Theremin (used in Ed Wood) is tense, especially in the scene while walking down the high street, and there are some clever sequences, like the nightmare sequence, it is grim but a highly watchable drama. It won the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Music for Miklós Rózsa, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the beginning of the film, a bottle of whiskey was ominously hanging outside the window of troubled writer Don Birnam (Ray Milland) distracting him as he was packing his things to spend a weekend in the country with his brother Wick Birnam (Phillip Terry). That first scene already showed the central character of the film whose life is altered by his addiction to booze. Ray Milland's authentic portrayal remains up to this day one to reckon with when alcoholism is the main plot of a movie. Don Birnam's struggle is basically what the film is about and how it affected his relationships with other people. He is a detestable man if we judge him by means of the conventional standard but there is still that aspect of humanism in Ray Milland's performance however so slight that cannot be ignored. The love interest was Helen St. James and passionately played by Jane Wyman. She was a key supporting character in the film ? the girlfriend who, despite Don's moods and self-destructive tendency, remained loyal with an unflinching determination to help him. It was Helen's unrelenting effort that braved the deteriorating mental condition of Don Birnam who was on the brink of snapping out of reality. At the end, it was the woman who prevailed over the bottle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film seems over the top to me. I am an alcoholic and have known hundreds of others. Sure, some people like films that are over dramatic and this is one of them. In reality, in the worst cases people just crawl into the woods and die, they don't go raging around town. What is with that secure hospital scene where he just walks out? He needed help.Billy Wilder is a remarkable director but I don't think this is one of his best.A "friend" of mine no more showed me this movie. If Jane Wyman wants to travel in time and be such a friend as in the movie it would be fine with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I won't be asking for a rye and ginger anytime soon. There's one thing the movie still does in spades?debunk the romance of alcohol. Debunking may not be much problem now, but it was in 1945. Movies to that time portrayed most drunks as either silly or lovable. Besides, Prohibition gave abstinence a bad name and made imbibing chic among trend setters (think 30's screwball comedies).Then too, there was (and still is) a powerful liquor lobby along with the underworld, both of which have a vested interest in the drug, plus a Hollywood where alcohol greased many a high-pressure deal. Now, I'm no prude about alcohol, but given circumstances of the time, a movie like TLW was overdue. After all, the 30's had no difficulty hyping the effects of pot in such exploitation classics as Reefer Madness (1936).The movie itself is more fascinating than entertaining as we watch Don (Milland) spiral down. It's a depressing one-note narrative with an implausible upshot. Still, there are a number of effective touches?the NYC street locations; the hospital that offers no relief; but most of all, that nightmarish bat attack. No wonder Don reaches for a gun; the rodent squeal and smeared wall has stayed with me for decades. Looks to me like director Wilder was a man with a mission. Then too, I doubt the movie would have succeeded without the horrors of WWII in the background. The film may not be Wilder's best, but it is his most worthwhile, and still packs dramatic punch long after the screen novelty has worn off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lost Weekend is directed by Billy Wilder, based on the novel by Charles R. Jackson and stars Ray Milland and Jane Wyman. Before Wilder made this extraordinary film drunks in films were usually figures of fun, however what Wilder and his screenwriter Charles Bracket churned out bore no resemblance to this at all. Instead they gave us a film that tells us what alcoholism is like with nothing held back.Wilder shows us that being an Alcoholic is not fun and it can be destructive to the drinker and to their family and friends as well. It's effects can leave you with nothing except the desire for more booze.It can drive you to do things that you would never do sober.For example the scene in the nightclub where Don runs out of money for his drinks,he steals a ladies handbag for her cash leading to him being chucked out in disgrace to the tune of Somebody Stole Her Purse.The Lost Weekend tells the story of Alcoholic Don Birnam(Ray Milland)who's been sober for ten days and is supposed to be going on holiday with his long suffering brother Wick(Phillip Terry).However he swiftly ends up getting drunk again and in a series of flashbacks we see how he became a drunk and how he met his girlfriend Helen St James(Jane Wyman)who will not leave him no matter what as she loves him too much.To call this film bleak would be an understatement but it is also a deeply moving and shocking(even by todays standards)look at the problem. Wilder proves why he is considered one of the greatest directors of all time and Ray won(and completely deserved)his first Oscar for his performance as the tortured Birnam.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film on addiction before it was understood, at a time when drunks and addicts were thrown into a cell to dry out. The big question is, has treatment changed very much?. Not sure there is an answer in 2010 even. Ray Milland is excellent as a man who loses all grips on reality, and succumbs to the one thing that matters to him, his bottle.It starts out slowly, Milland has issues with his brother who keeps trying to "make" him stop drinking. A futile goal, as anyone who has been a caretaker may learn. Milland eventually meets Jane Wyman, a woman who is involved with someone else but attracted to Milland. Eventually, after many encounters with her, he feels he is beyond hope, and rejects her and meeting her family. Clearly shows the isolation, denial and what the alcoholic feels about himself, the lack of self-esteem, the self-hatred. Highly recommended. 10/10</fullReview>

Ray Milland stars as the suffering and penniless alcoholic who knows no shame as he hits his lowest point in life, begging and stealing just to obtain some liquor. Milland's performance was rightfully deemed worthy of an Oscar. Jane Wyman co-stars as his caring girlfriend who wants so desperately to help him. Wilder won the Oscar for Best Director and deservedly shared in another for his screenplay with co-writer Charles Brackett.

Howard Da Silva plays a friendly bartender, and Doris Dowling a sympathetic friend(and would-be rival of Helen).

Some cliches and excessive melodrama are used to slightly dull the edge of the dark story, and the ending seems a bit forced. Overall, though, a solid effort nicely done. Especially dig the "dream sequence" with the bat killing a mouse that's crawling out of the wall. Did this sequence perhaps give Roger Corman the inspiration to star Milland 2 decades later in the horror classics "X: The Man with the X Ray Eyes" and "The Premature Burial"? Just food for thought.</fullReview>

It doesn't have the great dialogue that his other films do and the ending was unbelievable. Ray Milland's performance is good but I've seen better and more convincing portrayals of alcoholism in other films, especially Leaving Las Vegas. I did like the scene where Don was begging Nat the bartender for a drink because he felt he was going to die, he really was excellent in that scene. I really didn't like the score that much, I know it's the first movie to use a theremin but every time I heard it I thought I was watching a twilight zone episode.

		<fullReview>One wonders why Billy Wilder wanted to make this. What was the angle... the concept? Because the prospect of watching an alcoholic drink and wallow in degradation for two hours is likely to be exactly as non-edifying as it sounds. How do you make a movie about the downward spiral of a drunk without making the viewing experience as dreary as actually being a drunk?, or being stuck with a drunk?Wilder is a good director, so I thought I'd give it a try. Sadly it's exactly what I dreaded. Wilder has no concept other than showing us the depths of alcoholism. Do you want to listen to people talk and talk and talk about a man's drinking problem? Do you want to see a movie whose every scene is about wanting a drink, hiding alcohol, drinking, denying you're drunk, arranging to get drunk, drinking, drinking and drinking? Because this addiction is so unrelenting, it makes for viewing that doesn't build. Around Chapter 8, tedium had already worn in. The movie doesn't even offer an answer to a viewer's question; what does an alcoholic get from making alcohol their primary relationship?The Snake Pit is another issue film from the same period, which is holding up much better. Note to self; Never watch The Lost Weekend as a double feature with Repulsion!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will he quit drinking Even if he convinces so at the end of the movie? Is this considered as a noir film or not? Rather, what is a noir film if this is not. Don Birnam, why is he addicted and does he drink only on weekends or on weekdays (Monday to Friday) too?These were the questions I was left with when I watched this film for the first time two years ago. I found answers and and am convinced after a third time watch.Will he quit drinking Even if he convinces so at the end of the movie? Ans: Does it really matter. Is this considered as a noir film or not? Rather, what is a noir film if this is not. Ans: No this not a noir film Why is he addicted and does he drink only on weekends or on weekdays (Monday to Friday) too? Ans: He surely has an addiction even on week day too. Reasons for addiction does not bother me as they can be any.Don Birnam (Ray Milland) is an addicted alcoholic who thrives on it and strives for it. His every emotion be it his joy when he finds a bottled or his fears, they are shown in extremely novel style in a time as 1945 where still a movie on alcoholism was a taboo and alcohol drinking was still not so much in films. I am sure, this film has stylized drinking in a way too. Made in an post World War 2 time, the film has to be looked at historically coz this has great historical relevance. Sure, this has all the ingredients of a terrific drama and exactly that is what it turns out to be. It is made uncompromisingly and very very compellingly. Till the very end, we cannot figure out where the movie can lead to. This could have gone anywhere in the climax and the climax is a bit hurried coz it hushes things and ends too quickly to my dislike. I wanted to be savored but had to swallow.This has very strong characters (only 4 important though) and yet you easily sustain a 90 minute drama.I really was happy and surprised to have seen this. It's 3/5 for a film that is good in all ways but still does not rise above to be called great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For its time, an unflinching and unstinting film documenting alcoholic Ray Milland's struggle against the bottle over a supposed holiday weekend. There's no pre-amble here, Milland has the problem already and has effectively lost his struggle before it's begun, as we see from the hiding of a bottle of whisky from his outside window. I like the fact that we're not really given an explanation for his sickness, like any other drinker could have, he's succumbed to his illness and it will obviously be touch and go as to how the film will finish, which suspense director Wilder accentuates cleverly but subtly. Thus Milland's ailment and symptoms all seem real and are not exaggerated into grotesquerie as could so easily have happened.One could argue that not much actually happens in the film as it charts the alcoholic's slow demise to almost literally self-destruction and even the ending seems a little gratuitous as the love of a good woman and support of his local bar-man (stretching credibility somewhat, I must say) inspire Milland's retreat from the edge even as his voice-over makes its universal plea for temperance over the end title. More gripping are the various episodes which lead up to this point as we witness the depths to which he's reduced in pursuit of his poison, including theft, abject pleading indeed begging and in the end sheer desperation as he ransacks his own flat to find his stash of booze, hidden away when he was sober.The acting of Milland deservedly won him that year's Oscar, a gritty, two-tone performance, pretty much carrying the film, although he's ably supported by the very pretty and capable Jane Wyman. Wilder's direction as stated earlier eschews sensationalism but still contains many a striking image (the proliferation of ring-stains left by Milland's ever increasing number of glasses on the bar-counter, the reflection of his "found" bottle in his light shade, the DT's scene where he touches on madness and his weary trek all over to find a pawnbroker that's open.One thing I didn't like was Miklos Rosza's over intrusive music, especially the spacy / spooky upper register notes which come out whenever Milland is about to tie one on. I did also feel the ending seemed tagged on and that there was a case for taking the film to its natural conclusion, namely Milland's exit.So strong was the impact of the film that the phrase "lost weekend" has come all the way down to modern times as a self-evident term for an alcoholic bender, although the film's cautionary tale narrative, while diluted a touch in the home stretch, still packs a kick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's truly wonderful about this film is that it was one of, if the very first to show us that people afflicted with dipsomania can also be extremely intelligent, likable, attractive, and the object of other people's care and affection. Drunks don't necessarily have to be burping hobos riding in freight trains and drinking out of paper bags. Don drinks because his early promise as a writer didn't turn out the way he expected it. Right there, the film sends a warning that sometimes, success and praise given to creative people without the long-haul earn can bring the artist to such a let-down that he/she can retreat into self-pity, which is at the root of most addictive behavior. One problem with the film was Jane Wyman's character. If she is so in love with Don to have stayed by him through all the pain and chaos of his alcoholism, it would have been nice to understand why? Is she a frustrated nurse, or does she feel the need to satisfy he latent maternal extincts? The biggest cop-out is of course the ending. So this time Don is really going to stay on the wagon and finally turn out that novel? A more realistic ending would have had him pull the trigger. This is the way many alcoholics have ended their lives. But remember, Billy Wilder, as talented a craftsman that he was, still operated within the Hollywood system, where happy endings were always a requisite to the completion of the product. Also, Howard Da Silva should have had more screen time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no doubt, in my mind, that Billy Wilder is a good director; history has proven that. He has also proven that black and white film is not a limited medium. This film does this.The Lost Weekend is a very good film, with a very good cast (including Ray Milland, the lead; even if the film is over fifty years old, and touches slightly on the melodramatic, we have sympathy for his character). The only (minor) complaint I have about this film is that it, on the subsurface, like a two-hour commercial on the perils of alcohol. To me, the material seems as if it was inspired by one of those bitties who fought for prohibition in the first few decades of the 20th Century. That, in itself, left a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth at the film's end.Of course, I imagine that in its day, it was both original, witty, inspiring, and captivating. To a degree, it still retains that, so I can not really penalize it for its didactic overtones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Lost Weekend", directed by Billy Wilder, was the 1945 Best Picture Oscar winner. It remains a highly-regarded film though there are some (like me) who will tell you that it has aged poorly.The story concerns a chronic alcoholic (Ray Milland) who spurns the help of both his brother and his lover. The film follows him as he hits rock bottom in a four-day binge that may turn out to be his last.The acting is alright but nothing special as far as I'm concerned. Sure, Milland won an Oscar in the lead role but his performance just didn't hit the mark for me. Everyone else is competent but not worth remarking upon.The film was directed by Billy Wilder though I wouldn't rank it among his best efforts. It has a decent look and the Miklós Rózsa score is interesting at times but I don't consider the film's presentation to be especially noteworthy.My major issue is with the story. I'm sure that it must have been hard-hitting back in '45 but nowadays this sort of thing is old hat. It's also a rambling plot which revolves around a character that I had a hard time feeling sympathy for. Yes, I realize that alcoholism is considered a disease but if someone doggedly refuses treatment then they have only themselves to blame. Then again, support groups like Alcoholics Anonymous weren't nearly as common back then.In the end, I suppose that your opinion of this film will be determined by a number of personal factors. As a result, I do not seek to dissuade anyone from seeing the film. Just be aware that, like me, you may be less impressed than others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ray Milland gives a great performance here as an alcoholic who cares nothing else but a bottle. Other characters in the film are also very well acted, especially the bartender and Bim who gives Don a scary lesson about the dark side of alcoholism. There are some pretty striking scenes here if you think that this was made in the 40's. The scenes where Don and other alcoholic sees the hallucinations are pretty rough for a Hollywood picture at that time and Wilder does give a pretty merciless description of an alcoholism. But even though Don drinks, he is still very warm and sympathetic character and as he is aware himself that he has a problem and he thinks he is a looser, it's easy to feel kind of sorry for him.The movie is more of a review for a dark side of alcoholism rather than asking the reason for it. It's a one man story about how bottle is everything he has and care about. You don't need to know why he drinks and movie does not even try to explain that. Which is good i think because the it would easily go too pathetic for telling reasons why Don became what he is. Movie starts when Don has been already alcoholic for years and story goes back only to tell how Don met his girlfriend. And he was a drunk then already! Many here criticize the music score here but i think it's one of the best i've heard from Miklos Rozsa. Especially the scenes where Don is trying to find the bottle from his house and when he sees those visions are musically great and gives a great point of view to Don's confused state of mind. It's not an usual Rozsa score and that makes it more interesting as it seems that he has tried something different here with using theremin and more experimental themes.There are a few flaws though that's why i have to drop a couple of stars. In the beginning when Don suddenly wants his brother go to the concert instead of him seems a little bit too obvious. And if his brother has seen these lies for years, he pretty easily takes his story. And the bigger flaw is the ending. I was kind of hoping that the ending would follow the movie's straight storyline and "not" happy ending would have made this almost a 10 star movie. It's a shame that in Hollywood it's so rare that movies end like the director wants them to end. Especially here the ending feels really out of place and i don't think they would have released this movie without the happy end. Despite the flaws it's still a good movie and this is another example of Billy Wilder's great directing skills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That calls for a drink.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not exactly a funny movie. After all, being a career drunkard is a lot of work. It takes devotion, cunning, effort, time, and talent. In the course of the movie the hero, Don Burnham (Ray Milland) discovers that it takes more character to be a drunk than to be a writer.I vaguely remember the novel. Burnham was not only a blocked writer but gay as well, and drank out of guilt for what was seen as two failings. The book didn't come out and SAY he was gay, but rather revealed he was fond of opera and enjoyed watching Garbo in "Camille." Readers at the time, I suppose, could crack the code, but movie goers didn't need to.In most movies, drunkenness is treated as a transitory state. It's either played for laughs (John Ford) or the equivalent of a dose of nepenthe designed to replace an otherwise intolerable state of consciousness. This is one of only a few movies to treat it as the career that it is. Temporary exhilaration maybe but not fun at all.What causes it? Despite the millions of dollars spent on the problem, nobody knows. And it IS a major problem. The personal and social damage cause by other illegal substances like heroin and crack are nothing compared to alcohol. Everyone has tsuris. Maybe you can't do integral calculus and I can't bring myself to sweep the back yard, but we don't all get drunk because of our failings. There's probably some constitutional component, meaning that you can't blame it simply on writer's block. Brain scans are kind of spooky to begin with, but they're spookier because of some of the results that are emerging from them. The offspring of career alcoholics show an unusual amount of activity in an isolated spot of the frontal lobes that "normal" people don't have -- and that's BEFORE they've ever had a drink themselves.But as Jellenik argued, there is an environmental consideration too. Europe can be divided into two parts -- roughly northern and southern. In the northern part, the pattern is to drink hard liquor before dinner and get bombed. In the southern part, you drink wine with dinner and getting smashed is frowned on. Also, historically, the northern pattern is relatively recent, depending on the distillation of grain, while in the southern part fermented grape juice has been around for so long that its origins are lost. Somebody will have to figure this out.As far as this particular movie goes, Ray Milland is a decent actor but doesn't do a good drunk. See Paul Newman in "Verdict" for a good drunk. Jane Wyman is the kind of loving, steadfast girl friend that real career drunks never have. Brother Wick is realistically done.Well, overall impact aside, see this movie, if only for one scene. Milland is sitting alone in his darkened room, recovering from a bout with the bottle, and sees a mouse emerge from a tiny hole in the wall. I'll leave it at that, I think. Your hair may stand on end, no matter how many computer-generated images of monsters you've seen.There's a moral lesson involved here. "Drink responsibly," as the TV ads say. Time for another jug of Gallo Ripple -- a good wine but not a GREAT wine -- brave but fickle.</fullReview>

Its symbolism is obvious and foretold in a grating manner-such as the visuals when he has hallucinations of rats and other beasts for Ray Milland as Don Birnham. Modern and later alchoholic depictions such as Barfly and possibly Days of Wine and Roses are much better. I am very much a fan of the Classics of the Golden Age of Cinema(1930s-50s,but this is one that simply doesn't hold up and it shows how many of the Best Picture Winners in an Era are not even good Movies.

		<shortDescription>Worst "Best Picture" Ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Billy Wilder and it pains me to write this, but here it goes: "The Lost Weekend" is, in my opinion, the worst Oscar-winning "Best Picture" I've seen, and I've seen all but about five. It is proof positive that Academy Award voters were as misguided in 1946 as they have been in the past decade with such embarrassing choices as "Gladiator," "Braveheart," and "A Beautiful Mind." "Mildred Pierce," another Oscar nominee in '46, also is dated, but it is well-written, compelling entertainment. I am sure that in 1945, "The Lost Weekend" seemed very daring and gritty. But today it just seems dated. Indeed, as I placed the DVD back in the case, I searched on the floor for mothballs that I figured fell out of the packaging in my haste to get the DVD into the player. "The Lost Weekend" is like a not-so-good high school play circa 1945. The acting is laughably overwrought. Jane Wyman's role as Helen "Oh-I-Love-Him-So" St. James needs a bottle, too: Over her noggin to pound an iota of sense into her head. And the music...?! I hate to be repetitive, but only one word springs to mind in describing Miklos Rozsa's score, and that word is "overwrought." The only two things I enjoyed about this movie was seeing the skyline and streets of Manhattan circa 1944 and hitting the "stop" button on the remote control when the credits began to roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well acted but superficial.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched this movie I was really impressed with the story and the acting, especially that of Ray Milland, whose performance as Don Birnam is truly classic. Then I made the "mistake" of reading the book by Charles Jackson, and then revisited the movie, and sadly my opinion of the movie has changed. I'm still impressed with Mr. Milland's performance, but can't say the same about the story. The problem with the movie is that it does not explain what is compelling Don to drink. All the movie presents is a somewhat theatrical and sensational portrayal of a man whose behavior becomes more and more ridiculous as he is repeatedly thwarted in his quest for money to buy a drink. Okay, Don has a drinking problem, but why belabor the point? Substance abuse is a multifaceted problem; there's nothing theatrical about it either. Don Birnam needs to drink ... so what! Showing an alcoholic lugging an iron typewriter up Third Avenue in search of a pawnshop so he can get a few bucks to buy a drink was more ludicrous than dramatic. The problem is that the movie doesn't explain WHY Don is drinking and what is driving him to torture himself and feel so miserable. But then again, who cares?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In terms of Wilder classics, this one comes up short.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this film with great expectations considering it was written, produced, and directed by the men who also gave us Sunset Blvd., one of the best films of the Golden Age of Hollywood in the 1950s. However, after watching this, I was utterly disappointed at what was given to me. Don't get me wrong, it is still a strong film on the subject of alcoholism and its effects, but I was utterly unsatisfied with most of it in the end. Ray Milland gives an average performance, and to me, the entire film rests on this character's shoulders. The supporting characters come across as annoying instead of helpful, and the flirtatious woman at the bar is completely pointless. The best parts are when Wilder takes us inside Don Birnam's hallucinations and craving for liquor. It is a powerful subject, but in terms of what Wilder is capable of, it comes up short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>95 % believable - but why would a woman stay three years with a man who was a habitual drunk!Also unanswered:Why no war connection to the male leads? No mention of WW II at all. The end ... unbelievable. There are no quick turnarounds for an alcoholic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd been meaning to see this movie for a long time. Now I'm glad I've finally got it out of the way. I have to agree with some of the other comments--this movie is overrated. Far from being an intelligent, nuanced study of alcoholism, it was pretty one-dimensional. There isn't much to this flick but a man who can't stop drinking and hurts the people around him. I almost wish he'd shoot himself at the end.The scene with the hallucination of the bat flying around the apartment reminded me a lot of Gilligan's Island, when the bat on the string would fly into Gilligan's hut. The lead actor's girl-screams weren't very impressive either.At least the performances of the supporting actors were good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Lost Weekend' leaves a lot fascinating questions unanswered - for instance, why wasn't Don 'Lester' Burnam fighting in the war? There are some remarkably scenes here, in particular the opera sequence nodding to 'The Gold Rush', or the Kafkaesque purse-snatching incident. Throughout, Wilder emphasises the circle, the vicious circle, the noose, right down to the closing shot mirroring the first, which ironises any 'cop-out' move towards resolution, and which, like everything else Burnam produces, is pure talk. This will go on and on, ending in suicide or an asylum. Still, it's Wilder's most over-praised film, as dated in dialogue, assumptions and wearying drunk hero as a Eugene O'Neill play; while the visual 'daring' now looks risible. For a genuinely non-judgemental portrait of a drunk, watch Melville's 'Deux Hommes Dans Manhatten'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie is Dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just seen this movie and found it very dated.The sci-fi score was over the top and the material too melodramatic.It should of been about heroin addiction.I liked some of the location work done in new york,as I love to see life as it was in the forties in movies,its like going back in time.To have alcoholics in a locked ward doesn't happen anymore,even drug addicts can leave.Jane Wyman was quite young at the time,and I loved her leopard coat.Faylen was creepy and cruel as the nurse on duty in the ward.I have know alcoholics in my life who drank every day yet seem to maintain their habit,without going to pieces.The craving for another drink reminded me of wanting a fix,especially with the intense spooky background music,which I had to turn down it was so irritating</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>overrated "classic"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Billy Wilder movie is considered an all-time classic. As a kid, I found it scary but confusing. Now 55 years later, it almost seems farcical. It has not aged well. Ray Milland's over-the-top hallucinations seem laughable now. I love Billy Wilder films, and many consider this one of his best, but I think it is merely an overly praised failed experiment. Please see it for yourself, again, and let me know what you think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is dark stuff. There's a slight romantic angle. But mostly it's the darkness and despair of alcoholism. For it's time, it is very hard hitting.This film sums up Wilder's versatility. A director who has made 5 of the top 100 films of the 20th century.</fullReview>
