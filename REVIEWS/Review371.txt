		<shortDescription>A Rousing Answer to the Question: Why do They Climb?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The inherent drama of men and mountains has spurred in recent years a glut of TV and film that has blossomed with the technological advancements of our time and the "look at me" attitude pervading society so that everyone with a Go-Pro can film their adventures for the world to see. From Youtube channels of independent climbers filming their routes to big money TV shows that bring the adventurers' lives to our living rooms, the world of mountain climbing and adventure sports in general seems caught in contradictions. Always underlying the contradictions is the simple question of why? Do these individuals risk life and limb for their fame, for sponsors, for a TV deal or out of a unique personal desire and will that drives them into the wild.The British climber George Mallory who died while attempting Everest back in the 1920s famously responded to the question of Why? with "because it is there". For the next 100 years, many climbers have tried to give better answers, and in Meru, we have a compelling combination of narrative and visual imagery that may result in the best answer of all. The narrative stands apart from other films and documentaries in that it is not completely linear and veers off course to give the viewers appropriate back stories to inject meaning and under currents to the climbers' motivations. You get to know the climbers as people, and with that understanding, I think it becomes easier for anyone, including people who have never set foot on a snowy ledge, to understand why these people climb mountains. The technical climbing is filmed by Jimmy Chin (both climber and film director) in a way that I have simply never seen before. As a climbing enthusiast, the shots of these guys on the walls of ice and rock are astounding, gut-wrenching and for me, completely inspiring. The organic relationship of the climbing team, their histories and ultimately their trials on the snow and rock of Meru expand on many common mountaineering themes - mentors, sponsors, risk analysis and contemplating death both yours and your friends. Jon Krakauer is not my favorite voice in this world, but he is a voice that is adept at translating the mountaineering world to laymen, and his role in this film is served well. In the end, I strongly recommend this film for everyone. For those that can understand the motivation to be the first to stand atop a peak, you will not be disappointed. For those that can not understand the motivation, you might walk away finally getting it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boy, did I choose the right movie tonight!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went with my family to the ol' picture shows, since it was Friday and all, and they all went to see the new Transporter: Refueled. I told them that I was definitely not going to see something as poorly made, regardless of how much I loved the first three (as an effing kid). So, I was limited to a certain amount of movies since theirs started at 10:30 PM, I had to see one as well around 10:00. I looked up the show times; last viewing of Bloodsucking Bastards was at 9:00 so I thought I was screwed. Then suddenly, I came across a new film I haven't even heard of called MERU.This film literally put me through a whole mountain-climbing experience. I LOVED it so much in fact! I could not decide at first if I was going to rate this with 3.5 stars or 4. Even at one point I got to thinking it might stoop down to a 2.5 (shh), but it had its comebacks and moments that will remain stuck in my mind for probably all eternity.Meru is about a team of climbers who want to be the first to top off the great Mount Meru in India (I believe..). Guiding this mission is a man named Conrad Anker, who I think presents himself as a great leader. Though, he definitely has that crazy, adrenaline-junky-look in his eyes, he is also smarter than you think. To aid him are two of his longtime friends whom he has accompanied throughout his travels/expeditions. Their names are Jimmy Ching, who is the sort of younger, optimist of the group, and Renan Ozturk, who basically is the weakling in the group; // doesn't stop him though.I actually noticed how this documentary was organized in three acts, and it's funny because whatever I thought the movie was going to be about was ALL in the first act. Silly me! This film has twists and turns and though you may not get the best of footage, the (true) story is what counts. // There is also breathtaking camera shots; I love seeing a wide open mountain range; makes me feel like I can finally breath.One of my favorite aspects of this film was the character development. And I know, how can you say that about a documentary? Well, this one has it! Especially, Renan who started out as the most annoying/bitchy character and turns into... well I don't want to ruin it.This adventure was UNPREDICTABLE and EDGY. Especially around the third act, you will be bitting your nails. This is the kind of story that makes you understand more of the human psychology - facing your fears - With FRIENDSHIP and FOLLOWING YOUR DREAMS. // Also, they speak highly of "praising to the teachers"; Learning from others and passing on the experience/skills. That is how things get done in this world. It also presents how many people come to finally accomplishing their dreams. // GOALS, PEOPLE! You gotta push yourself.I liked how I had a point of view on things after walking out of the theater. I said to myself, "Huh, maybe FEAR is a good thing after-all."-- Michael Mendez</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful tale of dedication and humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Elite climbers on a previously unattainable peak are just one level of this film which digs deeply into dreams, goals, dedication and hardship made all the more inspirational when the viewer realizes the insanely remote, high altitude, and technical location that this story was shot in. Watching the climbing on MERU is as foreign to most of us as landing on another planet yet the film has all of the human elements that we crave, portrayed in powerful honesty. During the final scenes, I realized that each of the three main characters had their own well-developed back story filled with intense personal struggles yet the three characters were equally compelling and developed to the point that I was filled with flash-backs of the film that I carry with me to this day, nearly 6 months after my first viewing. There has never been another climbing genre documentary like MERU.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As breathtaking as the real altitude climb.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Appreciate Meru, for it is rare that a documentary, or movie in general, able to bring audience in such inspiringly immersive journey. This is more than just a trip to the titular location, it's a private real life struggle of the climbers which we as viewers may not fully understand, yet it's presented with incredible honesty and amazing visual spectacle.The documentary spans across many years of the climbers' lives, including all the trials and tribulations they must endure. There's myriad of behind-the-scene video making involved as well as testimony of friends and families. Everything is done with polished approach and this honest nature welcomes audience even if they're not into mountaineering.What's great about this is how they talk about the darkest days in very professional manner. Having to describe one's own intimate fear and life altering experience can't be easy, however the filmmakers still present them with composure. It is rarely that they are emotional when delivering the narrative, even if it's involving a very personal subject, yet the appreciation for the extreme sport and the determination are highly riveting. It also displays the hazard strikingly well one can't help being absorbed in their excursion.The rest of it doesn't even need words as the documentary captures beautifully taxing landscape. It offers so much clarity before and during the climb itself, from the preparation, trip in the cities before to the physically exhausting climb. There is no five minutes spent without scenery worthy of being wallpapers or posters.Meru is a visually stunning journey accompanied by brave and inspiring fellows. It is more than most movies wish they could convey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing like a good documentary about people doing spectacular things to inspire you to do great.Three mountain climbers attempt to reach the top of an impossible mountain. Despite failing to reach the top their first time around, the impossible task does not stop them from trying again.It's amazing insight about Mountain climbing as we watch these men doing what they love doing and were met to do. It's seems crazy what they are doing and the doc does not hide how crazy it is but it also makes you understand that they had to do it cause this is their passion. The footage from Jimmy Chin was perfect at capturing the harsh conditions of the weather on top of Meru. One image that really got to me was when the mountain started to poor down hard ice. You could not even call it rain or hale. It seemed brutal. Then they would switch it up with beautiful shoots of climbers going up the hill in such a beautiful atmosphere. I could feel the crisp air.It helps a lot how close the filmmakers are to the subject matter. Though the narration could be dull at times overall it's a beautiful picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much much better than the theatrical 'Everest'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, this is one of the greatest viewing experiences I've ever had. The whole film put yourself as one of the team climbers with these three great, stubborn, die-hard, totally obsessed mountain climbers. What a cathartic therapy viewing journey! The Meru is just part of the Himalaya but more pure and an absolutely non-commercial summit unlike the Everest. We didn't see any littered garbage like what we usually saw along the route to Everest. When I watched this film, I couldn't help thinking of those films related to the mountain climbing: K2, Into The Thin Air, Everest, Cliff Hanger, Vertical Limit, even a old thriller, The Elgar Sanction. But this particular film would stand out quite uniquely. A simple narration, not exaggerated, not pretentious, not self-important or self-promoted with strong commercial stink. And the camera work, my, so crystal sharp and beautiful. I think 'Everest 2015' is way off the chart if compares to this one, plain and simple.If you have the chance to watch this film, don't miss it, folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting documentary will make your heart skip a beat or two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Meru" (2015 release; 90 min.) brings the story of three guys attempting to peak the top of Meru, an ultra-difficult mountain in the Himalayas that is considered as possible the toughest climb in the world. As the movie opens, we see the three guys in a hanging cod on the side of the mountain, looking utterly exhausted. We then go "3 Years Earlier", where we get to know Conrad Aker, fearless climber for whom "Meru is the culmination of everything I've wanted to accomplish as a climber (we later learn that he's summited Everest a number of times, but failed to summit Meru in one previous attempt). We also get to know Jimmy Chin and Renan Ozturk. Will they succeed and conquer Meru? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, I pretty much knew going in that I would like this documentary as I am a sucker for these types of "you gotta see it to believe it" type documentaries. This one may top them all. If you think Everst is hard, just wait until you see Meru's Shark's Fin towards the top of the mountain, a 4,000 ft climb straight up of solid rock. Second, Jimmy Chin decided to catch everything on camera, and hence is a co-director (along with his wife), co-editor and co-producer. The footage that we get to see is nothing short of jaw-dropping. At times, I felt dizzy just looking at the screen. Can you imagine what it must've been like to actually do the climb? But wait! there is more! Just as you think that the documentary is all about the quest for Meru, we get a couple of side stories that filled in the human aspects and as a result made the movie even that much more compelling to watch. Third, there are a number of talking heads giving further insights on what we are seeing, and by far the most interesting of them is Jon Krakauer, author of "Into Thin Air". Last, there is some great music in the documentary, including from J. Ralph, Explosions In the Sky and others."Meru" recently opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati without any pre-release fanfare or advertising. I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening week day screening where I saw this at was not attended very well, I am sorry to say. I love documentaries, and I love watching extreme sports (emphasis on watching, ha!). "Meru" is a riveting documentary that will make your heart skip a beat or two. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most inspiring films you'll see. Period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from seeing the documentary film "Meru" in the theater. I will probably write more on it later, as there's just too many thoughts swirling now 'round me head. And perhaps none of you will see the writing (I'll stick it on IMDb. But the short story is it's truly a marvel. And not just one of the best docs I've seen but one of the greatest movies I've seen in a VERY long time. There's such an immersing story there, and the 3 principle characters are fleshed out so impressively that by the end you really are emotionally invested in each and feel you understand deeply what motivates and scares each of them. It's a film which really shines a light on big ideas of motivation, inspiration, brotherhood, insane, I mean INSANE perseverance and really broad almost sports movie clichés territory. But they nailed it! Honestly this film takes on such subjects in such a way as to put to shame most of the "feel-good", "overcome the impossible", "overcome so much to follow your dream" - type films. And the fact that it's a true story is just all the more awe inspiring. And yeah, can't stress it enough, each of the three climbers' back stories are just so dramatic, and interesting. Any one of the three could have a nice documentary film made about them. It actually is crazy how many awesome story lines exist here, how many twists and back stories exist in this documentary and how nicely they tie all three of their lives together so beautifully. Oh and it's about climbing a mountain, what more beautiful built-in cinematography can you ask for? And what better built-in metaphor can you want for any goddamn goal you may have in life? It's astounding. If you can see it, I highly recommend it. It is just about the most purely INSPIRING film I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Meru" doesn't need to dramatize its mountain climbing story - it takes us there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Be careful around the shark's fin. It's a warning that swimmers might utter ? and mountain climbers too. The Shark's Fin is the most challenging route up the most challenging of the three peaks of Meru, which is part of the Himalayas of northern India. The documentary "Meru" (R, 1:27) traces two separate attempts by a trio of climbers trying to be the first to reach the top of Meru Peak, via the Shark's Fin.Conrad Anker, Jimmy Chin, and Renan Ozturk are three of the most famous mountain climbers in the world, largely for their experiences on Meru Peak. Anker had become famous for his climbs in Antarctica and the Himalayas, one of which led to his discovery of 1920s' climber George Mallory's body on Mount Everest. Jimmy Chin had made a name for himself as both a climber and videographer who documented his climbs, as well as the expeditions of others. Anker and Chin were climbing partners for years when they took on Ozturk, a young but accomplished climber, for their 2008 expedition up the Shark's Fin.This film tells us about and shows us the trio's 2008 and 2011 Meru expeditions and the momentous events in between. Heading up the mountain with them in 2008, we learn about why the Shark's Fin is uniquely challenging, uniquely dangerous and an irresistible goal for serious climbers like these. When the men come heartbreakingly close to reaching their goal, but have to turn back, we feel for them, even as we hear them talking about making another attempt. Their bodies and minds have to recover before they go back to India to try again, and life has to be lived. There are other climbs and other jobs for each of the three men to do while they plan their second trip to the Shark's Fin. When two of the three men have near-death experiences on separate occasions, serious questions arise. Who will make up the team on a second attempt? Given what's happened, can they succeed this time? Will they? "Meru" uses interviews with the trio to explain how they got together and describe their experiences on Meru. Anker's friend and fellow climber, Jon Krakauer, who wrote "Into Thin Air" (which was made into the 2015 film "Everest") also sits for an interview which sheds a significant amount of light on the story of the three Shark's Fin climbers, their expeditions, and mountain climbing in general. Most of "Meru", however, is made up of video shot by Chin and Ozturk on Meru Peak. The interview clips are succinct and informative, but it's the on-site video which gives this documentary its drama and its immediacy. I would have liked to hear more about what makes them do what they do and a bit of what happened in each of their lives after their second attempt to climb the Shark's Fin, but few criticisms can take much away from this remarkable film ? one of the most fascinating and engaging documentaries of 2015.

		<fullReview>Absolutely riveting movie. Be prepared to grab your seat many times, there are some really scary moments! I found the beginning quite meaningful as the climbers passed various Indian Holy men praying and meditating. What the 3 climbers were about to do really required divine protection. The photography is stunning, especially with the stars whirling around over Meru. What comes across to me is the supreme team work and total trust in your partners. Conrad puts together the team and sets the objective. His partners Jimmy and Renan add their enormous set of diverse skills to enable the successful completion of the climb. Conrad has the wisdom accumulated over many years of climbing to know when to pull the plug and when to push on. We are introduced to each climber and the serious setbacks that they all have but they still push on. Marvelous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually breath-taking and a great example of the human spirit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are definitely many reasons to seek this film out. One of those reasons is that the film captured footage that not many films could even dream of attempting, not with CGI or visual effects or anything. Visually dazzling is the word, and on Blu Ray the film must work even more wonders. Another reason is that the film is really motivating and inspirational, but with that deeper questions about these men arise. Surely one can say that they are merely insane and delusional, as a lot of the things they do here are questionable, But there's also something deeply admirable about how they go about doing it, and the three men remain really likable throughout and we feel for them. This is a fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched it after reading the good reviews on IMDb. The reviews are right in many ways, at least the positive ones.First this is not a movie . This is real life with real drama , tragedy , courage , hope and a celebration of human spirit.The documentary captures the eerie beauty and loneliness of the most amazing mountain range in the world. There is cracking footage of 3 courageous men slowly inching up to the summit 20000 ft above land.At times the viewer will feel the very real vertigo , the absolute silence , the sheer complexity of the climb. It is said that this route to Meru is the most difficult in the list of mountaineering challenges.The night sky looks like you are in space literally. I guess the climbers had the fortune of good weather resulting in beautiful cinematography .What some may find equally moving and beautiful is the story of each of their struggles and how they use the climb to the top as a catharsis of sorts.Best documentary in a long long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the finest films about extreme sport I have ever seen. It takes you into the mind of a climber, and what you find is spirituality and madness in equal measure.It is a pleasure to spend time in the company of the three main climbers, who each overcome the most testing adversity to achieve something which to my eyes looks humanly impossible.The film is also beautifully shot, a number of times I found myself wondering how it could be possible to get a particular angle? Or who would leave the relative comfort of the bivouac in the middle of a storm to get an exterior shot of all the gear hanging off a wall at 20,000ft.Simply astonishing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This cinematic/documentary is PROBABLY the best mountain climbing movie/documentary I have had pleasure to come across.The stories are real- the characters are real- the scenery is off the charts beautiful.This movie will have you exploring the human potential - and it's not your typical 'I climbed Everest - check out the photo of me at the summit- I'm better than you' message.In fact, it's not that message at all- even though this team is pushing first summit - each one of the team members has a different drive to accomplish this impossible task.I will not comment on success or failure - but this movie is not about either it is about the reach for the summit I HIGHLY recommend taking the time to watch this one.I recall some tear jerker from the 1970's 'The Other Side of the Mountain' - while I do not recall details - There IS another side of the mountain with this movie.Hats off to the director, writers - all who helped film it - the scenery is simply breathtaking.This is NOT a mountain anyone has climbed before with success.When you see what they are up against - your head will spin in bewilderment that ANYONE would or COULD seek to hit summit.This movie is not about altitude - this movie is about fortitude.WATCH IT- you WILL celebrate the full potential of humanity.In fact- I had to add one more comment hereI must say that this movie will have you celebrating the AWE of this planet we live on - in ways- no other cinematic production has to date.Considering when people DO climb- let's face it - they ARE reaching OUT of this world - and this movie - REACHES TOWARDS that which is OUT of this world and yet in it.Simply TOPS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Meru" (2015) is very good documentary not only about climbing. We spend enough time with climbers to better know them, and we understand why they are doing these very risky climbing's. There are many (most of) scenes filmed during climbing, and they are breathtaking. Pacing of this documentary was superb, as well as directing. I was engaged into the story from the beginning till the very last end. Movie ends perfectly at the very right moment - it's a haunting feeling.Overall, "Meru" is a very good movie not only about climbing itself, but also as a reasons for doing it.

		<shortDescription>7.7? the best film of 2015 for me. Out of 94 so far. LIGHTS OUT!! very minor spoiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WOW! As soon as the credits rolled - I hit start again and watched- it as intently as I did the first time."Meru" is the best climbing documentary ever made, but, it's much, much more than that. A few years ago "U23D" became one of my under-rated "10's" (mostly due to it's incredible use of 3-D technology). "Meru" accomplishes a similar feat for high- altitude film. But, it's what happens on the ground that makes this film complete.This, unlike the IMAX film "Everest", is a finished and complete work. The people within have stories to tell, and that coupled with the clear and concise focus and climax of "Meru" make it a SPECTACULAR film. When Chin attacks the summit in the final scene it is something to behold. A perfect ending to an epic adventure film.There is absolutely NO reason to rent this movie. Buy it. I think that when all is said and done, years from now, this film will be the benchmark for this type of extreme film-making. Jimmy Chin has really out-done himself here, and we're talking about the guy that skied Everest for goodness sakes. I'm not a climber, I'm not a contributor or have any vested interest in the film, but this film will transport you to the mountain, and give you human stories that really magnify the achievement and risk.Solid 10/10. The 45th that I've awarded out of 3600+ ratings. 7.7 is a terribly misleading rating. Don't get me wrong, it's solid, but if this film doesn't deserve an 8+, nothing does!You'd like this if you liked:Touching the Void(great but nowhere near as great as this), Searching for Sugar Man(nearly this films equal), or The Crash Reel(not as good, but still solid). 95/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Me Too For Meru</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Meru three days ago and still feel giddy with vicarious altitude sickness. Stunned with admiration for the three people who not only conquered The Shark's Fin but produced this film so other wimps like me could be blown away by its grandeur. I kept asking myself, "How are they filming these scenes and still climbing?" Getting one's body to the top of the Shark's Fin is astounding, let alone lugging cameras and setting up for shots. Any OMG, the scenes are to take one's breath away and they are succeeding at almost 20K feet up in the sky and at 20 degrees below zero at times. Adding footage about the death of fellow climbers really brings the deep soul motivation of these three men to the heart. Not to mention that Renan Ozturk pulled this off after crushing his skull and breaking his neck a half year prior to conquering Meru.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.6/5 starsVisually mesmerizing and stirred by a narrative that's more gripping than several big-budget features, "Meru" is that rare documentary that proves thought-provoking while offering thrilling wide-screen vistas. It's a triumph of editing and narrative beyond "are you kidding me?" visuals - cinematographers Jimmy Chin and Renan Ozturk, who're also two of the trio of gallants who attempt to scale the unconquered peak Meru, capture both the astonishing views from the top of the world and soul-searching moments inside a cramped tent dangling from the side of the mountain like a used tea bag.In the high-stakes pursuit of big-wall climbing, the Shark's Fin on Mount Meru may be the ultimate prize. Sitting 21,000 feet above the sacred Ganges River in Northern India, the mountain's perversely stacked obstacles make it both a nightmare and an irresistible calling for some of the world's toughest climbers. In October 2008, renowned alpinists Conrad Anker, Jimmy Chin, and Renan Ozturk arrived in India to tackle Meru. Their planned 7-day trip quickly spiraled into a 20- day hazardous odyssey in sub-zero temperatures with depleting food rations. Despite making it to within 100 meters of the elusive summit, their journey, like everyone before them, was not a successful one. Heartbroken and defeated, the trio returned to their everyday lives, where the siren song of Meru continued to beckon. By September 2011, the three inseparable friends resolved to undertake the insurmountable challenge of the Shark's Fin once again, under even more extraordinary circumstances than their first attempt. "Meru" is the extraordinary true story of that journey; an expedition through nature's harshest elements and one's complicated inner demons, and ultimately on to impossible new heights.Watching these three men fight for every foot of altitude is far more exhausting and far more inspiring than seeing a superhero defy gravity - there's something indubitably cool about a bunch of real- life daredevils who stare death unflinchingly in the face. You can't help but ask yourself, "Are these guys nuts?" "Are their egos needy of self-affirmation?" "Or is there some higher purpose they seek in such inexplicable endeavors?" "What drives these men?" "Do some people just have a genetic need to live on the edge?" "Or is it just the love for the sport and the thrill?" "Is that they just can't rest easy without knowing if they can pull it of?""Meru" has it all - high adventure, breathtaking shots, and some incredibly tense moments skillfully interwoven with effective use of biographical material that offers accessible emotions of these elusively intrepid souls who challenge one of the toughest mountain routes in the world. It is a soul-stirring adventure to its very core with enough gut-wrenching sequences and stunningly beautiful vistas to thrill theater-seat adventurers and hardcore extreme- sports addicts alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautiful documentary i have watched in a while now. To decide to fail after 17 days at 20000ft at the first attempt and to go back and scale the Meru its breathtaking. I don't know how they manage to take video of this assent. The hanging Tent scenes, the panoramic Himalayas is just beautiful and. First i thought it was another normal dramatized movie, but there is no drama in it, Just the real story and the narration will hold you on. You also gasp for breath in between and skip couple of heart beats at sometimes.Its about the passion, its challenging, its unbelievable, its inspiring. Like it says , "Its unpredictable,dangerous and unknown"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Admiration but off their heads?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People always talk about Everest as the ultimate mountain to climb but that hasn't been true for a long time. On Everest you can hire Sherpas to carry your stuff , to fix your ropes for you and to take most of the risks. Most climbers worth their sorts have climbed it many times , some have even skied off of it. Mount Meru is a whole different ball game. This is documentary about three climbers who attempt to climb the unchartered "Shark Fin" summit of Meru and it tells their story along the way. In a way I enjoyed this more than the film Everest because this is real footage and of mountain I wasn't aware of before. You have to admire these people for their determination but on the other hand you can't help but think they have a death wish. I only wish I had an ounce of their determination and drive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be called Jackass Mountain Climbers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary seemed to me to be about totally selfish immature grown men apparently trying to kill themselves with no regard for their families, loved ones and the emergency resources that are squandered trying to save their lives. These guys did not seem like professionals.I respect the skill, courage and endurance involved in mountain climbing but in this case the people involved came across as totally reckless and amateurish with no regard for the gift of life.I did not feel admiration or respect for these people.Their obsession to conquer Meru came across more as a sickness. Were their lives that empty that they had this desperate need for attention? The movie's one saving grace is that the scenery is spectacular.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies like this always leave me wondering exactly what is the appeal in the life-threatening sport of extreme mountaineering. Obvious as the question may be, we gain few insights in this documentary set against the stunning super-peaks of Himalayan India. Instead, we get the sense that the three starring climbers have set out to conquer Meru, and its uber-intimidating Shark Fin approach, yes, because it is there, and because others before them have failed. The three guys at the center of this drama all sport the best in mountaineering gear. It pops and glows, seemingly from right off the pages of the latest North Face catalogue (two of the climbers are part of an athletics team sponsored by the retailer). It's hard to believe the number of hooks, ropes, and other tools of the trade they shlep along. As adventure writer Jon Krakauer, the documentary's premier talking head, points out, unlike as on Everest, there are no sherpas to ease the ascent of super-risky Meru.The photography in this film is extremely impressive. I kept wondering who was taking the often awesomely positioned pictures. Then, in the final credits, I read that two of the climbers are credited as cinematographers -- the handsome and buff Jimmy Chin (once chosen as a magazine's "eligible bachelor," according to Wikipedia), and the more understated and enigmatic Renan Ozturk. We see some incredible footage of how the guys slept in a tent dangling from a sheer rock face, their enclosure looking no more securely attached than a chrysalis to a plant stem. It is hard to fathom how the climbers themselves could have wrangled such a shot. And I was amazed that anyone could drift into slumber from such a death-defying perch.We learn very little about the three daredevils' backgrounds. Poignantly, we are told that Chin's by then deceased mother had implored that he please let her be the first to die. And the 50-ish seeming leader of the team, Conrad Anker, well-known in mountaineering circles for his challenging climbs not only in the Himalayas but in Antarctica, and for having discovered the body of Everest pioneer George Mallory, notes that at one point in the not-distant past he had been living in a van. Er, um...a little explanation, please? He went on to marry the widow of his partner in climbing, a kindred soul who had perished in an avalanche. We also learn about a devastating accident, seemingly involving snowboarding, endured by Ozturk between the threesome's first attempt at Meru and its second, successful venture. We gain insight into Ozturk's relentless efforts to recover after head injuries and the team's back-and-forth about whether to allow him to join the second expedition.I'm glad I saw this film, and I wish these guys well, but I won't be signing up for any mountain-climbing treks soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm software tough...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disappointing cliché. 3 Flat boring characters cannot get enough explaining how difficult there challenge was and how tough they are. How stupid People can be. I have seen about dozens of these commentaries. All those guys tell you exactly the same. Hollow dogmas about frostbite, being tired, all predictable dangers etc. Etc. Etc. The views on the mountains are almost as beautiful as the ones I made during high mountain tracking in the Alps. Most difficult, biggest, highest, coldest, biggetjes avelanche, extremely shocking, do not start to count... Sick symptoms of kapitalistic and spoiled grown ups. This movie kills you faster then climbing the Meru.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Base Camp | "The Symbolic Rectangle"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Divorce can crush you.No, I'm not talking about Meru. That's the lead I wish I'd written for my commentary on Her. www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/reviews-734But IMDb won't let me revise my commentary, because I hit the max tweaks IMDb allows.So, undaunted?a fan of non sequitur, incongruity, Russian Formalist "strange-making," and eccentric creative leaps!?I won't bury the lead this time. Even though the lead doesn't go with Meru. I know, go figure.But I did get something right in my Her commentary: I introduced the concept that I call The Symbolic Triangle.Her spins around a One-Word Theme*: Divorce. The only way through the dark labyrinth of divorce? Acceptance. Her presents a Rite of Passage story that requires the hero, Theo Twombley, to move through the heartache and grief of divorce into an emotional space where he accepts his fate.And the simple geometry of Her's story triangle helps us see through the sizzle to the substance of the movie's deft thematic structure.THE SYMBOLIC TRIANGLE. 1. TITLE: Her (secondarily, the digital-woman played by Scarlett Johansson?the attractive distractor; primarily, Catherine, the real-life woman who dumps the story's hero). 2. ONE-WORD THEME: Divorce. 3. HERO'S NAME: Theo Twombley (screenwriter Spike Jonze's artfully chosen name, which I translate: "A Man For Whom Women Are 'Deities Unknown'").Which brings us to Meru.Meru prompted me to reconfigure the geometry. I shifted to an iconic geometry shared by architecture, painting, literature, and cinema?the archetypal shape of windows, walls, and rooms, of canvases, books, and movie screens.Enter ?THE SYMBOLIC RECTANGLE.Anchored by four cornerstones of thematic unity crucial to the art of story design:1. TITLE | 2. ONE-WORD THEME | 3. SPECIAL WORLD | 4. HERO'S NAMESame as The Symbolic Triangle?except I added Special World.I learned about the Special World from David McKenna&#x200b;, who co-wrote with Christopher Vogler&#x200b; the book &#x200b;"Memo from the Story Department," in which Vogler presents the concept "one word-theme&#x200b;.&#x200b;" I took David's screen writing course at Columbia University. And one day during a class break, we walked and talked. I'd just watched All the President's Men, and I asked David, "What's the Special World?" Now, I was thinking along the lines of The Washington Post, Investigative Journalism, Political Corruption, Abuse of Power...You get the picture.So imagine my surprise when David said, "The Wasp &amp; the Jew." Ah! Woodward &amp; Bernstein. That blew me away. And stuck.My contenders for the Special World of All the President's Men play a role in story design: ARENA. And thanks to Barbara Nicolosi, who unpacks this concept in her screenwriter talks (catharsis.com), we can distinguish between Special World and Arena.But where does Arena fit into The Symbolic Rectangle? Well, I had to mull that over. And I didn't want to turn the rectangle into a pentagon. For symbolic reasons, rectangle makes wayyyyy more sense. As an architect, a painter, and a screenwriter, no way I'm going to base my work on a pentagon! So it hit me: Make the Arena the space defined by the four corners of The Symbolic Rectangle.Think of a story's Arena as Central Park. Or as The Lawn at UVA. The space the sacred space defined by the perimeter. The stage on which the drama unfolds.Back to Meru.THE SYMBOLIC RECTANGLE: MeruFour Corners:1. TITLE: Meru?Meru means "High"2. ONE-WORD THEME: Trust3. SPECIAL WORLD: Team4. HERO'S NAME: Conrad Anker?German origins: Conrad means "bold" and rad "counsel" (rad: "very appealing, good radical"). Anker means "anchor"?a person who provides strength and support.Space:5. ARENA: Mountain ClimbingSure, Meru's a documentary, but the filmmakers clearly signal their awareness of story-design concepts encompassed by The Symbolic Rectangle. (Talk about luck for the hero's name!)Meru tells a story about a trio of brave-beyond-measure mountaineers. But Meru also tells a story about us. Because as Robert McKee says in his workshop and book, Story, every movie is a metaphor for life. A metaphor for my life and your life.Meru sends us the message: To reach our high goal, we too must act boldly?guided by radical good counsel?and provide strength and support for a team in whom we place our trust.Meru asks: Like Conrad Anker and his team, do you have the wherewithal, courage, and bold character to sacrifice everything to achieve your worthy ideal? And when your goal's finally within reach, do you have the humility, wisdom, and grit it takes to retreat? Like the mountain climbers?and filmmakers?did just 150 feet short of the summit? (The filmmakers didn't have a movie after team Anker's 2008 unsuccessful climb.) Or are you so hypnotized by your goal that you blunder, ignoring wise counsel, your inner GPS? Do you have the brains, heart, and guts to hit the reset button? To regroup? To "fail, fail again, fail better," as Samuel Beckett put it? Can you endure an ordeal that doubles or triples in magnitude as you scale your mountain?Because a mountain can crush you.Meru's heroic story impels us to more fully realize our own heroic story. We climb to the summit of the human spirit. And return to base camp transformed, dumbstruck by a team of people powered by audacity, tenacity, foresight, mettle, and trust. And love.McKenna taught me, "The only power of a storyteller is to withhold."Where does WITHHOLD fit into The Symbolic Rectangle? First take: the Perimeter?the line that connects the four corners and outlines the Arena. Because that line? That's a story's Power Line.Dimension six of The Symbolic Rectangle.Meru's Perimeter?6. WITHHOLD: (See the movie.)______________________________________* See "Memo from the Story Department," by Christopher Vogler &amp; David McKenna© Copyright 2015 by JEF7REY HILDNER</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am surprised by the high reviews of this film. I enjoyed this film, but it was good not great. The entire film heavily relies on the account of four interviews including the three climbers in what seems like a single interview with each. There were many dramatic moments that should have been captured on film and highlighted, but were instead reenacted. In "Meru" the drama of the stakes surrounding the endeavor to summit Meru are not clear so the tension in the story is soft. Better execution of using drama in the climb movie genre can be found in films like "Touching the Void," "La Dura," and the TV series "Everest: Beyond the Limit." In those films the stakes of the endeavor is real, present, and apparent thought the storytelling. One of the possible reasons some opportunities for drama are missed in "Meru" may be because one of the climbers was also the director of the film. A few key events in "Meru" were somewhat glossed over. I am not a fan of a characters that close a long dramatic sub- story with, "so yea, I survived." Again, the film is good, not great.</fullReview>
