		<fullReview>THE BIG SLEEP is one of the more entertaining private eye movies I have seen. A dying old man has two beautiful, uncontrollable daughters: Vivien (Lauren Bacall), and Carmen (Martha Vickers). Carmen is being blackmailed, and her father hires P.I. Christopher Marlowe (the beloved Humphrey Bogart) to get the blackmailer off her back. But Marlowe finds that somebody else has done this job for him: the blackmailer is murdered almost under his nose. And as he puts it, "That didn't stop things. That just starts 'em."I have not read Raymond Chandler's novel, on which this movie was based, but those who have say the title refers to death. That is never explained in the movie. Howard Hawks packs so much plot into 114 minutes of footage that the movie feels like it's bursting at the seams. The story is not incomprehensible as some would have it; while there are many improbable coincidences, there is no element I can point to and say "That couldn't have happened." (Although I'm still not quite sure how Carmen got into Marlowe's apartment). True, the plot really is very hard to follow, and Marlowe's periodic explanations of events, without which the movie would indeed be nonsensical, smack more of inspired guesswork than logical deduction. But the furious pace at which the plot unfolds lends more excitement to the movie than nine out of ten of today's lazily plotted would-be thrillers.THE BIG SLEEP's greatest strength is its delightfully droll dialogue. When Chandler writes the novel and then Faulkner helps adapt it, you expect some verbal fireworks, and you sure do get them. "How do you like your brandy?" "In a glass." - "You're not very tall, are you?" "I try to be." - "I'm getting cuter every minute." - "Such a lot of guns around town, and so few brains." - "Is it any of your business?" "I could make it my business." "I could make your business mine." "You wouldn't like it. The pay's too small." - "She tried to sit in my lap while I was standing up." Bogie and Bacall get two of the best exchanges; they have a horse-racing discussion where racy double-entendres are dripping like savory sauce off of every word, and they also get a truly hilarious telephone conversation where Marlowe convinces Vivien not to call the police.But THE BIG SLEEP has a harder side that is also effective. It is shockingly violent for a movie produced under the stern eyes of the Hayes code censors. The movie is too unpredictable to generate much suspense (you can't dread something you don't know is going to happen), but the ending is one of the most intense, nailbiting scenes you'll ever see.The 1940s were not a great era for film music, which makes Max Steiner's brooding score all the more impressive. The print I saw was very low-quality, so I can't judge the cinematography.The acting is wonderful. Bogart gets to show his chops at one point by switching off the hard-boiled personality he developed for THE MALTESE FALCON and impersonating an antiquarian bookworm. Bacall radiates class whether she's at ease smoking in a cafe or outwitting a man holding her at gunpoint. Martha Vickers' Carmen strikes the perfect balance of appealing seductiveness and outright nastiness.One final note: this movie is almost Bond-like in terms of the number of appallingly beautiful women Marlowe accidentally encounters, all of whom seem to have a burning desire for him. Even his taxi driver wants him. Dorothy Malone, whose character name we never learn, plays the sexiest book seller you will ever meet (and yes, she wears glasses; eat your heart out, Dorothy Parker!). Minus fifty points for credibility, plus a hundred points for entertainment. Regrettably, I cannot promise similar thrills for the female audience; it just kind of depends on how you like Men In Suits.Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic private eye tale with Bogart and Bacall in fine form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic of American cinema, actually made during the war and released in 1946, got a whole nation of young men affecting Bogey mannerisms, raising their eyebrows or showing their teeth while grimacing, and especially pulling on their earlobes while deep in thought, a smoking cigarette dangling between their lips. It was the genius of Howard Hawks, who directed, to do everything possible to make Humphrey Bogart a matinée idol, including having Lauren Bacall slump down in the car seat so as not to tower over him. With this movie a new kind of cinematic hero was created, the existential PI, a seemingly ordinary looking guy gifted with street smarts and easy courage, admired by men, and adored by women.Hawks fashioned this, part of the Bogart legend, with a noire script penned by William Faulkner, et al., adapted from Raymond Chandler's first novel, that sparkled with spiffy lines, intriguing characters, danger and a not entirely serious attention to plot detail. Hawks surrounded Bogey with admiring dames, beginning with the sexy Martha Vickers who tries to jump into his lap while he's still standing (as Marlowe tells General Sternwood), and ending with the incomparable Lauren Bacall, looking beguiling, beautiful and mysteriously seductive. In fact, every female in the cast wants to get her hands on Bogey, including a quick and easy Dorothy Malone, bored in her specs while clerking at a book store. Hawks also employed some very fine character actors, most notably Elisa Cook Jr., and Bob Steele, the former as always, the little guy crook, (Harry Jones), and the latter, as often seen in westerns, the mindless heavy with a gun (Canino). Charles Waldron played the world-weary general and Charles D. Brown was the butler.I was reminded somehow of the old Charlie Chan movies with the dark, mysterious, ornately-decorated interiors heavily carpeted and studded with ethnic statuettes, especially the house on Laverne Terrace that Bogey keeps coming back to, and the glass-paned doors and glass-separated cubicals of his office and others. The atmospheric L.A. created here has been much admired and imitated, cf., Chinatown (1974) and L.A. Confidential (1997), two very superior movies that continued the tradition.In comparing this to the book, I have to say it's a little on the white-washed side, and not as clearly drawn--'confused' some have said. Of course liberties were taken with Chandler's novel to make it romantic. Chandler's novel emphasizes cynicism, and romance takes a back seat to manliness and loyalty to the client. An especially striking difference is in the character of General Sternwood's younger daughter, Carmen. She is vividly drawn in the book as something of monster, a degenerate sex kitten who would try and do just about anything. She is twice encountered butt naked by Marlowe, once in his bed. Being the sterling guy he is, he turns her away. (Right. I could do that.) Another difference is in all the sleazy details about the low-life underworld of Los Angeles that are omitted or glossed over in the film, including Geiger's homosexuality and his gay house guest, Carol Lundgren. (Of course there was a code in those days.) Bacall's character in the movie is actually a fusion of Vivian and Mona Mars from the book, made nice for movie fans. In the book, Marlowe kisses Vivian, but turns down her invitation for more intimate contact. In the movie, of course, there is no way Bogart is going to say 'no' to Bacall. In the book Marlowe seems to prefer whiskey to women.Most of the sharp dialogue comes right from Chandler's novel, including Bogart's grinning line, 'Such a lot of guns around town, and so few brains.' Interesting is the little joke on Bogart in the opening scene. In the novel, Chandler's hero is greeted by the purring Carmen with the words, 'Tall, aren't you?' Well, the one thing Bogey ain't is tall, and so in the movie Carmen says, 'You're not very tall, are you?' Bogart comes back with, 'I try to be.' In the novel, Marlowe says, 'I didn't mean to be.'By the way, the film features Bacall singing a forties tune and looking mighty good doing it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>Interesting DVD Release of the Proto-Noir Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE BIG SLEEP has a reputation for being a film that gets lost in its own complexity and which fails to clearly identify all the perpetrators of all the murders that litter its scenes. There is a certain truth to this: like the Raymond Chandler novel on which it is based, the plot is extremely complicated, and it requires the viewer to mentally track an unexpected number of characters--including two characters that never appear on screen, a pivotal character who doesn't actually have any lines, and a character who is frequently mentioned but doesn't appear until near the film's conclusion. There is not, however, as much truth to the accusation that the film never exposes all the killers: only one killer is not specifically identified, but even so his identity is very clearly implied.All this having been said, THE BIG SLEEP is one helluva movie. In general, the story concerns the wealthy Sternwood family, which consists of an aging father and two "pretty and pretty wild" daughters--one of whom, Carmen, is being victimized by a blackmailer. P.I. Philip Marlowe is hired to get rid of the blackmailer, but an unexpected murder complicates matters... and touches off a series of killings by a number of parties who have covert interests in the Sternwood family.Perhaps the most amazing thing about the film is that you don't actually have to pick apart the complicated story in order to enjoy it. The script is famous for its witty lines and sleek sexual innuendo--much of it lifted directly from Chandler's novel--and the cast is a dream come true. Philip Marlowe would be played by a great many actors, but none of them ever bested Humphrey Bogart, who splendidly captures the feel of Chandler's original creation; with the role of Vivien Sternwood Lauren Bacall gives what might be the finest performance of her screen career; and the chemistry between the two is everything you've ever heard. The supporting cast is superlative, all the way from Martha Vickers' neurotic turn as Carmen Sternwood to Bob Steele's purring hit-man Canino. There's simply not a false note to be found any where. Although the film really pre-dates the film noir movement the entire look of THE BIG SLEEP anticipates noir to a remarkable degree--it would be tremendously influential--and director Hawks gives everything a sharp edge from start to finish.Two versions of THE BIG SLEEP are included on the DVD: the film as it was originally shot and the film as it was released to theatres in 1946. The actual differences between the two are fairly slight, but they prove significant. Although the original version is somewhat easier to follow in terms of story, it lacks the flash that makes the theatrical version such a memorable experience; it is easy to see why Hawks elected to rescript and reshoot several key scenes as well as add new ones, and both newcomers and old fans will have fun comparing the two. The DVD also includes an enjoyable documentary on the differences between the films and the motivations behind them.I don't usually comment on picture quality unless there is a glaring issue, but several reviewers have noted portions of this print have a flicker or seem a bit washed out. I noticed these problems, but I can't say that they in any way distracted from my enjoyment of the film, and they certainly don't prevent me from recommending it--be it on the big screen, television, video or this DVD. And I recommend it very, very strongly indeed.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex plot, but well written and well scripted with tough dialogue and great characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philip Marlowe is a private detective who is hired by General Sternwood to investigate a case of blackmail involving his youngest daughters' gambling debts. The General has lost his right hand man, Shaun Regan, and needs a man able to do the job. Marlowe investigates the blackmailer, Geiger and tails him to a house. When he hears shots he rushes in to find Geiger dead and Carmen strung out of her head. With Geiger dead, Marlowe follows the trail to Joe Brody, who also gets rubbed out, and then to Eddie Mars, who's wife is rumoured to have run off with Regan. As he digs deeper Marlowe finds only corruption and deceit but also starts to fall for the General's eldest daughter, Vivian Rutledge.Despite the fact that this film is overly complicated at times, it still stands out as a classic bit of noir, even if aspects other than the plot are what really makes it as good as it is. The plot starts simply but quickly becomes a much more complex beast that moves beyond the issue of blackmail and into murder and lies. For many viewers, this will be a challenge - so many characters come and go in a short period that it is hard to keep track of how they all relate to each other, and the fact that we're not always supposed to know the connections just makes it more difficult at times. However, if you manage to make it past the midpoint of the film without having totally lost track of people then it becomes clearer towards the end. It may sound silly, but this time I watched the film with a pen and paper to help me keep track of who's who - it really helped; but it is worth noting that, even with help, bits of the plot will make little sense at times.The focus of the film is not the plot - the focus of the film I think is the relationship dynamic between Marlowe and Vivian. In this regard the film really works well. The relationship between is tough but trusting no matter what; at times it is a little hard to see the affection between the two being real or realistic but it is the dialogue between the two that makes it work despite this. The writing is fantastic, the scenes between them do fizzle but the dialogue across the whole film is perfect: it is tough, memorable and basically it is the way I'm sure we all wish we could talk at some point in our lives! The material is also quite daring for the period - murder and tough talk was not unusual but the issues of drugs and nymphomania are hardly common subjects for such a mainstream film at the time.The performances are fantastic and perfectly fit the material. Although this is not my favourite Bogart performance (I love him in Maltese Falcon) he is still brilliant here, he is cool, tough and intelligent - at times his power over women threatens to be unrealistic but his presence makes it work. His character is not as complex as in Maltese Falcon but Bogart does harried and world-weary better than anyone else. Bacall is great even if I don't personally find her that attractive; she has a great chemistry with Bogart and delivers the goods. Vickers is also good but in a less subtle role. The support cast includes tough turns from Cook, Heydt and Ridgely all of whom convince as tough guys but not to the point where they threaten to eclipse the shining star of Bogart.Overall this is a classic film despite the fact that the plot is too difficult at times and doesn't always hang together. The flaws here are covered by a tough script that delivers the goods in terms of both dialogue and characters. The plot is a complex web but the basic energy and relationship dynamics keep the film moving really well through scenes that continue to show their influence in films today. Not a perfect film but a great bit of noir that is likely to be loved by the vast majority of viewers - just keep that pen and paper to hand though!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"My, my, my, such a lot of guns around town and so few brains."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starting out, I must advise that my review here is for the 1945 pre-release version of "The Big Sleep", which had quite a few scenes redone prior to it's release to general audiences in October 1946. With filming already completed by Spring of 1945, there were two main reasons for the year and a half delay; first, with World War II underway, Warner Brothers felt compelled to get it's war related films into theaters while they were still timely. Secondly, Producer/Director Howard Hawks was convinced he had to re-shoot some scenes involving Lauren Bacall, who was critically panned in her latest film, "Confidential Agent" with Charles Boyer. In the original print, Bacall is presented in a few scenes wearing a distracting veil, and it's her more glamorous side that the studio needed to capitalize on.Much has been made of the complexity of the "The Big Sleep", and deservedly so. On my latest viewing, I took pen in hand to keep track of the characters and situations. That only helped so much. For example, Humprey Bogart's character, private detective Philip Marlowe is tailing rare book dealer Arthur Gwynne Geiger for his client General Sternwood; Geiger allegedly holds gambling debts involving a few thousand dollars on Sternwood's daughter Carmen (Martha Vickers). Following Geiger's auto to his residence, Marlowe studies his surroundings, and then hears a woman's scream and gunshots, followed immediately by two cars careening out of the driveway. Entering the house, he discovers the lifeless body of Geiger, and a spaced out Carmen Sternwood. Out of this scenario are offered two, maybe three possibilities. First, General Sternwood's chauffeur Owen Taylor is implicated, as he had fallen in love with Carmen and wanted to defend her from blackmail. Secondly, a shady Geiger accomplice Joe Brody may have done it, OR may have chased the guilty Taylor from the crime scene either to retrieve some incriminating blackmail film or to remove him as a potential witness. OR, the spaced out Carmen could have killed Geiger herself, and although this wasn't offered as a possibility in the film, she WAS present, and may have been entirely coherent when the murder was committed.And this is how the story proceeds. Even more characters are introduced to spin off the original plot, and Marlowe is off investigating the proprietor of a gambling house named Eddie Mars, Brody's accomplice Agnes Lozier, the salesgirl at the rare bookstore, and Harry Jones (Elisha Cook Jr.), a tail on Marlowe who gets rubbed out after setting up a meeting with Agnes that might provide more information to go on.All of the intrigue aside, it's the chemistry once again between Bogey and by now, Mrs. Bogey, Lauren Bacall that propels this movie forward. Whether just sizing each other up at the beginning of the film, or as unwilling accomplices and possible lovers by film's end, it's the snappy banter and smoldering tension between the two that put the sizzle into this edgy noir thriller. As if to prove how great an actor Bogart was, this film offers us a glimpse at his incredible range. Of course I'm referring to the bookstore scene in which Bogey portrays a nerdy client seeking information on a non existent rare book. With a mere upturn of his hat's brim and a cleverly positioned pair of glasses, Bogart completely transforms into an almost unrecognizable comic character who befuddles and infuriates the store's proprietress. He follows that up with a walk across the street, and a double entendre filled conversation with a disarmingly seductive Dorothy Malone in a scene that could have lingered into X-rated territory if not for the task at hand.One could go on and on about "The Big Sleep", and others have, but to appreciate the film's mystery, darkness and noir complexity you'll have to view it. But don't try to solve the case, you won't want to hurt yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Ignore That Discombobulated Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many fans of this classic film are drawn to it because of Bogie and Bacall, who do indeed make a deft acting duo. Here, Bogie plays Philip Marlowe, the tough talking, street savvy PI, who has his roots in the crime novels of writer Raymond Chandler. Bacall plays Vivian Sternwood, the adult daughter of a wealthy man. Vivian is just as tough and cagey as Marlowe. And she has a younger sister named Carmen, who seems to have fallen in with a bad crowd. It's up to Marlowe to investigate, and to save the Sternwood family from financial ruin. "The Big Sleep" is a story of blackmail, murder, multiple motives, lies, and all manner of general mayhem.Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall are certainly persuasive in their roles. I also like the script's snappy dialogue. For example, in a conversation with General Sternwood, Marlowe responds: "Hmm". Sternwood follows up: "What does that mean?" To which Marlowe fires back: "It means, hmm". Marvelous.But the film's plot is an incoherent mess. It is hard to follow, disjointed, and has obvious lapses. Further, secondary characters (Geiger, Brody, Mars, et.al.), and their interrelationships, are poorly defined. To some extent that vagueness and lack of precision are fairly common in 1940's pulp detective stories.The best approach to "The Big Sleep" is to engulf the relationship between Marlowe and Vivian, marvel at the acting of Bogie and Bacall, enjoy the witty dialogue, and ignore the discombobulated plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Big Sleep" is one of those movies I never tire of watching. Bogie, playing Philip Marlowe - one of his finer roles, commands the screen, wise-cracking with felons and coppers alike, giving a few beatings and taking a lot himself. The night scenes are wonderfully shot, with shadow and fog effects being used perfectly. The main reason to watch this movie, though, are the scenes between Bogart and Bacall. Their on-screen chemistry (fueled by their off-screen romance) lends the most weight to the film. My favorite of their exchanges is when Bogart, tied up yet still smoking, tells Bacall to "take this cigarette out of my mouth". And, of course, they kiss. A short while later, she helps Bogie take out a hired killer. Bogie remarks "I didn't think they made them like that anymore." They certainly don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Read all of my reviews at www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com This classic film noir has very few of techniques generally associated with noir. It contains no skewed camera angles; and though it is darkly lit, it is not overcome with murky, obscuring shadows. The hero is not down-and-out, poor, or desperate. There is no retrospective narration, or flashbacks. Yet, the Big Sleep is widely considered to be one of the very best of this genre. It is a cynical, perverse, murderous world filled with loads of confusing action and unknown motives. It is, in fact, one of the great films of one of the screens greatest actors (for my personal top 10 actors list, click here), and most talented directors.It was directed by Howard Hawks fresh off of the successful pairing of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Becall in To Have and Have Not. The two star here again and it is easy to see why they made another two films together. Based on a Raymond Chandler novel of the same name, many people complain that this film is incomprehensible. Somewhat famously it is reported that Bogart and Hawks, after arguing over who killed one of the characters, called up Chandler to get the correct answer. Chandler didn't have the slightest idea, for the novel is rather vague on this point. It's true that both the novel and film leave many plot points as to who did what to whom more than unclear, but there is so much style in both that it's hard to make a convincing argument against them.A good deal of the confusion within the film comes from the production codes in effect at the time it was produced. Chandler's novel deals with murder, homosexuality, heterosexuality, and pornography. At the time, these things were deemed unfit to show on a movie screen and so Hawks had to hint at them using various subtle methods. For instance, when Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers) is found by detective Phillip Marlow (Bogart) in the novel she is completely nude and sitting posed for a hidden camera. Since pornography is explicitly against code, in the movie she is dressed in a silky, Japanese gown. There is still a hidden camera, and its missing film becomes a catalyst for much of the action in the film. We must infer from the exotic nature of the gown that there was more than just pictures of a woman in a gown going on. There are many similar instances in the film like this. For an audience member who has not read the book, they must pay close attention to the subtext, or the film will seem baffling.Personally, I am very much a fan of the book, and all of Chandler's work. While I appreciate that some of the finer plot points are a bit vague in this film, I also understand that the film succeeds not in the details of the story, but in a sinister sense of style. The film oozes with a dark, disquieting atmosphere. Nearly everyone Marlowe meets is hiding something, and is of less than upstanding moral character. Hawks does a great job of keeping nearly every scene in the dark or in the rain, or both. There are so many characters coming in and out of the shadows and with their own shady character that it is difficult to keep up.Bogart, of course, does a marvelous job as Marlowe. He seems to understand a lot more information than the audience is ever given. Chandler wrote Marlowe as a detective who sticks by his own set up morals, remaining somewhat of a noble creature trying to stay afloat amongst the muck and sewers of the city. Lauren Bacall does a very good job portraying Vivian Sternwood Rutledge, in a role that is much different than the one in the book. Like many films from this era, they create a romance that wasn't really in the source material. I don't mind though, because Bogart and Bacall really sizzle.What can I say that hasn't been said before? This is really classic noir at its best. It's got Bogart and Bacall. It was directed by Howard Hawks, written by William Faulkner from a novel by Raymond Chandler. What more could a lover of classic cinema want? More reviews at www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was the film in which Bogart became Marlowe for all time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frequently compared with Huston's "The Maltese Falcon" as one of the classics of the private eye genre, "The Big Sleep" is, in many ways, far removed from the former film? Where on the contrary "The Maltese Falcon" has a basically simple plot about the hunt for a priceless statuette, "The Big Sleep" has probably the most complicated story ever filmed? And, more important, where Hammett's Sam Spade was uncompromising, mercenary and a winner, Raymond Chandlers Philip Marlowe was a frequent sufferer at the hands of cops and hoods and in many ways a loser? "The Big Sleep" almost defies plot analysis? Just about the only part of the film that is straightforward is the opening sequence when Marlowe undertakes a job of investigation for a crippled millionaire whose daughter is being blackmailed? Afterwards it fills up with such a vast assortment of shadowy characters ? whores, pimps, killers, gamblers, a dope hooked deb who sucks her thumb ? it is almost impossible to follow? Nevertheless let me mention that Bogart was hired ostensibly to track down a blackmailer, but quickly finds himself immersed in murder, and harmonized double-crosses? The film has speed, efficiency and magnificent craftsmanship, it has wit? and the acting, needless to say, is of the quality one expects from a Warner's movie of the Forties? Bogart witnesses Bob Steele smilingly giving Elisha Cook, Jr., a poisoned glass of water, all the while assuring him that he has nothing to fear; and Bogart's coldly calculated shootout with Steele later in the film? Bacall moves stealthily in fear or shame, Martha Vickers expresses displeasure, resentment, and bad humor, chief heavy John Ridgeley shows anger and Elisha Cook Jr. is furtive?If the magic, whether it was entirely calculated in advance or not, lies in the absolute congruence of the Marlowe character with Bogart's screen personality, it nevertheless was an important contribution to the Bogart mystique and is usually paired with "The Maltese Falcon" when reissued? This was the film in which Bogart became Marlowe for all time... It was the only time he played Marlowe, but it stuck? Bogart as Marlowe is a rock of logic in a carousel of shady characters with clear psychological motivations for only partially explained actions...When it first appeared, "The Big Sleep" was attacked in some quarters for violence and amorality? but beneath its cynicism and toughness there breathed a heart and sentimentality which he1p to make it timeless?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Over Here, Canino"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second of the Bogey and Bacall pairings has Humphrey Bogart playing his second pulp fiction detective for the screen. Previously he had done Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and now he's Philip Marlowe in The Big Sleep. He's at the top of his game in both.Bogey's been hired by Philip Waldron to get rid of a blackmailer that's got something on one of his daughters, the amoral and disturbed Martha Vickers. The older daughter Lauren Bacall intrigues Bogey a bit more when she tries to pry into exactly what Bogart is doing for her father. Seems as though a family chauffeur has gone missing a while back and the family is concerned on a number of levels.The plot glides into the question of the missing chauffeur and Bogart meets all kinds of interesting characters before all the mysteries are solved.The Big Sleep proved that the teaming on screen of Bogey and Bacall was no flash in the pan success that they had in Two Have and Have Not. They are surrounded with a great cast of players. Dorothy Malone got her first notice on film as a bookstore proprietor. Elisha Cook essays one of his typical roles as a luckless fall guy. John Ridgely is properly menacing as gambler Eddie Mars.But my favorite in this film has always been Bob Steele as the vicious killer Canino who Ridgely has on retainer. Why Bob Steele wasted his time with two bit grade C westerns when he was doing work like this is beyond me. My favorite scene in The Big Sleep has always been when Bogey blasts Steele after Bacall has diverted his attention. When you hear Bogart utter those words, "over here, Canino" he was never more chilling or menacing on the screen before or after.Set comfortably within it's time in the Forties, The Big Sleep still packs quite a wallop for today's audience. May you never have Humphrey Bogart looking to nail you for some misdeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howard Hawks directs Raymond Chandler's novel on the silver screen. None other than William Faulkner is primary screenplay writer. Bogart and Bacall star in this grand black and white thriller. Private eye Philip Marlowe(Bogart)is hired by a very wealthy family to protect a young woman from her own indiscretions and along the way there is murder, blackmail, car chases and gun play to deal with. Right smack in the middle of this complex case Marlowe finds time to fall in love with his client's eldest daughter(Bacall). Murder galore does not phase our cool detective with the cigarette hanging from his thin lips.Flawless acting from Bogart and Bacall. There is a very talented supporting cast that includes Regis Toomey, Martha Vickers, Elisha Cook Jr., Bob Steele and John Ridgely. Then there is the charming Dorothy Malone that sizzles in her short time on screen. Very witty dialogue and colorful characters make this a classic among classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Los Angeles, the private investigator Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) is invited by the wealthy General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) to a meeting at his house. General Sternwood, who lives with his pretty and wild daughters Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Bacall) and Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers), explains that he has been blackmailed by the bookseller Arthur Geiger on Carmen debts in gambling. The general also tells that he had been blackmailed in the past by the scum Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), but his Irish friend and shamus Sean Reagan resolved the situation. Then Sean decided to leave L. A. with Mona Mars (Peggy Knudsen), the wife of casino owner Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), but now Sean has gone missing. Vivian meets Marlowe when he is leaving the house and tells that she had borrowed money from Eddie Mars to pay for photos of Carmen.Marlowe follows Geiger from his bookstore home and when he hears Carmen screaming, he discovers that Geiger is dead, Carmen is doped and also a hidden camera missing the film with photos of Carmen. Marlowe brings Carmen home and when he returns, Geiger's body is vanished. Then Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls (Regis Toomey) invites his friend Marlowe to go with him to see a body of the general's driver in a Packard that has been withdrawn from the pier. Marlowe connects the dots and is evolved by a complex network of blackmails and deaths while Vivian and he fall in love with each other."The Big Sleep" is a splendid film-noir, actually one of the best I have ever seen, directed by Howard Hawks with a magnificent story of blackmail and deaths and stunning performances. Lauren Bacall is the perfect femme fatale and Humphrey Bogart, my favorite actor ever, has another top-notch performance. The plot has many details and sleazy characters and I intend to see this movie again in a near future to "catch" details that might have gone missing. Last but not the least, I found the explanation of the title in Google that means "death" and is explained in the novel. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "? Beira do Abismo" ("On the Edge of the Abyss")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Big Sleep (1946)Even hardened film noir and Humphrey Bogart fans admit that this is one confusing movie. It makes sense, but it is edited down to such essentials, and it barrels along with the intensity of a bullet in a smoky canyon using overlapping dialog e and a shower of names, half of whom end up dead, it's really an impossible job for a mortal viewer.And that's where it's aura, and magic, and legend, lie. It's a great film, and if it's flawed by its excessive velocity, it's defined by it, too. Enjoy Bogart as such, and Lauren Bacall for her sporadic appearances, and for Elisha Cook Jr. for a brief, wonderful splash. All the side characters, even the ones who are clearly only characters, are dripping with criminal drama. The photography is dark but never obscure, the action is fast but never unreasonable, and the lines are classic noir.In fact, the dialog, if you are paying attention, is one of the gems of 1940s movies--really witty and cutting, and cunning. The movie is brilliant top to bottom, if only you could keep track of what was going on. Suggestions: Read the plot in the Wikipedia entry before you watch the movie a second time. (The first time, just dive and and get lost. It's too much fun to care, if you can let go.) Watch Bogart's delivery, his physical presence, his wherewithal. Listen to Bacall sing (pretty darned good). Watch the amazing light and camera work (Sydney Hickox) with it's constantly moving perspective and layers of action. Follow the score (Max Steiner) which is appropriately restrained, turning just slightly when Bogart and Bacall are in scenes together. Howard Hawks pulls of a quirky masterpiece here. You get to the end and frankly don't care too much, perhaps, about the outcome, about who survives and what their futures might hold. But that's fine, too. It might just make you want to watch it again. Good filmmaking does that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Bogart-Bacall melodrama from Raymond Chandler novel...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I take exception to something that previous commentator David R. Baker of Missouri makes in reference to film music. He states: "The 1940s was not a great era for film music which makes Max Steiner's brooding score even more impressive." HE'S GOT TO BE KIDDING! Did he ever hear of Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Bernard Herrmann, Alfred Newman, Miklos Rozsa and Aaron Copland, all of whom did their best work in the 1940s? And Max Steiner himself was responsible for such outstanding scores as those for 'Casablanca', 'Now, Voyager', 'Johnny Belinda' and 'The Letter'. The others had a hand in 'The Song of Bernadette', 'The Sea Hawk', 'Citizen Kane', 'The Heiress', 'The Lost Weekend' and 'Spellbound', among many others. In fact, the 1940s is often referred to as The Golden Age of Film Composers. And another mistake, Bogey is Philip Marlowe--not Christopher Marlowe. As for 'The Big Sleep', I agree, Max Steiner's score was an important ingredient. So are the quirky characters, including actresses Dorothy Malone (as an oversexed bookstore owner who seduces Bogey on a rainy day afternoon) and Martha Vickers as the thumb-sucking sister of Bacall, a nymphomaniac, whom Marlowe refers to as having tried to sit on his lap while he was standing up--just one of the punchy lines in the witty script. Confusion abounds everywhere in the plot that's as full of holes as swiss cheese--but who cares? It's all done in mock-serious style with the usual Warner Bros. finesse in black and white cinematography. Only jarring note is the script's insistence that every female in the cast sees Bogey as a sex symbol--something even Bogart would have found amusing since he never considered himself that much of a looker. He makes Philip Marlowe a believable enough character and the part fits him like a glove. After the preview, the studio added additional Bogart-Bacall scenes of hanky panky to give the film an added zing. It works!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If someone asked me to summarize the plot of, say, "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre," I could probably do it easily enough. "Three men go gold prospecting and one of them goes nuts." But Raymond Chandler's plots, of which this is one, defy facile description, let alone analysis.I understand that William Faulkner is given lead credit for the writing but I can't imagine he had very much to do with it. Faulkner wasn't sober all that often -- "Old corn-drinking mellifluous", Hemingway called him -- and description, not dialog, was Faulkner's forte anyway.Anyhow I'm not going to bother much with the plot. Half-way through, Humphrey Bogart, as Chandler's private detective, Philip Marlowe, appears to have satisfactorily wrapped up the case assigned to him by General Sternwood. The misbehaviors, legal and otherwise, seem to have been explained to the General and Bogart has been paid off. But Bogart decides to poke around further, on his own, largely because he's fallen in love with Sternwood's daughter, Lauren Bacall, and she with him. If someone can provide a logical link between Bogart's love for Bacall and Bogart's decision to kibbitz in events of no consequence to either of the two, I'd be grateful.Here's what Bogart tells Bacall in his office. "You're trying to find out what your father hired me to find out and I'm trying to find out why you're trying to find out." Amen.And -- let me ramble for a moment -- what in the name of all creatures is Geiger the crooked book dealer up to? "Blackmail," somehow involving photographs of Sternwood's naughtier daughter, Carmen, the one who tries to sit in Bogart's lap while he's standing up. In Chandler's novel at least Marlowe manages to get hold of one of Geiger's books. "It was filth," says Marlowe -- meaning pornography. Okay. That at least tells us what kind of illegal enterprise Geiger was involved in. Simply OWNING a copy of "Lady Chatterly's Lover" could wind you up in jail, never mind SELLING it. The "blackmailing" business is a poor substitute because it raises additional questions the movie doesn't answer. Who was being blackmailed for what? There are too many other discrepancies between the novel and the film to bother with. And Raymond Chandler and William Faulkner are no more than popular pegs for the real author -- Howard Hawks -- to hang the story on. Bogart is nearly perfect as Philip Marlowe, just as he was nearly perfect as Dashiel Hammett's Sam Spade in the earlier "The Maltese Falcon." Bogart and Hawks had made one previous film together but this was their last. Hawks didn't like Bogart's horning in on his supernally beautiful new find, Lauren Bacall, and sneaking off for mid-afternoon, umm, assignations.What one remembers from "The Big Sleep" is not the story but the characters and the exchanges between them. "The Maltese Falcon" at least had the search for the black bird to hold it together. This movie has nothing of the sort. Instead, we remember Bogart imitating an androgynous book collector, a scene that was improvised on the spot, as many of Hawks' memorable moments were. The movie has a kind of slapdash quality to it that keeps it from becoming more than an entertainment. Yet -- entertaining it is. It's filled with little quirky gestures, mannerisms, and apothegms. Hawks has Bogart pulling his ear while he's thinking. And it's a wonder that some of the banter between Bogart and Bacall sneaked past the censors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considered as a classic example of the film noir style, Howard Hawks' "The Big Sleep" is famous not only for the complexity of its convoluted plot, but for the high quality of its dialogs as well as the legendary coupling of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Oddly enough, the movie's most famous traits were not in the film's original version, and became the result of a series of changes and additions Hawks did to the film from the day when the shooting ended until the day it was released. The original version had less romance, and a better explained plot; it was only after the success of the two stars as a couple that it was decided to add more scenes between them, and "The Big Sleep" as we know it was born. Time proved that the changes were worthy, as now that both versions are available it is easy to pick a favorite. This review of "The Big Sleep" is based on the 1946 final version, as personally I find it superior to the less convoluted original (but definitely less fun) cut.In "The Big Sleep", private detective Philip Marlowe (Bogart) makes a visit to Gen. Sternwood (Charles Waldron), an old handicapped man who has a mission for him. Sternwood tells Marlowe that he wants him to take care of the gambling debts of her younger daughter Carmen (Martha Vickers), as she is being blackmailed by a bookseller named Geiger (an uncredited Theodore Von Eltz). Marlowe takes the job, but before leaving he is confronted by Sternwood's other daughter, Vivian (Lauren Bacall), who wants Marlowe to find out what happened to their former employee Sean Regan, who simply disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Marlow finds Geiger and follows him home, but the plot thickens when he finds Geiger dead in his home, killed by a mysterious man and with Carmen in the crime scene while high on drugs. But this death will only be the beginning.Based on Raymond Chandler's novel of the same name, "The Big Sleep" is definitely one wild ride to a dark world filled with gangsters, femme fatals, pornographers and drug addicts; in simple words, the epitome of Film Noir stories with the character of Philip Marlow as one of the genre's biggest icon. The script (by the excellent team of William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman) follows closely the novel's story, but of course, with many interesting changes and additions, most of them being the exchanges of dialogs between Bogart and Bacall in an attempt to cash in in the couple's popularity. It is in this series of dialogs where the magic of "The Big Sleep" is, as the focus on the relationship between the couple drives the movie and makes the complex ambiguity of the plot feel more accessible and enjoyable.As usual, Howard Hawks' direction is direct and straightforward, letting the dialogs to drive the movie but at the same keeping true to the Noir style of its hard boiled source novel. It is easy to notice that Hawks considered the characters to be more important than his story, as the film focuses entirely on their actions instead of the results of those actions. It is this style what makes the film work, as he makes sure that the many supporting characters of the film receive a moment to shine in scenes of great emotion and juicy lines of dialog. Visually, the film is a textbook of how to make a movie in the Noir style, with the excellent cinematography by Sidney Hickox being a highlight of the movie, and the subtle yet appropriate score by Max Steiner creating the proper atmosphere of decadence that runs through the film as Marlowe gets deeper and deeper inside this dark world.Being that the screenplay makes the characters the main focus, the performances by the cast are essential for the film. Bogart's portrayal of Raymond Chandler's best-known character, Phillip Marlowe, easily ranks as one of the icons of the Film Noir genre, in a legendary performance only equaled by Lauren Bacall's Vivan Sternwood. Their chemistry on screen was explosive, and Hawks knew exactly how to use it for his benefit. "The Big Sleep" is certainly one of the best (if not THE best) film with the legendary couple. As many have pointed out, Martha Vickers is a highlight of the film, stealing every scene she is in with her delightful portrayal of the wild spoiled brat Carmen Sternwood. A remarkable group of actors make the supporting roles of the film to come alive, each one of them adding their talents to the movie with excellent results. Dorothy Malone and Elisha Cook Jr. stand out among the rest by stealing the small scenes they appear.The overtly complex plot may be considered by many as a flaw of the movie, specially as it is hard to follow at first and it gives the feeling of constant plot holes. However, this ambiguous way of telling the story is just another device Hawks uses to keep the story character driven. It may seem at first that Hawks doesn't care too much for the plot (and on a second thought, maybe he really didn't), but in the end this overtly complex puzzle reflects what Marlowe himself is experiencing, and in many ways makes the audience to identify with the detective and his work trying to solve the mystery of who is blackmailing who. True, it is certainly difficult to follow the plot at first, but the way Faulkner and company have written the script certainly makes up for this difficulty.Probably "The Big Sleep" may not be everybody's cup of tea, but personally I think that anyone interested in the history of cinema should give it a try. It showcases some of the best performances ever and shows Howard Hawks, that famous Jack of all trades, proving his talent and versatility in the Film Noir genre. A real classic. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the girls/women in Howard Hawk's 1946 Classic 'The Big Sleep' either want to sit in his lap, remove their reading spectacles for or flirt with Humph in one way or another. Even if they don't actually like him, you can almost smell their respect for him.As we all know, the Raymond Chandler story is both complex and intriguing, but that's only half of it. You can stick this movie on umpteen times (as I do) and there's always bits that seem new and fresh, as well as the those that linger long and deep, like a fabulous fragrance. The story, for me is almost second fiddle, though it could easily be first, if I chose it to be. The period detail, the sharp banter and the suspenseful music, the shady characters, the lurking night-time shadows...I could go on.Howard Hawks did make some great films and this must rate as one of his very best. It's become famous for helping to cement Lauren Bacall's life-long relationship with Humph, probably the most loved and respected (and no doubt, envied) courtship in Hollywood history. The black &amp; white photography is remarkably efficient and deceptively simple, yet has all the detail and complexities it needs. There's a real art in making a movie flow so easily and naturally.ALL those who even think of themselves as movie buffs, film-lovers or really anybody, who appreciates a fine film must see The Big Sleep at least once. It does come up on TCM occasionally and it's well worth the effort in tracking down the DVD. Comment Comment | Permalink</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The theatrical cut is a classic but the original pre-release cut on the flipside of the DVD is well worth watching. If you've ever wondered what on earth is going on in the plot this recently recovered version may help clarify things. As usual you don't get it on the region 2 (European) release so this is another region 1 (US/Canada) DVD worth importing if you live in the UK. I'm not reviewing the film itself as there are plenty of reviews of the film here, suffice to say it's great and well deserves its status as a true classic of the film noir genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm trying to piece together a story about noir, what it is, how it works and where it came from. It seems to me that noir -- what I call noir -- is bigger than what it is normally tagged as. Its deep, a new notion of how the world works and how we narrate it. I think like jazz, its peculiarly American in origin. The backbone of noir, I believe comes from a stew of experiments in the thirties with legs in the detective story and the movie-about-movies or "shows." It became more distinctly cinematic and tied to formal narrative devices with "Citizen Kane." That's my story and I intend sticking to it. After that, you can see how the young thing was shaped, not entirely with deliberation. I think this was a milestone of noir and much of it was by accident.The books are based on one simple notion, I believe, that Marlowe was the only soul we see that isn't trying to force the universe, trying to be someone. He just is. He just accepts the world and what it serves up, perhaps noticing that the world seems to be designing coincidental impediments. (These are created by us watching, but that's another story.)Plus, he is primarily motivated to "see" what things are all about. Halfway through this, he apparently solves the problem, but still has to keep looking, "detecting." Now for the accidental amplification of the genre. Books nearly always are reduced in translating to film. There's just more space for more events in books. But with this type of mystery, you just cannot take bits out. So Faulkner and partner kept it all in, all wedged together. Its too much and confuses the ordinary viewer, at least the kind who really wants to "understand." But the whole point of noir as it has grown up is that fate is capricious and that the world presents some "dark logic" that we can't quite reach. We can sort out the shreds that fall from the sky, but beyond is some machine that we can never see.So the fact that this movie makes less sense than we expect matters. I think it is an accident of talent, that it wasn't intended. But its effective as all getout to be encountered with confusion just as Marlowe is, though he gets to pull his ear. And we just get to pull our eyes.There's a strange overlay between the zen acceptance that Marlowe has for the inexplicable world, and the fact that overtly horny women flock to him. I think the attraction is less the usual wisdom and strength, but a similar sort of calmness that comes from simple recognition that the world isn't logical. Ted's evaluation: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling plot, black &amp; white, with plenty of sharp dialog and interesting characters... everything a great noir film needs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the first real noir films I've seen, and I must say, it was every bit as good as I had expected. I have been interested in the genre for a while, after seeing many attempts at noir, and quite a few neo-noir film that impressed and entertained me. Still, nothing beats, or even matches, the real thing. I had also been wanting to see a film with the famous Humphrey Bogart, so when I found this film at the local library and discovered that it perfectly fit the criteria, I naturally borrowed it immediately. I was surprised by how interesting and entertaining this film was, and the incredibly sharp(not to mention equally well-delivered) dialog impressed me greatly. You just don't get that with modern Hollywood cinema. The plot is exceptionally well-written, although quite complex, which will surely discourage some potential viewers. There are a lot of characters to keep track of, something that seems to just be a problem with some of these, as well as neo-noir films(particularly L.A. Confidential). The pace is kind of slow, but not overly so... not like many other films of this period. Also, it seemed more laid-back than slow, kind of like American Pie(but, of course, there's nothing else that this film has in common with that... at all). The acting is top-notch. Bogart and Bacall are wonderful, and they compliment each other perfectly. They have great on-screen chemistry. The rest of the cast all give convincing performances... I was impressed with Martha Vickers, who was only about 20 years old at the time, and this was apparently her first role that was bigger than a smaller supporting one. The characters are well-written and interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I believe that just about any fan of classical cinema will, too. I recommend this film to anyone who can watch a good movie, even if it is almost 60 years old. It's especially recommended to fans of noir, Humphrey Bogart and/or Lauren Bacall. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...except maybe a completely coherent plot. Raymond Chandler's books tend to have so much plot that Chandler himself wasn't always completely sure what was going on. There is a famous story about this movie in which co-writer Leigh Brackett called up Chandler late one night to ask him who killed the chauffeur. Even HE didn't know. So, apologies to everybody who gets a headache trying to follow the story, but hey don't sweat the small stuff.The Big Sleep has big pay-offs too. 1. Bogie and Bacall were never better, and their on-screen chemistry is the stuff of legend for good reason: their every scene together is like watching Ali take on Frazier. High powered Old Hollywood screen presence is a thing sorely lacking in what passes for drama in these days of 'reality' TV.2. Whole sections of Chandler's dialogue were lifted right off the page, and this is the movie's best feature. Chandler was a master of hard- boiled dialogue, but he also mixed a lot of really funny bits into the fireworks, as Marlowe verbally probes and challenges everyone he meets. The creators wisely did not set out to 'improve' on Chandler, they just adapted his work for the screen.3. The sort of viper pit atmosphere which modern Hollywood mostly fails to create in its thrillers is here in purest form thanks to smart choices of staging. The posh house in which Bogart/Marlowe meets his client is full of people, none of whom are completely suited to the place. The old general lives in his sauna-like greenhouse, and the girls seem So, right off, you get this eerie feeling of generalized wrongness on a soundstage filled with expensive-looking decor. As characters move to more comfortable surroundings (smoky gambling houses, and other dingy out of the way places of sin) the viewer gets to participate in the full film noir experience: seeing where casual crime encroaches on 'respectable' society as we follow around femmes fatales who are not to be trusted.Great fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bogie persona at it's fullest with a twist here and there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart, one of the biggest movie stars of the 20th century was the one and only choice to play Philip Marlowe. The great thing about him was that he didn't seem like your typical heroic figure and that puts him right at home in the seedy environment of film noir where everybody seems kind of crooked, even the police.Though he played kind of heroic figures there was always a sinister quality to him and this is played out beautifully in this movie where he seems to be most comfortable with the villains rather than the more straight-laced characters.The plot of The Big Sleep is so complicated that you are often thinking that you are being put on. Names and events are hurled at you every 2 seconds so if you only watch this movie once you will be totally lost. The most complicated character belongs to Lauren Bacall's Vivian. Marlowe is in the dark about her role up until the last 20 minutes or so and therefore it was really unbelievable that the role is played so well by Bacall (this was only her second movie).The whole movie is quite good but a little bit slow for my taste. If you have seen The Maltese Falcon it was definitely the better of the two. Still, there are those priceless moments when Marlowe goes into the Geiger bookstore and is met with the absolute hilarious line by the clerk: "What do they look like - grapefruits?" The director, Howard Hawks, was certainly an actor's director and he gave some of the best roles to among others, John Wayne, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper and of course Bogie himself. This was as far as I can remember the last time that Bogie and Hawks worked together and I think that anything that they would have done afterwards could not live up to this, so maybe it was a good choice. Hawks would die a very old man and by the the 60's his inspiration had virtually dried out (he made Rio Bravo 3 times).Had Bogart lived longer he would probably be in spoof after spoof of his undying persona and it's a bit of a disappointment that he was not very successful at playing a different character. The part of Captain Queeg in "The Caine Mutiny" is absolutely terrific and so different from Marlowe. Although, in my opinion he is the essence of 40's movies cynicism, he should have been much more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just average for a grafter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, the plot is incredibly convoluted, but so was the source material. In fact, they say that Hawks contacted Chandler directly to find out who killed Owen Taylor, the Sternwoods' chauffeur, and even Chandler couldn't figure it out. I am convinced that it was Joe Brody.I will not repeat what the other commentators have said, but I think that the best scene of all has been largely overlooked. Bogart grilling Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt) about his activities during the evening of Arthur Gwynn Geiger's murder. Brody squirming in his seat desperately trying to avoid eye contact with Marlowe as Marlowe follows him around the couch saying "Try looking at me, Joe."A couple of great lines were also omitted from the list of great lines at the beginning of the thread.Eddie Mars pulls a gun on Marlowe and says, "Do you mind?" Marlowe: "No, I'm used to it."Mars to Marlowe: "Open the door." Marlowe: "Open it yourself. I've already got a client."Brody to Marlowe: "I guess you think I'm dumb, huh?" Marlowe: "Just average for a grafter."Plus the traditional Hawks overlapping dialogue in which Agnes twice says, "He gives me a pain in my ---," and each time she is interrupted before she can finish the sentence.There are two ways to make more sense of the incomprehensible plot. One is to read the novel; the other is to see the far inferior remake. For example, both explain what happened to Sean Regan ("Rusty Regan" in the book) while this version does not.In the book, Carmen sneaks into Marlowe's apartment and is waiting in his bed in the raw when he returns. However, he resists her offer and throws her out causing her to become unhinged. Marlowe figures out that the same thing happened when Regan refused her advances and that she killed him because Carmen does not like being told "no". This is impossible to figure out from the 1945 version, probably because of the Code that was in effect at the time.I agree that Bogart's Marlowe and Spade are totally different characters. Sam Spade was a pure reflection of John Houston. Tough, hardboiled, sardonic, dismissive of women, totally in charge, and laden with a sense of vague morality at best.By contrast. Bogart's Marlowe is a far more realistic, less glamorized, version of the private eye: Ex-DA investigator; knowledgeable about things that only cops know; a lone wolf with his own code of morality; and the desire to do the right thing barely hidden under a veneer of cynicism and world weariness.Also, even though only 3 years elapsed between the making of the "Falcon" and "The Big Sleep," Bogie aged dramatically in those three years.This movie truly has it all: vintage 40's noir; the Bogart-Bacall mystique; superb supporting performers; an engrossing mystery populated with intriguing characters; and a marvelous capturing of the feel of old L.A.This one should be firmly ensconced in everyone's all time Top 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After looking at some of the preceding reviews, there is not much more left to be said about this stylish dark detective thriller of the 40's. Who can fault the director, stars, author, or screenplay? All were top drawer in their field. Granted, the story is confusing with so many characters and sub-plots that you need a diagram to follow who is doing what to whom. And certainly violent enough......did you notice that Marlowe shoots Canino not once, but three times....and how about when he pushes Eddie Mars out the door to be shot down by his own men. No talking or beating around the bush here! How much more can be said about Bogart and Bacall?....to this day, their presence still evokes passion in their fans, me included. But there are a some other players in this film worth mentioning. Bob Steele, as Canino, is so perfect for the role of Mars' henchman,..he is truly evil and Steele plays it to a T. It is also strange to see John Ridgley playing a bad guy; he was usually the bland sidekick and his role as Eddie Mars is against type. It works. Elisha Cook Jr. is spot on as the pathetic "little man" Jonesy. And Dorothy Malone comes across (in more ways than one it appears)in her small part as the book store clerk, glasses and all. My favorite line from the film comes from Martha Vickers when she first meets Marlowe and says, "You're not very tall are you?".......Marlowe's reply,"I try to be." If you like fast moving, hard bitten films with great black and white cinematography, this is the ticket. It's a delight!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The dialogue in this film is what was once referred to as "Sure Fire Dialogue" The cinematography was great. I like the scene when he was sitting in his 1937 Plymouth coupe after the rain. The interaction between characters is terrific. Can you imagine what a great piece of work would come of a collaboration between Chandler and Hammett in those days. I don't think they could remake this one today and I have the impact that it did back then, even with the liberality they take in the new films. No one cussed, took off their clothes and it still was a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best noirs tend to offer complex labyrinths in which we enjoy getting lost. They portray conspiratorial worlds in which invisible forces pull and push us around like puppets on a string. In this regard, what made "The Maltese Falcon", a 1941 noir directed by John Huston, influential was the way it communicated this conspiracy. In Huston's film, dialogue was fired rapidly, his sets were resolutely claustrophobic, his plot was impenetrable and his characters existed within a mass of hazy motivations, unspoken schemes and sinister intentions. The very cinematic language of the film was oppressive, every detail, word and object actively working against the viewer. It was all very murky.And of course it was up to our intrepid avatar, Humphrey Bogart, to cutlass his way through this conspiratorial web. Through him we hacked and we slashed, peeling back the layers, trying to get at some truth. Whether we got there or not was unimportant. Noir's joy is in being tangled within a spider web of fate.Released five years after "The Maltese Falcon", Howard Hawks' "The Big Sleep" is up to the same game. Hawks takes Huston's aesthetic, inserts a little sex appeal in the form of Lauren Bacall, amps up the sexual innuendos and expands his sets, but for the most part achieves exactly what "The Maltese Falcon" did, Hawks creating a moody, seamy and oppressively dark world of scheming players, pawns and puppet masters.Humphrey Bogart plays our hero, of course. His character was called Sam Spade in "The Maltese Falcon" and Philip Marlowe here, but for the most part he's the same guy in both, Bogart bringing the same mixture of cynicism, wit, intelligence, coolness, sexiness and toughness that makes most of his better films memorable.As for the plot, nobody knows what's going on and that's how it should be. A great film noir is an almost tactile thing. Like reading a good Chandler, Thompson or Connelly novel, noir immerses you in a world that is as thick as it is black. "Falcon" and "Sleep" may not have the technical wizardry or scope of later film noirs, but they have a purity and immediacy that most of those films lack; an abstract quality, the essence of noir distilled down to the bare essentials.It's therefore interesting to observe how noir has expanded as the decades have rolled by. In the 40s and 50s directors like Hawks and Huston gave us noirs confined to tiny rooms, their characters battling their way from one small sound-stage to the next. The genre then expanded with the political thrillers of the 70s and sci-fi movies of the 80s. Nowadays noirs have the expansiveness of "The X Files" or "The Wire", their characters at the mercy of a far wider-range of forces (politics, science, sex, religion, money, mysticism, Hollywood, genetics, technology, screenwriters, family, fate, bureaucracy etc).The best modern noirs take place in a forever un-mappable universe, their heroes increasingly lost, set adrift in a world of conspiratorial influences so vast that the human mind can do nothing but succumb. True noirs of today can be found in films as widely divergent as "Ran", "Inland Empire", "Mulholland Drive", "The Wire", "Code 46", "Boarding Gate", "Eyes Wide Shut" etc etc. Of course nobody thinks of these films as "film noirs". They much rather champion self consciously emulative fare like "Blood Simple", "Fargo", "Brick", "LA Confidential" or "Red Rock West". But those are all retrograde noirs, nostalgic, content to ape convention rather than explore the world as better directors do. They reduce noir to a aesthetic choice, a kind of chic, designer existentialism, rather than anything more socially, psychologically or philosophically meaningful.What all these later noirs lack, though, is Bogart. Actor Cary Grant, in a 1946 letter to a British publisher, said it best: "Bogart is so much better than any other tough-guy actor. As we say here, Bogart can be tough without a gun. Also he has a sense of humour that contains that grating undertone of contempt." What Grant forgets to mention is that Bogart also exuded a kind of cool sexuality. No surprise that he married Lauren Bacall, 25 years his junior.10/10 ? Along with "The Maltese Falcon", this is a genre defining classic which plays as well today as it did over a half century ago. Bogey, Bacall and Hawks teamed up in 1944 for another (arguably) masterpiece, "To Have And Have Not". Worth multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be honest and admit that I haven't actually read the Chandler novel this was based upon.Maybe I should have. It could have helped me work out the complicated, mussy plot of 'The Big Sleep' better.But WHO CARES about plot when you have a super-stylish noir boasting shady, fascinating characters, Bogart and Bacall, a brilliant screenplay and a whole lot of humour. I know I'm breaking my 'law' that a good plot is vital to a good film, but 'The Big Sleep' is an exception to the rule. It doesn't seem to need a strong storyline, and it's classic status has endured without one. Chandler couldn't even explain many of the events in his novel, so how could the film be expected to?It is Martha Vickers that almost steals this movie, though. As the nymphomaniac, perpetually drugged-up Carmen Sternwood, younger sister to Bacall's Vivien, she is simply fantastic. Apparently many of her scenes were cut (!) because she was stealing the film from right under leading lady Lauren Bacall's nose. Bogart is perfect as usual as our favourite detective Phillip Marlowe.Lucky Bogart. Every female wants to jump him in this film, and who could blame them? He oozes sex appeal and charisma. No wonder Bacall fell for him. He again shares terrific chemistry with his soon-to-be wife. The feeling of equality and mutual need is there. Marlowe is not the cynical Spade we saw Bogart play in 'The Maltese Falcon' 5 years earlier. Marlowe is no push-over, but he does play the 'sap' for women occasionally. He's a much more likable fellow than the hardened Spade.Style, style, style. This film has it in bucket loads, from the sexy play between the sexes to the dark, rainy streets. It is certainly one of the greats of the noir genre, and one of the most charismatic.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Noir Film with gritty interpretation , atmospheric settings and powerhouse filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absorbing and worthy suspense film about blackmails , killings , corruption and strong intrigue . Starred by Phillip Marlowe , a two-fisted and cynical private detective operating in Los Angeles . Phillip (Humphrey Bogart at his high point in his glorious career)'s fee was ?50 a day , plus expenses . Then , the toughest Shamus , Philip Marlowe , is hired by a rich family on a twisted case with unexpected consequences . As Marlowe asked by the elderly (and near death) wealthy General Sternwood to investigate an attempt at blackmail on one of his daughters . Before the complex case is over, he's seen murder, blackmail, and what might be love . He soon finds that the attempt is half hearted at best and the daughters seem to be more connected with the disappearance of strange characters . Marlowe becomes involved with the oldest daughter , a society dame called Vivian (Lauren Bacall) and her uncontrollable as well as addled sister Carmen (Mary Vickers) who seem unconcerned with disappearances , further complicating the mystery . Only General Sternwood seems concerned as mobsters and hired killers continue to appear in the path of the investigation .This first-rate and entertaining picture draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama , emotion and moody atmosphere . This classic mystery thriller follows Raymond Chandler's book fairly closely otherwise . Twisted film Noir about murders , troubled relationships , treason , dark secrets , including an unforgettable dialog ; being based on the novel ¨Big Sleep¨ and screen-written by the prestigious William Faulkner , Leigh Brackett , Jules Furthman and the same Raymond Chandler . Eager to repeat the success of To have and have not (1944), Warner Bros. studio chief Jack L. Warner gave Howard Hawks $50,000 to purchase the rights for "The Big Sleep" ; Hawks bought the rights for $5,000 and pocketed the rest. It has a convoluted and difficult intrigue though stars can quite compensate for some far-fetched moments . It packs a good realization , an original script , haunting atmosphere , intriguing events ; for that reason madness and murder prevail . Here Bogart is extraordinary and as cool as ever ; he plays as the tough-talking P.I. , his scenes with Lauren Bacall are awesome and at their best compared to those they shared in ¨Dark passage¨ , ¨Key Largo¨ and ¨To have and to have not¨ . The couple throws in enough sparks to ignite several lighters . This was the best pairing of cynical Humphrey Bogart and sultry Lauren Bacall , a fifth film was planned several years later, but Bogart died before it could be made . Due to Humphrey Bogart's affair with co-star Lauren Bacall, his marital problems escalated during filming, and his drinking often resulted in his being unable to work. Three months after the film was finished, Bacall and Bogart were married. Exciting as well as complex film , possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller , serenity , baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances , evocative cinematography in black and white by Sid Hickox and magnificent musical score by the classic Max Steiner . A pre-release adaptation run 116 minutes with 18 m. of scenes re-shot and reused in the official release . And also shown in horrible computer-colored version . This is first film version of Raymond Chandler's first novel "The Big Sleep". The second was The big sleep in 1978 by Michael Winner with Robert Mitchum , Oliver Reed , Edward Fox , Richard Todd , Richard Boone Sarah Miles and Candy Clark , this remake was released about 32 years after the original . The latter takes place in the then contemporary Britain of 1977, even though Hawks's Big sleep took place in Los Angeles in 1941 . The movie was part of a predominantly cycle of pictures adapted from novels by Raymond Chandler , especially his first four novels , such as Murder, My Sweet (1944) , The Brasher Doubloon (1947); and The Lady in the Lake (1947). It had a revival in the 1970s , the films included Marlowe, (1969), The big sleep (1978), A long goodbye (1973) and Farewell my lovely (1975) as well as Double Indemnity (1973) made for television Chandler was screenwriter on the original (1944) directed by Billy Wilder .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Sausage and 2 Fried Eggs, 35 cents.' (sign near public pay phone)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, a sign of the times. Only 35 cents for a breakfast, or 45 cents for a pork chop lunch. These were among those posted on the menus on the wall near the phone where Phil Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) made some of his calls. As most critics agree, the actual gambling, bootlegging, murder mystery portrayed in this movie is secondary, maybe even unimportant. As the detective, Bogart is always able to arrive at highly accurate conclusions from seemingly vague information. He gets beat up several times, only to doggedly pursue the bad guys in the next scene, all because he was falling in love. The real reason for 'The Big Sleep' is to feature Bogart and Bacall in some very witty dialog, near the beginning of their real-life romance which led to marriage. And, in the end, the private detective gets the 'angel.' One of my favorite lines, addressed to Bogart by two different characters, in different scenes, "You sure take chances, mister!", after a Bogart wisecrack. The dialog in this movie is simply remarkable, and I laughed enough times that I could almost call this a 'dark comedy' and keep a straight face.I saw it on DVD from my public library, in glorious black and white, of course. This is a prime example of a classic movie which could have benefited from color photography, to help distinguish the various locations and characters. This DVD release has both the recently-discovered 1945 'dircetors cut', 116 minutes and more linear story telling, plus the 1946 theatrical release, 114 minutes with the re-shot scenes to intensify the Bogart/Bacall interplay. I watched the 1945 version.</fullReview>

The other is Marlowe. That's who Bogey plays here.In 2014 Falcon has a higher IMDb score then Sleep. I am hoping that by the time this review is read in the 22nd century, that error will have been rectified.Why is this the better film? Two words...The first word is restraint. In this film Bogey gives one of the few measured performances of his life and that is an impressive sight. In Falcon his character was nuts and so was he. There was even a "Mutiny on the Bounty" end speech in it with wild eyes. All very gratuitous and over the top.The second word is BABY.In this film Bogey plays against Baby just before they hooked up in real life. You could feel it then, you can feel it now, and you will still be able to feel in the 22nd century.This is the better film. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Noire Style but Poor Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard Hawks's 'The Big Sleep' is a classic no-ire thriller that has a complex plot. Well, complex enough to end up nowhere. Yes, that's the problem with the film. The plot seems a little lost and the film itself is very slow-paced. Well, probably I'm being a little too harsh but there are just too many plot holes. The film itself is a 'tamer' version of the book as they do, to an extent, greatly differ from each other.Yet, it has its moments. The standout is the electrifying chemistry between the mysteriously sexy Bacall and the charismatic Bogart. We are introduced to a host of interesting but dangerous characters. The women are quite sexually charged while the gentlemen have guns. Dialogues are witty. The subtle comedy was finely put, especially in the scenes with Bacall and Bogart.If the script was a little better developed and the suspense made more effective by tighter editing, this film could have been very close to a masterpiece. In spite of it all, it does have the no-ire feel and Bogart's detective Reilly seems very much the prototype detective of the time. Worth a watch for classic cinema lovers, at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Big Sleep is one of the best known and distinctly archetypal examples of a style of movie-making we now call "film noir". It is also notoriously hard to follow, with a plot so and labyrinthine and subtly suggestive it leaves most viewers baffled. And yet it is immensely popular, was a commercial success in its day, and has long been praised as one of the all-time classics of the form. It must have some secret.The screenplay is adapted, very faithfully I must say, from the novel by Raymond Chandler. In a book, where it's possible to chew over a story point-by-point, such complexity is quite acceptable. But Chandler's story seems staggeringly unsuitable for the movies. For a start, the intrigue does not revolve around any tangible goal or object, like the titular bird in The Maltese Falcon, a similar but far simpler work. This means rather than watching out for who's hiding what, we have to pay attention to the relationships between the characters, none of whom has any obvious reasons for helping or hindering one another. The characters themselves are numerous, with more heavies, molls and dodgy businessmen than you can shake a pistol at. And while the dialogue is sparkling with quotable quips, whenever anyone gets onto the actual subject of the investigation, it suddenly turns into gobbledegook. Bogart's going over with Joe Brody over whoever may or may not have the photos of Carmen is a veritable tongue-twister. No wonder audiences then and now were confused.So what else does The Big Sleep have to its name? Well, most importantly it has its too leading stars, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Bogart and Bacall were built for noir styling. They both have a hard iciness to their personae, but with easygoing charisma and a knack for delivering smart dialogue with aplomb that makes them absolutely irresistible. And between them they have chemistry to boot. Even if you didn't know they were an offscreen couple, you would still think them destined for each other on screen. It was their first pairing a few years earlier that livened up the otherwise uninteresting To Have and Have Not, where they took a few classy lines of script and made the air crackle.Standing between this stellar pair and that convoluted plot is director Howard Hawks, and this is where things get really neat. Rather than try to elucidate the story, Hawks buries it even further. At any moment which deals with the finer details of the plot, Hawks dresses up the image with shadows, movement or really whatever clutter is available. In the opening scene at Sternwood's house, the gloomy, cavernous interiors show off the old-world austerity of the place. He then makes a bizarre jungle of Sternwood's greenhouse, with bits of plant invading the foreground like tentacles. All of this is part of the atmosphere, or more precisely the trappings of film noir, and Hawks lays it on thick to immerse us in the picture's world. However, Hawks was exceedingly good at bringing individuals out of the mosaic. In the first scene between Bogart and Bacall, all the other business fades away, the sets become light and bare, and suddenly we are just looking at two people. Compare this to the scene in which Bogart finds a drugged-up Martha Vickers at Geiger's house, where Hawks places her to blend in with the lavish decoration. She is effectively part of the scenery, not a focal point as Bacall is.The upshot of all this is, we don't end up feeling as if we've been told a story as such, but we do feel we've been given an experience. When Sternwood sets the scene to Bogart, we are unlikely to pick up all he says about Regan or Geiger, but we do remember the old man's mutterings about brandy and cigars. When Bacall comes to Bogart's office, we don't recall what she has to say, but their funny telephone conversation, where Bogart pretends Bacall is his mother and Bacall pretends Bogart is her father, sticks in our minds. By all means, try and fathom what's really going on ? it's a rather fun intellectual exercise for repeated viewings ? but the real point of The Big Sleep is to give us the very essence of hard-boiled fiction, of mean-faced hit men and double-crossing dames. It's nifty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is shot during World War 2, which is very evident by the gas rationing stickers on the cars. Besides Bogart &amp; McCall, the rest of the cast is pretty much studio contract players except Dorothy Malone. Still, they are plenty of support when you have Howard Hawks directing and a lot of action.Granted this film is complicated, without a doubt. Too many people look for films that are simple and straight forward. This film is neither, nor does it pretend to be. The book it is based upon is no simple read either. So if you get numb with more than 1 plot in a film, this film is not for you.If your a Bogart fan, or a Bacall fan, this is your film. Bogart is in fine form, almost at sex symbol status at the time this film is made. He carries pretty much the entire film, enduring beatings, getting into murders, &amp; pretty much trying to be a step ahead but sometimes finding himself a step behind. While the film is not perfect, it is pretty close for its genre. You have to enjoy this type film to like it. Taking Chandler's material &amp; having a writer the caliber of William Faulkner working on the script is not going to produce a simple film.This one is getting dated, &amp; while it doesn't quite make it where it is a perfect classic, it is a very good film. Casablanca accidentally worked out to be a better film, but that is only because that one was an assembly line production. This was was expected to be great before it was released. That might be why it does not live up to the expectations, but it is still a very good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the greatest film noir as some have felt, but still a very entertaining crime classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Big Sleep" is often acclaimed as the quintessential noir, either the film or the novel. I don't consider it as such, but its still an extremely entertaining experience. The main fault for both the film and the novel is the rather muddled plot. Its complex, but a bit too complex for its own good and requires great attention to minor details if you want any chance of keeping up with it. Apparently, Raymond Chandler didn't even know who killed one character and left that decision up to the screenwriters. Plus, due to the censorship of the era, the film has to simply hint at some of the more taboo subjects which were in the novel (such as homosexuality and pornography). This is definitely a case where the novel is better than the film.Still, this is one of the most effortlessly entertaining film noirs ever made. The pulp poetry of Raymond Chandler is very well adapted - the dialog in both the film and the novel really set the standard for hard boiled talk in the years to come. The dialog is brimming with sarcasm and is frequently hilarious and eloquent. The direction by Howard Hawks is very skilled, but thats to be expected from him. He keeps the film moving at a lightning quick pace and the brief bursts of brutal violence (not to mention subtle sexuality) are quite stunning for their time. The acting is great as well, but when you have both Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in the cast, thats entirely unsurprising. Both performers were watchable in any film and they're at their best here. "The Big Sleep" is one of Hollywood's most enjoyable classics. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To begin with, you have not seen this film until you have seen a mint print on a theater screen. The lighting effects here are astonishing, and when film fans decry 'colorization' and insist that a B&amp;W film be seen in B&amp;W, this is one of the films their talking about.the film is shot so that the center of the image is predominately light gray in tone, but harsh black shadows suddenly cut through the center and create multiple spaces, leaving a sense of three-dimensionality that is made uneasy by the sudden disruptions in light values.No 'noir' film ever quite caught the atmospherics that supposedly make the whole genre memorable as well as this one. Hawks knows the story is way overcomplicated - at one point in the writing of the script, Brackett and Faulkner realized they couldn't tell who killed the guy who was found in the car in the bay; they telephoned novelist Chandler, who, after a long pause for thought, admitted that he didn't know either! (The novel's worth - as with most of Chandler's best - derives from his ability to write paragraphs like poetry.) But Hawks was a director in love with challenges like this one; so he turned the whole film into an exercise in mood and character. Could the mood make the characters come alive? Could the actors take this opportunity to drive the plot despite the lapses and complications? Obviously, my answer is a strong "yes!" As a viewer, I become immersed in this other world that is so predominately night, and in learning all I can about these characters. And when the movie ends, I feel I have experienced something different yet wholly satisfying.Surely this is one of the greatest attractions and accomplishments of any film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***MAJOR SPOILERS***Being hired by Gen. Sternwood to clear up some problems that his younger daughter Carman got herself into private investigator Philip Marlow feels that it will be just routine for him and nothing more. Carman has gotten herself into debt at what later turned out to be Eddie Mars gambling den and was being blackmailed by one of Mars tenant, in a house that he rented him, rare book-shop owner Arthur Geiger.Marlow checking out Geiger's place is shocked to hear this woman screaming and when he breaks in he finds Geiger shot dead and Carman in a state hysteria unable to talk as Geiger's killer, or killers, take off in two different automobiles. Finding Geiger's little black book with names of those whom, like Carman and her father Gen. Sternwood, he's blackmailing Marlow deduces that he may well have been murdered by one of the persons in that book. Marlow also notices that there's a hidden camera with the film missing and with Carmen scantily dressed it didn't take long for Marlow to realize that she was, with almost no clothes on, the one who was photographed.It's then that Marlow takes Carman back home and tells her older sister the former Mrs. Vivian Rutledge Sternwood to tell the police if they show up that she was at home the entire evening. This is Marlows way of keeping Carman from being suspected in Geigers murder. It's later when the Sternwood chauffeur Owen Taylor, whom Marlow finds out murdered Geiger,is found dead with a broken neck at the bottom of Lido Pier that things start to go a bit too fast in the movie and makes it almost impossible to figure just what Carmans real problems are. It turns out that Carmans troubles have really nothing to do with either being blackmailed for not paying off her gambling debts or being photographed in the nude; they have a lot to do with something far more serious murder.Dspite all the killings in the film, I counted seven of them,the one most on Gen. Sternwood's mind was that of his former employee Sean Regan. It's not until much later in the film that you begin to realize that it was Regan whom Gen. Sternwood was really interested in finding and using his young and somewhat unstable daughter Carman as a cover in having Marlow find him, dead or alive. Regan had become somewhat of a son to the old man and his sudden disappearance had deeply affected him. Gen. Sternwood was positive that Regan didn't just leave on his own but that something terrible happened to him and he also suspected Carman to have been the person who was responsible for it.Meanwhile Marlow is totally clueless to what's really on Gen. Sternwood's mind which the general did everything to throw Marlow off in having him find Regan by making it look like he was trying to uncover who was blackmailing him over his daughter Carman. During the film Marlow gets involved in a number of murders as well as having himself badly worked over by Mars hoods as well as falling in love with Gen. Sternwood's older daughter Vivian. Vivian herself knows that her younger sister was somehow involved in Regan's disappearance and you start to wonder if her relationship with Marlow was really on the up and up or she was only using him to get the cops from suspecting Carman in Regan's disappearance or even murder!The movie or Philip Marlow has non other then Eddie Mars get set up for Regan's murder in his already having been responsible for at least two others that of Owen Taylor and little Harry Jones as well as trying to have his hoods knock off Philip Marlow himself. Marlow with Vivian, who for a time was working with Mars, have Mars show up at the late Arthur Geigers place and trick him into having his boys outside think that Marlow was the first one to first step out the door. Firing at Mars and wounding him Marlow has him run for his life outside where his hoods, mistaking him for Marlow, blast him to pieces with the police who were alerted by Marlow, by phone from inside the house, coming on the scene to arrest them.With the dead Mars now being framed in Regan's, his body had since been found, murder Marlow with both Vivian's and Gen. Sternwood's help have Carman sent away to a mental institution where she can get help and at the same time not end up behind bars for Sean Regan's murder. The truth is that Carman not Eddie Mars was responsible for Regan's murder when he left her for Eddie's wife Mora which drove the very mentally and emotionally unstable Carman to go off the deep end and murder him.P.S The remake of "The Big Sleep" in 1978 with Robert Mitchum playing Philip Marlow had a lot more cohesive plot and didn't confuse those watching the movie like the 1946 version did. Even though the 1978 version covered the same ground as the original it stuck to the story and didn't hit you with side-plot after side-plot that by the time the movie was finally over you had no idea what you were watching for the last two or so hours on the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Big Sleep offers a plot line that's impossible to follow in some instances. That doesn't matter because the ragged plot still keeps you interested because it moves along so swiftly. The story is: Wealthy old Guy Sternwood is too debilitated to monitor his two wild daughters' vices, so hires a Private Investigator Phillip Marlowe, played by Bogart, to get rid of a blackmailer named Geiger. Geiger presents promissory notes signed by younger daughter Carmen for "gambling debts." Marlowe learns that Geiger is an ACDC sexual athlete who earns his living renting out porn books, as well as making his own dirty photos at home. Geiger photographs bored &amp; degenerate rich kids as porn models (e.g., Carmen Sternwood) and then charges them big bucks for the honor of appearing in his books. Geiger's blackmail tool is the notes Carmen signed for being made into a porn queen, not for gambling losses. Before Marlowe can confront Geiger, Geiger's murdered by Sternwood family chauffeur Owen Taylor, lover of Carmen. Taylor runs for it. Marlowe is almost an eye-witness to Geiger murder, but Carmen is in murder-room also, drunk &amp; drugged so Marlowe spirits her home for her protection. Investigating Geiger's lending-library next day, Marlowe finds two employees cleaning out the books under direction of petty mug Joe Brody. Taylor's found murdered inside Sternwood limousine. Brody has photo stolen from Taylor who stole it from Geiger's house showing Carmen in murder-room &amp; tries to blackmail Carmen's sister Vivien with it. Marlowe confronts Brody &amp; Vivien, confiscating photo from Brody. While at Brody house, Marlowe &amp; Vivien see Brody shot to death by Lundgren, Geiger's former employee /gay lover. Marlowe captures Lundgren, turning him in to cops after beating clues out of him. We learn Vivien has gambling problems and owes money &amp; favors to Eddie Mars, big-time hood &amp; entrepreneur. Mars gets rough with Marlowe but later plays nice, all for unknown reasons. Vivien tries to "sugar Marlowe off" with big payment. Marlowe keeps his hand in the mess and gets beaten by two Mars goons. Enter little Harry Jones, small-time outlaw. Jones promises Marlowe can get critical data on Geiger, Mars, Sternwood, etc from his girl- friend for $200. Girlfriend actually former Geiger librarian, former Brody gun-moll Agnes Lozier. Before Jones can deliver goods on the caper, he's murdered by super-thug Lash Canino. Again, Marlowe is almost eyewitness to murder. Agnes sells her info to Marlowe but doesn't grieve over Jones' death...Marlowe learns Mars' wife Mona hiding in farmhouse out of L.A. for unclear reasons. Marlowe cases farmhouse and sticks head in noose provided by Mars thug Canino. Vivien at farmhouse with Mona, but reasons unclear. Vivien helps Marlowe escape and kill Canino. Marlowe drives Vivien to Geiger's house to confront vengeful Mars but tricks Mars into arriving late. Mars' own men murder him by accident, Marlowe summons police. End.What a convoluted story to pack into 117 minutes! The film is helped to 5-star status by screen-idol good-hearted tough-guy Humphrey Bogart playing Marlowe and cool subtle sexy Lauren Bacall doing Vivien's part. There's not an actor miscast in any supporting role. If atmosphere can also be considered a supporting role, this movie has it. Even So Cal daytime scenes are filmed in a noir manner. People smoked furiously in movies then, and lingering tobacco smoke helps give The Big Sleep even more atmosphere, as does well-placed rainstorms and overgrown foliage. Sternwood butler Norris is an ominous presence in that he knows all about the family closeted skeletons. Norris will never spill the beans but his demeanor throughout suggests deeper darker secrets exist within the mansion than even this plot will expose.Even with so many dark and pointless lives revealed to us, this movie is funny and even lighthearted. Comic relief here covers over a bit Marlowe's innate dislike of the filthy rich, sexual vice, addictions, official corruption, bad business ethics, popular culture, psychiatry, quack religions, poor parenting, and the criminal classes. Raymond Chandler was an old-fashioned moralist who wrote message-stories using a popular genre of the day: tough-guy detective novels. His books written a good 60 years ago are all amazing indictments of what's corrupt and nasty in 2006 - gangsters with control-lines into City Hall, teenagers who carry contraceptives in their purses, film-culture that makes society more and more preoccupied with sexual sin, and honest cops getting beaten down by bigger and smarter waves of sleazy government, adults who'll do anything for a dollar when the quick dollar is best made by corrupting the youth of western society.</fullReview>

The dialogue is beyond sophisticated and if you follow it you'll find yourself laughing out loud because of its brilliance.When Bogart meets his client who can no longer drink or smoke because of health the client says "I like seeing people drink... its a sad state of affairs when one must indulge their vices through proxy." There are dozens of great lines like that in this film.Also, Bogart is very powerful and cool throughout the whole film just like he was in the Maltese Falcon. I prefer this Bogart to the more flawed and trampled upon one seen in Treasure of Sierra Madre. In roles like this, there is none better than Bogie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With movies like "The Big Sleep" and "The Maltese Falcon", among others, private detective = Humphrey Bogart. No question. "The Big Sleep" has a complicated plot and it requires some effort to follow what you can of it - that's a good thing, because I like to engage my bran in a movie. However that aside, there's a lot here anyway to like.Bogart plays Marlowe, but he also plays Bogart. He brings himself to the role - the dry drawl, the sharp on-screen presence, the sheer assuredness of character. He plays well against Lauren Bacall, one of two daughters of the man - Stockwood - who hired him to find a missing friend. As the mysteries and confusion deepen, Bogart and Bacall constantly find their paths interweaving. They have great simmering chemistry on screen and display anger and passion towards one another - an interesting combination. Neither roles can be faulted much.The film moves along sharply - you're never left bored - thanks to Director Howard Hawks. He has the "film noir" feel done well, and there's a nice broody atmosphere to the picture, accompanied by a great score."The Big Sleep" is a movie well worth checking out. You may be confused by some plot turns, but that's a side issue when the production you're left with plays out so well. A fine 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regarding the confusing nature of The Big Sleep-it helps to have read the book and to realize that the Production Code made some of the plot details difficult to dramatize. In the book, Marlowe finds Carmen at Geiger's house with Geiger dead on the floor and Carmen sitting in a chair stark naked. She's been posing for porn photos-the photos that in the movie are sent to Vivian by Brody to blackmail her. It is amusing to imagine such a fuss, drawn guns and all, over photos of a fully clothed Carmen, but that's what the production code did to these scenes. In the later scene where Carmen sneaks into Marlowe's apartment, she is again supposed to be naked-but not in the movie. The annoying gunsel, Carol Lundgren,in the book, constantly uses a familiar profanity,leading Marlowe to observe that he doesn't have much of a vocabulary. Carmen, in the book, tries to shoot Marlowe, but (spoiler warning!) wets her pants! The book doesn't really help to understand who killed Owen, the chauffeur. If Brody did it, how did he get back to Geiger's place in time to remove the body?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite possibly the most complicated detective film ever made, "The Big Sleep" is can be definitely called a classic. This film proves that a movie does not need an understandable plot to be good. All those viewers who berate films because of the plot (lacking or complicated)should realize that just because a certain film does not fit into a mold like so many other films does not mean it's terrible. All it means is that movies can be good no matter how different. "The Big Sleep", a great film from great director Howard Hawks is complicated but good enough to be entertaining without understanding the plot. Considering how big Bogart was during the time this was made in Hollywood, we should all try and suspend our disbelief about all the women falling for him instantaneously. All in all a great fun movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the novel ever was...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the above title should indicate, I do not overly care much for Raymond Chandler. "The Big Sleep" is the only novel of his that I have been able to make it through and even that was an uphill struggle against crippling boredom. The effect was not unlike what I would imagine being pumped full of tranquilizers and being made to run the New York Marathon would be like. A big sleep, indeed...Thankfully, because Howard Hawks did take the time to listen to his audience before releasing the version known best to later generations, he managed to hammer the movie version into something that never gets dull, not for a minute. Granted, you're not sure who's who, what just happened, or when the next dead body is going to hit the ground (this particular mystery has the highest body count of any I've seen in recent memory outside of "L.A. Confidential"), but the razor-sharp dialogue keeps things entertaining throughout.Bogie could call himself Phil Marlowe, Sam Spade, Rick Blaine, or Howdy Doody for that matter, but Chandler, when asked about his performance in "The Big Sleep", probably said it best, "Bogart is always superb playing Bogart." Here, he plays that role probably the best that I have ever seen him do it. He takes more of a beating this time out than usual, worked over a couple of times and none too gently, either. The sense one gets is that he's a man trying to get a handle on a situation that keeps threatening to spin out of control. The miracle is that Bogie is able to keep track of the plotline better than the audience (including myself).Of course, I would be remiss if I did not mention a certain lady by the professional name of Lauren Bacall. She provides the film with it's other stable axis. She comes off as mysterious, tough, over her head in trouble, and head over heels in love. The moment where she and Bogie clicked into place for me was the phone "conversation" with the police line they dialed up. I get the impression that she didn't want Bogie to probe any deeper because she knew that he'd land in the spot she was in. Of course, getting info from her is like trying to pry open Fort Knox with a crowbar. She keeps her cards as close to her chest, if not closer, than Bogie. You never know where she's going to pop up next, but you know it's going to be interesting.Now, to answer the all-important question of who killed Regan,...watch the movie again. Failing that, read the novel (if you can). The answer to that burning question IS there, but, like everything else in this film, it's tossed out so fast that if you blink, you miss it. Failing that, just enjoy it, I say. Bogie and Bacall pairings don't get any better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every scene in this Howard Hawks mystery/detective piece is a masterpiece, nearly a clinic on how acting, writing and directing should be done. The story is replete with enough plot twists to keep ardent mystery fans entertained through the final scenes. The dialogue, especially of the theatrical release, is as sharp as anything Hollywood has ever produced. The characters are largely memorable, even smaller parts like the General's butler, gambler Eddie Mars, and Elisha Cook Jr. as small time hood Harry Jones. Bogie and Bacall individually light up the screen and together set it on extra crispy.I don't know if the regular theatrical release has been restored but try to see that version. The scenes changed or added from the pre-release version really let Bacall shine and they do make for a better, if glossier movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film I can watch again and again. I never get bored with it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say I like the Big Sleep is an understatement. I love it! Raymond Chandler's first novel, The Big Sleep, was a reworking of three of his short stories. The Killer in the Rain, The Curtain, and Fingerman. Howard Hawks saw the chemistry between Bogart and Bacall after the success of "To have and have not". So he teamed them up again quickly. The Big Sleep was actually started towards the end of 1944. It was finished in early 45. And it contained 20 minutes of film never seen by the public. He saw it was a good movie but something was missing. It didn't quite have the chemistry the earlier film had had. So it was shelved for just over a year. In the meantime Bogart and Bacall had become married. Lauren Bacall also had another movie that was released. It was a flop and Hawks was worried. He decided to go back and reshoot a few scenes. He was very happy with the result. And it became the classic we all love today. The original 1945 Directors Cut of The Big Sleep is out on video now. I saw it a year ago and I understand why it was never released. The new scenes showed how Bogart and Bacall had really fallen in love and really spiced up the movie. It really is a classic and a film never to be missed. I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

Naturally, Bogart runs into Lauren Bacall (probably in one of her better roles) and the two of them create this incredible love-hate-arrogance chemistry keeping you absolutely riveting.

		<fullReview>No, it couldn't. "The Big Sleep" is based on a novel by the greatest writer of the century, the lead role was given to the greatest and coolest actor of all-time and the director was one of the creators of noir films (remember "Scarface", 1932), together with John Huston and his "The Maltese Falcon". It really can't get any better.This film is ciriticised because its plot is confusing, you never know what's really happening and the ending is not really an ending. Well, I guess this is the greatest about "The Big Sleep". You don't need to know who's the criminal to find it attractive, because the development is so magnetic that you can't keep your eyes off the screen. And after all, it's a film about the "big sleep", or, in other words, the death itself, and the movie gets along with this mission.The dialogs are one of the highlights of it. But then again, they were written by Raymond Chandler, and anyone who has ever read one of his few books know that the dialogues will be intense, sarcastic and memorable.Just a hint for the starters: if you catch the computer colored version, don't watch it, leave it for another time. They made it worse than on "Casablanca"</fullReview>

Gangsters, sluts, weasels, and a gritty (anti) hero are all visually and orally brought to magnificence by Hawks and a cast shooting from the top of the hill.Often tagged as the unfathomable masterpiece, The Big Sleep has this power that draws you into the picture to feel completely part of it, each punch and shot seems to be a part of your life. It's an incredible experience for film lovers of all ages. Humphrey Bogart is Philip Marlowe, a private investigator called in to solve a blackmail case, and that's all you need to know because you just need to observe as Marlowe lurches from scene to scene, deeper and deeper into a convoluted mire that triumphs as each scene unfolds.One of the greatest detective films ever made, directed by a genius, starring another, and as dialogue goes it has few peers. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a well done Hollywoodization of a classic crime novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story itself is a mystery, that becomes more of a mystery (and perhaps more frustrating) the more you think about it. Compared to this, The Maltese Falcon's story is for kids (by Dashiell Hammet, another of the prime pulp/detective novelists along with Raymond Chandler). Bogart trades his Sam Spade for Philip Marlowe, an exchange that changes only certain patterns of witty dialog, but not by much. Marlowe is investigating a blackmail on a General, who has two gorgeous, tricky daughters, one of them Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers, not given enough credit along with her headlining co-stars), the other Vivian Sternwood (Lauren Bacall, right in her prime). As he digs deeper into a story of murder, corruption, and romance, things may seem out of place, almost confounding, but that is Chandler for you.I have not read all of the Big Sleep, but as a Chandler admirer I always find his use of first person narrative, trademark classical cynicism, and the kind of early day brutal, almost satirical jabs at society (highs and lows) very entertaining, and of the highest caliber of writing. For the screenplay three heavyweights- Leigh Brackett (also responsible for Altman's The Long Goodbye), William Faulkner (one of the key doomed writers of the 20th century), and Jules Furthman- pump together a script that somehow keeps this kind of twisting, keen sense of narrative and humor while still making it commercial. In some ways its as much a romantic tug &amp; pull story, with witty, strong banter going between Bogie and Bacall, as it is one of the key film noirs.But is it as gritty a film noir as some of the less expensive ones like Detour or Gun Crazy? Does that even matter? Does Chandler's sense of the darkness of the world get lost in some of the more typical classic Hollywood aspects of the film? It might for some, especially if you're a purist for the book. Director Howard Hawks, I think, brings a balance to the styles, giving his 'there's danger when there's action' statement some good grounding here. It's almost too good a kind of direction for a film like this- everything is polished and down to the line, and even in the other director's cut from 1945 this is still prevalent. But he never lets loose his actors too far or constricts them from their alluring, striking personalities. On the contrary, this really makes use of its star players so well that at times, even when you're not sure what's going on the script carries it so completely that you just love hearing Bogie and Bacall talk. There's even a sense of whimsy in many of the better scenes. If by the end you can't understand what has happened totally, you may have missed the point- it's about the twists, the style, the kind of popular edginess of the day. It's not with the clarity or humor or experimentation of a classic like the Maltese Falcon, but in its own league the Big Sleep earns its status over time as a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Production of a Mystery-Noir Classic Storyline; Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must report that as good as this this classic film noir entry written by Leigh Brackett and others is as screen writing, it is still a bit overrated. Humphrey Bogart tries hard in the role of Philip Marlower, though he is not ideal for the part; and others such as John Ridgeley, Frank Puglia, very young Lauren Bacall and Dorothy Malone do very well indeed. Other parts are less-well realized. But what the viewer sees here is a convoluted storyline that is made to work technically and artistically by Howard Hawks, the skilled director, and by a more-than-attractive production made in glowing B/W, featuring a large number of well-mounted scenes. The original novel by Raymond Chandler was a pasting together of plot elements drawn from very fine earlier short stories; it is to be regretted that he did not later rewrite this early attempt which is quite unsatisfying compared to his later works. But the promising storyline was taken up by the screenwriters and made into a very memorable set of ethically contexted characters, the actions they feel compelled to take and their reactions to the consequences of those actions. The film has a lot of very famous tough and terse dialogue of course; but the dialogue is always used to move the slender plot-mystery along. The art direction and cinematography are unusually good in most places; many minor parts are played very well, by Elisha Cook Jr., Trevor Bardette, Charles D. Brown and others. Blocking of difficult-to-stage scenes is very good, such as a large nightclub-gambling joint, the action climax at a country house and the opening in General Sternwood's nicely-considered home where p.i. Marlowe first meets his potential client (Charles Waldon)and his two unruly daughters (particularly Bacall). One of the best elements of this bright film is the way pairs of persons play with one another and off a third person; perhaps no one can follow the storyline exactly, but there is hardly a dull second in this importantly-well-made adventure noir entry. No wonder this is the most copied of all early noir films, and one that in its own metier has never been equaled. We never miss a chance to enjoy this ground-breaking achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes more sense if book is read</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One great mystery (book and movie). Not really film noir in the sense that Double Indemnity, Postman Always Rings Twice, or Out of the Past are - Marlowe is a "good guy". Clever writing at the beginning distinguishes the "movie" Marlowe (not very tall, are you) from Chandler's Marlowe (tall, aren't you) without distracting from the story. I prefer the original film with Pat Clark as Eddie's wife - she is a BABE-ORAMA as Chandler created her. As others have pointed out, the film is full of beauties. And because there was such a shortage of males at home during WW2 (either too young or too old according to a pop tune) even a guy like Bogart had to fight'em off (or not). The book also makes it clear that Carol and Geiger, in addition to blackmail, dealing in drugs,dirty books and pictures, are homosexual lovers (subtly hinted at in the movie description of Geiger) - hence Carol's murderous rage when Geiger is killed. Eddie's demise at the end of the film departs from Chandler but is probably a better movie finish. One of Howard Hawks' best.</fullReview>

Following the plot is impossible, no character development, bogart walks around like he's jesus he's so perfect (okay I know it's that type of movie, but it gets old when the story's so confusing), and the characters are talking ad nauseum in unnatural dialogue and tones, just so unrealistic (I know again, it's an old movie and I'd overlook this if the story was compelling) mumbling about some mysterious plot details nobody understands, blah blah blah.

		<fullReview>Raymond Chandler is perhaps as well known as his famous Private Eye in his many books. Further, there are many Hollywood greats who have played his leading detective, from Dick Powell to James Garner. In this early Black and White the studio script written by equally famous William Faulkner, we have our hero Phillip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) contracted by rich, retired but concerned General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) to find his daughter Carmen's (Martha Vickers) missing boyfriend. His other daughter Vivian Sternwood (Lauren Bacall) seeks to hamper Marlowe's investigation as she believes it will reveals many other dark family secrets. No sooner does he begin his search for the missing chafferer, when all sorts of mysterious gunmen, blackmailers and a police inspector (Regis Toomey) want to know what he is up to. What begins as a missing person's case, soon leads to extortion, Blackmail and eventually multiple murder. Chandler originally wrote this story with a slight twist in it, yet as one watches the movie, it becomes so confusing, even the author forgets who killed whom. Were it not for excellent character actors like Elisha Cook Jr, Bob Steele and John Ridgely as Eddie Mars, the mystery would go flying off leaving the audience stranded. The trick is to pay close attention and enjoy the magic of Bogie and Becall and interestingly enough you'll find that this film became a Classic because of them. Great detective movie with lots of excitement and drama. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart and Bacall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard Hawks brilliantly captured the atmosphere of Raymond Chandler's novel "The Big Sleep" in this 1946 classic that has proved to be a favorite among its fans. The film is enhanced by the adaptation of William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman. The movie has an excellent look and the music score by Max Steiner enhances what we witness on the screen.The new director's cut shows a much tighter film, although both the studio release and Mr. Hawks' version are equally excellent. The film capitalizes in the interplay between Marlowe and Vivian. As portrayed by Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, this seems to be the main reason for watching the film. However, there are small details that render the film the brilliant piece it is.The dialog is intelligent and keeps us interested in what's going on. As Bob the Moo suggested in his commentary, it helps to keep pen and paper handy because the many sub plots will get anyone confused if no attention is paid to the proceedings we are witnessing. Also, this film seems to have gotten away with murder, no pun intended, by having been given an OK by the Hays group, because the way some things are said that convey another meaning. There is a homosexual undercurrent because of the figure of Geiger, who is obviously gay, but without mentioning the fact, or drawing undue attention to what's going on.The best thing in the film is Humphrey Bogart. He is a cool Marlowe who can unravel the mystery he is investigating. The gorgeous Lauren Bacall is just as good in her cool approach to Vivian. Not only is Ms. Bacall talented, but she casts a large presence on the movie.Howard Hawks' direction got excellent performances from the cast. Dorothy Malone's book store manager, emits so much heat, she smolders the screen! The nymphet Carmen Sternwood, hitting on Marlowe at one point, and high on drugs next, is interpreted by the sexy Martha Vickers showing she had promise. Charles Waldron, Elisha Cook Jr, Charles Brown add another layer to the film's texture.The film in any of the two versions prove to be a perennial favorite of fans of this genre thanks to Mr. Hawks' understanding of the material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart was a tremendous actor who made so much out of so little. Who would have thought that a short, slight man with a lisp and the name `Humphrey' could become such a sex symbol? The Big Sleep sees him playing a private eye, a role revisited from five years earlier in The Maltese Falcon (Different dicks though ? there he's Sam Spade, here he's Philip Marlowe). Falcon is a fantastic film with a celebration of noir. The Big Sleep is perhaps overshot (huge shadows fall over supporting players as the principles are backlit to extreme) and deals more with domesticity. Flowery wallpaper, ornate vases and delicate curtains adorn this lighter work.Falcon also saw a greater variety of characters, including Peter Lorre as the camp Joel Cairo, twiddling away with his umbrella. The Big Sleep is largely composed of women, all of whom seem to find Bogart irresistible. Even the taxi driver is a beautiful brunette. As a result, it's someway the weaker of the two films, it's enforced melodrama and overdone incidental music dating it considerably. Perhaps the biggest weakness is the interplay between Bogart and Bacall. His real-life wife, any build-up of sexual tension between the two would have dissipated, thereby killing any on-screen chemistry. Many cite their relationship as one of the film's major strengths, but to my eyes, even the raciest of dialogue exchanges (such as the part where Bacall describes being ridden like a horse) lack that vital spark.What makes it though is the classy lines, if not the complex plot. There's Charles Waldron as Bacall's father, who encourages Bogart to smoke and laments having to indulge his vices `by proxy'. Or Humphrey snapping to Bacall: `Take it easy. I don't slap so good around this time of the evening'. Maybe it's just the way he tells ?em. The film takes us back to a time when murder was committed bloodlessly, and for the most romantic of reasons. Cars were big, hats were bigger. The Big Sleep is a film everyone should see at least twice. The Maltese Falcon is a film everyone should own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huhn?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Big Sleep begins with a series of memorable, entertaining scenes. Even Bogart is a hoot donning a disguise and an altered voice at one point. Then scenes of equal weight and equal length begin piling up and it readily becomes apparent that the best stuff was in the first half hour when things still had potential. The 6th time Bogart drives to Geigers cottage you may be crying, "Enough!" but this plot just keeps going and going...I had been warned that this one was quite elaborate and it is. Something like seven people are dead and I still can't tell you why. The only noir where I lost interest in the plot quicker, was Murder My Sweet which was just as elaborately silly. Can't each cadaver have a walk-on before they're killed. (Owen Taylor and Sean Regan) I tend to confuse stiffs I've never seen. If it must be this complicated, couldn't the writers make the narrative/crime so compelling that a viewer is drawn in? How can a viewer care about a solution when they haven't seen (and haven't been made to care about) a crime that occurred before the movie even started?I accidentally viewed the wrong side of my double sided DVD and preferred the 1944 version to the one that audiences loved in 1946. I see very negligible differences in the two versions that saved it from Bacall's supposedly poor performance. Seems like the sexually-charged racehorse dialog needed inclusion because without it, the most emotionally involved Bogart gets with anyone is with the rare books girl. Without it, Bacall just simmers for the whole movie.The thing I find strange about noir is that even the most pricey production feels like it was shot on the cheap. Here, two or three major characters never appear, but are talked about and credited with driving the whole plot. Central characters are never visualized; to save money... or to allow the plot to be more complicated? Also cheap, but effective is that night looks a bit more like night in Bogart's movies because they skip the expensive exterior day-for-night shoots, which I never find convincing and always find distracting. (Why are people gleaming in the dark?)LA Confidetnial and Chinatown both make overtures to this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE BIG SLEEP of the compound explicitness in the air, extremely smart and funny dialogue, great acting and amazing atmosphere. The story is, from the perspective of an ordinary spectator, confused and confusing. A brilliant private detective mystery keeps all for himself. Taking into view if the large number of characters and murder, I have to admit that the story at times confusing. I have a feeling that the writers did not know exactly what they want or what truly can. In the end, it all became clear, though, and the end of the film is a kind of dilemma.Given the novel indication of pornography and homosexuality are cleverly disguised, although I would not be surprised if the director Hawks was a little more explicit, or rather direct. I am very pleased with the fact that the film does not have some kind of moral note. It would just ruin everything. Tensions in abundance. All characters are armed. In addition to the old father is not a single character does not look helpless. Each character tends to his goal in the universal mysteries and permanent plots.Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe is the element that makes this movie a lot better. His performance is amazing. The detective is determined, cold and dominant character in every sense.Lauren Bacall as Vivian Sternwood Rutledge is a bit sluggish for femme fatale. Bacall simply captivates with its appearance and voice. In addition to Bogart must play better. In one of my perception she is not the dominant female figure. Chemistry is unquestionable but ....If you ignore the confusing story, this is a great film the false glamour that touches dangerous underworld where government dependency, voyeurism and sexual immorality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will preface this review by saying that about half way through I began to lose track of what was happening in the plot, and it only got more complex and confusing as the film went on. But the truth is, I didn't care. The best part of this film is that you don't need to know exactly why everything is happening to be completely invested in the characters and the film. It's score and camera work, while pretty stereotypical for a film noir, still shows us when the characters are in danger and when something important is happening. Just because you can't keep track of everything happening in the film doesn't mean the filmmakers can't keep you tense with the tough and fast paced entertaining dialogue in the various situations situations the characters get into, and that's also a testament to how good the dialogue in this film is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bogie/Bacal Diamond, Even More Dazzling in BluRay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I write this only a few months after WBA released this film in a BluRay upgrade. It is essential noir in any format, the BluRay brings out more detail and sharpness, more vivid noir style solid blacks and grays, and was reportedly restored frame by frame. This applies to the version released in Feb 1946. The disc also has the pre-release version that was almost distributed in 1945, but this version remains in 480i resolution. The changes, shot in Jan of 1946, make the film from a good one into a great one in my estimation. It adds more of the "To Have And Have Not" innuendo laced snappy dialog between LB and HB. Roughly 15 minutes of new scenes were shot in one week in Jan of 46, all of which were cobbled together with parts of the existing 45 version, and the result is a noir masterpiece. It is difficult not to be distracted by the dazzling B&amp;W photography, or Lauren's sultry beauty, but this film must be attentively viewed to follow the plot. The plot is not as byzantine as some make it out to be, you must merely pay close attention. This is noir in all its glory- replete with the men in snappy suits, the women in flowing gowns and form fitting dresses. Even the hoods are well dressed. The improved soundtrack on the BluRay disc makes Lauren's voice even more sultry, and her incredible beauty more mesmerizing. Bogie is at his wise-cracking, tough guy best. Surrounded by an excellent supporting cast, and directed by Howard Hawks, this is an absolutely essential addition to any film noir collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Sleeps '45 and '46 - both good in different ways.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen The Big Sleep a number of times over the years; it's a terrific movie with witty dialogue, a classic Bogie performance, and an unlikely number of hot women throwing themselves at the middle-aged detective. The great flaw of the film is the story, which by the end is a jumbled, confused mess.I just watched the earlier version of the movie, before Lauren Bacall's agent begged the producer to add and re-shoot scenes because he was afraid the critics would trash her for her performance as they had in her previous film - or at ignore her in favor of Martha Tilton's flashy performance as the kid sister - and he wanted to see a replay of the magic of her first movie with Bogart, To Have and Have Not.The original version of the movie would, like the final version, have been a classic 40s detective movie with a great performance from Bogart and Howard Hawk's crackling direction. It also wouldn't have been said to make no sense. Since The Big Sleep is the only Raymond Chandler book whose plot holds together in the slightest, I always thought the movie didn't make sense because they were flummoxed by how to make a movie about porn and drugs without mentioning either. But that wasn't really the issue. The 1945 version spends time explaining what's going on a couple of times, drawing connections between characters and crimes. Much of this exposition is in one particular scene with the police, and it's gone from the final version. It's understandable that they cut it, as it's a major drag on the action, but its removal makes the film incoherent.While you can argue against making a detective movie no one can follow, the pace was improved (another somewhat overlong scene of Bogart searching a house was also tightened) and the film added its most memorable scene, a suggestive conversation between Bogie and Bacall that is exactly what fans of To Have and Have Not (and Bacall's agent) wanted. The end result is faster paced and even wittier than the first version.If you're only going to watch one version of this, you should certainly watch the 1946 version. But if you're a film buff, or just want to know what on earth was going on in that 1946 movie, check this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Direction and Dialogue, but Plot Holes Abound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Big Sleep is one of the all-time classics of film-noir. The film is great fun, following Humphrey Bogart's Phillip Marlowe from scene to scene as he unravels the plot's mystery.The film's scenario is good, and the dialogue is great, however the screenplay fails to adequately express the plot. Marlowe will often tell other characters his conclusions without ever having it be explained how he deduced them, and many aspects of the story are left open. It is never explained who killed Owen Taylor (was it Joe or was it a suicide), or, more unforgivably, who killed Sean Regan, the action which is responsible for the entire plot of the film. Eddie Mars claims that Carmen killed Regan, but Marlowe then disproves this by asking him why neither Eddie nor Carmen recognized each other when meeting at Geiger's place the day after Geiger's murder. As well, how would Eddie have proved this to Vivian sufficiently that she would go through all of this trouble to protect Eddie?? It's also been posited that Eddie killed Regan, but if that were the case, why would Vivian believe that Carmen was the killer?? Either way, the keystone which support the entire plot is faulty, a big problem for any film, but combined with the dense plot and the lack of explanation for Marlowe's deduction, this makes for an very weak screenplay.Making up for the weak screenplay is the direction itself, which keeps one engrossed in the latest situation which Marlowe finds himself in, as well as Humphrey Bogart himself, whose screen charisma is the film's greatest strength. Lauren Bacall isn't much of an actress at her best, and this early in her career this was even more true. Martha Vickers was much better as Carmen Sternwood, unfortunately her role was shrunk in order to give more screen time to Bacall. The supporting pieces do very nicely (especially Elisha Cooks Jr., one of my favourite character actors of the era), and the below the line work is excellent, particularly Max Steiner's score.Despite the gaping wholes in the screenplay's construction, this film is Hollywood gold. Pure entertainment from the era that did it best. No matter how much I nitpick, it's still a great product of a great era in film history. I can't give it full marks because of those complaints, but definitely a must-watch film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Big Sleep is a convoluted mess that leaves you wondering, "What just happened?". Although the movie includes impeccable dialogue and incredible acting by Bogart (Marlowe) and Bacall (Vivian Reagan) with a strong supporting cast, the scenes move so quickly it may take several watches to figure what is happening. Many times the scenes move so quickly, and so many characters are introduced I was left completely confused. There were so many subplots and characters intricately connected, it was difficult to follow. Such as the scene where the Sternwood's chauffeur died, I still cannot pinpoint who killed him. Bogart, encapsulates Marlowe perfectly, and Bacall who plays Vivian Reagan is able to bring out a convincing performance. The rapid scenes and sudden actions by each character do not really leave any time to process what just happened. The movie does have an incredible score and sound effects, such as the gun shots. But, I was really not able to understand what was happening. Although the cast gives an incredible performance, I really could not understand all the points of the story. Overall the music works perfectly with each scene and the cast does an admirable job, the confusing plot cannot be ignored. Throughout the movie I was left extremely lost and that really detracted from my enjoyment of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Big Sleep Media Student Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Big Sleep, directed by Howard Hawkins, persistently presents a perplexing but intricate plot line that is filled with sexual tension, speculation, and direct confrontation. The Shamus, Malone, encounters all these matters when he is introduced to the Sternwoods. Carmen, the youngest of daughter of General Sternwood, displays a multitude of sexually promiscuous behaviors. She finds Malone attractive and literally throws herself at him. In that moment Carmen seems raunchy. Her first impression on Malone can easily be abbreviated to less than desirable. Malone comments that the young lassie needs "weaning".The exchanges between Malone and Carmen signify that women need to be supervised because they cannot control themselves. The film also suggests women are cunning. The following decade, the fifties, film undergoes a drastic moral reformation. The depiction of women and their mannerisms in the fifties contradict the behaviors displayed by Carmen. Similarly, Carmen's older sister, Vivian, is forward. Vivian is decisive and sophisticated. She, unlike her hyper-sexual sister, is a tasteful and charming. Vivian and Carmen's interactions with Malone both prove the Sternwood girls are likable. Nevertheless, the affable sisters are jammed in several taboo social circles. Their mischief begins with black mailing and gradually the ladies are snared into relations with gamblers and killers. The unfavorable characters force their presence on the Sternwoods. Malone's hire and personal speculations lead him to solving the disconcerting investigation. Yet, the exploration ends with Vivian and Malone coupling. Even though the plot rifles off seven individuals, the romance manages to develop and transpire during the plot (grouping). It is typical for films to have a romantic aspect. The Big Sleep, no different, also has a romantic component. The spark of the relationship begins at the Sternwood estate. Vivian requests to see Malone and interrogates him. The desire Vivian has for Malone shows when she begins to regularly visit him at his office. The spontaneous run-ins also display the connection between the romantic pair. Through the midst of chaos, protecting a meaningful element in one's life is exposed throughout the big sleep. The spectrum begins with General Sternwood's desired protection of his daughters and extends to Malone's protection of Vivian as a romantic partner. There is also the protection of friends, sibling, and image. The desire to have security seems inevitable. Every person yearns for the proper safety. Some people, Malone and Vivian, find that safety in the love for a romantic partner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classy, complex crime caper with cracking chemistry - 78%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unusually for me, this is a rare film where I have read the source novel before viewing the film - it's normally the other way around. Still, this classic film noir is pretty enjoyable in its own right even if the book's complex plot makes following things a touch tricky at times. But what really elevates this film, and what the studio knew at the time given their prominence in the publicity, is the electric chemistry between screen idols Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. It is a joy to watch and lifts what might have been a fairly plodding crime caper into the stuff of legend.Bogart is perfect as Philip Marlowe, a world-weary private detective summoned to the mansion of the aging General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) who asks Marlows for help when he finds himself being blackmailed. The General is convinced that it has something to do with one of his flighty daughters - the good-time-girl Carmen (Martha Vickers) or the femme fatale Vivian (Bacall). But as Marlowe digs a little deeper, it soon appears that everyone has something to hide. Marlowe's investigations turn over some unpleasant stones and as the case gets ever more complex, Marlowe can't help but feel that Vivian is the key...It may be suffering from some excessively dark scenes due to a lack of colourisation but "The Big Sleep" remains the classic film noir. Bogart simply IS Marlowe, wonderfully ragged at the edges and wears the expression of someone who has seen the worst the world has to offer. As a viewer with little exposure to Bogart's work (most of my movies involve at least one explosion), I had always assumed him to be a somewhat limited actor - but he is unmissable, especially when he and Bacall exchange dialogue that crackles with sexual tension and innuendo. The film is probably the closest to Raymond Chandler's vision and does the story justice, although I personally felt that some characters were underwritten and some dialogue felt difficult to understand. Maybe some of the technical advancements that have been made over the last seventy years could help iron out these particular issues but they rarely impede on the film as a whole and I can't score a movie lower just because it's old.But then again, that's part of its charm - there's no CG or big fight scenes to wow the audience but it doesn't need them. If anything, it feels more authentic than a modern version might. I still believe that instead of endless sequels or half-baked ideas like "Battleship", something like this could work as a remake - the era has been captured before in the likes of "LA Confidential" and "Road To Perdition" so why wouldn't it work? It's difficult to think how the magic between Bogie and Bacall could be replicated but that's why this movie is very much recommended - some things just can't be replicated.</fullReview>

Before the complex case is over, he has seen murder, blackmail, and what might be love.Never mind that I am not a big fan of Lauren Bacall. And never mind the connections between this film and "The Big Lebowski" (which may or may not be obvious). This is the essential detective film -- of all the private eye movies, this could be the greatest, even outshining Bogart's "Maltese Falcon".The film's biggest (and possibly only) flaw is that it is not very linear, and I had trouble keeping characters straight in the first half. A second viewing would solve this, and may be something I opt to do (it would be worth it). There also exists another cut of the film with less Bacall and a more direct story.

		<fullReview>Private detective Humphrey Bogart (Marlowe) is called by Charles Waldron (General Sternwood) to put an end to a case of blackmail involving his family. He has 2 daughters - Lauren Bacall (Vivian) and Martha Vickers (Carmen) - and it transpires that they are both drawn to the thrill of danger. Bogart solves one case but is then hooked into sticking around and poking his nose into other situations which seem to have been lurking around for a while. He is not welcome.This film is nicely shot, for instance, the depth in the greenhouse-type room where Bogart meets with Waldron draws you into the house. The dialogue is snappy and funny (both Bacall and Vickers tell Bogart that he is short) and sustains a consistency throughout the whole story. However, the film is slightly too long and I can understand those who think the film a little over-complicated. I was able to follow about 90%but I had to concentrate for the full 1 hour and 54 minutes, and this is quite a demand on the viewer. The story just seems to keep going, so just run with it.The cast are all effective and Lauren Bacall sings a really cool song after 1 hour when we see her in the nightclub and we realize, for the first time, that she is also a problem girl. Up to that point, Vickers is the bad girl who is always getting into trouble. You wonder what will happen in the final confrontations and I am pleased to say that the ending wasn't the cliché that I was expecting given the title of the film. I have no idea what the title means.Overall, it's a bit complicated but make an effort with it and it's not bad. Like Humphrey Bogart, I even felt sorry for Elisha Cooke Jnr (Jones) in his role as a messenger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably one of Bogart's best movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Big Sleep is a classic detective movie in the film noir style. My friend claims that this is the best film ever made. I wouldn't go that far, though it is tempting, but this movie I believe is a work of art. There are actually two versions of this film, one where the plot is clear while the actual 114 minute version in which the relationship between Phillip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) and Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Becall) is emphasised. It is this second version that was released and it is the more popular version. Unfortunately the plot does suffer, but I will try to outline what actually happens.Marlowe is summoned by a rich general because his daughter is being blackmailed. His former detective has left town so the general must turn elsewhere for help. Marlowe accepts the job and trails the blackmailer Mr Geiger who is murdered. The case is closed and Marlowe is paid, but he knows there is something deeper. The general's younger daughter is at the house and at Geiger's bookshop, which is really a front for a pornography ring, some guy is cleaning out the rear. All the evidence points to this guy, but as Marlowe digs deeper he learns that it is not, and this guy is shot before he can get anymore answers. This then leads Marlowe to follow up Geiger's landlord, who also runs a gambling house. Unfortunately the motivation for the murder is lost, and the plot is claimed to be so twisted that the original author of the book simply says, "the butler did it." The Big Sleep is about appearances and keeping yourself shut of from the world. All of the conversations within the movie seem to have two layers. There is the visible layer yet there is another layer which is trying to undermine the recipient of the conversation. Though guns are deadly in this film, and a number of people are killed, it is the art of conversation which creates the powerful people in the film, and Marlowe is one of the most powerful.All of the main characters in the film have a dark, flawed side to them. Marlowe was described by one person as being incorruptible, but I disagree; this issue is not raised in the film. We know there is a dark side to Marlowe, but he hides it very successfully. We know that he is covering himself out for he only lets Vivian in a little way: even though there is a electric passion between them. We do know that Marlowe was sacked from the District Attourney's office due to insubordination, but beyond that we have no clue as to who or what he is.Marlowe is a loner. He works by himself and lives by himself. He does start to form a relationship with Vivian, but this is a shallow relationship where both parties try to protect themselves from their secrets, and this is displayed as the best one can get. The Big Sleep is noir so the dark side of humanity does play a role. The movie is not a tragic movie, but there is a lot of senselessness in it. The death of the guy tailing Marlowe is seen as being a pointless death, and it is one that constantly sits in Marlowe's mind. We constantly are reminded about the brutality of the death because "he was a good kid." Marlowe met him only once, but that one meeting was enough to let him know that the kid was harmless. Thus Marlowe makes the death of Geiger's landlord just as pointless. We know that he is behind everything in the movie, but at this point Marlowe is not interested I answers, he simply wants to see the guilty pay for their crimes, and they do.The ending of the Big Sleep is not conclusive, and I don't think it is meant to be. Everything is chaotic and twisted and we have trouble following what is really happening, and I feel that this is the purpose of the movie. Everything moves through the movie quite fast, and we will arrive at a point where we think everything has been resolved only to find we have gone off in the wrong direction. In the end, the frustration simply rises to the point where the games end and the shooting begins, yet all the while Marlowe's hands remain clean, "he's just been shot by his boys," Marlowe says on the phone.Even then, Marlowe is a master manipulator. Throughout the movie, Vivian's Younger sister Carmen does not know who he is. The name he first gives her is not his real name and she persists with this name right through. Yet he sees through to he flirtatious nature and misleads her with the name because he knows anything between them is simply going to be just as misleading. The phone scene to the police station is just as manipulating as Marlowe turns the call from being a report of a crime to a crank played against the police, but this phone call is also reveals that Vivian is not a lady that is going to be led around by Marlowe. She has resolve and will stand up to Marlowe when necessary.The Big Sleep is a superb movie which vividly portrays the darkness and the chaotic nature of this world. It is one where the characters protect themselves, yet are revealed to be vulnerable, and it is one of deceit and manipulation. Blackmail is rife and people will pay up rather than bring about police involvement. Murder is common yet brutality has a price. It is a superb movie and worth every minute of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complicated, but oh, what a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall star in "The Big Sleep," a 1946 film which also features Martha Vickers, Regis Toomey, John Ridgeley, and Elisha Cook, Jr. Briskly directed by Howard Hawks, this film has more characters and more plots going on than can ever be described here. A rare book dealer, blackmail, murder, payoffs, a missing chauffeur, a missing wife - yikes! The story is so convoluted that the script writers had to call Raymond Chandler, on whose novel the film is based, to ask him who killed a particular character. Chandler says it's in the book, but the writers couldn't find it. So in the general release film, we're left not knowing, although the cut shown to serviceman does resolve the question. But somehow, it doesn't matter because of the casting.Humphrey Bogart is terrific as Sam Spade, absolute perfection. He mines the humor in the character as well as the drama. Lauren Bacall is drop-dead gorgeous and sexy as Vivian Rutledge, and her chemistry with Bogart is va-va-va-voom. Their dialogue, with those sexy innuendos and undertones, is one of the delights of this film, particularly when they're discussing horse racing. Mrs. Rutledge feels it all depends on "who's in the saddle." Fabulous. That scene and several others were added much later to benefit Bacall's character; Warners and her agent were afraid more bad reviews like she received in Confidential Agent would ruin her. (The fact that she was miscast in Confidential Agent seems to have escaped everyone.) According to Raymond Chandler, Martha Vickers overshadowed Bacall, so lots of her footage was cut.Bogart and Bacall made several films together, but I think this is their best. Bacall, admittedly nervous in "To Have and Have Not," though it didn't show, is supremely confident in this and gives as good as she gets.I just followed the story and attempted to keep track of it, all the while enjoying the repartee between these two. I usually don't think of Bogart as sexy, but he sure was here. Goes to show you what love can do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 161 The Big Sleep is a great movie about crime, being a detective and other hard to understand stuff. The story is filled with twists, turns, lies, murder and surprises: it's a complex, convoluted film noir. The beginning doesn't make much sense, because many characters and ideas are introduced. Eventually most of it is pieced together, and things wrap up nicely. But you have to think when watching the Big Sleep.The best part is Philip Marlowe, played by the legendary Humphrey Bogart. He's an awesome character: a hardworking, tough detective with noir style, and he seduces no less than 4 women simply by being himself. You root for him entirely. Also, his disguise in the Geiger bookstore is simple yet hilarious.Opposite him is Vivian, played by Lauren Bacall. They have great chemistry, but while Bogart in Casablanca had 'love' chemistry, here he has 'desire' chemistry. It's far more sensual and interesting.Speaking of sensual, there's a lot about this film that seems to be boundary-pushing. Carmen Sternwood, Vivian's sister, shocked me in her first scene by wearing a short dress. This is the 40's! Conservatism! Also, when Vivian scratches her upper leg, the notion of it is given dialogue. Just to tell audiences, "Look! She's scratching her thigh ON CAMERA!" I really liked The Big Sleep, more than I thought I would. The characters are likable, the plot is thick, and it's a well- made film. You'll think about it for a few days. 8.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Noir Goes Abstract</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Big Sleep" is a murder mystery which grips its audience right from the start and never lets go. Its story about a private detective's investigation which initially involves a missing person and gambling debts soon mushrooms into a complicated series of developments which lead to shoot-outs, murders, blackmail and numerous subplots which involve a whole variety of very shady characters. The fast moving action is consistently intriguing but also very entertaining as it features many humorous moments and also one of the most brilliant screenplays ever written.Private detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) is employed by the very wealthy but ailing General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) because he's received a demand for payment of his daughter Carmen's gambling debts and his employee (Sean Regan) who'd dealt with a previous similar demand had disappeared.The demand had been made by a bookseller called Geiger (Theodore von Eltz) and when Marlowe follows him to his house, he hears gun shots and discovers Carmen (Martha Vickers) in a drugged up state and Geiger's dead body together with a list of his blackmail victims.In a conversation with Vivian (Lauren Bacall) who's Carmen's older sister, Marlowe's told that a blackmail demand has also been received relating to a compromising photograph of Carmen. In order to pay the ransom, Vivian attempts to borrow the money from Eddie Mars (John Ridgely) whose a professional gambler. Marlowe's subsequent investigations eventually unveil what had happened to Regan and he then cleverly ties up the loose ends in a manner which avoids his employer from the distress he would inevitably have suffered if he'd been made aware of the whole unsavoury truth.The screenplay by William Faulkener, Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman is scintillating and smart throughout and contains numerous wisecracks and plenty of innuendo when Bogart and Bacall indulge in their now famous race track conversation.Humphrey Bogart is perfect as the tough and cynical Marlowe who's incapable of being shocked by anything that happens and has a witty one-liner for every occasion. He's also a "babe magnet" and flirts with a number of women, most notably a bookseller who gets friendly with him very quickly, takes off her glasses, unties her hair, pulls down the blind and closes the shop for the afternoon!! In another amusing encounter with a female taxi driver, she gives him her business card and says "if you can use me again sometime call this number" and when Marlowe asks "day and night?" she replies "night's better, I work during the day".Lauren Bacall is very cool and composed as the elegant Vivian but also proves to be Marlowe's equal when it comes to exchanges of witty repartee. Famously, it was the wish to exploit the commercial appeal of Bogart and Bacall's on screen chemistry that led to the movie being re-edited at some cost to the coherence of the end product.In this movie we see what happens when an already complicated plot is presented in a way which disrupts the narrative, omits important elements of exposition and alludes to some of the subject matter (e.g. pornography, homosexuality, nymphomania, drug use etc) in ways which are either extremely coy or elliptical. The result is an entity which is devoid of many of the reference points which audiences normally rely upon and consequently it becomes rather abstract. The fact that "The Big Sleep" withstands this treatment and remains a supreme example of classic film noir is testament to its intrinsic quality, its great performances and its superb screenplay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>top-notch Bogart private eye flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Big Sleep' seems ten times as complicated as 'The Maltese Falcon;' to some people, that makes it a greater cinematic delight, to others, a slightly lesser one. There is a legend going around that, even if it's not true, is fun to believe- that the star, director, and even the writer were uncertain about whether one of the deaths in the film was a suicide or murder, and if it was a murder, who committed it. After seeing 'The Big Sleep,' I am inclined to believe it. Unless you almost literally take notes while watching it, after a certain point your brain just stops trying to keep track of all the persons seen or referred to, on screen and off, who killed whom and who is getting the blame and where the hell Sean Regan is. There are three people that you end up caring about- Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart), Vivian (Lauren Bacall), and Vivian's younger sister Carmen (Martha Vickers). Carmen is an example of an enduring cinematic character type that lives on to this day, the drop-dead gorgeous young woman who is absolutely out of control and doesn't give a damn about anything but having a good time. This being 1946, her personality is drawn mainly by suggestion, and suggestive lines, and Vickers' wickedly suggestive performance. It is said some of her scenes were cut to build up Bacall's part. If that's true, it's a shame. But then 'The Big Sleep' is a pretty naughty film overall for its time. There's Bogart and Bacall's famous conversation with the 'racehorse' analogy, which probably pushed the envelope as far as it would go back then. The film is heavy on dialogue, not so much on action, but you don't really notice it. An air of threatening cold-bloodedness hangs over the proceedings, the feeling that life is cheap and anyone might be killed at any moment on someone else's whim. In this way, it can be seen as a very early precursor to a film like 'Blue Velvet.' When Marlowe walks into a house to find Carmen stoned and completely out of it, one gets the same feeling about the crowd she's been hanging out with that you did in the David Lynch film, where Dennis Hopper casually kidnaps and torments Kyle McLachlan. Bogart of course is perfect as Marlowe; at this stage in his career, he had the hardboiled private eye bit nailed. Lauren Bacall builds on her performance in 'To Have And Have Not' as the brainy and sexy femme fatale who sometimes is too clever for her own good. Martha Vickers is a knockout as the 'nymphy' younger sister. Her constant flirting with Marlowe prompts his classic line, "She tried to sit in my lap while I was standing up." The rest of the cast is standard issue, the usual Warner Bros. stock company of character actors, with one exception- a very young Dorothy Malone portrays a sexy bookworm with whom Marlowe has a rainy day tryst. She makes the most of her scene. 'The Big Sleep' is one of those films that you can watch again and again and always pick up something new from, an example of old-time Hollywood at its most riskily and racily adventurous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall made screen history together more than once, but they were never more popular than in this 1946 adaptation of Raymond Chandler's novel, directed by Howard Hawks (To Have and Have Not). Bogart plays private eye Philip Marlowe, who is hired by a wealthy socialite (Bacall) to look into troubles stirred up by her wild, young sister (Martha Vickers). Legendarily complicated (so much so that even Chandler had trouble following the plot), the film is nonetheless hugely entertaining and atmospheric, an electrifying plunge into the exotica of detective fiction.

		<shortDescription>An engaging detective yarn, though a bit convoluted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Big Sleep" is a classic film noir that centres on P.I. Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart). Initially hired to make a blackmailer 'go away', he soon finds himself unravelling a much bigger mystery.Much of the film's lasting appeal stems from the Bogie/Bacall pairing. Personally, I think that they have good chemistry but I wouldn't say that it's as exceptional as some seem to think. Bogart's Marlowe is similar to his Sam Spade but here he shows a bit of a lighter touch. Bacall, meanwhile, is extremely fetching and exudes a sultry, seductive aura. The supporting cast is pretty good for the most part but not really worth remarking upon in detail.From a technical standpoint the film is well constructed but not particularly exceptional. The Hawks direction and Steiner score are both solid but I doubt that many consider them the main draws of the picture. The script is quite strong in terms of dialogue but the storyline is undeniably convoluted. I was able to follow it without any problems but you've been advised to pay close attention.In the end, "The Big Sleep" makes for an entertaining film noir with some excellent work from Humphrey Bogart. I wholeheartedly recommend it to any fans of "The Maltese Falcon" or film noir in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people say that they don't make them like that anymore, but I don't necessarily believe that. If you take a film like "The Big Sleep" you can see it's descendants in films like "LA Confidential" and "The Departed", but for all the changes to both censorship and language that has occurred over time, this is still as raw and fresh as anything that's come since.A relatively simple story of a private detective hired to pay off a troublesome blackmailer for an elderly gentleman seems relatively straightforward. With both Bogey and Bacall in the forms of their lives as they carry out their verbal sparring whilst getting more and more entangled in a web of intrigue and corruption that neither of them an escape, the film moves at an incredible speed as corpses of the great and the good mount up on both sides.The dialogue is glorious and it's no coincidence that the writer of this also went on to write some of the most memorable lines put on celluloid in "The Empire Strikes Back". If you watch the two films back to back you can easily see Leigh Brackett's fingertips all over it.An all-time classic that makes you wonder why the hell they bothered with the remake.Nuff said Em</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why did you have to go on?" "Too many people told me to stop."A supreme noir whodunit. Bogart &amp; Bacall are class. The film follows LA Private Eye Phillip Marlowe ( Bogart) on a blackmail case...and follows a trail peopled with murderers, pornographers, rogues, the spoiled rich and much more. But it is Raymond Chandler's legendary gumshoe, Marlowe who solves it all in hard-boiled style. And style is what this film is all about. From its sultry mood, to its incredibly witty script. Director Howard Hawks serves up a feast for the eyes and ears in regards to the films countless snappy character encounters. The scenes involving Bogart and Lauren Bacall particularly are the ones most talked about.The thing I love about Bogart is that in one scene he can scare the living **** out of you and in the next he would go all puppy eyed on you! However, the scenes involving Martha Vickers, the kid sister Carmen are so much more interesting to me personally. Vickers is just a hoot to watch as the sex mad younger sister. Furthermore, my favorite scene from the film doesn't even involve, Bogart and Bacall. It involves Bogart, of course.... ( he is in the majority of the scenes, as our eyes and ears of the film) but it involves another actress-Dorothy Malone. The scene of which I am speaking of, has Bogart's character held up in a rain storm during a stakeout at a bookstore, and of course I believe the sexiest moment of that scene is when she closes the window blinds. I also love the way he says "Hello!" when she takes off her glasses, and lets her hair down. Dorothy Malone also improvised this scene as well. "Did you do this?" "That? Oh yes, that's a little special service....I always provide all my clients."The film's pace does suffer at times, no doubt due to the film's ( adapted from a Raymond Chandler novel) difficult and at times hard to understand plot. Chandler was even quoted as saying he didn't know who had committed one of the seven murders in his own book."How do you like your brandy, sir?" "In a glass."These her signatures? Who's Arthur Geiger?" "I haven't the faintest idea." "Did you ask her?" "No, and I don't intend to. If I did, she'd just suck her thumb and look coy." "I met her in the hall and she did that to me, then she tried to sit on my lap while I was standing up.""Your cute." "And your high as a kite." "You go too far, Marlowe." Harsh words to throw at a man, especially when he's walking out of your bedroom.""Eddie Mars never kills anybody. He just hires it done." "Look, angel, I'm tired. My jaw, my ribs ache, I killed a man back there and stood by while a harmless guy was killed.....""What's wrong with you?" "Nothing you can't fix."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who killed Owen Taylor, the replacement chauffeur? I don't know; Philip Marlowe doesn't know; screenwriters William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman certainly don't know. Indeed, even Raymond Chandler, the author of the original novel, was once asked to explain his story's many murders, double-crossings, twists and turns, and replied that he had absolutely no idea. In any other situation, I might consider this a solid detraction from the quality of the film, but, strangely enough, here it almost acts as a positive. 'The Big Sleep (1946)' is so doggedly obsessed with showing us the dark, seedy underbelly of human existence that any scenario, however shocking, is quite conceivable; the murderer could have been any one of the characters, and this would have been wholly consistent with the general tone of the film. The Hollywood township setting is occupied by a collection of the most morally-depraved creatures imaginable, and the murder mystery plot is so incredibly convoluted that anybody who claims to follow it all on first viewing is either a genius or a liar.Humphrey Bogart is, of course, the definitive version of the film-noir hero, exhibiting handsomeness, toughness and always remaining in full control of the situation. Though his character is basically the same as his Sam Spade from 'The Maltese Falcon (1941),' this was the only occasion on which Bogart portrayed Chandler's popular character Philip Marlowe {who, notably, has also been played by Dick Powell and Robert Mitchum}. Though Marlowe is allowed to entertain a variety of seductive women, via some surprisingly-scandalous double entendre dialogue, it is with future-wife Lauren Bacall that the chemistry really sizzles {the couple would be married by the time of the film's release, and would co-star in numerous subsequent pictures}. Considering I had been rather disappointed with the pair's chemistry in 'Key Largo (1948),' it was a real pleasure to witness the sparks really flying this time, most memorably in a sexually-suggestive horse-racing dialogue sequence, which was re-shot later to capitalise on the pair's popularity following 'To Have and Have Not (1944).''The Big Sleep' is one of the most rawly-entertaining hard-boiled detective thrillers I've seen, an indecipherable jumble of murders and low-lifes that both acknowledges its incomprehensibility and accepts it {indeed, the characters each seem as baffled as we are}. Various important characters never appear on screen, while others turn up already dead, and more still only survive long enough to divulge a vital clue. Considering the dominance of the Productive/Hays Code during the 1940s, it's surprising that much of the content of the film was allowed to remain intact. Aside from the sexual innuendo, the plot also contains veiled references to pornography, drug use and homosexuality. Perhaps the film's ultra-complicated plot also served as the picture's saving grace, with censors apparently too bewildered with the mystery to notice what was actually being implied by Bogart and his various female companions. However, the one most important question has yet to be asked: where on Earth did Howard Hawks manage to find so many good-lookin' dames?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart made several films in the 1940s, which I saw on television when I was very young. Although I fully enjoyed the films back then; I expected to more fully comprehend them when I was older. Now, I am older, and, while I still enjoy films like "The Big Sleep", I do not expect there will ever be any way to understand the storyline of this one. Mr. Bogart is detective Philip Marlowe, hired by older General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) to solve an increasingly complicated crime. The aptly named Sternwood has two sexually charged daughters: Lauren Bacall (as Vivian) and Martha Vickers (as Carmen). And, check out young Dorothy Malone as a bookstore clerk.The pairing of Bogart and Ms Bacall is terrific; and, Ms. Vickers is no slouch, either. One of the best scenes involves Bacall unsuccessfully trying to ignore an itch under her dress; finally, Bogart invites her to scratch away. Such scenes have a great sexual energy, and innuendo. Although the story, as a whole, is too vague, the script is exceptional. It's full of wit. Raymond Chandler (original novelist), Leigh Brackett, William Faulkner, and Jules Furthman have written exceptional conversational dialogue. And, the film has a wonderful look; it's directed, with great style, by Howard Hawks. His Bogart/Bacall scenes are very entertaining, and the action sequences exciting; especially notable is the confrontation between Bogart and "Lundgren" (Tommy Rafferty). ******** The Big Sleep (8/23/46) Howard Hawks ~ Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Martha Vickers</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nowadays, one can see the actual minor differences of the two versions though the 1946 version has the comical and sensual racetrack scene of Bogart and Bacall. It replaces a scene that detectives discuss the events of the narrative so far.For those who read the book, one very dramatic scene is near the end that in in neither version. The scene where the little sister confronts and almost shoots Phillip Marlowe. But there's enough good stuff here that makes this a classic.The dialogue comes quick and fast and most of it holds up quite well over forty years later. Bogart: "It says so on page 47 in the book on how to be a private detective." Bacall: "Is that where it shows you how a be a comedian?" Influences of this movie show up in other ones in different other ones. One inside joke Hawks played was having every single female character making a play on Bogart. His scene with Dorothy Malone is quite funny. Years later, Kubrick would play the same joke in "Eyes Wide Shut." Every character would be aroused when they meet Tom Cruise.Don't try to figure it out. Just enjoy this 1940's ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Convoluted but thoroughly enjoyable classic Bogart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Memorable primarily because of the off-screen as well as on-screen romance of its two stars, and the bewilderment of even those involved with the film in respect to the chaotic and convoluted plot, The Big Sleep stands to this day as one of the most memorable pictures of the film noir movement. By all respects, the film should not have functioned, considering its number of discordant qualities, but somehow everything fits together in a surprisingly functional and sturdy fashion, standing out as one of the most subtly unique and daring films of the decade. Director Howard Hawks demonstrates his typical flair for energy and enthusiasm, and every scene virtually crackles with the fast paced, overlapping dialogue and captivating intensity. And while the infamously convoluted plot is just as ludicrously difficult to follow or make sense of as heralded, it becomes almost inconsequential - when even Chandler admitted to having difficultly figuring out who had murdered who in his own novel, it became quickly clear that not all of The Big Sleep was meant to be understood. Instead of attempting to clarify matters, Hawks cheerfully embraces the convoluted script and pumps the film full of such energy and vivacity that the final effort is too unabashedly enjoyable for one to be concerned with an increasingly trivial plot. And in the end, when the film boasts so much else to relish, such as the sumptuous noir visuals, the aesthetically brilliant sets, and a powerful but never overbearing orchestral score, it becomes increasingly difficult not to enjoy. In contrast with the infinitely twisty and frequently confounding plot, the script itself is a truly masterful work, providing a consistent barrage of snappy, highly quotable lines (many put to brilliant use by Bogart's masterful deadpan delivery) many subtly parodying film noir conventions ("What's the matter? Haven't you ever seen a gun before?" is one of the most memorable) and a surprising quantity of comedic moments, nicely counterbalancing the tense tone of the film. Moments one would never expect to see in a classic noir, such as Marlowe portraying a flamboyant literary expert and a very James Bond-like slew of women falling instantly for Marlowe, often with a coy innuendo in pursuit, work surprisingly well, and far from descending the film into farce, maintain an outwardly serious tone with a seeming quiet chuckle carefully masked. Of course the unquestionable high point of the film are the incredibly strong performances, in particular the electric chemistry between Bogart and Bacall. The character of private eye Philip Marlowe could easily have been tailor written for Humphery Bogart, considering the ease with which he sinks his teeth into the role. Bogart is on absolutely top form from start to finish - an iconic blend of gruff charisma, dogged intensity and pitch perfect deadpan delivery easily justifying his legendary status. As one of the few female co-stars who could ever go toe to toe with Bogart in terms of dramatic intensity and charisma, Lauren Bacall is perfectly cast as the mysterious Vivian Rutledge. Her magnetic presence and icy delivery are consistently captivating, and the scenes between her and Bogart tremble with romantic tension it seems impossible could have ceased after the cameras stopped rolling. Backing up the two dynamic leads, John Ridgely is a commanding presence as malevolent casino owner Eddie Mars, and Martha Vickers is captivating and enormously powerful as Bacall's hedonistic sister Carmen. All in all, for those willing to either overlook or put up with the film's sometimes confoundingly complex plot, The Big Sleep proves itself to be one of the most caustically enjoyable entries to the film noir movement. Kinetic, sharp, and incessantly clever, the film exudes class from every frame to the point where matters such as continuity become easily overshadowed by the snappy script and the dynamic performances of Bogart and Bacall. They simply do not make films such as this anymore, and upon subsequent viewing, such a notion becomes increasingly tragic. -9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I try to imagine watching Howard Hawks's movie version of Raymond Chandler's "The Big Sleep" when it first got released. It was right after WWII had ended, and people were no doubt mired in optimism. If so, then movies like this may have existed to temper everyone's optimism.Eternal tough guy Humphrey Bogart, hot off the success of "The Maltese Falcon", "Casablanca" and "To Have and Have Not", plays private eye Philip Marlowe, surrounded by a murky, sleazy world of various cases. One day, he gets hired by an old man to investigate a case. Of course, he's about to get a lot more than he bargained for. Throughout the whole movie, you can feel the tension between the various characters, and you wonder who's hiding what. It goes to show that Bogie and Lauren Bacall were truly a great team.Oh, and by the way, I noticed that in one scene, Marlowe enters Acme Bookstore. Maybe that was just the name, but maybe there was more to it than that. I try to imagine Wile E. Coyote ordering from them some wacky device to try and trap Road Runner (only to fail, natch). Probably not many people interpret that, but I do.Anyway, a really good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Big sleep sees Humphrey at his best as a hard fast talking detective on a case. This has to be my all time noir favourite. It beats new and old Noir films like Sin City or DOA (still good films) hands down with plenty of plot twists, witty dialogue, blinds, cigarette lighters and mystery. It's style is similar to the Maltese falcon, however I think each are as good as the other. In the Maltese falcon Boggart seems to play the same character as the one in the big sleep, just with a different name. So similar are the characters that they even have the same punch. I'm surprised they don't have the same name. If anything I recommend watching the film just for the dialogue. From a writers point of view, it would be a dream to have skill such a that. The film made me laugh and it excited me at the same time which is rare in todays films and it was made over fifty years ago, so it's got my vote...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this film for my first time and very pleased at the production it achieved considering the rumors that the story is unfathomable and some of it was filmed a year apart. Overall, Bogey plays his usual wise-cracking self, although there is a semblance of a human being underneath (this time) with feelings and emotions. Bacall is less effective, in my opinion, and the character seems indecisive about which side she is on. For example, why does she cut the ropes used to tie Bogey if she is "in" with the Eddie Mars crowd? The dialog is sharp and more bodies fall than we can keep track off, but it all has something to do with the "Carmen" character. A lot of reviewers noticed sub-"gay" themes, but they were lost on me. This is a rewarding film ... one qstn: where is that bookstore located that Bogey spends one rainy afternoon? :^)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Big Sleep is not as good as the Maltese Falcon but it's an excellent film. The detective story is confusing and rambling but it keeps your interest; you never know where it is going next and in the end it probably doesn't make that much sense which is true of most mystery stories.Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall are in their screen prime together and Bacall is filmed to show off her timeless beauty. All the characters are interesting with my favorites being Dorothy Malone as the Acme Bookstore proprietress and one of the best supporting actors Elisha Cook Jr. as little guy Harry Jones. Bob Steele as Canino is an especially creepy thug.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humphrey Bogart brings Phillip Marllowe to life in this Howard Hawks classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this many times over the years and it's a Bogey/Bacall classic filled with sexual tension and innuendo in a complex crime drama murder mystery and filled with the stylish atmosphere of a film noir. Raymond Chandler had developed his Phillip Marlowe character for six years in pulp fiction throughout the 1930's and in 1938 he began writing The big Sleep, which in 1939 became his first novel to introduce the Marlowe character. The screenplay is adapted from his novel by William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman. Legendary director Howard Hawks who directed such classics as Scarface, Sergeant York, Air Force, To Have and Have Not, Red River and Rio Bravo began filming The Big Sleep in 1944, six months before Bogart and Bacall were married. It went through some re shot scenes and some editing and was shelved throughout 1945 until the actors were called back and some scenes were re shot and two additional scenes were included and after more editing was finally released in 1946. The end result is a complex, hard to follow dialog driven film that has many complexities to keep track of including murder, organized crime, pornography, bootlegging and missing persons. Marlowe is a hard boiled private eye who is hired by a millionaire to stem a blackmail scheme. The dysfunctional family of Marlowes employ for this assignment includes the millionaires two femme fatal daughters. This film overflows with corrupt and crooked characters. Cinematographer Sidney Hicks who had his beginnings in silent films and went on to do such movies as To Have and Have Not, Dark Passage, White Heat, All Through the Night and Possessed is Big Sleep's photographer. Eric Stacey who had been the production director on To Have and Have Not and the assistant film director of Gone With the Wind and Rebecca is the production director. Casablanca's Jules Weyl is the Art Director. Christian Nyby who went on to a successful career as a television director is the film editor. Renowned film composer Max Steiner provides the score. Besides Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, the fine cast includes Martha Vickers, Dorothy Malone, Regis Toomey, John Ridgely, Louis Jean Heydt, Charles Waldron and Peggy Knudsen. I would give this a 9.0 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Product of the Warner Bros. Studio system</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most compelling suspense films ever made. It is actually the product of two films: The first version was never released for two reasons: The studio had a backlog of war related movies to release while the war was still underway and the Big Sleep could wait; the second was the weak performance and poor costuming of Lauren Bacall. When they re-shot the film the logical, if plodding sequence early in the film was ditched in exchange for a sketchy, much faster paced beginning sequence as well as other scenes that supported the faster pace. The result was a mystery so simultaneously intriguing and confusing that neither the writers, Howard Hawks the director and nor the original book's author, Raymond Chandler, could figure out who did three of the killing. But that didn't matter, it was a riveting movie and like Casablanca a fine example of what the studio's movie factory model could produce. The DVD has an earlier version and a UCLA film school comparison of the two productions. It is well worth the time to watch it despite its being a little academic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of Raymond Chandler and his famous character Philip Marlowe to say that I found this film entertaining would be an understatement. Indeed, this film's wildly twisting plot and superb performances create an overall stunning film. Who better to portray the rough edged Philip Marlowe than the master of the tough guy, Humphrey Bogart. But "Bogey's" performance is masterfully balanced with the smooth and silky performance of Lauren Bacall. The chemistry between these two actors isn't entirely fiction, however. Bacall and Bogey were a real life couple, and this film marks the beginning of their relationship. I suggest this film for anyone who is a Raymond Chandler fan, a Humphrey Bogart fan, or simply a fan of good movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delicious Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most, if not THE most convoluted yet enjoyable noirs I've seen in years. The DVD (R1) version explains some intriguing production points: Filming began in late 1944 on the tails of the success of pairing Bogie &amp; Bacall in "To Have And Have Not". The pre-release print of the film (Spring 1945) did not favor Bacall as flatteringly as the final print we've all grown to love. Her agent (same as director Howard Hawks') implored production chief Jack Warner to re-shoot some scenes and add dialogue for Bacall. Warner agreed and today we actually can see on DVD both versions: The 1945 Pre-Release and the 1946 Final Cut in their entirety. There are out-takes and scene comparisons as extras too. Chandler is quoted as noting that at one point HE didn't even know who killed who! Bogart, Bacall and Vickers are all excellent and the machine-gun banter is extraordinary. The dialogue alone is worth the price of admission. Definitely a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

Check out the pre-release print for a couple expository scenes that fill in motives and who is doing what, and a few flat scenes w/ Bacall that they wisely re-did.I highly recommend this of course-Bacall is great, Dorothy Malone has a great scene where she comes onto Bogie, and you can't go wrong w/ Elisha Cook Jr., Bob Steele and the always steady Regis Toomey. Bogart fits this role like a glove, it may be his all-time best performance.I enjoyed also the rather risqué(for the era) subject material-drugs, promiscuity, etc.-they certainly don't stint on the underside of society in this one.By all means check it out and don't worry too much about the plotting-it's always best just to follow the bouncing ball as best's ya can and enjoy the ride.****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quintessential Noir with Insane Plot but Superb Atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philip Marlowe, a Los Angeles private detective, is hired by the wealthy General Sternwood to discover why his younger daughter, Carmen, is being blackmailed and to find out what has happened to his former employee Sean Regan who has disappeared. Marlowe traces the blackmailer, Arthur Geiger, to his house, only to find that Geiger has been shot dead. Any further explanation of the plot would be difficult; from this point onwards it becomes very complex, with a large cast of characters being introduced and several more murders being committed, as Marlowe uncovers a web of corruption and violent crime. The plot is not only extraordinarily complicated, it is also confusing, containing threads that are never developed and events that are never explained. It is said that even the scriptwriter, the well-known novelist William Faulkner, did not know who committed one of the murders, nor the motive for which it was committed, and that Raymond Chandler, the author of the original novel on which the film was based, proved to be no more helpful. (Is it significant that the leading character has the same surname as the Elizabethan dramatist known for his complex and gruesome plots?)This is not, however, the sort of movie one watches primarily for the plot. Anyone who watches it expecting it to be an Agatha Christie type 'whodunit', with all the crimes solved and all loose ends neatly tidied up in the final scene is likely to be disappointed. What makes the film so watchable is its atmosphere. A dark, menacing feeling was a hallmark of the 'film noir' style, but in 'The Big Sleep' it is particularly strong. In keeping with the dark deeds that make up its plot, much of the action takes place either at night or against a background of torrential rain. Combined with this is an air of dubious glamour. There are numerous strikingly beautiful but sinister women among the cast, some of them only playing minor roles. The best-known of these is, of course, Lauren Bacall as Carmen's older sister Vivian (who provides Marlowe's love-interest), but there are also Martha Vickers as Carmen herself, Dorothy Malone, Peggy Knudsen, Sonia Darrin and Joy Barlow. (Joy Barlow? She is the angelic-looking brunette who plays the female tax-driver who appears in one brief scene. She had bit-parts in fourteen films in the 1940s, only being credited on one of them. Even in Hollywood, looks are not always enough to guarantee success). One might have expected the late forties, following the return of peace after the victorious conclusion to the Second World War, would have been a time of optimism in America, but this mood was not always reflected in the films of the era. This was the heyday of film noir, the most pessimistic of genres. As well as being physically dark, 'The Big Sleep' is also morally dark. The mood is one of cynicism and world-weariness, mostly emanating from Humphrey Bogart's interpretation of the lead character. This was the sort of part in which Bogart excelled; apart from 'Casablanca' (in which he played another type of cynic), he is probably best-remembered today for his film noir roles, especially the hard-bitten private eyes he played here and in 'The Maltese Falcon'. There is, of course, frequently a more human side beneath the surface Bogart cynicism; Rick in 'Casablanca' ends up 'doing the decent thing', and Marlowe, for all his cynical wit, has a genuine desire to see justice done. Bogart gave so many great performances in the course of his career that it would be difficult to single one out as being his best, but 'The Big Sleep' must come high on the list. Lauren Bacall, Bogart's real-life wife, is also excellent in this film, and there is a genuine sexual tension in the scenes between them. It is interesting that the film was completely overlooked by the Academy; it did not receive a single Oscar nomination. Like a number of other classic films noirs it seems to be more highly regarded now than when it was made. Despite the insane complexity of its plot, this is a film that never fails to hold the attention, and still has the power to fascinate nearly sixty years on. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>classic film noir by Hawks...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An impressive film by any standard. Even with a convoluted script that had Hawks supposedly phoning Falkner as to "who killed Geiger?" ; this noir has something for everyone. Nice double entendres (talking about horses) between Bacall and Bogey during the dinner scene are one of the highlights. A funny "pal" scene with cult fave Dorothy Malone is another. The interplay between Bogey and Martha Vickers (Carmen Sternwood) is memorable as well.Another remarkable scene is a long (almost single take) shot of Marlowe entering the Geiger bungalow after the first murder. Almost without dialogue for more than half its duration, it's remarkable for a film this old from the old studio system to have a set-up like this. The novel by Chandler was passed off as common pulp fare by some critics when it was published - but the film has remained a classic by many generations of filmmakers and viewers. Perhaps not as "essential" as the Maltese Falcon - but for those who enjoy classic noir, Bogey &amp; Bacall or just good film-making a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Should you watch this film for plot? Nah. Because it get too complex sometimes and you may lose yourself in the progress. Humphrey Bogart delivered superb performance as Phillip Marlowe, whose found his match in Lauren Bacall's character Vivien Sternwood Rutledge. I think it's very fun film to watch because you can lose yourself in progress with Bogie, whose is trying to figure what the hell is going on. However, DVD version offered 2 different versions of The Big Sleep. One version that is well known, which is very confusing. Another version that never got released, which is more straightfoward. Which version does I prefer? I prefer well known version because I just love the chemistry between Bogie and Bacall. I saw prereleased version of The Big Sleep and I didn't like it as much as I do for released version. Why's that? The tone in prereleased version doesn't really have same ring as well known version one.Let me explain how should you view The Big Sleep. It's great film noir in its own rights and I strongly recommend that you checked out well known version because it's just fascinated to watch. The dialogues in The Big Sleep are very wicked, which is the reason why I like this film very much. Superb film noir, my friends. ****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>introducing - the nice detective!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogart definitely plays a kinder, gentler gumshoe in this film than he did in "The Maltese Falcon." For that reason, I can understand why "Falcon" has a better reputation; it's a remarkable study in sleaze, and not a single character is above reproach. Yet I'm more of a "Big Sleep" kind of guy; I like a nice hero. Marlowe is a little shady and grumpy, perhaps, but he means well. He even gets a very human moment of fear when his hand shakes during the final confrontation. Unlike Sam Spade, he's not a mystery to the audience, but an open-book type whom you can root for with a clearer conscience. This film is more "Hollywoodized" and accessible than "The Maltese Falcon" in several other respects. Sexy babes abound here; every few seconds, another gorgeous woman pops out of the woodwork. The pacing is much faster than "Falcon," and while that helps sustain interest, it also means that certain plot elements are glossed over and obscured. And yet, I still prefer the style of "The Big Sleep." I don't necessarily need realism or grimness to carry a detective story; in fact, this film's glib and sexy tone is more in keeping with my image of the genre than "The Maltese Falcon." At the end of the day, this film is simply faster and more fun, and I can relate to the protagonist more closely. So, my somewhat flippant summary line actually disguises a deep admiration for this film! This is about as much fun as you can have with a hoary old classic. By the way, for my money, the theatrical cut is better than the original (boring) version. Even with the D.A. scene added, the plot is still confusing, so I'll take a faster pace and some extra flirting instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little too complex?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I studied The Big Sleep for my high school English studies, it being a perfect example of Film Noir, and I'm glad I did. Having to watch it multiple times and pay very close attention to every minor detail makes it so much more enjoyable. That's just because you actually understand what's going on this way.The classic example of the complexity is the fact that one of the many deaths in the film is never actually solved (not even by Raymond Chandler himself), and so in many ways the audience is left in the dark with regards to a number of the plot elements. Just so I could wrap my head round the plot, I was required to draw up a chart of all of the murders that take place, who is murdered, who is the murderer, and what was the motive. It took a fair while.That doesn't detract from the film though, and it is the sort of film that is just as great to watch on subsequent viewings. Humphrey Bogart is found at the top of his form as Private Investigator Philip Marlowe who doesn't know the meaning of the word quit. Lauren Bacall is also flawless as the femme fatale of the film, while Martha Vickers makes a strong contribution as Bacall's young, petulant sister. Howard Hawks' direction is snappy and the plot moves with great pace. Like I've said, there are many twists and turns in the plot, and a lot of questions are left after the first viewing. I think the great thing about the way in which it is handled, is that it doesn't try to answer every question and in that way treats its audience with respect.It also gives the audience a lot more, with great suspense, excellent chemistry (for obvious reasons) between Bogart and Bacall and a bunch of witty exchanges between Marlowe and various villainous characters: We really enjoy the detective's character and we know that he is set for a big finish. He doesn't disappoint.In retrospect, I can only say that it's an awesome film that presents one of the most complex stories of all time with style and vigour. It's a very entertaining and well-crafted work and truly deserving of the label 'classic'. For a piece of cinema that stands the test of time, it must be given a perfect rating on this occasion, despite its over-complicated nature. ***** / *****</fullReview>

Digging into a murky underworld to discover the fabric of human nature to be woven with lust and death the stoic protagonist (played by Humphrey Bogart) is on a sublime crusade that has little to do with the plot. A palpable dark sexuality permeates this film where all but Humphrey are suspect if not suspects.

		<fullReview>Why don't they make movies like this anymore? Great acting, original plot line with a few twists here and there...but the real treat is the very likeable characters and suspenseful tone. It seems the continual temptation for many directors is to "cheap out" on dialogue and human interaction so they can appeal to the masses who can't catch up to the more "subtle" suggestions which enhance the romance. It seems the opposite is to often true, you know, the immature and vulgar suggestions that are rampant in comedies.Anyhow back to the movie, Bogart is right on target with his hard and heavy role, rational and brutally honest as in "The Maltese Falcon" yet a little more romantic as in "Casablanca". Overall, a great show of his ability to play the "man's man" character.Lauren Bacall was perfect, too, in her performance and romantic suggestions done to perfection, her role with Bogart showed such chemistry, one could easily wish for a sequel of some sort.Overall, it was obvious that a true writer invented this beauty, and anyone who likes those mildly romantic, suspenseful with just the right touch of murder, will enjoy this absolute must watch classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart plays a down-at-heel private detective (Philip Marlowe) that gets involved with a wealthy, but unstable, family.Raymond Chandlers' first novel was probably too complicated for the screen and the attempts to abridge and simplify it leave many holes and gaps, but if you ignore this you cannot mark it down as anything less than a film noir classic.The look and Bogart take it the material to another league. Warner Brothers, it is alleged, didn't like spending too much on sets and directors frightened of being too obvious used low lighting and smoke to try and blur the edges. This creates a look that many with bigger budgets have seeked to emulate. Here we are almost in a dream world - or maybe more accurately, a nightmare world.Death is never far away and anyone not needed for plot purposes is soon found with a bullet in them. There is one scene where no one actually knows how somebody ended up dead - but this is mere window dressing in this dark and dangerous world.Bogart is without doubt the best thriller actor of all time. Not conventionally handsome or even vocally versatile his acting remains strangely modern and natural. Ambiguous about all matters from sudden death to good manners - he is, strangely, neither hero nor anti-hero. However we believe he will do the right thing as events unfold.His reaction to danger is strange and almost manic: Point a gun at him and he wll smile, tell him a joke and he won't. Not that he is without dry humour or a sharp one liner. Here - like many of his films - he is a veneer stripper, tearing down the outer to get to the reality underneath.In today's film world sex, violence and greed can be tackled head-on and shown in as much detail as the director cares. In the 1940's things had to be eluded to, hinted at and even talked about in code. Sex and sexual desire seems emotions to be repressed rather than indulged in. As dangerous as Russian roulette and often having the same outcome. You are going to get lost watching this film. You can't do anything else. Given the fact that many of the points that are small and could have been cleared up with a line or a small scene it makes you wonder why.Maybe it is an attempt to confuse the censor or just trying to be true to the original material. Who knows? Those that want to own this film will get more out of it than most as they gain extra clues by multiple viewings - although this won't put you right on all matters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Big Sleep Has Me Wide Awake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Howard Hawks' 1946 adaptation of Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep is a witty and sufficient conversion of literature to film. The black and white picture serves Chandler's novel much justice. The lead roles are distributed to two talented and experienced actors.Humphrey Bogart depicts a sarcastic and smart mouthed private eye named Marlowe, whereas the female lead of a wealthy daughter, Mrs Rutledge, with a sneaky lifestyle, is brought to life by Lauren Bacall. The film grabs your attention from the moment the first frame appears. The plot is rather complicated, it is filled with murders, gambling, love, blackmail, affairs, every sin in the book holds true in this film. Although the plot is rather confusing at times, the actors display of the characters provides enough motive for the audience to follow the extensive plot. Chandler's novel is full of murder and mystery, betrayal and deception, these aspects give Hawks' a plethora of material and scenes to create. Bogart presents a strong representation of a intelligent and analytical private eye. Murders occur left and right, six in total, and Marlowe breaks down and solves every one. His sarcastic approach and nonchalant persona leave viewers attached and interested in Marlowe's every action and his next moves. Hawks' direction is strong and artistic.The costuming and set decoration add to the ambiance of the film. Bacall left me breathless. She is truly the beauty and the love story of the film. Bacall's gorgeous face and sensual voice allow men and women alike to be entangled in her dialogue and consumed by her angelic looks. At the end of the film I was truly pleased with Hawks' portrayal of Chandler's classic mystery novel. I feel as though anyone who takes the time to watch this movie will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

As Bill Cosby says in the TCM ads "No cusswords" I would not like the Hays Office back but the positive side is that it made the film makers and writers creative.

		<fullReview>Bogart is at his finest - the private eye persona softened just a bit from Sam Spade. The plot is as anyone will know pretty well incomprehensible. For once though this hardly matters. My only reservation is that Lauren Bacall, never much of an actress, rather overdoes the sultriness. Still a classic. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Dialogue and Great Acting by Bogie &amp; Bacall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie of all time. The screenplay dialogue was written by William Faulkner who was one of the greatest American authors and the lines are delivered with a crisp one-two punch. The acting between Bogie and Bacall (B&amp;B) contains a chemistry seldom seen on the screen or stage. For instance, when B&amp;B first meet at General Sternwood's mansion and she invites him to her room for a drink and trying to get info from him. The dialogue between them sizzles with controlled raw emotions. Howard Hawks directing keeps the plot moving along with new characters appearing and disappearing throughout the movie. The supporting cast also rises up to the level of B&amp;B and does a superb job. This is one of the first movies to deal with the issues of drug addiction and how people are used and abused because of their enslavement to drugs. The plot itself is very convoluted and you have to follow it closely to catch all the nuances and connections. I also like this movie so much because Humphrey Bogart is my favorite actor of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>**** out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard Hawks performed a great feat by managing to take a convoluted, confusing plot and craft it into a great masterpiece. "The Big Sleep" is often criticized because the plot is so extremely confusing, but I thought it was great. The story follows private detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart), who is hired by a rich general to investigate the blackmailing that is happening to his daughter Carmen (Martha Vickers). Also entangled in the story is her sister, Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Bacall). The story gets so complicated that it would take far more than one short review to explain the basics of it.Despite the confusing plot, "The Big Sleep" is frequently hailed as being great simply because of its direction and atmosphere. Quintessential film-noir, it has the dialogue, the characters, and the lighting that embody every great film-noir. With the exception of "The Maltese Falcon", perhaps no other film-noir has captured all of these elements so perfectly.The plot keeps a hold on the viewer throughout the film. While it's only natural to try and figure it out as it goes along, it's not really necessary to try to hard because it all resolves itself in the end. Just sit back and enjoy one of the most superbly directed, incredibly entertaining pieces of film-noir ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's true, the plot of this film is a bit convoluted. But that doesn't really matter, in that everything else is just so much fun to watch. Bogey is unparalleled here. Awesome. Every single other cast member nails their role, whether large or small. A few minor quibbles: I can see how the Hays Office required some bowdlerizing of Chandler's book. (Which I haven't read.) I don't know if Chandler's Marlowe was tremendously good-looking, but Bogey was not, and having every single female salivating over him was a bit much. I'll bet it was a lot of fun to shoot, though. (for him) This is a must-see film, and I can't believe I've lived this long without seeing it. Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film works on two levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On one hand, this film is a simple, straight-forward, Hollywood star vehicle for Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. On the other hand, there is actually a really strong story here, very well told, with good performances, a great script, and more than enough twists to keep even the most jaded viewer puzzled.To go along with these two levels are two versions of the film. The theatrical version, released in 1946, was significantly re-edited to put more attention on the combination of Bogart and Bacall. At the time, Bacall was a hot property with a shaky future. Her career was on the edge, and she needed "The Big Sleep" to succeed in order to cement her standing in Hollywood. But remember, this is the studio system. Warner Bros. was even more concerned about her career than she was. So, when the film was originally completed, red flags flew up all over the place, and people were scared that it would kill her career. There needed to be more sexy dialogue between Bacall and Bogart. The romance angle between the two of them had to be played up much more. It's what the audience expected, and if you give them something other than that, even if it's good, the film will fail. And for the love of God, get rid of the bloody veil. Unfortunately, something of the story was lost. "The Big Sleep" has a seriously complicated and confusing storyline. The 1946 theatrical version adds to the problem. That's why (call me a philistine) I prefer the 1945 pre-release version. Yes, you heard me right. I'd happily give up a silly, pointless conversation about horses to get that scene in the D.A.'s office.Look, I'm a fan of Bogart's. I really am. But no one is going to pretend he's the greatest actor in the world. I happen to think he's under-rated, personally, but he's still no great shakes. Better than Keanu Reeves, nowhere near Anthony Hopkins. And Bacall... well, she's not nearly as good as Bogart. The great strength of this film is the script and the story. There's lots of great dialogue. There are loads of colorful, devious, fascinating characters. There is a fantastic, clever, and meticulously plotted story. Why undercut all of those things to devote more screen time to Bogart/Bacall? Don't get me wrong, I'm not questioning the wisdom of the studio's decision. They needed a star vehicle, so they made it a star vehicle, and it worked. The judgement of history has to be with Warner Bros. But Warner Bros. had a different set of criteria to make their decision. They were worried about money... box-office receipts for this film, and the future marketability of Lauren Bacall. But I don't care about that. I'm just interested in the better film, and the pre-release version, in my opinion, is clearly the better film. I do have one question, though... who killed Owen Taylor? The conventional wisdom is that it was Joe Brody. But watch the scene in Brody's apartment again. Remember, this is a Hollywood detective movie from the mid-forties. The scene clearly plays as though Brody didn't Taylor, and it certainly appears that Marlowe believes Brody on this point. If it really was Brody, then this scene ends up looking weak. If Taylor killed himself (highly doubtful, considering the evidence), that's even more weak. Oh well. It's really a quibble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bacall Et Bogie at it Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Big Sleep(1946) was to originally to be released in 1944 and was previewed to a small audience in a 116 minute cut. Due to the filmmakers dissatifaction of the cut the film was shelved for two years and rereleased two years later with more emphasis on Bogart and Bacall instead of plot elements. The 1944 version claifies who murdered who and the motive for the murders. Also, Eddie Mar's wife is played by a different actress in the 1944 version than the 1946 version. This edition is interesting to watch as comparison to the 1946 version.After changes were made and a new focus was created, The Big Sleep became more a film of the foreplay of Bogart and Bacall with the plot as secondary. The 1946 Edition of The Big Sleep became one of the greatest film Noirs in movie history. In this cut the chain of murders are more complex and the plot is a string of labyrinth doors. A couple of scenes were dropped and replaced with new scenes to the filmmakers likings. The talk between Phillip Marlowe and Bernie Ohis is longer is this version.The constant foreplay throughout the film between Phillip Marlowe and Vivian Sternwood Rutledge is the main memorable aspect of The Big Sleep(1946). Most of it was real due to the fact that the actors playing the parts married each other during filming. The relationship is full of the usual trademarks from the director concerning a man and a woman. Exceeds the level of foreplay shown in the couple's previous pairing in To Have and Have Not(1944). I enjoyed this part of the film and thought the filmmakers were right in making the changes they made.One of the ten confusing masterpieces of all time. Confusing in the sense of the murderer or motive of a chain reaction of violence. Some of the plot elements of The Big Sleep were so confusing that even the writer of the Original novel had trouble knowing who did what. Probably has to be watched more than three times to try to get a clear understanding of what's going on. The plot confusion of this pic has become part of Hollywood legend.Like many great Noir pictures the plot of this one is surrounded by a labyrinth of tangling proportions. Need a machete to cut through the thick plot lines to know what's going on. A great labyrinth mystery is not the answer but finding the way to the solution. Bad labyrinth mysteries lead to nowhere but endless questions and little interest in the process of going through the mystery. The complexities of the story is what makes The Big Sleep(1946) intriguing.The sexually charged horse race talk between Bogart and Bacall is a classic scene of film history. Use of subtle references make the scene more juicy and less obvious. The erotic nature of dialogue between the two actors is well disguised. Examplifies the on screen persona of the Bogie-Bacall relationship. A highlight of dialogue in film that is hard to top.Canino is a Howard Hawks villain that's is a unforgettable character. In the few scenes he appears in he fills the screen with a sadistic presence. None more memorable than with the count to three like the movie speech he makes to Harry Jones. Bob Steele plays Canino with a breeze of coolness and gusto. Canino enters and exists the screen in memorable fashion.The Big Sleep(1946) is one of three masterpieces by Howard Hawks made back to back to back. The first meeting between Phillip Marlowe and Mrs. Rutledge is one of my favorite scenes. Dario Argento would play homage to his moment even paraphasing some of the dialogue in Cat O'Nine Tails(1970). The writers involved in the picture were some of the best in film and literature. Humphrey Bogart perfects even further the persona of the romantic rough guy in trench coat.Gets a fine film score from the always reliable Max Steiner. Dorothy Malone is fine in the one scene she has in The Big Sleep(1946). Philip Marlowe unlike Sam Spade has a more friendly relationship with the District Attorney and Assistent District Attorney. Lauren Bacall brings with her the charisma and coolness that made her a star in To Have &amp; Have Not(1944). John Ridgely is calm but tough as the main heavy Eddie Mars.One memorable is the opening introduction between Private Detective Philip Marlowe and Carmen Sternwood. Another memorable moment is the negotiation tactics between Marlowe and a blackmailer in a hotel room. The beginning of this scene is a replay of the climatic moment in the hotel of To Have and Have Not(1944). A third memorable moment takes place after a part of the plot has been cleared up. A final memorable moment is the telephone game played by Marlowe and Mrs. Rutledge on the Police.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best Bogie movies. It has more twists and turns than a pretzel factory. As Philip Marlowe, Bogie gives one of his best performances as the honest Private Eye up against the corruption and deceit of the Sternwood family and their "acquaintances". Lauren Bacall is charming and sexy as Vivian, Bogies main love interest. But who's side is she on? Martha Vickers effectively plays Bacall's younger spoiled sister whom Marlowe frequently encounters in his quest for the truth.John Ridgely appears as Eddie Mars the chief villain of the piece. Veterans Elisha Cook Jr. (Harry Jones), Regis Toomey (Bernie) and Louis Jean Heydt (Joe Brody) contribute solid performances in their roles. A special mention for veteran "B" movie cowboy Bob Steele for his chilling performance as the cold-blooded killer Canino. Steele was always more effective when playing a villain and gave excellent performances when playing in the occasional "A" feature. (Check him out in "Of Mice and Men" (1940)).At the beginning of the film, Marlowe is hired to find out what happened to his former aide Sean Regan. After all the twists and turns in the plot and the numerous bodies do we ever find out who actually DID kill Sean Regan?A classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful movie. It has a lot of great dialogue in it, some written by Raymond Chandler (I've heard a number of mistakenly attribute the scene leading up to and including the first visit with the general as being by Faulkner, but it's all in the book), and some by Faulkner (the "horse racing" innuendo). The plot is Byzantine, and at times incomprehensible, but it just adds to the charm. It's got a lot of "modern" vices, (drugs, gambling, blackmail, pornography, and murder), but it treats them in a way that makes them all seem sort of quaint.The performances are all very good, especially Bogart's. If you haven't seen this movie, and you like "old movies", you are in for a treat. (If you like incomprehensible plots, you should see "The Kennel Murder Case" -- the detective's exposition when he's figured everything out is priceless...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remains one of the all time great films. What is interesting is that the year before it was released (1945)Hawks showed US troops a first version of the film. In itself it was much tighter, more faithful to the original novel, and most significantly, had less of the steamy Bogart and Bacall sequences.The troops said that they wanted more of her, it was said that there was a need for more atmosphere in the film. This was noted by hawks, who then re edited and shot the film into the version that is known today. What he created was a near perfect example of what became known as "film noir". Chandler, the novel's author, when asked what he thought of the film replied in his curious mixture of English/american (he was born and educated in Dulwich, Sth London) "wonderful, but who did it?". What Chandler said is a valid point, but to be honest, who cares?What Hawks created was a masterpiece of style, atomsphere and dialogue. Bogart was rarely better than this, and Bacall simply oozed sexual tension. As ever there was good support, but this was not an ensemble piece like "Casablanca", the film rightly belongs to the two leads. I've read the book and seen all three movie versions, but even now, I struggle to say, who did it. All I know is that it was a great film, and we will never see its like again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With Bogey and Bacall, who needs a plot you can follow?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogey and Bacall in a noir thriller not to be missed. Humphrey Bogart plays Philip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler's famous character. Lauren Bacall is Mrs. Rutledge. Between the two of them they comprise one of the hardest romantic couples I've ever seen. In the midst of the bizarre black mail and murder case, they fall in love. "I'm in love with you I guess" they say to each other. Harsh.In my younger days I would have celebrated this as content over form, substance over style. But it serves to remind that they truly don't make them like this anymore. Written in part by William Faulkner this is a movie you actually have to listen to. This contrasts with so many movies today -- the scripts are so bad you can nap for 10 minutes and not miss anything important. I actually saw "That Thing You Do" on a plane and did not spring the $3 for the earphones. I didn't miss a thing. Someone who had seen the movie asked me to tell them the story and, except for not knowing people's names, I could relay the entire story.But this is a movie carried by stars, not effects. I was almost surprised to see someone riddled by a machine gun and not even get a tear in their jacket. There are no exotic locations, no special effect. Yet the movie is gripping, drawing you in, daring you to figure things out as fast as Marlowe does. I could not keep up. Marlowe is also the smartest P.I. I've seen in a while. He throws a punch or two, but violence is not his tool. His tool is information. He gathers it, he keeps it, and he uses it (modern businessmen would say "leverages" it) to outmaneuver his opponents. Bacall is magical, as the steely and stunning Mrs. Rutledge. She does not scream or faint or cry once (except when asked to as part of a ruse). She holds her own and more. Watch for her as she half sits, half lays in Marlowe's car as they drive home from a casino. It's about time the love interest holds her won with the hero.Bogart's quick impersonation of a snobbish book collector alone makes seeing this a must.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is widely recognized as one of the best films ever made by film critics, movie fans, and film directors. There is almost nothing bad you can say about the film, the acting is superb with Bogart romancing his (soon-to-be) wife Lauren Bacall. Other fine acting is by Martha Vickers (the crazy older sister) and John Ridgely as the slimy Eddie Mars. They are accompanied by a fine collection of character actors who play their roles to perfection. The setting, Los Angeles just after World War II is a city of dreams and nightmares, sometimes both at the same time. The dialog sparkles. The violence is brutal and emotional. People gun other people down but it means something. The final confrontation between Bogart and Eddie Mars has an emotional intensity that few other films reach. The director, Howard Hawks, is now regarded as one of the greatest film directors of all time. There is not a wasted shot or misplayed scene in the film.The only problem with the film is that the plot is very complex and not well explained in the film. After seeing the film two or three times most things will be clear but even the screen-writer (William Faulkner) when asked to explain who killed a minor character allegedly exclaimed "how the hell should I know?".The scenes between Bogart and Bacall are priceless, they virtually define term "good screen chemistry" between an actor and an actress in a film. This film marked the continuation of a relationship which Bogart and Bacall had struck up during the filming of "To Have and Have Not". After that film, Bogart (who was married to another woman) broke off their love affair. However, they couldn't resist each other when they were cast together in this film. Bogart divorced and married Bacall following this film.</fullReview>

The on screen chemistry between Bogart and his co-star, Lauren Bacall was perfect and was seamless through the movie.Even though I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, I did have to issues. The first is being that the plot was all over the places and things were happening in many different places so it was hard to follow smoothly.

Humphrey Bogart's character(Philip Marlowe) takes the audience along in his head throughout the entire movie. This first person point of view keeps the movie entertaining; for you know no more than the main character while he's finding clues and solving the case. Being as how the movie was made during the reign of the production code there were rules on the content that was and wasn't allowed to be in the film including excessive violence, sex, drugs use, etc. The film was well made despite the strict regulations.

		<fullReview>Philip Marlowe is a private eye hired by an elderly general to find out who's blackmailing him over gambling debts owed by his wayward daughter. Marlowe traces the threat to a bookstore owner, who soon winds up dead. Delving deeper, Marlowe links the stiff to a prominent mobster. As bodies start to multiply, can Marlowe figure who's crossing who ?I will confess straight off that despite multiple viewings I never really understand what's going on in this movie. Famously nobody was ever sure who killed the chauffeur (I think it's Joe Brody) but I also don't really understand the blackmail scam, why the kid shoots Brody, the dirt Eddie Mars has on Vivian or why Mars' wife goes along with it. There are answers to these questions, but the movie is so beguiling with its fancy-pants dialogue, crazy characters and seemingly contradictory moments that it's best to just surrender to its stylish charm. Whilst I reckon I marginally prefer Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon, this is Bogart firing on all cylinders; tough guy, funny, romantic and sharp as nails, his jaded gumshoe qualities perfectly counterpointed by Bacall's elegance - the scene where they give the police dispatcher the runaround is classic banter. The supporting cast are the most lovable bunch of scheming white-knuckled grifters you'd never want to meet, with Vickers (as the spoilt hussy), Cook (as the unlucky bloodhound) and Darrin (as the devious bookstore clerk) all standout. Hawks is in complete command of the movie's grammar, carefully setting up all the key scenes for the maximum payoff and dazzling us with clever touches and a heady brew of mystery, potboiler and romance. My favourite line (and one of the best comebacks in all cinema) is, "I don't mind if you don't like my manners. I don't like them myself. They're pretty bad. I grieve over them on long winter evenings.". Brilliantly scripted by William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman, based on the 1939 hardboiled classic novel by Raymond Chandler.

		<shortDescription>Howard Hawks's Classic Film Noir.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Big Sleep" (1946), is a classic-era Film Noir directed by the great Howard Hawks. Having read the book on which it was based on by Raymond Chandler, I knew that certain aspects would have to be gotten rid of as they simply wouldn't have passed the Hays Office. Perhaps these things that were left out (such as what Geiger's book store really was) helped confuse people even more while watching an adaptation of an already (enjoyably) convoluted book. But the plot in this movie comes a long second to the Noir atmosphere that Hawks conjures up. He really pins down what Noir is all about, full of femme fatales, heavies and dark, brooding camera-work. Humphrey Bogart as Private Detective Philip Marlowe may not physically resemble the character in the novels, but he catches the spirit of Marlowe that few others did (Dick Powell in "Farewell My Lovely" AKA "Murder, My Sweet" (1944) is perhaps the only other actor who did) and his chemistry with Lauren Becall as Vivian Rutledge (Reagen in the novel), the oldest daughter of the dieing General Sternwood (Charles Waldron), who hires Bogart to take a blackmailer off his back, is quite extraordinary. Also, Martha Vickers as the wild, wild Carmen Sternwood is brilliant. The opening scene she has with Bogart is unbelievable sexy and pins down the flavour of the book. It is indeed a great shame that Howard Hawks never made another Noir, as this is supreme example of th genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hanging out with Marlowe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Big Sleep's plot may get frustratingly incomprehensible at times with a myriad of sub plots and suspects but Howard Hawks brisk direction, William Faulkner and Leigh Brackett's crisp dialog from Raymond Chandler's classic pulp and Humphrey Bogart's unflappable cool make getting lost a lot of fun in what is arguably the apogee of the American detective film. Convoluted as the script is we get to shadow Bogart's Philip Marlowe (who is in every scene) just a step ahead of us, his hunches and Epiphanies developing in real time. Marlowe is hired by the aged and infirmed General Sternwood to find out who is blackmailing him over the wild ways of his young daughters. Things immediately go awry however when the blackmailer is murdered with others soon to follow. From its intriguing first scenes at the Sternwood mansion The Big Sleep sweeps you away on a wild goose chase that is more about the journey than the destination. Marlowe is the consummate PI as he doggedly pursues leads trying to remain dispassionate to keep his mind clear and while he's game for a no string's attached hook up with a book store clerk he finds himself falling for Sternwood's older daughter even though she's still a murder suspect.With most of the film shot in heavily atmospheric interiors (fully utilized by Hawks) very little of the Big Sleep sees the light of day. By making the viewer identify with Marlowe, Hawks forces you to pay attention to every shot and detail. Camera movement is minimal but telling. Some leads go nowhere and loose ends remain so keeping the audience guessing and allowing the film to maintain a consistently high level of suspense.As Marlowe, Bogart is in the prime of his career and his element. Cold, confident and suspicious his sardonic clipped delivery engages everyone he encounters in verbal duels that reveal and amuse. Lauren Bacall as the sultry alluring older daughter seems to be the only one able to slow him down but even she is not immune from his third degree and this makes for some memorable jousting. Every other character of significance from Martha Vickers thumb sucking recreational drug using sister of Bacall to Tom Steele's cold blooded Canino fit their roles perfectly. As he did with Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday, Hawks balances the sparring and Marlowe gets as well as he gives with a variety of mugs, dames and a butler. The Big Sleep is a confluence of iconic American film elements running on all cylinders. With an abundance of qualities interwoven into its complex plot it invites repeated viewings not only to get answers but to appreciate on different levels as well. It's an American classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Dorothy Malone. One of the best of the so-called film noirs, which we called murder mysteries back in the day. Clinched Bogey and Bacall as superstars. Made a STAR of Malone in one 10 minutes scene. High school, fountain cherry cokes, movie magazines and Bogey and Bacall. Didn't get any better. To this day, I don't think there is a coherent synopsis of this story. But it is the best at atmosphere, dialog, and stars chemistry. I have to watch it every year or so and every time, I just have a smile on my face. 9/10 That final line of Bogarts "what's the matter with you?" and the look he gives 'Baby' is what is now called HOT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ya gotta love it, no matter how confusing it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years, I thought I was going out of my mind every time I saw this classic detective story/film noir. Each time it screened on TV, it seemed to be different. New scenes would crop up; scenes I was certain I had seen in the past were suddenly missing. And always, the plot made no real sense.Blame it all on Lauren Bacall. She'd been a huge hit in "To Have and to Have Not," playing opposite Bogart in her screen debut. So Warners, eager to capitalize on her natural sex appeal, had rushed her into another film, "Confidential Agent," where she played opposite Charles Boyer. They, it turned out, had no chemistry and the picture bombed. But by the time that had happened, Bogie and Betty had wrapped Bacall's third film, "The Big Sleep." So Warners held up its release so they could shoot some new scenes that would make Bacall look good.The result was that a couple of different versions of this classic exist today and when you toss in the cutting for TV, you wind up with a mishmash of scenes that leave you guessing as to what the film is all about, who killed whom, and how could writers of the caliber of Raymond Chandler (author of the original novel) William Faulkner and Jules Furthman come up with this mess.My favorite scene takes place at the rural gambling casino operated by Eddie Mars. There, in a side room, we come upon Bacall singing an obviously heavily rehearsed song with a whole group of backup singers providing harmony. There is no prior reference to Bacall's character being a singer and no further reference to her song in the rest of the movie.But the real stunner is Eddie Mars' blond wife, played in her one and only scene toward the end of the film, by different actresses in the two main versions of the film.Never mind. This picture has lots of crackling good Howard Hawks style dialogue and a great, slick Warners film noir atmosphere. Both Bogie and Betty are at the top of their games and are surrounded by great supporting players, from Dorothy Malone to Elisha Cook Jr and B-Western star Bob Steele, who was positively scary when he played a modern day killer.Watch this one, because try as they might, nobody does this kind of work today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original and best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Raymond Chandler, but the other adaptations of his work that I've seen did not impress: Robert Mitchum was too old to play Phillip Marlowe (the essence of Chandler's detective is that he is prematurely weary); while Elliot Gould played almost an anti-Marlowe in Robert Altman's film. So it's a delight to see Howard Hawks' interpretation, true to the spirit of the books, with Humphrey Bogart capturing the Marlowe character perfectly: outwardly cynical (and very funny), inwardly a man deeply upset by a world in which some men call the big shots while everyone else has to hustle for a dollar. The female characters (most notably Lauren Bacall's) also reflect Marlowe's attitudes to women, which are not always edifying but which are part of the fabric of Chandler's world. Even more surprisingly, the film sticks almost to the letter of Chandler's labyrinthine plot. Of course, in such an old film, there are always going to be limitations: the action scenes are fairly lame, and the soundtrack is intrusive (although as the film progressed, I learnt to ignore it and enjoyed the movie more as a result). Of course, Chandler is so much imitated that the shadow of parody lies heavy over modern attempts to recreate his work; better stick to the original, and best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our Best Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since most American film directors have rated this as one of the great films, it should be even higher in your list. The combination of our best American writers, Raymond Chandler and William Faulkner, and Bogart in the only time he did Marlowe, along with Bacall and the witty dialogue and convoluted plot and atmosphere, rank this as perhaps the best American noir. Anyone who doesn't recognize that should not watch anything made before 1980 because they don't have a clue as to noir or great films. What do you want me to do? Learn how to stutter? There is no better example of the darkish quality of humanity and noir film-making, with the exception of "The Maltese Falcon" or "Out of the Past," but Bogart is the greatest of our hard-boiled detectives, and the 40s talk exemplifies how men should react in life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Big Sleep is one of the most confusing detective movies i've ever seen there are so many plot twists and coincidences that it demands a 2nd viewing, but you certainly wont mind that when you get drawn into Marlowes world.The plot maybe a bit all over the place but it's the on screen chemistry of Bacall and Bogart that make this such a well remembered classic. Bogart in particular was born to play Marlowe and he spits out Raymond Chandlers hard boiled dialogue like no one else could.Marlowe is in a way a forerunner of James Bond every woman wants him and every man wants to be him. In the world of Phillip Marlowe every dame is beautiful even the librarians and taxi drivers, and of course they all fall in love with him! Bacall is the femme fatale and surely one of the sexiest movie characters of all time.With a supporting cast of goons, gamblers, dames and hustlers the Big Sleep hurtles along at a storming pace and the two hour running time seems to just disappear. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves great movies, but particularly to those into Film Noir and detective movies. In my humble opinion this just shades it for me over the Maltese Falcon.A classic detective story, the original Sin City - 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart At His Dominant Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart is at his best and is featured in every scene. His understated delivery of Philip Marlowe makes The Big Sleep a film noir classic. Lauren Bacall is her sexy, sultry self. Her vocal of "Her Tears Fell Like Wine" rivals any performance of her award winning career. The Bogart and Bacall combination closed on a very high note. Howard Hawks was at his best as director. Not one character - credited or uncredited - turns in a bad performance. The only negative is that the plot is very complicated. This film must be seen more than once to be fully appreciated. Raymond Chandler's fine story may have too many twists. However, the screen writing - led by William Faulkner - is crisp and deserves repeated exposure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rather like this film. But, I found one thing extremely annoying. Max Steiner's music is cartoonish, not suspenseful. In fact, the music is more appropriate for a comedy. Surely, The Big Sleep is not a comedy or satire. I don't think I'm so stupid as to miss that intention. So, I don't get the comic music with a serious mystery. I found the horns every time Lauren Bacall makes a smart remark to be especially irritating.The odd part is that in the silly phone call to the police, there's no music - comic or otherwise.I'd like to know if others find the music odd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phillip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) gets involved with the Sternwood family (including Lauren Bacall) and finds himself neck-deep in murder.The plot is impossible to summarize--it's ALL over the map. They tried to adapt a great but very difficult novel and were determined to keep everything in--and as much as the censors would allow. There were drastic changes before it was released (some of the Bogart/Bacall scenes were added and the censor demanded several cuts)...but it still came out great! The movie moves a breakneck speed--you have to pay close attention to it at every moment. This movie is so incredibly convoluted it almost demands multiple viewings. I've only seen it once and I agree--I loved it but I'm still not sure what exactly happened! There are beatings, shootouts and tons of twists and turns. It's also full of the most incredible dialogue I've ever heard. Every line has double meanings and the cast speaks VERY quickly. There's also some hilarious sexual dialogue between Bogart and Bacall--listen for the lines about horses! The acting is just great. Bogart IS Marlowe--he gets the character down perfectly. Bacall is drop dead sexy and very good in a difficult role. Also her and Bogart play off each other perfectly--it's no wonder their scenes were beefed up. Actually no one is really bad in this film--that's quite an accomplishment with such a large cast.Easily one of the best film noirs ever filmed and a must see! I give this a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howard Hawks has crafted a wonderful noir-style picture with "The Big Sleep". This is the type of film that could only be told in beautiful black and white. The shadows that fall over the faces and scenery are breath-taking.Bogart is Philip Marlowe a private investigator who works for the unbelievably sum of $25 per day, plus expenses. He more or less is playing his Sam Spade character from "The Maltese Falcon" with a little Harry Morgan from Hawks' "To Have and Have Not" thrown in for good measure. But this is the type of movie and role that no one does better than Bogart.Bacall is as smoking hot in this film as she was in "To Have and Have Not". She radiates sensuality, and knows it. But really, she should not be singing.One of my favorite bits in this movie is the fact that every woman who comes in contact with Bogart is beautiful and acts kittenish towards him. Whether it's a cab driver, book seller or cigarette girl, they all want him.The screenplay by William Faulkner is involved and often times confusing. There is a lot of dialogue to listen to, and yet it still feels as though some part of the story or exposition is being left out. Perhaps this is explained in the deleted scenes. A lot of characters that are interrelated, and many sets that look similar also add to the confusion.But the performances and brilliant direction more than make up for any shortfalls in the script. You will want to see "The Big Sleep" more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bogey and Bacall's follow-up to "To Have or Have Not" pays off big time! Great suspense and star chemistry, blistering dialogue (largely thanks to the master, Leigh Brackett) and a violent, pessimistic view of the world make this one of the best of its type. Very stylistic (as opposed to realist) direction and tone. The story doesn't make too much sense (in its initial release version), but that's OK, too. DVD now allows us to see both versions of the film on one disc -- thank heavens for good technology! Hawks claims that in order to lower Bacall's voice to a suitable tone, he asked her to drive her car to the top of one of Hollywood's adjoining canyons and scream at the top of her lungs every night. Looks like it paid off, because her husky delivery is even more effective here than in her previous film with Bogey and Hawks. She shows a lot more chops than in her efforts without that very masculine pair. As for Bogart, he carrier Chandler's classic antihero with dignity and panache, playing (as usual) the straight man to a set of unnerving circumstances and situations. For a small guy, he can definately carry off the tough act. Here he's created one of the silver screen's most unforgettable tough guy portrayals, not again equalled until perhaps Clint Eastwood's turn in "Fistful of Dollars."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often Chaotic But Fun to Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although often chaotic, "The Big Sleep" is fun to watch. The long list of interesting characters makes a fine showcase for Bogart, Bacall, and a good supporting cast. Excellent dialogue and Howard Hawks' expert pacing more than make up for a plot that is sometimes confusing and rarely plausible (but always interesting as well).Bogart plays detective Philip Marlowe, from Raymond Chandler's novel. He gets entangled in an investigation that involves blackmail, several murders, and just about everything else. There is an awful lot going on, and even after watching this a couple of times, it's still tough to figure out all the details. Even when it is clear what is happening, it is usually also clear that the characters make some pretty weird decisions. But the characters themselves are more important than who shot whom, and watching these fine actors and a great director at work makes you feel part of their world.This is an entertaining film that most fans of classic movies will enjoy - just watch it for the entertainment value, and don't analyze the plot too much.</fullReview>

This detective-film noir classic has more action than most do, and its a good thing because it needs it. This is no Double Indemnity or Out of The Past. Plot is its weakest point. The way things are filmed is its strongest. And both Bogart and Bacall are very very good here.

		<fullReview>What a beautifully crafted piece of entertainment! I first saw this as a youngster on UK BBC2 Christmas Day 1977 and it blew me away; at 18 I thought how something so apparently ancient and hackneyed could be so engrossing and powerful? It led me on to some highs: reading the complete works of Raymond Chandler ? decades ago I actually held an original Black Mask in my hands but unfortunately not even a fraction of the asking price as well; and lows: watching the abysmal 1978 movie remake. Humphrey Bogart &amp; Lauren Bacall under the Warner Bros arc-lights were a marvellous addition to Chandler's world, even if Chandler's world was somewhat toned down by Hollywood. Michael Winner was not a desirable addition at all, and as usual a Loser.Fiendishly complex tale condensed and mashed up from two short stories has youngest daughter of a rich old man being blackmailed for porn pictures taken of her when high on drugs, while the elder daughter is ravelled up with a rather vicious hood and his henchmen. Bogart as Phillip Marlow (and cute Doghouse Riley) Private Detective comes in promising to clear up the mess by getting the blackmailer off the rich old man's back ? or was it to find the rich old man's missing friend Shaun Regan instead? All the set pieces roll by: General Sternwood's sauna, all the confusing visits to Geiger's quaint house, the Ben-Hur episodes. And Bogie and his sexy pal Malone in the ACME Book Shop ? on the strength of this I even got a first edition of The Wire Cutters by M E M Davis which if you notice was momentarily on display at the end of the section ? but not at the start, and also the Dumas offer near the shop doorway was apparently over and done with at the climax of those few beautiful minutes. Some nice time spent with their funny senses of humour in Joe Brody's flat led to a loud murder and chase; fun and games at Eddie Mars' joint; while acidic Agnes' new friend little Harry chokingly finding nothing funny at all is imho one of Cinema's most poignant moments ever. Canino was a baddie you'd surely feel too scared to hiss at. The music from Max Steiner and the production from Howard Hawks were something to applaud though, the brooding electric atmosphere brilliantly captured onto nitrate black and white.There's two versions of the film available: the first version I saw was the 1945, it was always available ? was I confused years later seeing the 1946 Bacall remix the first time without realising it! I wish my VHS copy of the TCM-UCLA recording from the '90's hadn't bit the dust as it was invaluable in listing and dryly explaining all the big and little differences.As with the question posed in Kane, what does it all add up to? There's so much happening it's legendary confusion is not surprising. A seamy Los Angeles was only envisaged from various Warners sound stages, however Shakespeare could realistically tell stories from around the world from only one stage. But surely Time has already proved this was a masterpiece, and in many people's opinions still one of the best motion pictures ever made. It's one of my top 5 favourite films of all time watched umpteen times over the decades, nowhere near perfect but an utterly superb poetic potboiler recommended in spite of a rather large body count and because of a rather large entertainment count.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming old film, but it doesn't capture the grim atmosphere of Chandler's writing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Big Sleep" was a Bogart/Bacall vehicle first and a Raymond Chandler adaptation second. The master of detective fiction was pragmatic about this: he didn't care for the romantic storyline, but acknowledged that "in Hollywood you cannot make a picture which is not essentially a love story, that is to say, a story in which sex is paramount." And he enjoyed Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of private detective Philip Marlowe, calling Bogie "the genuine article." (See Frank MacShane's "The Life of Raymond Chandler" for more about the troubled relationship between Chandler and Hollywood.) While Bogart does make a great Marlowe, the romantic aspect of the film *is* overemphasized and everything is a little too smooth-edged and tidy for its own good. The Los Angeles of the '30s and '40s just didn't look like this--and, more importantly, Chandler's books didn't feel like this. They were full of betrayal and disappointment and resignation, and it was precisely the author's willingness to confront these less pleasant facts of human existence that elevated his work above mere genre writing. Having said all that, "The Big Sleep" is an enjoyable film (miles better than anything Hollywood is grinding out today, certainly), and a few scattered scenes remain true to Chandler. Could anyone but Elisha Cook Jr., after all, have played down-at-the-heels but noble Harry Jones? And there are sexy dames to spare: my favorite is the luscious Dorothy Malone as a bookstore proprietress whose beauty is ill-concealed by a pair of pince nez glasses and a prim little outfit. On the other hand, there are a few things I absolutely hate--things which depart so far from Chandler's vision as to be ridiculous, like Lauren Bacall merrily singing 'And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine' ("She's a real sad tomato, she's a busted valentine!") at John Ridgely's casino. But the film is good on the whole and, again, it's more about Bogie and Bacall than it is about Chandler. With that in mind, even hardcore Chandler fanatics should get a kick out of this cool, breezy relic of a bygone age. (My personal favorite of all the cinematic interpretations of Raymond Chandler is the Paul Bogart-helmed "Marlowe", based on Chandler's fifth novel "The Little Sister" and starring James Garner as the immortal private eye. Still, this film didn't quite nail the Chandler vibe, either. It could be that he--like H.P. Lovecraft, another great American writer whose work transcended the narrow confines of its genre--is essentially unfilmable.) 6 and 1/2 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So What If It Doesn't Make Sense, It's First and Foremost Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard Hawks ranks as one of the least pretentious Hollywood filmmakers. In Todd McCarthy's biography, "Howard Hawks: The Grey Fox of Hollywood," Hawks summed up his philosophy about messages in his movies. "I never made a statement. Our job is to make entertainment." First and foremost, Hawks considered himself a storyteller. Second, actors and actress either adhered to Hawks' dictates or he wrote them out of scenes, sometimes movie entirely, and gave their action to others. Not surprisingly, when Hawks hired William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, and Jules Furthman to adapt mystery novelist Raymond Chandler's "The Big Sleep," he told them, "Don't monkey with the book?just make a script out of it. The writing is too good." Between 1944 and 1947, Chandler's shabby but heroic private eye Philip Marlowe appeared in four films, including "Murder, My Sweet" (1944), "The Big Sleep" (1946), "The Lady in the Lake" (1947), and "The Brasher Doubloon" (1947). During this period, Hollywood filmmakers made what French critics later called 'film noir' movies. Essentially, 'film noir' movies occurred at night either indoors or outdoors. The gritty black &amp; white photography stressed realism, while the low-key lighting forged haunting shadows that boded ill for the characters. Urban thrillers bore the marks of this movement. Flawed male heroes and the treacherous dames that trapped them in a web of intrigue populated these films. The atrocities of World War II and Nazi persecution of the Jews destroyed the innocence of American isolationism and created more mature movies where characters suffered from flaws. Although "The Big Sleep" fits into this oeuvre, Hawks shunned such artificial narrative gimmicks.In "The Big Sleep," Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) works for $25 a day and expenses. He uses his wits and fists to relieve the wealthy but crippled General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) of an extortionist. Sternwood has two daughters: a divorcée, Vivian Sternwood Rutledge (Lauren Bacall), and an undisciplined hellion Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers). Arthur Gwynn Geiger (Theodore Von Eltz) demands $5-thousand dollars from the General for a sheaf of gambling debts that bear Carmen's signature. No sooner has Marlowe gotten onto the case than an assailant shoots and kills Geiger. Marlowe enters Geiger's house moments after the murder and finds Carmen sitting in a nearby chair drugged out of her mind. He finds a concealed camera but the film has been removed. Marlowe discovers a black book of addresses and hustles Carmen back home. Marlowe's former boss, Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls (Regis Toomey) with the District Attorney's Office, pays him visits at home while Marlowe is examining the black book. Bernie informs him that a Sternwood limo has just been pulled out of the ocean with Owen Taylor, the Sternwood's chauffeur, dead behind the wheel. Ohls wants information. Marlowe explains the blackmail angle and later divulges what happened to Geiger, but he leaves Carmen's part out of the murder."The Big Sleep" qualifies as one of the most convoluted murder mysteries to emerge from Hollywood. Hawks and Bogart argued over the identity of who killed the Sternwood chauffeur. They called Chandler, but he could not conjure up a plausible answer to their question. Eventually, Hawks and his scenarists worked out a solution. The solution to Taylor's murder, however, remained hidden until 1995 when the original version of "The Big Sleep" was made available to the public. Originally, Warner Brothers showed the original to American troops overseas, but Jack L. Warner shelved the movie until after the war so the studio could release its other war-themed movies before the Axis surrendered. Meanwhile, Bacall had received abrasive reviews for her performance in "Confidential Agent" (1945), and her agent, a worried Charles Feldman, suggested Warner reshoot several scenes and invent new ones to showcase the insolence of Bacall's character. When Warner Brothers released "The Big Sleep" in 1946, Hawks had jettisoned the expository Taylor murder solution scene and added other scenes that would have been more appropriate in one of his screwball comedies. Ultimately, Marlowe solves the case, eliminates the villains, and woos Vivian, but the plot makes very little sense, which may account for the film's following. McCarthy quoted Hawks about the director's own perplexity: "I can't follow the story. I saw some of it on television the other night, and I'd listen to some of the things he'd talk about and it had me thoroughly confused because I hadn't seen it in twenty years." Incidentally, the title "The Big Sleep" refers to death. The first third of the action makes sense as Hawks and his writers establish the basics. The scene where General Sternwood meets Marlowe is pretty strange. The General suffers from a host of maladies and stews in a hothouse. He indulges in his vices by proxy, watching his visitors drink and smoke and sweat at the same time. The mediocre Burt Reynolds crime comedy "Shamus" reversed this scene and had its equivalent character living in a freezer. Anyway, Marlowe encounters a number of sexy ladies, including statuesque Martha Vickers as the looney Sternwood daughter who tries to sit in his lap while he is standing up. There's a funny scene when Marlowe masquerades as a homosexual in Geiger's book store. He flips up his fedora brim, puts on shades, and speaks with a lisp. Later, as if to reinforce Marlowe's red-blooded nature, he visits a book store across the street and the Acme Bookstore proprietress (Dorothy Malone) lets down his hair, locks store door, and shares a bottle of rye with Marlowe while it rains outside.Hawks may have been one of the earliest American filmmakers to ridicule Hollywood conventions. In a scene where a vicious gunsel, Lash Canino (Bob Steele), questions a man (Elisha Cook Jr.) at gunpoint, he threatens to shoot him and adds, "What do you want me to do, count to three like in the movies?" B-movie cowboy actor Bob Steele is terrific in his scenes! Don't miss "The Big Sleep."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Along with the original (Dick Powell) version of Farewell, My Lovely this initial adaptation of The Big Sleep is light years ahead of subsequent adaptations of Chandler novels - and it's highly debatable if the Michael Winner travesty of The Big Sleep should even be included in the set. Only those who have read and delighted in the book would perhaps take exception to the changes, not all of which can be excused on grounds of censorship - for example in the book the elder Sternwood daughter had been married to Sean Regan and Marlow learned at first hand that Carmen had shot Regan when she tries the same stunt on him - whilst viewers who lack the comparison will find much to enjoy in the crisp writing, directing and acting. Too much has been written already here for me to need to replicate it so suffice it to say that this movie's reputation as a Classic is well deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart is perfectly cast as Raymond Chandler's famous private-dick Philip Marlowe, here on blackmail/murder case involving two wealthy Los Angeles sisters. Plot is endlessly complicated, so don't even try to sort it all out (you'd need a blackboard and a big eraser). But why complain when the picture is so crafty and stylish, exotic, charming, and vivid. A slightly different version (the original cut, shot before Lauren Bacall's star-prominence) is often shown on the Turner Classics channel and features fewer scenes between Bogart and Bacall; it's also worth watching, but only after you've seen this re-shot version, with its suggestive dialogue and looser performances. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you ask me - I'd definitely say that The Big Sleep made for quite an enjoyable, yet unintentional, parody of the Film Noir genre. It really did.I mean, (with the hilarious way that all of the babes were literally falling into Bogart's arms, over and over again, and with so many of the bad guys being bumped off, left, right and centre, for no apparent reason) I certainly couldn't take this crime film's tale of drama at face value for even a minute.I clearly saw The Big Sleep as being played strictly for laughs. And, believe me, unintentional laughs it certainly did produce.Now 70 years old, The Big Sleep is filled to overflowing with plenty of wise-cracking dialogue, and cutie-pie bantering.... And, of course, Bogart's character was so ridiculously hardboiled and always just a little too sure of himself (regardless of any imminent danger) - And that all quickly added up to a truly comical romp down "Nostalgia Lane" for me.Anyways - Here in The Big Sleep, Humphrey Bogart plays (as only he could possibly play) character Philip Marlowe, a 25-dollar-a-day gumshoe who, agreeing to take on a cut'n'dry case of blackmail, inadvertently finds himself completely caught up in a very messy and tangled web of murder, treachery and, yes, romance that, believe me, gets screwier and screwier by the minute.I honestly can't imagine how any audience (even from the 1940s) could ever take The Big Sleep's story with dead-faced seriousness - 'Cause it's not. It's a literal laugh-riot all the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Glad to see that following last night's TMC showing, IMDb at last lists Sonia Darrin's sharply etched "Agnes", the unfriendly sales girl, among the cast credits, after what had been an inexplicable omission.)Alan Silver and Elizabeth Ward's excellent source book "Film Noir" goes into some detail ferreting out the strictly noir elements of this otherwise compromised private eye melodrama. Understandably, their concern is with the movie's noirish subtext and not with the film itself. Still and all, much of noir's appeal lies in its dark forebodings about the basic nature of things. Thus, the subtext here may be worth ferreting out, but that hardly compensates, in my book at least, for the movie's overall failure to live up to standards of either a noir classic or even a movie classic, despite the fabled Bogart-Bacall-Hawks collaboration. Now, there's no need to dwell on the notoriously convoluted plot, except to insist that it really does undermine the end result. Most importantly, the general incoherence drains viewer interest because of mounting difficulty in maintaining the many threads. As a result, interest in a subtext, for example, is abandoned to hardy professionals not so concerned with whether the movie succeeds as a movie. Thus, it's the characters that must sustain audience interest. However, an unusually large, and at times confusing, supporting cast is required by the screenplay meanderings. That would be okay if the characters and their actors were consistently interesting. But they're not. The trouble is that except for the two leads no one else gets much screen time. Thus, genuinely interesting characters or actors such as the general (Waldron), Carmen (Vickers), Canino (Steele), and (Agnes) Darrin, get shuttled around by the pallid likes of Mars (a badly miscast Ridgely), Ohls (Toomey), and Brody (Heydt). In short, the screenplay is not only confusing, but over-crowded, as well. True, many of the one-liners are memorable, but no one seems in charge of what they add up to.Also, I think many folks are too much in thrall to the Bogart-Bacall-Hawks mystique to notice that this is not a triumph for any of the three. Bogart's Marlowe is basically a one-note character, who spouts snappy one-liners, sees through most every ploy, and proves irresistible to anything with long hair. To me, it gets quickly tiresome, Bogie or no Bogie. At the same time, nothing shows the movie's basic flaw better than the ruinously unnecessary afternoon dalliance between Marlowe and Acme girl Malone. Not only is it awkwardly handled (Hawks), but undercuts the credibility of the Marlowe character early on. Whatever Bogart's appeal, it's not that of a matinée idol. Then there's Bacall. To her credit, she never claimed to be much of an actress. Instead, she's a presence. The trouble is that Vivian's devious nature calls for more nuance than Bacall can manage. Thus, her performance is reduced to dialogue without behavior, and an object lesson in what proves good for a career does not necessarily prove good for a movie, basic attractions or no basic attractions. Then too, I don't see much of trademark Hawks anywhere on screen. No overlapping dialogue or real snap. Looks to me like he was shackled by the screenplay and Warner's desire to employ a bevy of contract players. Then too, there's the question of final edit, which wouldn't be the first time a studio had botched a director's cut.I'm also puzzled by some of the sub-standard sets, especially the outdoor night scenes. The occasional fog serves not only as atmosphere but also masks the shabbily done backdrops. Given the name cast and director, it's surprising to me that these detractions would pass studio muster (or Hawks'). Now, none of this is to deny that the movie does have its moments. The first 15 minutes or so amounts to a gem of an opening act. The interplay between Marlowe and the mansion's assorted characters is cleverly conceived and executed. Also, there's enough boldness in the production to hint at such forbidden adult themes as drug addiction and nymphomania. As a result, Carmen Sternwood amounts to one of the most unusual characters of the Production Code 1940's, daringly brought to life by the under-rated and star-crossed Martha Vickers. Nonetheless, the sum total adds up to a disappointingly disjointed result, made more so by the caliber of the artists involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Big Confusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Big Sleep" is a good movie that I have now viewed twice (once for a Film Theory course, once for pleasure). But, unlike a movie that is "very good" or "excellent," it runs out of steam well before its climax. It is a well-made film, that is for certain--director Howard Hawks choreographs every scene with fluid blocking and hard-boiled dialog that eventually becomes self-parodic. Adapted from a novel by Raymond Chandler, "The Big Sleep" is not the "masterpiece" that many claim--for comparative purposes, such neo-Noir as "Chinatown" (1974) and "L.A. Confidential" (1997) interweave many characters and plot threads more coherently, while still leaving enough ambiguity to warrant repeat viewings. "The Big Sleep" begins with a plot setup that will bob and weave freely over its two hours: a millionaire is being blackmailed, and private eye Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) is called in to get to the bottom of it. To watch the movie is to be in a state of utter confusion (indeed, even Chandler couldn't follow it), and even as I took notes, I still came up with a fair amount of unresolved loose ends. And the double-crosses and dead bodies that surface in the narrative become increasingly hard to care about, since the characters exist as types rather than fleshed-out individuals. Ultimately, the best reasons to watch "The Big Sleep" have nothing to do with the plot--Bogart is well-cast as the quick-witted Marlowe, and Lauren Bacall (who was married to Bogart at the time) makes a fitting--albeit ice-cold--femme fatale, and Hawks skillfully directs a screenplay that seems confusing for its own sake. The film is not bad, but it could have been a whole lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart Miscast as Marlowe, Plot Too Complicated, but Well-Stylized Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(A Little Spoilers Included)For readers of Raymond Chandler, to enjoy this noir adaptation, the first hurdle to conquer may be to forget Philip Marlowe in Chandler's novels and to accept Marlowe performed by Humphrey Bogart. Chandler portrays Marlowe as a private eye with professional ethics and pride, not a womanizer like Bogart Marlowe, who falls for a daughter of his client. In addition, even understanding the values in the 40s, it is hard to believe that Bogart Marlowe can easily attract many women.The original story is too complicated to be adapted to a film; as a result, the plot highly relies on explanatory dialogues and is difficult to follow. For example, the viewers come to know that someone is tailing Marlowe when he asks Eddie Mars (John Ridgely) if Mars has someone follow him; this information should be given by a picture. The conclusion is abrupt; Marlowe figures out what happened to missing Shaun Regan completely out of the blue (He does so in the original novel, too, but the abruptness is less).Aside from these problems, the film is a well-stylized enjoyable noir piece. As a prototypical femme fatale, Vivian Sternwood (Lauren Bacall) appears everywhere as if she was a criminal mastermind behind the scene, and develops a romance with Marlowe, while in the novel she does neither of them. These factors make the plot less convincing, but enhance the noir aesthetics. Mars' wife Mona (Peggy Knudsen) looks too plain as a mysterious woman in villains' den; the 1945 prerelease version has a more suitable actress (Pat Clark). The stunning last shot of Bogart and Bacall smoking represents what the film is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All present and correct but misfiring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the title, a lot of the dialogue of this puzzlingly celebrated Bogart/Bacall pairing noir is dated to the point of obscurity. It doesn't help that the majority of the dialogue is delivered with acting that is at best stilted but worse, is often equivocally wooden. In a film in which the screen is an A-lister catwalk the script becomes disproportionately important. Despite some early attentiveness to dialogue from the characters at Sternwood's house, the descent into dramatic coasting from actors and a lack of inventiveness from Hawks to give the narrative a third dimension can turn the experience into The Big Yawn.However, the melange is rescued to a degree by Bogart. Maybe he talks in a speedy drawl that Benicio del Toro would be proud of and can be selective about those elements of the script that suit him, but he does have marvellous charisma. In this film he's given abundant opportunity to exercise his charms as well; an army of Tiller girls are wheeled on in various roles to give him something to call Sugar. The scene in the Acme bookshop offsets his only irresolute collision with a female by providing the most surprising example of this effect.Bacall is more of a clothes horse than Bogart's other celebrated partner of the period, Ingrid Bergman, providing a cool centre to the tumbling, unchecked pace of the film's unfolding. Unfortunately, too much in this picture goes unnuanced and that story told in broad brushstrokes is one of the two powerful charismas coming together to the exclusion of most else. 4.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is over-rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't see how so many people can rate this film so highly, when it is all but impossible to follow who is who and who did what where and when, less yet why. My mom and I watched it last night, and found it very disappointing. Watching films mostly for the sake of seeing some of the "greats" acting just isn't enough reason to spend 115 minutes looking at a television set. Once was enough, I'd never waste my time seeing the film again.Now for starters, don't make the mistake of assuming we have a problem with black-and-white, I've got dozens of non-color films in my library. But how can you follow who all of the characters are, what their motivations are, why certain people who fall into the big sleep, do that? Why did the "little man" have to be poisoned, and what sort of poison is so powerful it puts you into the big sleep in less than a minute? Why does Bogart keep pulling on his ear all of them time? Why is it that nearly every woman in the film flirts with Bogart the way they do? Sadly, when I began writing this, I had said all I wanted to say, and found I could not submit for lack of enough lines. Making enough was a challenge, as there isn't much more to say, to me, than that I just can't see how anyone follows the film and understands a story in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Big Sleep is too complex for one viewing alone; you will have to give it two viewings or more. On first viewing though, it is difficult to follow the many characters and situations (killings, blackmail, romances) and will have you scratching your head instead of enjoying the film. The main thing to take away is that Marlowe and Vivian are falling in love slowly but gradually throughout the film.Nothing against Hawks here; there is great direction in every scene and the acting is beyond phenomenal. The screenwriters deserve appraisal as well since they have put together a very intricate story which happens to work, even if you can't decipher it on first viewing. Films that make the audience have to think and pay attention usually deserve merit; look at the television show The Wire, for instance. Every detail is there for a reason even if it is difficult to grasp on first viewing. However, with a television show it is easy to fill in gaps of what you may miss in the scenes or even the episodes to follow, but with a film that is just under two hours and as complex as The Big Sleep you NEED to rewatch it. Films with rewatchability is one thing, but films that require you to rewatch them are not necessarily fun experiences. Important maybe, but not fun.Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall are very convincing in their roles. They make the film bearable to watch. There is also some excitement in the film as there are little bits of action when you hear a gunshot or see somebody gunned down. With this film being somewhat action- oriented it makes up for the fact that you cannot follow the plot the first time (but only slightly).Give this film a shot if it sounds like something you might revisit, but do not be surprised if you're scratching your head through the duration of the film.3.0/4.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great and exciting movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Big Sleep is a movie full of surprising twists and turns, taking you on a roller-coaster of epic dialogue and flashy scenes. This movie proves to be extremely entertaining. The story begins when detective, Phillip Marlowe, takes on a case from the Sternwoods involving blackmail. Soon thereafter, he becomes embroiled in a situation involving murder, pornography, and lies.The film is extremely efficient and packs in tons of plot into 114 minutes. It is able to pack in almost every major plot point from the book efficiently and effectively. Marlowe's narrative is basically required so that the viewers don't get confused. Bogart, who plays Marlowe, encapsulates the character perfectly, and Bacall who plays Vivian Reagan is able to bring out a convincing performance. The chemistry between the two is flawless. Through the fast pace and the abundant amount of scenes, we have an incredible amount of information to process, which makes the film all the more exciting. The film is made incredibly well for its time, made in the typical black and white, every scene and set materials are made perfectly. Many times we are taken back to Geiger's apartment, and the set pieces are almost identical to chandler's descriptions in the book. The main cast of Bacall and Bogart works incredibly well with nearly perfect chemistry between the two. The music and sound effects exhibit the feeling of the movie every time something happens. When something paramount is about to happen the dramatic music is cued and in and adds to the tension. The sounds of gunshots are also extremely convincing, many times I jumped a little from my seat from the sudden sound of the guns.In comparison to the book the movie definitely indulges in using the women characters to their full extent and more? Many of the scenes unnecessarily have women that Marlowe encounters fall head over heels for him. Such as the very odd, out of place scene in which he interacts with the bookstore worker across from Geiger's store. The movie does stay true to the book mostly until the end. The change in the ending also has the same reasoning behind it as the unnecessary scenes with women.Overall, this film is extremely entertaining and thought provoking. It is definitely an amazing film with an extremely talented cast. The film can be bought on DVD now in HD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a thoroughly entertaining thriller even if you haven't the foggiest notion who did what and with which and to whom or how. Somewhere in the muddled plot, there's an answer as to why a bookseller named Geiger was murdered, what gambling den proprietor Eddie Mars was up to, how a Packard containing a dead body wound up in the ocean and why a millionaire' nymphet daughter keeps turning up drunk and ready to romp with the nearest male. Yet despite the confusion, Humphrey Bogart acts as if it all makes sense. He scores as private eye Philip Marlowe whose professional curiosity gets him slugged, conked, kicked and beaten up -- and who finally unravels the mystery even if it's eluded the audience. According to legend, William Faulkner admitted that he had lost track of the plot while writing the screenplay. But who cares? With Lauren Bacall as Bogart's sultry client and hoods like Elisha Cook, Jr. and John Ridgely on hand to threaten (and bewilder) Bogart, it's well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The so-called "Pre-release" 1945 version . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . of THE BIG SLEEP is an over-stuffed honeymoon mattress for Mr. and Mrs. Humphey Bogart in which the mister's Philip Marlowe character has as much "chemistry" with the boozy rainy day bookstore bimbo (Dorothy Malone) as he does with his mid-shoot Real Life bride Bacall (playing Mrs. Vivian Rutledge here). Since "General Sternwood's" Family is not as progressive (or proactive) as the Kennedy Clan, their infantile nymphomaniac daughter (Carmen) is leaving a long trail of corpses in her wake. Marlowe does his best to clean up her messes (for "$25 a day plus expenses"), but the bloated plot reeks like last week's beached whale.The theatrical cut of 1946 begins, like its predecessor, with Real Life foreshadowing: Bogart and Bacall smoking in silhouette, followed by a lingering shot of their "coffin nails" burning down side-by-side in an ashtray. "Ashes to ashes," as they say. Bogart still is antiperspirant free in the sopping first scene. Then viewers are again forced to plod through the deaths of Nympho Sister Carmen's Seven Stooges. Some of the 1945 cop talk is cut out, replaced by simpler play-by-play detailing between Marlowe and his friend Bernie from the D.A.'s office. The sex talk is ramped up. Not only does Phil continue to seduce the Acme Books chick with his "I'm a private dick on a case" pick-up line, but Bacall now states--in regard to her mating satisfaction--that "a lot depends upon who's in the saddle."

Because every woman drools over Bogart, and Bacall positively swoons after attempting (unsuccessfully) to pretend that she has no attraction whatsoever for "just a dick on a routine case"? A typical "racy" exchange involves Bacall telling Bogart, "You go too hard," to which he quips something like, "Not something to say to a man when he's leaving your bedroom." Rather bawdy, or is it ribald? Anyway, funny enough, but not enough to qualify this picture as an exemplar of the film noir genre.

		<shortDescription>"Bogey &amp; Bacall" fizzle as a couple, while a pair of supporting actresses upstage them both</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you were confused by the so-called plot in "The Big Sleep," you are not alone, as not even the studio execs at Warner's nor the original author Raymond Chandler could make heads or tails out of the film.Pic was intended to be a cash-cow for Warner's, despite the fact that their top-grossing leading man, Humphrey Bogart, was by 1946 reduced to a sawed-off scarecrow of a man, appearing twenty years older than his forty-seven years. All those years of chain-smoking and heavy bourbon drinking (he missed several days on the set because he was too hungover to work) had finally caught up with him. Bogey's decrepit appearance, together with that glistening, disgusting drool that always accumulated at the corners of his mouth, was hardly the image of a leading-man. Warner's unwisely went with the premise that Marlowe, Bogey's character, was a sexy sleuth who had young dames going after him right and left. The unintentionally hilarious scenes of having 19-year-old starlets throwing themselves at the dour, aging Bogey (like the steamy Dorothy Malone and her whiskey-infused attempt to seduce Bogey as she closes her bookstore, or the unbelievably sexy Martha Vickers, who wrapped herself like a snake around Bogey) comes off as a ridiculous tableau of nubile young women instantly attracted, however unlikely in reality, with the toupee-wearing, narrow-shouldered geezer who wore his belt line almost up to his ribs. Pic was filled with such laughable bits, such as when Bogey jumps into a cab, orders the strikingly beautiful young driver to follow another cab, telling her "It's a tail job," and she quickly reposts with a lascivious grin, "I'm your gal!" That line might have gotten a great laugh if Bogart had reacted with even a scintilla of ribald humor, but as usual he seemed straight-jacketed within his stuffy, signature anti-hero-living-by-his-own-code persona. What a dud of a romantic leading man. Bogey was a real man's man, never a lady's man, and the problem was that in this film (and all of his films) he never really seems sexually interested in any of the women in the cast. He leaves Dorothy Malone in her bookstore to follow a suspect he'd been staking out across the street just as he is about to close the deal with Malone. Seriously!? It would have taken a team of draught horses to pull any real, red-blooded man away from the breathless, sexually eager Malone. Author Raymond Chandler remarked that the coquettish Martha Vickers totally upstaged Lauren Bacall's stiff and sterile perf with her intense performance in the original cut (shown in 1945 only on a limited basis overseas to U.S. troops). Warner's writers later tried to build up Bacall in the theater release version with added "love" scenes shot with Bogey and Bacall nearly a year later, in 1946, after the principal photography had wrapped (Bogey and Bacall had by then just been married), intending to inject at lest a modicum of sexual energy into the boring, stale chemistry between them in the earlier cut. Most tragically, Warner's cut out and left on the cutting-room floor most of Martha Vickers' scene-stealing role so it wouldn't further detract from Bacall's gawky, unconvincing performance. What a shame.The added love scenes with Bogey and Bacall seem contrived, flaccid, and sexless, almost as if Bacall could hardly wait to wipe Bogey's drool from her own mouth. The unfortunate Bacall was also stuck with lines so trite and on the nose she must have been mortified to have to say them, as when he kisses her: "I like it. I'd like more." Ugh. Who wrote this doggerel? A Nobel Prize winner in literature? Oh, wait, it was! Faulkner won the Nobel just a few years later. Go figure.Dorothy Malone should have won the Best Supporting Oscar for her all-too-short, serpentine duet with Bogey in her bookstore. Martha Vickers' nymph-like, seductive performance was borderline pornographic, but had in spades what is always missing in pornography: genuine sensuality. Malone and Vickers were real actresses who simply blew the lightweight Bacall right off of the screen. 6 out of 10, primarily for the small yet unforgettable performances by Vickers and Malone, otherwise I'd give it a very reluctant 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether you're watching this as a lazy rainy day movie or a Raymond Chandler aficionado hoping to see a very decent adaptation of one of his best (most likely, the best) novels, you will not be disappointed!Humphrey Bogart seemed born to play the role of Chandler's hard-boiled detective, Philip Marlowe in a performance that still holds weight with fans of Chandler's classic and enthralling private eye novelettes. In fact, I think that only the great Robert Mitchum seemed better cast as Marlowe, but Bogie surely gets away with doing what he does best: playing a wise-talking detective in a similar vein to his Sam Spade of 'The Maltese Falcon'(1941).Within minutes, you can tell that this is a Warner Brothers film. The minute Marlowe walks into the Acme Book Shop! But it's all okay. It certainly adds to the charm to see Bogie sharing a drink with a knowledgeable young book seller who, when she removes her spectacles, becomes a seductive potential conquest.Undoubtedly, this is also one of those films that served as a vehicle for both Bogart and Lauren Bacall, as they remain the most memorable characters, getting into several scrapes and several scenes that hold a lot of comic lure without sliding into slapstick.Amongst the supporting cast, Sonia Darrin as Agnes Lowzier, Louis Jean Heydt as Joe Brody and Martha Vickers as Carmen Sternwood really stand out. Even Elisha Cook Jr. returns from the 'The Maltese Falcon', albeit in a slightly different role. Vickers in particular, in the few small scenes that she has, really could have excelled as the literally Looney Tunes Carmen, but the role was scaled back in order to satisfy the Hayes production code of the time (and, according to Chandler himself, to prevent her from upstaging Bacall). Other areas of the plot are also scaled back for similar reasons (especially the Geiger pornography/blackmail plot)and, although Chandler purists may baulk at them, this is, after all, an adaptation and is, thus, open to interpretation.On that note, John Ridgely is, sadly, underwhelming in the pivotal role of Eddie Mars and Charles Waldron is simply an old man sat in a wheelchair when compared with the dying and crippled General Guy Sternwood of the novel. However, Charles D. Brown is quite entertaining at times as the Sternwood butler, Norris, even if he is a bit wooden.But the charm of the Bogie 'Big Sleep' is in its atmosphere. From the rain-soaked residential streets and high-rises of 1946 Los Angeles to Mars' jolly countryside gambling club and the honky-tonk bistro where Bogie's Marlowe meets Bacall's Vivian Rutledge, this really is a gem, despite Raymond Chandler's absence from script duties ((he was busy writing the screenplay to 'The Blue Dahlia (1946)).In fact, it appeared that it was Bogie and Bacall that the audience paid to see, and the on-screen chemistry between the two is obvious, from their jokey arguments to the characters' whirlwind romance. So obvious, in fact, that several exposition scenes of dialogue explaining the plot of the film were deleted and scenes re-shot so as to focus on the future Mr. and Mrs Bogart!!An awesome adaptation of an awesome and engaging novel, 'The Big Sleep', though focusing on Bogart and Bacall, and lacking a truly inspired supporting cast, has the distinction of being an adaptation set in Chandler's Los Angeles.The 8/10 was awarded because, despite its flaws and the focus on the personal love affair of its stars, this really is an entertaining Chandler adaptation that is well worth a watch, both for crime buffs and Chandler die-hards alike!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Private detective Philip Marlowe is hired to deal with a case of blackmail but before the film is over he'll discover the case is really about more than that and the body count will rise quickly. Elderly General Sternwood is being blackmailed because of his wayward daughter Carmen's gambling. He mentioned that when this happened before his friend Sean Regan handled it but he has disappeared; apparently with the wife of a local casino owner and gangster. It isn't long before Marlowe finds the blackmailer but he is shot and killed before he can confront him. As the case deepens people try to warn him off but inevitably he doesn't back down even after taking a beating or two. While investigating the case Marlowe also finds himself getting closer the Carmen's older sister; Vivian? even though at first they don't get on.This film is one of Bogart's best; he plays Marlowe in a way that makes the character seem slightly vulnerable despite his tough manner; he also has the lightness to deliver laugh out loud witty lines when required. Leading lady Lauren Bacall did a fine job as Vivian and Martha Vickers positively sizzled as Carmen? her opening scene with Bogart was quite seductive! The plot kept moving at a fast pace; as soon as it looked like things might be about to resolved another twist would take the plot in another direction. Director Howard Hawks filmed the movie in a way that gave it a great atmosphere; it manages to be gritty and tense yet still have funny moments and a story that never really drags? it may be nearly seventy years old now but it doesn't feel dated; I heartily recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good movie, but not a great movie. Too many characters, too confusing...and the studio realized it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think to analyze this movie, you have to separate the actors, the acting, and the script.I think many people are fooled into thinking this is a great film because it has the magic team -- Bogart and Bacall. Their mere presence, alone, does not a great movie make.As much as I like Bogie in his prime, and respected Bacall in hers, the magic that they made in "To Have And Have Not", "Dark Passage", and "Key Largo" just isn't that evident here.And, in terms of plot, this one rambles, and even the studio felt major improvements needed to be made to make the film appealing to post-war audiences.Now, that's not to say it's a bad film. It's a good film. But, just a "good" film. Not a "great" film".For example, in the house where the primary murder takes place...would Phillip Marlowe really leave his finger prints all over every key piece of evidence? Not if he was a good detective.Would everyone be continually going in and out of the murder house like it was a hotel lobby? I doubt it.Humphrey Bogart is good here...his character sure of himself...with some clever patter to go along with it. Lauren Bacall is good, but not sultry as she is in some other pairings with Bogart, and her character doesn't seem to know which side of her bread is buttered. Martha Vickers, as a foolish young lady, didn't impress. Regis Toomey as a police inspector once again proves he was a dependable character actor. Charles Waldron as the old man trying to protect his family was an interesting character. Louis Heydt has an interesting scene as a somewhat shady guy who isn't as clever as he thinks, and isn't tough enough, either. Elisha Cook is around for a while, but not in the tough role we saw in "The Maltese Falcon". I wish we would have seen more of Dorothy Malone here...very promising scenes that I understand were cut back because she was getting more attention than Lauren Bacall.Another problem with this film is that there are just too many characters to keep them all straight. Sort of like when you get halfway through a book and wish you'd started writing the characters down to keep them all straight.It's not that this is a bad movie. It's good...but not great. It's always interesting watching Humphrey Bogart. A marvelous actor. I recommend watching this movie, but I think the 8 point + rating on IMDb is too high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And it's here, with "The Big Sleep" that Humphrey Bogart puts his signature stamp on Raymond Chandler's greatest character, Philip Marlowe. "The Big Sleep" is a film that, despite its overly complicated plot remains very watchable because of the players and scenes that make up its whole. Bogart is a marvel in this movie, and his scenes with Lauren Bacall's femme fatale are electric. The dialogue is candy to the ears with a plethora of killer one-liners. You feel like your head is spinning when THE END rolls, but it was such a well-written ride, you just don't care. This is a terrific film in arguably Hollywood's greatest period, and Bogey just plays the hell out of the role. Speaking of Bogart, he's a total babe magnet in this movie. The first half is a series of gorgeous women that just come and go with bit parts. It's crazy how Bond-like he becomes.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Classic Bogie and Bacall Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The definitive Humphrey Bogart/Lauren Bacall vehicle, The Big Sleep casts Bogart as Raymond Chandler's cynical private eye Philip Marlowe and Lauren Bacall as the female lead in a film about the "process of a criminal investigation, not its results".This is the first film version of Raymond Chandler's novel of the same title. William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, and Jules Furthman co-wrote the screenplay; and it was directed by Howard Hawks.Summoned to the home of the fabulously wealthy General Sternwood, Marlowe is hired to deal with a blackmailer shaking down the General's sensuous, thumb-sucking daughter Carmen. This earns Marlowe the displeasure of Carmen's sloe-eyed, seemingly straight-laced older sister Vivian, who is fiercely protective of her somewhat addled sibling. As he pursues the case at hand, Marlowe gets mixed up in the murder of Arthur Geiger, a dealer in pornography. He also runs afoul of gambling-house proprietor Eddie Mars, who seems to have some sort of hold over the enigmatic Vivian. Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall made screen history together more than once, but they were never more popular than in this film that is witty and sinister, and in an odd way is a realistic portrayal of big-city life with Arabian Nights overtones.The characters have been transferred to the screen with punch by Howard Hawks' production and direction, providing full load of rough, tense action most of the way.This is one movie that every film student should study and every movie lover should watch at least once.A true classic Bogie and Bacall film indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Big Sleep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I recognised this film because of the easy to remember title and the leading actor and leading actress, I was hoping it would be a film worthy for recommendation, from director Howard Hawks (Scarface, Bringing Up Baby, To Have and Have Not, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Monkey Business). Basically dying General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) in Los Angeles hires private-eye detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) to supposedly keep an eye on his daughter Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers) who owes many gambling debts to bookseller Arthur Gwynn Geiger (Theodore Von Eltz), but it may in fact be his older daughter Vivian (Lauren Bacall) that needs his help. Marlowe goes to find the bookseller, the shop being looked after by assistant Agnes Louzier (Sonia Darrin), and when he tries to talk to Geiger he finds his body instead, along with a drugged Carmen, and later when he returns the body disappears, and the Sternwood driver is found dead too. Vivian comes to see Marlowe with some blackmail type pictures of Carmen, so he goes back to the bookseller's shop and follows a car to the apartment Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), a gambler who has blackmailed the General, and after returning to talk to Carmen she at first denies any knowledge of the Geiger's murder, but then names Brody as the killer. After an encounter with small-time gangster Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), Marlowe, Vivian and Carmen go to see Brody, with Agnes there too, to get the photos back, but an assailant shoots Brody dead, but the shooter, Geiger's former driver Carol Lundgren (Tommy Rafferty) who killed for revenge. Marlowe needs answers from Mars, and after some stooge work and pressing there is some kind of robbery plot revealed, and Carmen reveals that Mars calls Vivian frequently, and then she tries to seduce him but he refuses to give in to it. There is some kind of murder plot by Harry Jones (Elisha Cook Jr.), hired killer Lash Canino (Bob Steele) is sent to kill Agnes or whatever but Marlowe kills him first, and after some more gossip and revelations a meeting is arranged with Mars at Geiger's place. Guns are pulled out as Mars reveals he blackmailed Vivian to claim a crime of murder, in the chase Mars ends up shot accidentally by his own men, Marlowe calls the police and says that the real murder culprit was the gangster, and he assures Vivian that Carmen will get a doctor's help. Also starring Dorothy Malone as Acme Book Shop, Peggy Knudsen as Mona Mars, Regis Toomey as Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls and Charles D. Brown as Norris the Butler. I will absolutely honest and say that I hardly followed any real plot at all, it was pretty complicated, a review even says that it is complex for most people, for the witty script and the performances by real lovers and to-be husband and wife Bogie and Bacall it is a worthwhile classic detective drama.

		<shortDescription>The Ambersons Effect Pt. III</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers near the end! My advice is to meet with this gently, have no thought what it's about, let the burden of names and trifle detail flow through you. Use it like you were calibrating the eye to focus.By itself the film is uninteresting and not really worth the energy required to investigate. On the page, I suppose the situation to have been somehow mitigated by Chandler's wit and prose but the plot is all of it disposable. If I kept on the right track, we have three sets of blackmail, six counts of murder, plus a seventh revealed near the end, and all sorts of trickery, fronts, and storymaking between players. But two sets of unconnected circumstances elevate this to something that is required viewing and working with.The Hays Code was one, a simple effect; none of Chandler's titillation about drugs and pornography could ever reach the big screen, so all the sex is staged between a camera concealed inside a statue and us getting to imagine about it. It works better than if it were explicit.The second one is even more incidental, a boozing Faulkner had shown up from Mississippi to write for the movies. Now I don't presume the finished script was either fully by design or by complete lack of it, since Faulkner didn't care beyond a paycheck, rather the result of handing out Chandler's hard and thin sense of reality to a literary giant of the most awesomely intuitive nature, capable for the most multilayered memory. Add to that reshoots of the film several months later, sexual innuendo between Bacall/Bogart spliced in, a key scene where Marlowe explains the plot left on the cutting room floor, and you already have enough pieces of the puzzle missing.Or what I call the Ambersons Effect, after the Welles film. This a situation where no writer is in full control of the complicated story originally intended, quite clearly in our case. The famous story is that Chandler had to be phoned back to shed some light on the cluster of murders.So we get a twist on Chandler's twist of the story, but following Marlowe's assembly of that story, the culprit is shot to pieces before we have a chance to corroborate. We leave the film thinking Marlowe got it right, had to.Here's where the world of allusive accidents kicks into effect.The framing device, this is where Carmen was going to be framed for murder, is a set of photos and a daze that makes her as a viewer susceptible to stories! Isn't this us?Chandler used sex and drugs to explain but that is gone. We just have the mystifying stupor, the girl drowsy in a Chinese dress. We have the concealed camera.We have Marlowe's coolly laid-out solution to the story, after the old blueprint of detective fiction - Holmes, Perry Mason, the mode that Chandler wrote in - so quite independent of the viewer. His snappy rat-ta-tat as he explains is followed moments later by the staccato sound of machine-gun fire that kills off the only one who could say if it was so.But upon reflection, the thing seems a bit off, ordinary logic broken in the process, this creates strangely ambiguous perturbations through a world we just experienced as rational and finite. Marlowe's story is near as possible as everyone else's, but the entire film leading up to it has been believable stories exposed as fabrication. The alternative reading I prefer, is that Marlowe solves blackmail but in doing so suspects he may have fallen for the wrong woman. So he investigates a second plot that is stories made-up by this woman to guard herself, in the end he unspools this in the only way where she turns out innocent and his instincts right all along.This is great the way we have it, a lesson in the relative dynamics of storytelling. When Marlowe resurfaces for The Long Goodbye, the world has outmaneuevered him in complexity. There is a boozing writer and shown to be destructive. The link is Leigh Brackett.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an example of a poor story well directed and acted.It is a film noir with a private investigator, played by Bogart, looking for an answer to a murder, even though he should be satisfied, on the surface, with the answer he's given.A great cast helps to tell this ordinary stage fare, pretty much a cliché of a mystery.The most disappointing aspect of this movie is the very aspect that helps it sell to today's bubble boy Beavis and Butthead audience, the cliché of the super evil assassin, Canino. Steele does a good job in playing him, it's not that, but it was a waste of his talents to play this cliché. Still, it's what sells to the psychopaths of today.Fortunately, the psychopath isn't the stereotype of the "superman sadist", and he isn't depicted as superhuman. He isn't as immortal as a modern day moron would make him. Most of the movie is about Bogart's character. A landmark scene involves him with two other landmark actors (including Steele), where he timidly watches a murder. The events that follow tell a lot about his character.And that's the highlight of the movie, the character of our hero. He is not perfect, but he is far from the one dimensional cliché of the psychopathic sixties and seventies movie characters who were declared "anti heroes" by every brain fried dope-head who inspired Beavis and Butthead. No, here we have a true anti hero. He at least struggles to make reason of a situation.It's hard to say whether it is directing or acting that makes Bogie shine. He was at his best when portraying imperfect people, in the Sierra Madre, in a black Legion, in here. He's flawed, and makes mistakes, but they're very human ones. Maybe he had the best agent ever, or maybe he was just that great, or maybe both. Whatever, he makes this worth watching.</fullReview>

The plot is so ridiculously convoluted and there is such a multitude of characters that it's just about impossible for the viewer to keep everything straight. And yet, it doesn't really matter that the big picture is unclear because the vignettes are enjoyable on their own. The dialog crackles with wit.

		<fullReview>The big sleep was a pretty good movie. The movie has a very consistent mise en scene. It's very dark and shadowy throughout, there are many rainy scenes, and a lot of the movie takes place at night. The story in the film is very interesting and entertaining. Bogart gives a smooth performance, as do all of the actors. The only bad thing about the movie was that some of it was a little tough to follow. For example, when the main character investigates inside of a car and looks at a tag on the steering column. I had to back it up to see what it said, but I still wasn't quite sure what it was supposed to mean. There were a few other things like that throughout the movie. Also there were a lot of names thrown around and I was never quite able to get a grip on who was who. Eventually it doesn't really matter because the plot goes where it's going to go whether or not you understand, and even if you didn't catch everything that happened you are still able to understand the story's resolution. But still, stuff like that gets annoying and I feel like the filmmakers could have done a better job making things clear. Overall it's still an entertaining film and I did like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film "The Big Sleep" was a very fast paced movie for me to watch. There was a lot of plot change and the focus of characters changed a lot as well. That was apart of its charm as well all of the changes on focus. At one point the main focus was of the General was Carmen, but on the back burner was his old friend Regan. The film kept me on my toes, the mystery changed every so often that I was unsure of who were the "good" characters and who were the "bad" characters. It became complex and intriguing all at the same time, you have multiple characters all with multiple motives. It can get confusing, so paying attention is required. The film's cinematography was interesting because I especially focused on the women. I felt that they were portrayed very much like a stereotypical woman in this time period. Most in the film were always very "dolled up" for every occasion. I felt that the woman even when they were not in the main focus of the shot helped create the background. Some of scenes had more action than others but Bogart really showed people how to solve a mystery and do it in style.</fullReview>

Marlowe's constant manipulation and observation of others was brought out perfectly by Bogart, who gives the character profound respect and power. I couldn't decide if id rather watch a gunfight, or watch Marlowe probe for information, which were both equally as tactful and exciting. But underneath Brando's commanding character lies an intense web of secrets, lies, and love. Uncovered gradually, and with a fair share of twists, the plot constantly is answering questions all the while presenting new inquiries, and doing all of this with suspenseful photography and perfectly lit subjects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Big Sleep" is one of those movies where it helps if you're in the right mood and frame of mind to watch it. This complex screenplay is based on the novel from the very gifted Raymond Chandler. None other than Humphrey Bogart would be right for the part of Philip Marlow, PI. Throw in Lauren Bacall, who was explosively successful with Bogart in 'To Have and Have Not' and you've got the potential for a great motion picture.By the end of this whirlwind, the whodunits don't seem to matter much, since we've had such a good time getting there - besides the movie is not about solving a mystery, and while gripping, is never particularly suspenseful. The film is about Marlowe, taking us through a maze of criminal networks where the dialogue sparkles as Chandler delivers completely. The script is pure magic and simply the best of the 1940's detective genre films. The only lasting criticism of the movie was it's complex and confusing plot. However, as the years go by, strangely this turns out to be a positive as well.While the novel written by Chandler is pretty straight forward, there is no central crime or criminal element that binds the story together. The story is told completely from the perspective of Marlow as he takes us through a labyrinth of crime. Racketeering on several different levels, murder, blackmail and gambling are all discussed in the novel. Pornography and homosexuality were also mentioned but could only be alluded to in the film. This 'hardboiled' style of detective writing Chandler employed was softened up a bit in the film. Comments on the decaying social and moral order, and references to crooked cops were left out of the script. Originally, the Phillip Marlow Chandler created was too professional to fall in love with his clients. Hollywood however, needed a love story, so screenwriters Faulkner, Furthman and Brackett took liberties with the novel to create a love interest between Marlow and Vivian. Because of this change, a chain reaction of other confusing changes were needed to balance out the story - the last name of Vivian - who she was married to - and how many times she had been married, all needed changing as well. I believe these modifications to the storyline impacted the performance of Bacall in the introductory scene. She came across as a shallow over protective daughter and busy-body sister. The same scene in the novel has fabric and functionality - the scene in the movie is worth little more than an introduction. Martha Vickers introductory scene is well, unforgettable.After preliminary viewings were made, Lauren Bacall's agent was concerned with her position in the film. He convinced Jack Warner to re-shoot several scenes and ramp up the dialogue in several others. The movie was originally finished in 1945 and viewed by servicemen overseas while shelved in the U.S. The 'improvements' were completed and the film finally released in 1946. The '1946' version enhanced the position of Lauren Bacall and more or less achieved what the studio wanted. The cost for this enhancement was a lack of clarity, since a key scene where Marlowe and Ohlms are talking the case over with the DA, is scrapped to make room for an amped up longer scene where Bogart and Bacall compare each other to horse racing with an obvious sexual double entendre. Sadly it was also rumored that some of Martha Vickers scenes ended up on the cutting room floor to insure Bacall was more of the standout in this picture.The code and censorship standards of the day made several scenes in the picture confusing and tricky to film. What type of books were being sold in the back of Geiger's store? What was going on with Carmen's photo shoot? When Marlowe breaks in she is fully clothed in a Chinese dress. The young bookstore clerk closes her store and lets down her hair to have drinks with Marlow on a rainy afternoon, yet we're left with the impression nothing went on? Filmmakers of the 40's had a way of taking you the precipice of something dark and dirty but never really letting you know for sure. You have to wonder what an audience in 1946 thought of all this? Maybe they read the book. All these things must be more than a little vague to a modern audience, who seldom is required to use this much imagination. Although Bogart's lines were not accelerated dialogue, the actor could deliver his lines PDQ. As with most detective films of the 40's you would think there was a shortage of celluloid, by the rapid fire bantering exchanges. In the novel Marlowe seems to prefer drinking to women, but Howard Hawks has Bogart bowling over the women in a way we wouldn't see again till 20 years later in the character of James Bond.If you're having trouble getting into the movie, there's a scene early on where Bogart is watching the house rented by Geiger. It's raining and Marlowe is hunched down in the seat of the Plymouth Coupe and fat lipping a cigarette when Carmen Stearnwood drives up. It's expertly written and beautifully filmed. At this time an invisible hand reaches out of the screen and yanks you out of your easy chair and into the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Philip Marlowe Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The prototype of the cool-headed private eyes, Philip Marlowe, the creation of Raymond Chandler, was a character made to be portrayed by Humphrey Bogart, and The Big Sleep also provides a rich role for Lauren Bacall, Bogart's real-life sweetheart. The electricity between them is palpable.Howard Hawks, one of the great masters of film noir, is in the director's chair and if the plot doesn't quite hang together at times, blame it on the censors, who wouldn't have allowed important themes and details to be included in the script. Who's killed whom and why may be a little murky but the execution could scarcely be improved upon. And as long as Bogart, Bacall and Hawks are the principals, who cares about the elusive details. William Faulkner is credited along with Leigh Brackett for having written the screenplay but if I recall correctly Faulkner was notoriously unproductive during his stint in Hollywood, so I'm inclined to doubt that the attribution has much significance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most influential detective films ever to come out of Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Private eye Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) is hired to protect General Sternwood's (Charles Waldron) wild young daughter (Martha Vickers) from her own indiscretions, and finds several murders later that he has fallen in love with her elder sister (Lauren Bacall).The Big Sleep is an inextricably complicated, moody thriller from a novel whose author claimed that even he did not know 'who done it.' The film is nevertheless vastly enjoyable along the way for its slangy script, outbursts of violence, suspense, sheer fun, and star performances; it was clearly tweaked to accommodate Bogart and Bacall's chemistry on and off screen. In 1997, the U.S. Library of Congress deemed this film "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant," and added it to the National Film Registry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart and Bacall are perfect together.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most important detail to the Big Sleep is that it is what Warner Brother movies of that time were all about. Mystery and the art of making movies so complex and confusing that you must wait on the edge of your seat the whole movie just to understand. Some of the greatest things about this movie is how it went about using Innuendo and avoiding showing scenes in which Bogart may have slept with the woman he was speaking with. A perfect example of this would be when Bogart who plays Private detective phillip marlowe visits a book shop to find out some more about a man named Geiger. He does this by asking about a special edition Ben Hur that doesn't exist, but instead decides to flirt with the clerk. This turns into an innuendo filled dialogue that howard hawks was known for. The scene ends with the clerk grabbing two glasses for some whiskey and shutting the blinds and locking the door. Therefore showing that they may have had some afternoon delight in between the fadeout and when the scene begins again. The most important detail to this movie is the dialogue that is portray by the characters in the movie as it leads you from scene to scene, Howard Hawks brilliance with dialog speaks volume for this film.</fullReview>

But the plot of the film isn't as important as the characters that inhabit it. Just watching Bogart run around telling people that he likes his drinks in glasses and commenting on how girls are trying to sit in his lap while he's still standing up, is so much fun that I'm willing to let all the plot holes slide (something I rarely do).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic film-noir, doesn't hold up very well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw the high score (8.1) on this film and decided to check it out. The plot sounded cool and I thought it must be a great film.I can see why this a classic and would have been popular at the time, but it honestly does not hold up very well to modern crime/mystery films. There is so much talking and exposition, so many character names to keep track of, and the story just didn't impress me all that much. The "plot twist" that are critical to any good crime mystery, just aren't that surprising and the film doesn't really feel like it builds to any kind of climax that I found myself caring out.There are some good performances in this film, but it is not something that I would want to watch again any time soon. I was bored through most of it, and I was having to work hard the whole time to pay attention to all the little details, trying to keep all the characters straight, hoping that it would pay off with some amazing ending, but that never really came. I think a lot of these old movies have very generous score on IMDb and this is one of them. Maybe it has a lot to do with nostalgia, or the importance of this film at the time it was made.Either way, if you are looking for an exciting crime murder mystery, I would look elsewhere. If you are into classic film noir movies, or a big fan of Bogart, then maybe this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film-Noir Despite Hawks and Bacall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is One of those. a Movie that is so Well Liked, Patronized, Slobbered Over, and so Often Hailed as "The Perfect Film-Noir", "A Great American Classic". But when such Accolades are administered, they are often Accredited to Two Things that could be argued are Misplaced.First is Lauren Bacall, the Second is Director Howard Hawks. It could also be Argued that neither Bacall nor Hawks have Anything to do with the Appeal and otherwise Sublime, Surreal Nature of this odd Film.Lauren Bacall is Overshadowed by everything in the Movie, not the least is all the other Female Characters. In Fact, it is well Known that Martha Vickers, playing the Nympho, Drug Addict, Carmen Sternwood was so Good, She Dominated the Film and most of Her Scenes were Cut so Bacall would Not be Overlooked.Howard Hawks Stiff Style and overlapping Dialog is completely Unnecessary here because the Words themselves are so Witty and Snappy, Sarcastic and Humorous, that Hawks need Not Intrude with His bit of Clunk. A Howard Hawks Movie almost always Looks Studio Bound, Fake, and Staged. It is Evident by anyone Watching this Film-Noir, must Immediately Notice the Lack of Expressionism. The Movie was entirely Shot in a Studio and on Sound Stages and boy does it Show and the Gritty and Dark Meilu of Noir are only Evident a Few Times.But Despite Hawks and Bacall almost Sinking the Thing, the Film still manages to be Great. No Doubt because of all the Interesting and Exciting Characters and the Scintillating Dialog and of course Bogart's take on the Philip Marlowe Character that Impresses.It is Marlowe, Carmen, the General, Dorothy Malone, Agnes, Arthur Gwen Geiger, Carol Lundgren, Joe Brody, the Girlie Taxi-Driver, Pete and Sydney, Eddie Marrs, Canino, Harry Jones, and even two Characters never on Screen (Owen Taylor and Sean Reagan), that everyone Remembers. Not the "Inserted Scenes" of Bacall jousting Innuendos with Bogart and Embarrassing Herself in the Casino Singing and making Silly Gestures. OK the Racehorse Scene at the restaurant is Remembered fondly but Not for Bacall but the, once again, Sexually Charged Dialog.There's plenty of Sexy Girls, a lot of Violence, and Code-Busting subtexts like Pornography, Homosexuality, a Teenage Sex and Drug Addict, that make this Film-Noir No Doubt. But all of the Edgy Things that Create this Vintage Noir treat have Little to Do with Lauren Bacall or Howard Hawks and much More from Everything and Everyone Else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Private eye Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) is hired by an elderly man named General Sternwood, who has two pretty daughters, to deal with a blackmail plot and find a family friend that's gone missing. Soon people start showing up murdered and Marlowe has to figure out who's doing the blackmailing and the killing, all the while falling for one of the daughters (Lauren Bacall).First-rate Raymond Chandler private eye flick with superb direction from Howard Hawks, a great cast, and a wonderfully quotable script. As others have stated, the plot doesn't always make sense. However, it's not quite as convoluted as some seem to imply. The mystery isn't the real selling point, anyway. It's Humphrey Bogart being the hard-boiled and quick-witted tough guy that we all know and love. Add to that his electric chemistry with beautiful Lauren Bacall and you have one hell of an entertaining movie.The version most of us are familiar with is not the only one available. The 1946 version is the one that has become the classic beloved for decades. But there is a pre-release 1945 version. The primary difference between the two is that the 1946 version has additional scenes with Bacall meant to capitalize on the popularity of the Bogie/Bacall pairing. The 1945 version has a slower pace with more plot exposition and a different actress playing Mona Mars. The 1946 version is the superior of the two but fans should enjoy watching the other for comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish Noir Overcomes Confusing Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you watch "The Big Sleep", you'd better take notes. Its plot is as confusing as "The Maltese Falcon".As a story, it is flawed. This is partly due to divergences from the original book by Raymond Chandler. It is very much due to changes in the story made because of Hayes Code considerations. Too many plot points are hidden by insinuation or implication. Finally, the film was re-edited after completion, to emphasize the Bogart-Bacall relationship.However, like "The Maltese Falcon", this film is generally heralded as a great example of noir. That's because style is more important than substance. What are these style elements that make the film an artistic success? Firstly, you have the dialogue, especially the dialogue that comes from the lips of Bogart, a real smooth operator who admits he likes games. Bacall's lines (enhanced by the refilming of certain scenes) are playful but, more importantly, they are delivered with her insolent-yet-interested style.There are plenty of night scenes. Most of Marlowe's work--like the best noir scenes--takes place after dark, in the shadows. And he frequents venues where persons of dubious nature dwell.Marlowe is a man with a moral compass operating in a sinister world. He is driven more by his own interest than by the law or a paycheck. That personality trait, more than anything else, makes the film interesting. The mystery that engages the viewer is not a whodunit. It is understanding the story that Marlowe is writing in his head, fueled by his understanding of human nature and the criminal element.So, the plot's obfuscations are more than compensated for by the film's style and the Marlowe character.</fullReview>

One year ago, he paid Joe Brody $5000 to leave his youngest daughter wild Carmen (Martha Vickers) alone. His other daughter Vivian Rutledge (Bacall) has left her husband. Both daughters are living with him. Now Carmen has signed notes for some gambling debts and Marlowe recommends paying the debts off. His investigations gets more and more complicated.This is fast-talking incredibly complicated double-crossing noir classic. Lines don't get better than "She tried to sit in my lap, while I was standing up." or "I collect blondes and bottles, too." The story is a bit too complicated to keep attached to. It's like a bucking bronco who keeps trying to throw you off. However the great lines keep coming and that's what so great about the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Bogart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was shot during the war and was later released in 1946. The film stars the very highly acclaimed actor, Humphrey Bogart, who does an absolutely magnificent job in capturing the very core of his character. His portrayal of his character is classic, it is so intriguing to watch. He is so very cool, and is so effortlessly. The way he dangles his cigarette loosely on his lips, and his calm, almost cold demeanor is very rich for supporting the character he was portraying. This movie sheds new light on the glorious P.I. movies, which have not lost their popular touch even in todays cinematic area. I think this movie sets off a new craze on the whole idea of being a P.I. and all the darkness that surrounds it. The shots are done in a way that gives you a feel of doom and gloom. The darkness gives you a good feel of the mood and setting of the story being portrayed. A lot of the scenes are dark, cold, and wet, which do well in complimenting Bogart's dark, sleek, powerful character. The film is the first of its kind and is certainly a Bogart Classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a quite complicated movie to follow, that features lots of characters, sidetracks, different motives and twist and turns. It will make your head spin at times and it's really a movie you have to keep paying attention to, in order not to understand things anymore. It's for example quite hard to understand who killed who and what all the motives are behind them. The movie is basically the one infringement after the other, in which the one covers for the other, until you're simply not able to follow it all anymore.It's a great example of the genre though and the class of the director Howard Hawks and the actor Humphrey Bogart make sure that the movie will keep you interest throughout. It really has all of the ingredients you could expect, such as lying double crossing characters, a plot that thickens and thickens and of course a femme fatale, in this case more than one as well.You could say that despite it's complexity it's still a well written and constructed story. The movie not in the least also features some great tough dialog, that really fit the genre and the atmosphere these type of movies always have over them.It's a real film-noir with plenty of mystery and thriller elements to it. It also features some action as well and of course a sniff of romance, when Bogart and Bacall once more fall in love in a movie. The sequence filled with loads of sexual innuendo really jumps of the screen and is really quite amazing for an 1946 movie. Lots of directors now days would have difficulties placing such a sequence in a movie.A true great example of the genre, despite of its complexity.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

I understand that this version is slightly different from that one which was first release. Lauren Bacall looks good in all her sconce, as do the full supporting cast of American lovelies. However the story itself is not its strong point. The film is very much studio based, and sometimes it shows. However the atmosphere of another time and place, the comedy, the good script all go a long way to make this an enjoyable film. Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall look good together.

		<shortDescription>A Movie For The Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Big Sleep is a comfortable movie to watch for the airy, pop culture-related intentions in the film-making. It was made to showcase Bogie and Bacall together, not to tell Raymond Chandler's intricate detective yarn, even if that's the way things may have started out. Actually, it started out the way most commercial films start out nowadays as well: It was an attempt at repeating the success of a previous film with the same stars. When the studio is focusing on a worry involving the comparison between the height of the male star and the women in the film and have him where shoes that make him taller, when the famous hole in the plot concerning an all-too-ambiguous death that Chandler himself couldn't figure out in his novel's adaptation, and when the majority of Martha Vickers's performance is cut because she has more intensity than the more profitable actress in the film, we're not talking about the celebration of cinematic art. We're talking about making ch-chings.I'm not saying The Big Sleep is a bad movie, because it isn't. It's just an early example of the transformation in film from art to commercialism and the rare wedding of both. Ask most big fans of this movie if they really follow the story. It's such a complex one, not to mention how much it was adjusted for the bankable advantages of having more of Bogart and Bacall on screen than they otherwise would've been. Here's a general description of the gist of the plot: Humphrey Bogart's character, down-to-earth private investigator Philip Marlowe, is sent for by General Sternwood, a rich war veteran who is dying from complications of organs that are growing weaker with his old age. Marlowe is asked to deal with blackmail concerning the General's youngest daughter, Carmen. Marlowe finds that the problem centers about the disappearance of Sternwood's favorite employee who has left with a mobster's wife. Marlowe soon finds himself falling in love with Sternwood's oldest daughter, Vivien, who initially takes a deep dislike to Mr Marlowe. As things unravel, the body count increases to cover the villain's tracks.See, now doesn't that sound good? Like a good little detective thriller? What the studio did to malleate it for an ensured profitability is not necessarily a bad thing, especially in comparison to what studios do for the same reasons nowadays, but why not let a movie be what it is? Nonetheless, it's a classic, and it's very good. Great cast, beautiful women, wonderfully earthy dialogue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Big Sleep" is one of those famous film noirs you always hear about, which has helped redefine (or even revolutionize) the entire genre. It stars Humphrey Bogart as famous screen detective Philip Marlowe, summoned by a dying General to investigate several problems related to the dying man's family.As Marlowe searches deeper he finds each issue involves the disappearance of an employee who has left town with a mobster's wife. Secrets are unturned, revelations made known...and so on and so forth.Howard Hawks was a great, great director and that really shows through here - more so than anything else. This film stands the test of time incredibly well. For a film from 1946, you'd hardly guess it isn't a modern one. The way the material is handed is something I'd never expect from a film from the 1940s.The performances are great. Bogart creates one of cinema's most endearing characters as Marlowe, the private eye with a lot on his mind. Bacall is a suitable (if not particularly captivating) love interest.The movie is well-written, well-directed and well-acted. Seen almost sixty years later, it's still a great film noir - and one of the best of its genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A private detective is only as good as his client.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gumshoe Philip Marlowe is idolized today by many fans of "The Big Sleep," but when the film first came out how did audiences regard him? And what may have been the intentions of the film's makers in creating an antihero with a personal code of ethics and honor that take him outside morality and the law to serve the interests of his jaded wealthy client? Unsavory underworld types seem to drop dead just about as quickly as they run into Marlowe. Not surprisingly, this perfectly serves his client, General Sternwood, who has told Marlowe simply to "get rid of" the blackmailer who threatens to expose Sternwood's daughter as a junky and a slut unless he gets paid for some bogus gambling debts. Never mind that Marlowe doesn't personally pull the trigger on Geiger, the phony rare books seller with a sideline in blackmail. In the unavoidable logic of this fatalistic movie the extortionist's fate is sealed the moment that Marlowe walks through his door.Just as much as he serves his client, Marlowe is the agent of doom, a symbol of the dark principle of poetic justice that informs so many noir movies made in Hollywood during the forties and the fifties. Yet he is not so much admirable as repugnant in the role of fickle finger of fate, like a pariah with a curse upon his head.Should we idolize him? He never does anything that doesn't perfectly serve the corrupt interests of the rich. If General Sternwood owned a factory and the workers there were on strike, you can bet that a private dick exactly like Philip Marlowe would be on the opposite side of the picket line attacking the strikers with a brickbat. Why? Because a private eye like Marlowe, who comes from the same tradition as the real life union-busting Pinkertons, would never fail to do anything in the interest of a wealthy paying client.There's nothing wrong with the movie though. In fact, it's fairly realistic and very well made. Like the works of the bourgeois French novelist Honore de Balzac, which were much admired by Karl Marx, the novels of Raymond Chandler and the movies based upon them are most interesting for the realistic portraits they present of the criminal and upper classes, which in "The Big Sleep" seem very much alike. But Marlowe's no hero for getting his wealthy client off cheaply, he's just another cossack serving the interests of a spoiled and decadent czar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big Sleep, The (1946) (Theatrical version) **** (out of 4) Classic film has private detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) getting involved with a rich family who seems to be getting blackmailed over some photos of the youngest sister. Soon the detective is in over his head with the older sister (Lauren Bacall) who might know more than she's telling. It's hard to believe that one of the greatest films of the decade also has what is perhaps the worst story. I believe this was my third time watching this and the story doesn't make any more sense now than it did the first couple of times I watched it. It's rather amazing at how highly thought of this film is even with its lack of a coherent story to follow. You'd really think a weak plot would lead to a weak film but that's far from the case because this here is certainly a pure classic of the genre. What works so well are the incredible performances mixed with the strong direction. Bogart is once again playing a cool but tough detective and God knows no one was ever better than he was. I often wonder if Bogart got a kick out of practicing his various walks for these types of films because he certainly nails it each time he walks into a room to knock out a bad guy or just flirt with a woman. His calm and cool nature really makes for a great leading man and he makes the role his own. Bacall also turns in another winning performance but it's Martha Vickers as her younger sister who really steals the show. John Ridgely, Dorothy Malone and Regis Toomey add great support as well. If you discuss this film the rather strange plot often gets talked about but I think the reason people overlook this is because the heart of the film isn't with solving the case but with the fun behind trying to solve it. The end result really doesn't matter because the viewer, as well as the characters, are having fun going through all the trouble of trying to come up with clues, villains and the reasons behind everything. A lot of the credit for this certainly goes to Hawks whose direction is solid and never wavers any of his style or vision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw The Big Sleep (1946) one night at the uni when I was doing my Masters. The plot is crazily confusing. Half an hour into the film I was a goner and I remembered looking around at others to see who was still following the story. Over the weekend I decided to try it again; this time with the wifey. I figured it should be easy peasy for me and I gave my wife a friendly warning. One hour later I was again a goner after yet another name drop and a dead body. The only thing that really got to me was the animalistic sexy chemistry between Bogart and Bacall. When the movie closed with a frame of their faces turning towards each other, I turned to my wifey and ranted a spirited barrage about how nobody could understand the incomprehensible plot. She turned to me with a befuddled look and said "what's so difficult about that?" I thought she must be trying to pull a fast one on me and I asked her to give me a rundown. She then in very succinct sentences told me what the whole thing was about. My eyes widened and my jaw dropped. She was absolutely correct! I am useless. Anyway, The Big Sleep is the quintessential American noir - An unreliable protagonist, a femme fatale, shady characters and nihilistic atmosphere, they are all here. Coupled with a piling on of important information, this was the Inception of its time. I love Bogart who essentially plays his character the same way as all his other iconic roles - sexist and insolent. The lines are amazing stuff:Philip Marlowe: She tried to sit in my lap while I was standing up.Vivian: What will your first step be? Philip Marlowe: The usual one. Vivian: I didn't know there was a usual one. Philip Marlowe: Well sure there is, it comes complete with diagrams on page 47 of how to be a detective in 10 easy lessons correspondent school textbook and uh, your father offered me a drink. Vivian: You must've read another one on how to be a comedian.Vivian: You go too far, Marlowe. Marlowe: Those are harsh words to throw at a man, especially when he's walking out of your bedroom.Vivian: So you do get up, I was beginning to think you worked in bed like Marcel Proust. Marlowe: Who's he? Vivian: You wouldn't know him, a French writer. Marlowe: Come into my boudoir.Marlowe: You know what he'll do when he comes back? Beat my teeth out, then kick me in the stomach for mumbling.Taxi Driver: If you can use me again sometime, call this number. Philip Marlowe: Day and night? Taxi Driver: Uh, night's better. I work during the day.This next one is my fave. If you can't catch the sexual innuendo you have no business watching movies. Vivian: Speaking of horses, I like to play them myself. But I like to see them workout a little first, see if they're front runners or come from behind, find out what their hole card is, what makes them run. Marlowe: Find out mine? Vivian: I think so. Marlowe: Go ahead. Vivian: I'd say you don't like to be rated. You like to get out in front, open up a little lead, take a little breather in the backstretch, and then come home free. Marlowe: You don't like to be rated yourself. Vivian: I haven't met anyone yet that can do it. Any suggestions? Marlowe: Well, I can't tell till I've seen you over a distance of ground. You've got a touch of class, but I don't know how, how far you can go. Vivian: A lot depends on who's in the saddle.Isn't that incredibly sassy? Such class in writing (which I hardly see in today's films) and every time Bogart and Bacall shared the screen together I thought the temperature in the room went up. The movie also has a very interesting history. It was actually competed before 1946 but kept on shelf as the studios rushed out their WWII patriotic films. Then Bacall's star got tarnished by Confidential Agent (1945), her second film. Her agent looked at the completed The Big Sleep and suggested to Howard Hawks to make changes to protect his investment and the film. So a few years after the film was completed, and by this time Bacall has become Mrs Bogart, the whole team reshot key scenes and inserted some new dialogue (the "horses" scene was added at this time) and we got the familiar 1946 version that plays on the incendiary Bogart/Bacall chemistry which became a winner. The documentary in my DVD explains the changes in both versions and it is essential viewing. Lots of stuff have been written about original directors' cuts and purists always swear by them. In this particular instance the retooled version is hands down the supreme version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Big Sleep is Film-Noir at it's finest. What makes a great crime noir is to develop a storyline that is not only hard for us to decipher who did what, but the characters as well. I love the feeling of unraveling what really happened along with the characters. It's probably one of the main reasons why I love private detective films. Humphrey Bogart was one of the biggest movie stars the world had ever seen. But to be honest, I'm not entirely sure he would be able to figure out the complete plot of The Big Sleep. It's an intricate story about a private detective who gets brought onto a case for one reason, and then ends up finding out 15 million other things he should solve.Lauren Bacall stars alongside Bogart, as a somewhat romantic interest? The reason I say that is that there are so many double crosses and mysteries involving each character that it becomes difficult to understand each characters motivations. But Bacall brings such charm and charisma the screen even at a very young age. If I'm not mistaken she was only 22 when she filmed this movie. There's something to be said about the vulnerability and maturity she brings to this character that makes her so compelling. Bogart on the other hand is incredibly slick and experienced. It's a nice balance to have in a crime drama because when a someone does something uncharacteristic it makes it that much more interesting.As much as I love the females in this film, I have learned not to trust anyone in film-noir's and in particular the ladies. I'm not going to pretend I understand everything in The Big Sleep but I do know they leave it on enough of a cliffhanger to make me doubt several things with Bacall's character. But there are so many characters in general in The Big Sleep that I could just be getting confused with another blackmail or who wants to get who killed scenario. The great thing about the film though is it's re-watchability. I feel like I still have a whole lot to learn when it comes to this story. Which is another reason why I hope to see them eventually remake this classic. Not that I'm always for a remake, I'm not. But I do feel like one starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence would be quite good.+Star power +Bacalls maturity at such a young age +Makes you pay attention +Engaging plot (page turner if you will) -Perhaps too many characters 8.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Big Sleep" is a crime movie in which we watch a private detective who is hired by a rich family in order to deal with several problems that are troubling this family. As he tries to solve some of them he understands that everything happens for a reason and when he will find this reason he will solve all of the problems of this family.I liked this movie because it shows us what a private detective has to do to find some answers for his questions and in many occasions has to put at risk even his life. I also liked this movie because of the plot which I found very good with many swifts and I believe that these swifts give a different style in this movie and make it even more interesting and mysterious. Humphrey Bogart who played as the private detective Philip Marlowe was as good as I expected of him to be and I also liked the interpretation of Lauren Bacall who played as Vivian Rutledge and I have to say that her style of play gave a different beauty in this movie.Finally I have to say that "The Big Sleep" is a really good movie and I strongly recommend it not only because of all the above reasons but also because of the suspense that this movie has. I am sure that if you watch this movie then you will understand what I mean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Motion Picture Production Code and Chandler's own plot recycling ruined this picture, though it defined Humph as The Private Dick.Every time I've started watching The Big Sleep, I felt completely lost after the first twenty minutes. This is mainly due to the Code that forbade every mentioning of what the blackmail was all about viz. dirty pictures. This made the story quite unintelligible to me, as I could not figure out exactly why somebody was blackmailed by a guy who runs a bookstore that apparently is a cover for something else. My first notion was not pornography, but rather drugs, espionage, or just any sort of mob business, especially as it turns out that one of the murderers' name is Canino - Italian and mafioso-like.Once I read about the story, and got the explanation, I was overwhelmed by the feeling of tardiness: Of course, I should have figured this out! Then there's the latter half of the plot that moves around Bacall's dead husband. However, by the time Canino is shot, I usually start dozing, so I've never really watched it to the end without a blackout.Chandler merged two short stories into one novel because of the similar settings. Well, having seen the movie, this wasn't very surprising to learn. Strange method this recycling: the meaningfulness of reworking unpublished works is obvious enough, but in this instance both short stories were already published before The Big Sleep.Still, Chandler is Chandler, Bacall is Bacall, and Bogart certainly is Bogart.That's the reason why I probably will be watching this picture over and over again despite disliking the story, and the dozing...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't try to 'get the plot' ... the beauty of "The Big Sleep" is elsewhere...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I don't like your manners.", says Bacall, to which Bogart dryly retorts:"And I'm not crazy about yours. I didn't ask to see you. I don't mind if you don't like my manners, I don't like them myself. They are pretty bad. I grieve over them on long winter evenings. I don't mind your ritzing me drinking your lunch out of a bottle. But don't waste your time trying to cross-examine me."And if you want to know how long Bogie's tirade lasted, count how many seconds it took you to read it and divide it by then. That's "The Big Sleep", snappy and witty dialogs popping like corn seeds on a frying pan, delivered at the same speed the most experimented typist put them on the paper, with the little 'ding' at the end. There are chances that most of the lines won't be immediately gotten at the first viewing, but don't worry, the film is known for being very hard to follow, in plot and words.Still, isn't that the mark of great movies to have a little something that will inevitably make you eager to watch it again? Directed by Howard Hawks, "The Big Sleep" is one of these films where one experience isn't satisfying at all, especially story -wise, you feel the need to watch it again, because it's one of the most convoluted and complex plot you'll ever have to follow, just as if you were tailing a Jaguar, while driving a tractor. But the secret of its greatness is that while you watch it a second time to understand it better, you end up understanding why it's regarded as one of the greatest film noir, Bogart movies, American movies and stop caring about the plot.And why should we care about it, the plot is so complex that even the starting mission is liable to confuse viewers. Philip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler's most iconic creation, is engaged by an elderly general to look for a man who blackmails his daughter, he mentions some gambling debts and the mysterious disappearance of Shawn Regan, a former member of the IRA who worked for him, and Marlowe's army buddy. At that point of the film, we try to memorize their names, but a few scenes later, they'll only be part of a never-ending chain of events where each twist leads up to a new plot within a plot.A blackmailer using a library as a front for illegal activities, a slutty spoiled brat, Sternwood's youngest daughter, Carmen, magnificently played by Martha Vickers, a mysterious murder followed by the death of a chauffeur named Owen Taylor. No matter how focused you stay, you'll lose it sooner or later, depending on your attention span, the film is a real challenge for concentration. Yet there seems to be some logic in the way events follow each other. It seems to obey the same pattern, whoever possesses an information will immediately be killed before (sometimes unknowingly) giving part of it to Marlowe. The point is to use a gun to make them talk before someone will use it to silence them forever. Roles can be switched though, but the way to the solution is paved by warm cadavers. There's another pattern, every encounter with a female, is full of sexual innuendo, starting with an irresistible exchange with Dorothy Malone as the scene-stealing librarian, perhaps one of the most erotic Bogie moments, there's a sort of modern chemistry in the raving beauty of Malone, the way she twists her tongue, and innocently take off her glasses and loosen her hair, provoking the perfect reaction from Bogie "Hellooooo". And who can't resist to the female cab driver giving her number and telling him he can call any time. "Day or night?" "Night's better, I work during the day"I said in "To Have and Have Not", also directed by Hawks, that Bogie found his match in Bacall, on that level, "The Big Sleep" is one hell of a matchbox. Yet, if all the girls never quite overshadow Bacall, they're just here for the show, TO show Marlowd, the private eye, as a man with lots of charisma with women, but he doesn't fool around, he's got an obvious fondness on one of them, Viviane, Carmen's sister. It's still a Bogart and Bacall movie, so I just saved the best for last. Again, at a time where their romance wasn't secret anymore, Howard Hawks, the matchmaker, knew how to exploit their chemistry again and create another classic with the most legendary Hollywood couple. And the fact that is a Bacall movie is crucial for another reason; we know it'll lead up to our two leads in each other's arms, that's the point, so the rest, starting with the story, hardly matters. The merit of great movies is to reinvent the rules of screen writing, not everything has a point, except allowing the crime investigation to progress, and the only possible outcome is the romantic reunion, the climax of all these interludes where together, talk in coded messages, full of risqué innuendo, to better hide their feelings, whether it's a racy debate about horses, or a hilarious prank call that show how screen writing wasn't just meant to make the plot evolve.Legend has it that neither Bogart, nor Hawks knew who and how did the chauffeur die, not even the author ? but who cared what was in that black briefcase in "Pulp Fiction" or was 'Keyser Soze' a made up person or not ? some questions are better left unanswered, and that's part of their legend. And in a film whose only purpose is to showcase extraordinary abilities of screen writing transcended by tremendous acting talents, why being so orthodox about the rules of storytelling, confident writers make their own rules. It doesn't work with every movie, but in "The Big Sleep"'s case, it does. And how!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film Noir Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One might say "I wish I could follow what the plot of this is"? That would be understandable as nothing seems to be linear story-telling. All you have to know is there is an element of crime thriving on greed that is dressed up rather respectfully as the main player goes about manipulation. That manipulator is one Eddie Mars. He's a flashy sort running a nightclub fronting his illegal gambling. A fellow the sort of Mars believes he is untouchable and his other main interest is blackmailing the rich. The rich in this case is a old-guard type named Sternwood. Sternwood is vulnerable in that he has two rather ripe for the picking daughters. One nubile youth who craves male attention and another slightly older that can have almost any man yet prefers her Achilles heel of gambling. Mars takes advantage of both daughters and sets us an elaborate blackmail scheme that has worked once in the past so why not go to the well again? While providing the vehicle for the movie the blackmail scheme isn't laid out in a very comprehensible fashion. The bottom-line is this story gets the viewer confused.What delivers an overall great film is the chemistry and excellent acting of Bogart as P.I. Philip Marlowe and Lauren Bacall as his love interest, the eldest daughter of Sternwood. The film is propelled by action in lieu of that aforementioned confusing non-linear plot. The B&amp;W film-noir cinematography doesn't get any better than one will see here. Each scene is crafted well and the period oozes with fine detail. Everyone looks the absolute best in their roles, singularly brilliant casting!. The beautiful women are plentiful with Martha Vickers (the young Carmen Sternwood), Dorothy Malone ( a true grand career entrance for Lauren Bacall as Vivian Sternwood), and the captivating book shop proprietress played compactly and stunningly by the great Dorthy Malone. Of course beyond Bogie we know this exponentially brilliant cast is anchored by the new film ingénue Lauren Bacall. Yes, it is said this film was the catalyst for one of the iconic Hollywood true love stories between these two and it blossoms right on screen here.So, one must rate this a solid 8 out of 10 for overall excellence in spite of a story which, many times, just seems not to wholly make sense. This keeps the viewer a bit "off-balance" to create a bit of mystery and suspense which does work in the end due to Bogart and Bacall's almost unbelievably strong pairing. It's sometimes comical how Marlowe puts himself in deathly situations only to gain the upper hand coming out barely. Bogart is the only one who could pull this off and not look silly. This is one of the most classic examples of film-noir and, of course, can't be missed - even demanding to be watched repeatedly. Bogart shines, Bacall's star is born and the viewer is rapt within the two. An absolute must see film for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are just too many problems with this film for me to flip out about it like everybody else seems to. I don't think it should even be referred to as a pure noir. I have watched both versions and read the Cliff notes and the plot just about makes sense to me now. So OK forget the plot then, it is often less important than the style in noir. But the style isn't particularly memorable, it could have been a lot seedier even with the code restrictions. There is some great noir dialogue, at least in the 1946 released version, that alone clearly makes it worth seeing. I can't say if it the worst of the classic Philip Marlowe film adaptations but it is certainly not the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched this tonight for the umpteenth time. This viewing was to honour Ms Bacall, who died today.No matter how many times I see it, the convolutions of the plot still fascinate me. And it's so populated! Just when you think you must have met all the characters, a new one pops up, played by someone from that seemingly endless roster of Warner Bros specials, including Dorothy Malone who, as I write this, is with us still - probably the last member of the cast who is. Long may she remain so.Bogart and Bacall are great together, although in truth he's a little mechanical in some scenes in the movie. She, on the other hand, is always on the go, as is Martha Vickers as her off-kilter sister - a terrific, rather disturbing performance. And Charles Waldron, as the sisters' father, is equally though very differently splendid in his final film role, carrying the opening expository scene on his frail shoulders.It's a great pleasure to revisit this movie, so for those who have yet to see it, hurry, so you can see it again as soon as possible.RIP Betty Joan Perske.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best private detective movie since Chinatown and the Maltese Falcon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard Hawks' The Big Sleep focuses on the character of Philip Marlowe (played by Humphrey Bogart.) a private detective who was hired by a family to take on a blackmail case to find that the man who blackmailed Mrs. Rutledge's (played by Lauren Bacall) father ended up being murdered, but there is a lot mystery that goes on after the murder. not only it is a good crime story, it also is funny in one scene , and also works as a love story because of the good chemistry between Marlowe and Rutledge. Howard Hawks has directed another movie to be a great alongside his first movie that John Wayne did for him Red River (1948). As i said in the beginning of my review of Touch of Evil (19580 that it was one of the best Film-Noir movies i have seen in a long time which this movie goes on to that list as well thanks to Hawks' directorial genius with every genre of a movie that he has directed. As well as being one of the best book to film adaptations that i have seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great Chandler character study and a great love story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Big Sleep" is generally regarded as one of the very best Films Noirs - although, as many people quite rightly point out, many of the typical 'Noir' features are missing here. No dirty back streets, no heavy shadow effects, no desperate protagonist; and yet, the ESSENCE of Film Noir is there, more tangible maybe than even in most of the 'typical' Noirs: a degenerate world of crime and sex, characters cynical, mean, or mentally ill - it's one of 'tough novel' writer Raymond Chandler's great character studies, brought to the screen with absolute perfection, and with an absolutely fitting cast.I don't think it's of any use trying to explain the plot revolving around blackmail, love affairs and murder; insiders (and most fans as well) know that it's probably the most twisted one in film history - even Chandler himself didn't know who killed the chauffeur, for example. He just didn't care very much about the actual plot; he wanted to develop some very unique characters - and he certainly accomplished that. And ALL of the actors who played in the film adaptation certainly brought those characters to life! With first and best, of course, the protagonists, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall...As we know, they'd fallen in love with each other during the shooting of "To Have and Have Not"; it was obvious from the beginning that their chemistry was just PERFECT both on and off screen. When "The Big Sleep" was made in 1944/45, there still was the problem of Bogart's marriage, and it was a difficult time for the lovers, because Lauren Bacall literally had to FIGHT for her man - but she finally won, and they married soon after the end of the shooting. Now you could say that's only of interest for romantic Bogey&amp;Bacall fans like me - but the private struggle clearly shows in the ups and downs of the relationship of the movie characters, private eye Philip Marlowe and rich, spoiled Vivian Rutledge. Some scenes were added later (that's why the movie finally got released in 1946), like the 'racing horses dialog'; which Bogey and Bacall did with the ease and obvious enjoyment of a perfectly happy couple who has left their worries behind - although their characters hadn't accomplished that in the movie yet, of course...Seen purely as a film, "The Big Sleep" certainly ranks among the best Films Noirs - maybe it doesn't QUITE reach the class of "The Maltese Falcon" or "Double Indemnity", but it's a perfectly written, perfectly directed, and perfectly acted, dark and tough murder story, one of the great Classics, no doubt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few times I've seen a film which had an awful lot of things going on as this film presents. And i don't think that it was a good thing, quite the opposite: it was literally a film guided by dialogs, and not the cleverest ones.I meant, it's very hard to follow what's happening after a while. Even if you pay a lot of attention to the dialog, it will still confusing you. There are things that are never explained in the film, and the amount of characters that are presented and abruptly exits the story may as well confuse the viewer.Also, as a film itself, it don't has that much to offers beside the plot. The acting is very average, and so is the music, which perhaps is as well very cheesy. The cinematography was good sometimes, but left a lot to be wished.And what bothered me in the technical aspects was the lazy edition. Come on. The transition of the scenes sometimes were just plain bad, and sometimes there was even two cuts in different angles from the same scene, without any continuity, to worse the things.But fine. It had a good interesting theme despite being way too confusing. It's about a complex scenario of a death and it's consequences that all the characters suffered. There is a lot of changes from the novel it was adapted,mostly due to the censorship that wouldn't allow a few things to go too far. The romantic trace in the relationship between Marlowe and Vivian would be impossible to transfer integrally from the book to the big screen, because Vivian was a married character in the book and there was a law in USA at the time which wouldn't allow the depiction of marital infidelity in the film.Anyways...it's a very watchable film, despite all his complexities and also despite not explaining too much for the viewer. 7.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A somewhat needlessly over-confusing detective plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoiler/plot- 1946, L.A. private detective, Phillip Marlowe takes on a blackmail case and follows the trail of murder, pornographers, nightclub gangsters, and spoiled rich society people.*Special Stars- Humpfrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall. Dir: Howard Hawks. Screenplay written by William Faulkner and company.*Theme- Money breeds graft and corruption in many circles, low income and high society ones.*Based on- Film noir detective books of Raymond Chandler*Trivia/location/goofs- Very early on-camera screen appearance of Dorothy Malone as the bookshop clerk. Shot entirely on the Warner studio lot and sound stages on purpose by Mr. Hawks to keep the audience guessing of the plot development in Los Angeles. Bogart was shorter than both leading ladies so through his wearing platform shoes and some camera tricks by standing in the camera foreground &amp; being on grip department 'apple boxes', his tall stature was achieved for the scene shots. Bacall's performance in the '44/'45 version was pumped-up with new Hawks re-shoots and his final editing. It was to be finally released in '46. Some original scenes were shot in late 1944 with the War coming to a close. This film was shelved to get all of Warner's war related films into exhibition theaters before the war was over.*Emotion- A somewhat over confusing detective plot and re-edited film of the film noir detective genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very interesting movie. Philip is a private detective hired by a wealthy family. Don't wanna give away the plot but its got it all. Suspense, romance, murder,blackmail, mystery. Has your classic old fashioned P.I movie to it. I found myself very immersed in this movie. Once again Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of Philip proves just what a fantastic actor he truly is. Thevery dramatic lighting/use of darkness in this movie really helped to build the suspense I think.Sometimes the plot would slow down, and feel a little lagging. Kind of scattered if you will. But other than that it really is a great movie that is definitely worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was certainly an interesting movie. Starting to first watch the movie, I thought there would be a lot of mystery and detective work. It certainly had a lot of mystery and detective work in it. The two contrasts of female characters in the beginning gave you the idea that there would be something later on and it was. Each situation fit their personality which caused it to seem more real. The detective seemed to know what he was doing and always seemed to realize something at the same time or before the viewer would notice. The lighting and camera work in the movie kept you watching. Especially with the use of lighting. The lighting helped set the mood for the scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of The Big Sleep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My thoughts before watching this movie were "it has to be good if Howard Hawks directed it." The film was good, however the storyline was complex, and a little hard to follow. The depth of the plot makes it hard to comprehend what is taking place in the film. Although, the film was still enjoyable. Although the film is basically about a criminal investigation, there's a sexy/romantic feel that I think makes the film appealing to a larger audience, than the typical "action" film. The Big Sleep is a great film noir, and it's play with light, makes it easy to appreciate that it's black and white. Howard Hawks is know for his remarkable films, and although I wish this one fell into that category, it just didn't for me. The cinematography and overall feel of the film is good, but to me, it's nothing that hasn't been done before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart is the definitive Philip Marlowe!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with The Maltese Falcon I believe this film is one of the greatest film noirs ever made. Humphrey Bogart is Philip Marlowe, and although he never played the role again, I picture him as Marlowe in all of Chandler's other novels when I read them. Lauren Bacall and Martha Vickers also do a great job of portraying Vivian and Carmen Sternwood.Even though this is not the most faithful of books to screen stories that have been made, it captures the spirit of the novel perfectly, especially because of Bogart's portrayal of the cynical, yet chivalrous private eye.One small criticism however I think it was such a great shame that the film makers decided not to have Marlowe narrate the story as in the original novel, with Bogart's, deep, cynical hard boiled style voice, it really would have been wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogie and Bacall make this muddled mystery a treat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm an admirer of Raymond Chandler but I confess I've never actually read 'The Big Sleep' so I can't comment on whether this is a good ADAPTATION, but as a movie experience it's undeniably great entertainment. The plot is pretty muddled (even Chandler himself didn't know who killed one character!) but I don't think anyone really cares because the end result is so damn entertaining. In fact I don't think the basic blackmail plot is even all that interesting, 'Farewell My Lovely' (the book) is much better in my opinion, with more original twists and characters. The reason this movie is so much fun can be summed up in three words - Bogie and Bacall. They are just a fantastic duo, with lots of on screen chemistry, and trade some classic lines (not surprising with both William Faulkner and SF pulp legend Leigh Brackett among the writers). Bacall looks totally stunning and her on screen sister Martha Vickers is very easy on the eye also (something Michael Winner's misguided 1970s remake really botched). I don't think Bogart is cerebral enough to play Philip Marlowe, but I'm willing to overlook it in this case. I prefer Dick Powell's Marlowe in 'Murder, My Sweet'. I don't think 'The Big Sleep' is as outstanding as others 1940s Noir classics like 'Out Of The Past' and 'Double Indemnity', but for sheer entertainment value it's hard to beat. If you like detective stories you're in for a treat. 'The Big Sleep' is one of the most entertaining movies of its type.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A confusing mess of a plot...but who cares!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an odd case of the film's style and acting being so good that it made up for huge plot holes in the film. Even those who love this film like I do will usually honestly admit that the murder mystery is muddled and made little sense. However, this doesn't really seem to matter that much since the mood, acting and dialog are so exceptional, this seems to be a film that can even overcome plot problems.The best part about this film, by far, is Humphrey Bogart. His Phillip Marlowe is terrific--sarcastic, tough and blunt. Hearing him spit out great one-liners is something you just have to see to believe and even some of the minor scenes (such as the one in the book shop) come off wonderfully due to his characterization. It sure helped that he was ably assisted by a great supporting staff (especially Lauren Bacall), but even without them this would have been a first-rate film due to Bogey.The direction also deserves a lot of credit. Howard Hawkes sure did a good job of setting the Film Noir atmosphere. Exceptional camera work, music, lighting and pacing all made this a sit on the edge of your seat type of film.As for the story, Marlowe is called in to help a rich old man find a missing friend. However, what happens next and all the twists and turns just don't add up to a lot--especially when you find out who did the crime and why. But don't worry--you can actually look past this!! By the way, although I loved Bogart, I also really loved Robert Montgomery's version of this character in THE LADY IN THE LAKE. While not necessarily better or worse than Bogey's version of the character, he was nastier and more sarcastic (while Bogart was a little more self-confident and tough). In fact, I am shocked this other movie isn't just as famous as THE BIG SLEEP--it definitely deserves to be and would make a great double-feature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It started off nicely. Having read some Chandler books, it was interesting to see Bogart doing the role of Marlowe. The dialog totally reeked of that hard-boiled style all us noir fans love. There was some really clever and nicely done dialog sequences early on. Problem was, though,...at least for me, the plot was all over the place. And the movie was just too long. I kept wondering what the hell was going on at some parts. Just too many references to other people and too many names to grab hold of.And while the scenes with Bogart and Bacall are legendary, wasn't she a bit young for him? lol All in all, not bad, but definitely not the 'classic' I'd been led to believe this was. IMHO, of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not such a deadheaded movie watcher that I have to watch films three times to "get" them, so I can't explain why I would watch "The Big Sleep" three times and still not "get" it. I can follow the plot easily enough, although it seems like a drudgery. I have no problem with the characters as they're written, and the actions they take throughout. I think the reason I get so bored with this movie has to do with the main creative talents in it.Otherwise, I have kind things to say about Howard Hawks ("Scarface," "Rio Bravo," "Bringing up Baby") as well as Humphrey Bogart ("Casablanca," "The African Queen") and Lauren Bacall (can't remember what I've seen her in, and as good looking as she is, that probably means I've never seen another of her movies, so maybe I'm stretching it to say I have kind things to say), but in this movie, the overly gentle pacing and lack of any sort of score to stir my cinemaphiliac soul I blame on the director, and the apathy I feel for Philip Marlowe and Vivian Rutledge as they wander through this bitter drama I blame on Humphrey and Lauren. They deliver their lines well enough, but it seems even they don't have any sympathy for the characters they're supposed to play.It's mildly pleasant to watch, but it's so far away from the better film noir I've seen (nothing touches "Double Indemnity") and not even the best Marlowe ever filmed (Elliott Gould in Robert Altman's "The Long Goodbye") that I can't credit it with being an interesting film or a very watchable movie. Three times was enough to still not "get" whatever is so great about this movie. I will be very desperate to ever give it a fourth watching.</fullReview>

I've always been immune to the charms of Bacall. So all in all, this movie left little impression on me.It's enjoyable as yet one more entry in that hard-boiled detective genre that was so in vogue at the time, but it's not one of the more memorable examples of it.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delectable Maze of Guns and Girls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only a tick after the Warner Brothers logo and theme song fill the room do the silhouettes of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall appear, trading cigarettes, exuding the allure only found behind the angular sunglasses of a dragon lady or a glamorized goon. Their names then appear with the rush of a bold statement; in 1946, they were the titles of stars, of top- drawer actors. In 2015, they're godly, legendary, untouchable. As the shadowed bodies, the gigantic names, and the dangling cigarettes of the leads appear before the title of the movie itself, a tone is already established. The Big Sleep will be a film in which Bogie and Bacall prefer slippery chats over liquor and smoke to breathy romance; it will be a film in which style, wit, and danger come first and intelligibility follows second.The Big Sleep is perhaps the film noir, the quintessential Bogart and Bacall pairing, the movie that sidestepped the sunniness of all those Technicolor, 1940s morale boosters in trade of something almost unhinged in its cool. It was the film that initially showed me just how beguiling actors could be, how captivating pure cinema could be, how bewitching dialogue could be. I've seen The Big Sleep twenty times or so (who's counting?), but each viewing brings some new discovery unnoticed by the previous undertaking. My last was an attempt to introduce my sister to its enticing world. This time around, some months later, I find myself re-enchanted by the chemistry between Bogart and Bacall, more appreciative of the silky screenplay. Each viewing changes ? some are out of a nostalgic need, some are out of a desire to consume flawless filmmaking ? but one thing always remains the same: no film has ever matched The Big Sleep's unflagging ability to excite.This is an amazing accomplishment for a film that doesn't make any sense ? famously, the author of the novel, the incomparable Raymond Chandler, had a hard time deciding if a major character had been killed or had committed suicide ? but one doesn't worry about plot twists or big payoffs here. We become so wrapped up in the stunning rapport between the leads (to be married after completion) and the quick (but razor sharp) dialogue that it's easy to forget that films normally, you know, make sense. It's not a case of style over substance but rather style with substance that gives us many memorable moments that just so happen to lead to nowhere. But those moments.It's the story of a private detective, Phillip Marlowe (Bogart), and a case given to him by the poisonously wealthy General Sternwood (Charles Waldron). It seems that one of Sternwood's wild daughters, Carmen (Martha Vickers), has put herself in the middle of a blackmailing scheme, and the girl, thumb-sucking and Lolita-esque, is too na?ve to get herself out of the racket. Marlowe, sardonic and clever, is the perfect man for the job ? but the case, as it turns out, is much more complicated than it appears to be. It also, unfortunately, involves a murdered pornographer (Theodore von Eltz), a secretive gambling-house proprietor (John Ridgely), Sternwood's other daughter, Vivian (Bacall), who Marlowe is attracted to, and more shady figures.As Marlowe wanders around in this muddled labyrinth of captivation, it's difficult to keep up with his thoughtful antics; but it isn't hard to find ourselves smitten with the hard-boiled world Howard Hawks and his congregation of screenwriters (including William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, and Jules Furthman) concoct for us. Enhanced by Max Steiner's fierce score, interludes don't slow things down but rather keep the swiftness of everything intact; scenes, in the meantime, are brimming with such fantastic exchanges that it's difficult not to laugh along with the virtuosic lines the actors challenge each other with.And if the actors aren't part of the atmosphere, then they're sticking out of it, making it. Whereas Bacall stole scenes from Bogart in 1944's To Have and Have Not, her career defining debut, in The Big Sleep they are equal, equally sensational. Bogart played several interesting men in his long career, but Phillip Marlowe is one of his most intriguing parts, surely among his finest performances. He can spit out lines at a machine gun pace, all the while cherishing Marlowe's dexterity, having fun with it. And though only Bacall's second movie (filmed before 1945's Confidential Agent, which nearly destroyed her blossoming career), she is a presence in the same way Dietrich or Garbo were in their early days: positively magnetic and unlike anything else found on theater screens of the time. Together, Bogart and Bacall almost set the camera on fire, and not just during love scenes; their real-life romance makes every scene throb with intrigue, and it still shows today. Supporting performances, particularly from the underrated Martha Vickers and Sonia Darrin, make huge statements, no matter how small the part.Almost 70 years later, The Big Sleep remains vital. It's a landmark in the personal lives of its stars, a landmark in cinema, and a landmark work for a director so versatile that Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and Red River are completely separate yet somehow fronted by the same man. I'll probably watch it twenty more times, but until then, The Big Sleep is one of the best films ever made.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a Classic film that you can see over and over again and never get tired of the plot and the magic that Bogart &amp; Bacall bring to the screen. They were married in 1945 and were the talk of the town, "He is Old enough to be her Father", was the main conversation when this film was shown. However, Humphrey Bogart(Philip Marlowe)"Dead End",'37, was the best private eye in this series, many actors played his role, but could not compare. Lauren Bacall(Vivian Sternwood Rutledge),"Misery",'90 put her magic to work in this picture and in those days, was extremely sexy and hot with her real life husband in almost every scene of the film. Dorothy Malone,"Too Much,Too Soon",'58 was very beautiful and the sexy blond who gave Vivian a hard time and was a great supporting actress. Bob Steele,(Canino),"Requiem For A Gun Fighter",'65 was a cold and blood thirsty HOOD who gave Marlowe a few lumps on the head. Bob Steele was a great veteran Western star and his career was starting to phase out during this period in time. Regis Toomey(Chief Insp. Bernie Ohls),"Guys &amp; Dolls",'55, another veteran film actor tried to keep Marlowe in line and save his neck out of murder. This is a must see Bogart Film with lots of action in B&amp;W, which makes it perfect for the year in which is was produced. ENJOY!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Faulkner's screenplay is NOT good. The movie is really not a lot like the novel. Now, that shouldn't be a knock, but the novel makes much more sense than this muddle of Hollywoodized caricatures of Chandler's tale.The whole thing got cooked into this tongue-in-cheek Bogey/Bacall thing, because of the success of To Have and Have Not, and so they hyped up the Bogey Sex Appeal at the sacrifice of the story, which is about a lady who can't keep her clothes on when cameras are around, and whose husband is "missing".**Analogy: Chandler's Big Sleep is to Filet Mignon, as Hawk's Big Sleep is to BK Broiler.**I love Hawk's work in the antic comedy area, but between his hammy directing and Faulker's (give me another mint julep *hic* honey) flat, canned screenplay, this is just a Screen Giant Personality Fest.It was cute in To Have and Have Not, but give me a freaking' break. Where's the life-and-death in this thing? Film Noir? The only thing "Noir" about this was that it was "Blanc-Noir".Jim</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second teaming of Bogart and Bacall is no disappointment after 'To Have and Have Not'. This movie positively crackles with the sparks between these two, and if the plot is confusing and decidedly secondary, well, who cares? Of the three Marlowe films in the 40s, this might well be the least like the books, but as a 40s classic it is never boring, has some great supporting players, a few nice twists, and a good dose of humour (I particularly like the mock phone call made to the police department). But who did kill the chauffeur? Who killed Sean Regan? What's it all about? Good fun though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacalle teamed to make 4 films together in their illustrious careers. Guess what? Other than 1948's "Key Largo," the other 3 were first class stinkers and "The Big Sleep" is absolutely no exception.To say that the plot is muddled and confusing is to put it mildly. The guys drop like flies as the bullet flies. The film should have ended when it appeared that the first two murders had been solved. Instead, it goes on and on with more shooting and much more confusion. By the end, you don't know really who did what and it was a relief to hear those police sirens as Bogie and Lauren embraced-you knew it was the end.This film noir faded to black all right! You really have to blame Raymond Chandler's writing for this colossal bomb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>confusing 'who dunnit'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of mystery 'who dunnit' films, so perhaps I may score this too low. On the other hand, any really good film, a film that endures through generations, does so because it has universal appeal.Well, I'm part of the universe and it didn't appeal. For one, I got confused, confused over the essential part of a 'who dunnit'. That is, who killed who and why. This picture just ends up with too many dead bodies and too many suspects with too many motives. After a while, you lose track. Presumably the most satisfying aspect of a 'who dunnit' is knowing who killed who in the end and why. This leaves you unsatisfied.So a lesson to writers ? don't have too many bodies or suspects. A reader, or viewer, shouldn't have to keep a chart to keep track. Keep the story simple and focused. If you must have the necessary 'dead ends' or 'false trails' make sure they don't blur the essential truth of your story.Also, I haven't watched black and white since I was a kid. As an adult, and one involved in film, I can see an essential weakness ? the night time scenes. Night scenes in black and white lose too much detail, especially around the periphery of the screen. Oft times it's like your peering through a keyhole. And the contrast is either too jagged or too blurred, depending on how the scene is shot.Not really a legitimate critique, just an observation, like seeing the black face actors in 'Birth of Nation'. As modern viewers we've grown accustomed to better film technique.</fullReview>
