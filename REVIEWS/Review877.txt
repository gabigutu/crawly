		<shortDescription>The Culture War goes to summer camp.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film at the Silverdocs festival, expecting it to be little more than an oddball slice of Americana, but I was pleasantly surprised."Jesus Camp" revolves around a pentecostal minister who hosts a summer camp for children in North Dakota, and the sectarian Christian conservative families who send their children to this camp. Directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady wisely chose to avoid the polemical tone of most politically-motivated films, and instead opt to present a mostly unfiltered glimpse of this odd subculture. But through carefully selected images and the use of talk radio commentary as a framing device, they construct a subtle, yet damning narrative about a religious movement that isolates its children from mainstream culture, indoctrinates them into right-wing causes, and uses them as political props.At Jesus Camp, the daily activities include standard camp fare such as spelunking and go-karts, but they also include speaking in tongues and smashing coffee mugs emblazoned with the word "government". Children learn that "science doesn't prove anything," and learn to consider themselves part of an Army of God. They are compelled to pledge that they will fight to end abortion. They are even pushed into publicly confessing their impure thoughts, and many of them cry and wail charismatically.The camp director explains that she admires the way Islamic cultures raise children so devoted they will risk their lives for their faith. When we ultimately see several of the campers being placed by their parents on the steps of the Capitol with tape over their mouths, protesting abortion, the real purpose of this camp is driven home.But the most touching scenes are the ones where the children are alone, and we see the ways that this indoctrination creeps into the most innocent elements of childhood. 11 year old Tori loves dancing to Christian rock, but frets that it's not always easy to dance for God instead of "dancing for the flesh." On an outing to the bowling alley, 9 year old Rachael feels compelled to walk up to strangers and awkwardly evangelize to them, without being prompted. A roomful of boys telling ghost stories after dark are interrupted by an adult who warns them about stories that don't glorify God.No doubt some viewers will accuse the filmmakers of the dreaded liberal bias. But this is not a work of fiction, nor is it slanted reporting. These are real people and real events, captured on film. If the evangelical movement comes off badly in this film, the people on screen have no one but themselves to blame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Child Abuse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film made my hair stand on end and I came away from it thinking that the adults in it ought to be indicted for child abuse. These children are being intellectually immobilized in the name of goodness and purity. Do they really think they are superior to other young religious zealots who study nothing but their holy book but who are not Christians? It seems that children ought to be exposed to all the wonders of the world instead of being told that their job is to point out the errors of others. Children are highly impressionable and mostly believe what adults tell them. We can only hope that some of these children get some exposure to reality later which will help them live productive and caring lives as people who can accept the world's diversity. The prospects are not good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be categorized "Documentary/Horror"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is really a horror movie. It's comparable to The Ring and Emily Rose.I thought we were living in the 21st century. This movie reminds me more of the 16th.On one hand, this movie is an unforgettable experience, like a dive into darkness. On the other hand, you're left asking yourself - "am I a sadist? I'm watching little kids getting tortured, brainwashed, their lives getting deformed". When you watch this movie, the first thing you want to do is go to IMDb and write a review about it.So,If you're in a happy mood right now, don't watch this movie.If you want chills down your spine, by all means, watch it!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating look into evangelical subculture through the eyes of children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film at SilverDocs, a documentary film festival at the American Film Institute in Silver Spring. It's excellent, and I highly recommend it.The basic storyline follows a year in the lives of three children from evangelical Christian families in Missouri, and focuses considerably on their experience at an evangelical summer camp ("Kids on Fire" in Devil's Lake, ND). The kids, 12-year-old Levi, 10-year-old Tory, and 9-year-old Rachel are, of course, endearing in their cuteness, but frightening in their fervor. Levi thinks that he will become a pastor, and his preaching to kids is starkly reminiscent of the Bible thumpers of Sunday morning TV. At camp, Tory is shown several times with tears streaming down her face, not least when a pro-life leader comes and distributes miniature plastic fetuses to illustrate the evil of abortion and again when many kids at camp begin speaking in tongues. Rachel, a nine-year-old evangelist, walks up to perfect strangers to ask them if they believe they're going to heaven and whether they would like to talk about Jesus. In short, the kids are the perfect spokespeople for the Jesus movement.The documentary goes beyond their experiences at camp and paints a vivid image of the evangelical subculture in middle America. From scenes with a mother home schooling her son on the lunacy of evolution to kids at camp praying fervently for a cardboard cutout of George W Bush, the tenacious beliefs of the subjects and their utter lack of doubt is striking. The infusion of politics into religion is also notable, as the children are told of the evils of homosexuality, that prayer in school is necessary for schools to teach effectively, and that America is responsible for the deaths of fifty million innocent children since 1973. The families even travel to Washington to protest in front of the Supreme Court building.The most awkward parts of the movie were scenes with Mike Papantonio, an Air America radio host. I felt the scenes involving him seemed a little forced, although a conversation at the end between the charismatic camp director, Becky Fischer, and Papantonio was an interesting microcosm of the larger political debate in this country. Interestingly, during a film festival question and answer session with the producers (Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady), they indicated that Papantonio was a late addition to the film because without him, there was no conflict. The people in the film were so sure of their beliefs that nothing in the movie showed them wavering. I wonder if the film might not have been stronger if they had left that sense of certainty alone.Ewing and Grady also chose to use the nomination of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court as a thread to tie the film together. Unfortunately, none of the subjects of the documentary spent much time talking directly about the Supreme Court. They talked about some of the issues that the Supreme Court might deal with, but the nomination of judges didn't seem to be a big factor in their lives. There were a few scenes in which radio announcers and guest speakers at the camp encouraged the families to pray for the nomination of judges who agree with evangelical Christians, but I didn't think that there was enough to hold that particular thread together.During the question and answer session, Ewing and Grady indicated that while they were both fairly secular, big city Democrats, they honestly liked the people in the documentary. In their view, the people in the documentary followed the law, and they worked to make the country better as they saw it, so what's wrong with that? They expressed interest in making a follow-up movie in five years to see whether the kids' faith survives puberty. It would certainly be an interesting experiment. They indicated that Fischer and the families that were profiled had seen the final project and thought that it was a fair representation of their lives. Fischer even thought that she could use it as an evangelical tool! At the same time, the audience I saw it with was overwhelmingly liberal and they also reacted positively (and, I'll say, with a fair degree of shock). To me, that says that Ewing and Grady did a nice job of ensuring that their biases did not show through into the movie, leaving audiences to read into it as they choose.In sum, Jesus Camp is a movie that is worth watching. If you get a chance, see this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enter the world of Jesus Camp, a brilliant documentary that chronicles the life of several people who attend or set up a "Jesus Camp" in (ironicaly) Devils Lake North Dakota.Filmmakers Heidi Ewing, and Rachel Grady decide to focus mostly on the children that attend, with some focus on minister Becky Fisher who is one of the main architects of the camp.Right away the filmmakers show a growing underlying change in the evangelical movement, to politicize their beliefs. Voice overs start talking about the newest supreme court nomination of Alito. However, once the focus starts on the kids who attend the camp the film gets its bearing.What becomes obvious is that paranoia and fear is driven into the kids. There is Ashley a young girl, and Levi an older boy who seems to be on the quest to become a minister and preacher himself. It's obvious he likes the attention that is given him. But the kids are still kids, Levi and his friend go out into the woods and do what all kids do, explore find a scary spider, Levi even mentions, I like to throw rocks.But then they are back in lessons again, scarred out of their boots in a sermon as they are being told to stay away from Harry Potter, abortion, and that they are essentially dirty from all the sins they carry. Most of them can't hold back the tears. Levi mentions he said he was saved when he was 5 years old (I can only think of the horrible things that he must have been guilty of to be converted (too much sugar cereal maybe?) ) The filmmakers do the smart thing and let the pictures and words speak for themselves. There is no voice over narration, no probing questions from the film-makers to the subjects themselves. There is no debate. The words from the kids just come out, and they are frightening. A sense of brainwashing can only be observed as the kids talk about how they have to fight in gods army, and that everyone else has to be 'purged'. Never mind that at one point kids are worshiping at a card board cut out of George Bush.Some scenes literally look like they could have came from the movie "Triumph of the Will".But the brilliance is shown in the innocence that these children loose and don't seem to enjoy in. What young kid needs to know about abortion? or be cleansed of all the horrors of the world? Why can't the kids just make up their own minds with everything but in front of them? When do kids ever get to just.... play? They are hints in the film at that, kids will be kids, little late night camp ghost stories, some break dancing.. it's all in good fun, and perfectly fine.But it seems like Jesus camp just wants to crush their spirits.Kudos to the film-makers for showing it real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was further proof how far off base militant evangelicalism has become</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this a qualified 7. I give it for the quality of the work in creating this documentary. If I was to rate it because of its subject, I would be dealing with negative numbers! I used to be an ordained minister, a Pentecostal one. This film was very painful for me, for it addressed all the things about modern evangelicalism that is wrong and gave further proof of why hundreds of thousands of evangelicals are leaving organized religion, and are embracing a simpler form of Christianity, one that is relational and community focused, and one that is not political, seeking to see the arm of government Christianized, but rather one has a powerful social element, seeking social change through loving and helping people in our society.My wife has home-schooled our two daughters all the way through high school. I thank God they are not like these kids. In fact when my kids watched the film they were equally concerned about kids being conditioned and brainwashed! I agreed with them. God has not called children into the work of evangelism, or to be warriors as portrayed in this film. Evangelism is the work of those who are adults and young adults. Children are never shown to be workers in God's Kingdom in the New Testament. We ought to follow that model, rather than brainwashing and abusing children! I am sickened by this film.Theologically I am equally disturbed by this film. It portrays that evangelicals have held certain beliefs "forever" which is far from the truth. Foundational to the premise of modern evangelicalism is the "teaching" concerning the pre-tribulational rapture of the church. This doctrine is one of the newest, and it was created by and espoused by people who at one time were heretics, and yet is has become the vehicle that drives this engine to have an "end time revival" where these kids will help usher in the Kingdom of God.My parents were missionaries, as were my in-laws. They gave their adult lives to the cause of Christ (between 45-47 years of ministry). They believed the same doctrine. Jesus was coming at any time. "Don't lay a nest egg for your grandkids!" "Don't conserve the environment, because as soon as Jesus comes, we are out of here!" "Don't save your money, go ahead use credit, for when you are in the rapture, you won't have to pay the bank!" My parents became disappointed when disease came to the door, and illness overtook them, and when death took home the husbands! There was despair, because Jesus did not come to rescue them.This is the same kind of despair that will overcome these kids who have been brainwashed and abused by these whacko charismatics. I was one. I know how people condition you to respond a certain way.There is NOTHING remotely like New Testament Christianity in this film. When the pastor compares what she is doing, to what fundamentalist Islam is doing in brainwashing Muslim children, she was correct. These poor kids of evangelical parents are being manipulated and brainwashed, and are as whacko as those who exploit Muslim children. Two wrongs don't make a right.This film reveals the whacky morality and bad theological world view that exists not only in America, but in Evangelicalism in Canada, and the UK as well. It is a theology that on one hands believes that our countries can be saved by using our children in the propagation of the gospel, through revival and advancing the Kingdom of God. This is not the work of children, and this makes all of this so immoral. Also, it crosses the line where Christians think, falsely, that if they gain political power, that somehow they will be able to Christianize their nations. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Should this ever happen in my country (Canada - I am a Brit who came to Canada with missionary parents, to plant churches in Canada), I would be the first to oppose it, for it would become tyranny and oppression. The ways of the world, including the use of government, is not the way God advances His Kingdom.God is not in the oppression business, but the liberation business, and more than anything, our kids need to be liberated from this kind of brainwashing! I am ashamed of having been a Pentecostal Evangelical! This film should be used by libertarians and true democrats, be they Christian, secular, or of another faith community, to reveal how dangerous a political Evangelical movement can be, and how dangerous it is to the very idea of a free and open society. Be forewarned this film will disturb you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It makes sense that this film came out in October, as it is the scariest movie I've seen in a loooooong time.I was a little nervous at first because I assumed that most of the people there would be uber conservative, but when the camp leader screamed, "If Harry Potter had lived during Biblical times he would have been put to death," and everyone laughed at her absurdity, I knew it was going to be okay.The "funniest" part was when a really young girl, no more than 9, approached these three older men outside the nation's capital and asked them "If you died *right now* do you know where you would go?"The men said, "yes." No inflection to their voices, no emotion."Are you *sure*? she pressed, desperate for a chance to proselytize."Yes," they said again, calm as you please.She walked off muttering, "I think they're Muslim." LOL! It was hilarious! Then she asked her young friend, "Do you think they think we're trying to sell something?" The whole theater burst out laughing.The best part was when the kids gathered around a card board cut out of George W. Bush, asking God to give him wisdom. If only....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is real footage from the 21th century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary offers a rare chance to get a close view inside a not very well known society within our society. I thought the content was very honest, and - although this is not the kind of movie people watch for entertainment value - I would like to point out that this is also a very well made film, and certainly never dull or boring. Religious communities are not often very open towards journalists or filmmakers; they fear - probably with good reason - that their portrayal by the secular media is biased and that their believes are depicted in the wrong light. However, in this documentary the filmmakers were granted full access, and the evangelical community whose portrayal you get to see in the film got the chance to see it first before it was released to the general public. They thought it was an accurate depiction of their lifestyle and their believes. What you see in this film is not staged - this is real, 21th century footage. Highly recommended. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intolerance Camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one thing which "Jesus Camp" reveals, it is the extent to which some adults will rob children of a normal childhood in order to foster their own politico-religious agenda. The children in this film are not being inculcated with moral and spiritual values; they are being manipulated into quasi-religious hysteria. In the name of a warped sense of religiosity the adults in this film are deliberately creating cadres of Christianist "yes men." This isn't faith; it's hypnosis.I do not doubt the good intentions of parents who indoctrinate their children from an early age with principles of religion; after all, the Catholic Church has encouraged this for centuries, and there are wonderful religious schools of all types which provide a strong moral and ethical education to our children. Giving children a foundation of values is invaluable. However, the religio-political cultism demonstrated in this film is beyond the pale. I can guarantee you that if those parents in the film had been born Muslim rather than Christian they would be at the forefront of such practices as stoning and clitoral circumcision. If that's what their particular Good Book calls for, they are all for it. It sure saves thinking for oneself. At the very least, those who survive this kind of cultist indoctrination may turn out to be psychologically disturbed or emotionally impaired. The children of "Jesus Camp" are the kinds of people who wind up as bigots, informers, and lovers of authoritarianism, and who join the myriad of "holier-than-thou" types who already populate American so-called Christianity. These children may never be able to think for themselves. If they do eventually see through this well-intentioned nonsense, they can wind up as the kind of obnoxious hypocrites which they themselves would be quick to condemn.What an astounding coincidence, then, that one of those very kinds of people shows up for quite a while towards the end of film. Ted Haggard, Evangelical pastor and newly confessed drug-buyer and patron of "male-massage", is seen counseling a young boy on how to play upon his youth in order to spread the Word. You can already see the young boy fawning over his adult admirers and saying whatever he thinks will please them and bring him a measure of recognition. That's the insidious thing about the "Jesus Camp", the kids really want to please their adult trainers. As for Haggard, in the spirit of Christian love and forgiveness he's already been kicked out of his Church. No turn-the-other-cheek Amish among that bunch. Can't have a guy like Haggard hanging around - especially now that he's been found out. As for the adults who encourage slavish indoctrination of their children, I think they would have been more comfortable in 1930's Spain, Italy, or Germany. Each of those countries had its cadre of young, true believers, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual documentary; people at polar extremes like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very unusual movie. It's likely to be LOVED by many Christian fundamentalists as well as valued by many who strongly oppose that movement, each side feeling it gives ample evidence for their positions. Its low rating (at the time this is written) is at first puzzling; its most frequent rating (28%) given is a "10". This gets offset by the next most frequent rating (22%) given -- "1". But considering that (at the time this is written) 56% rated this film a 10, 9, or 8, the majority of people view this as a very valuable, worthwhile to see film -- a view I share. Many of those who rated it a "1" did so in opposition to the movement while still saying it's a worthwhile film to see.It's most valuable to see by those who are NOT fundamentalists to understand a growing and already substantial movement of which most are not aware exists.I strongly urge those people to also read Michelle Goldberg's recent book "Kingdom Coming" about this movement. Very readable, very enlightening, it details the scope of this that those who are not directly involved otherwise would not be aware of.Francis F (a Japanese name; the IMDb anti-obscenity editing program will automatically "bleep" it if I typed it) wrote "The End of History &amp; the Last Man" maybe 15-20 years ago and he's recently updated it with an Epilogue. I found it a hard book to read so scanned much of it. But he did predict the rise of fundamentalist, conservative, reactionary religious movements such as we see in both fundamentalist Islam and fundamentalist Chrisitianity. One thesis he advances is that the world is changing so fast it's threatening the adjustment of many cultures and sub-cultures. Their core beliefs are not being given opportunity to slowly evolve but are threatened with being breached like the New Orleans levees (my metaphor, not his). Their reaction is to substitute Sharia (Islamic) law or "Christian" Biblical law instead of western secular law. My friend who accompanied me was not worried about these kids in the movie. She felt that when they became teens, most would leave behind these beliefs because of the pressure from other teens as well as emerging hormones. I'm not as sanguine. While that will be an effect on a few, these kids are being as indoctrinated just as much as (or more than) the Hitler Youth. Peer pressure works both ways -- when they're mainly around others with the same background, that will serve to keep most in line.Scary AND a very informative movie.PS -- Whether or not you're a member of the Christian Funadamentalist/Evangelical Right OR those who oppose them, you may be interested in this out-take from the film the link to which was posted on the IMDb "Message Board" View it AFTER you've seen the movie. ONLY then will it make sense.: http://youtube.com/watch?v=6B9GlayKS_0&amp;mode=related&amp;search=</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jesus Camp is serious business.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film intrigued me for several reasons: First it is filmed in my home state of Missouri, not the deep south as so many people think, in fact it is filmed near Kansas City.The film is a well-presented view from the perspective of the ultra conservative, Evangelical movement. It is honest in its intent. Minister, Becky Fischer, is honest in her goals for the camp and its attendees.I did find that the film seemed to play fast and loose with numbers. For example it is stated that 75% of all home schooled children are evangelical. I come from a liberal background and have many well-educated friends who home school and none of them are evangelical so I am skeptical about their claim.As one might expect, statements are made such as "there is no such thing as global warming" and that "all homosexuals are going to hell." That doesn't surprise me. The fact that not one of the adults or children questions any of these statements or offers to provide proof or seek an alternative explanation is the elephant in the room.However; the film is filled with passion and filmmakers present the information honestly. The sad issue is that the evangelical movement seems not to have learned anything from the War in Iraq. Our presence there will only result in civil war. This was predicted long before the war started, now, four years later, if the U.S. were to leave, full blown civil war would certainly result. Why, because the church and state in Iraq are inseparable.I will eagerly await the sequel five years from now when the filmmakers return to Jesus Camp and reinterview these children. On second thought, perhaps they had ought to wait ten years.</fullReview>

The film examines the Christian Right in America and how they are co-opting religion, indoctrinating the youth, and influencing politics. The ironic thing is that the main subject of the documentary, Becky Fischer, an evangelical kids' summer camp preacher, thought the film would have a positive effect on people's perception of her "Jesus camp." The real effect is QUITE the opposite. It is horrifying to see what the kids at the camp are exposed to. This is indoctrination at its worst. An excellent, scary film. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

The choice of scenes and shots and the way the lighting is done seems like a miracle. It feels like you're standing right in the room with everybody. The clarity and flow of each scene and transition and the ability of the director to unmistakably impart the message without boring or slamming the audience (or adding voice-over) is an artistic triumph that every serious movie buff should appreciate. Bravo, bravo, bravo! The most frightening, spine-curdling film I've seen in literally years. Watching children chant "WAR!...WAR!...WAR!" made my blood run glacial-cold. And I really loved John Carpenter's "The Thing".My favorite quote: "I guess you could call it brainwashing, but *I* think this stuff is important!" or "I've never heard of these churches with political ties."~j</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the must-see movies of your lifetime.To see people acting this way about their religion is mind blowing for most. This movie approached this delicate subject with accuracy and zero narration.People will feel very differently and strongly after seeing this movie. To appreciate it and not get caught up in the emotional circumstances is very tough. Unlike Farenheitt 9/11, the movie does its best not to drown you in propaganda. It is most amazing to see how the lives of children are transformed by the environment they live in. Is it better? is it worse? Can anyone say for sure? The question that should be asked is this: Is the feeling of salvation worth the sacrifice of freedoms never given? Is knowing that God is the answer to every question a terrible way to live life or the greatest? This movie is a great documentary and should not be receiving bad comments because it happens to conflict with your own beliefs. To do that would be ungodly and illogical all at the same time.</fullReview>

So far, it said, he has admitted to only part of the allegations as being true. Most likely to the lesser of the two evils. The pastor being Ted Haggard is innocent until proved guilty, but it shouldn't stop anyone from having an opinion on the matter. Also if you look closely at the young long hair boy fingers, you'd see he has chewed his finger nails down to barely anything left. The pressure on the boy, to be the perfect role model for other Christian children must be immense. I left feeling these poor children were being used as pawns by the sick adults. Especially, when that one adult promises the children a surprise for them, and it turns out to be a sick gross picture and red tape across their mouthes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fanatic is someone who can't change his mind and won't change the subject. This film is full of fanatics. They eat sleep and drink Jesus. They work Jesus into every second of their lives and every conversation, and when they need a break they go away to camp so they can testify to each other that they want, need &amp; have even more Jesus in their lives. Then they use this unbalanced obsession to judge anyone who isn't wetting their pants over Jesus. Rather than striking fear into liberal hearts as Becky the misguided Jesus Camp counselor believes, it's just sad. These children's minds have been solo-tracked and ruined before they even know what critical thinking is; as with the insufferable 9 year old Rachel who is proud of her emerging intolerance and know-it-all-ness; the arrogant Levi who spouts malarkey with a dead, uncomprehending mind. These kids are being warped and used in a disgusting, cynical way that a non-believer would never even contemplate.Although much is made of the demeaning comparison evolutionists supposedly make of humans to apes, I would say this. Every living creature on this planet has a brain, only one has a mind. That is the human race. As such it would be a disgrace, a shame and a waste not to develop it. You cannot develop your mind with the tireless, petty application of one book to every aspect of your life; or by endlessly forcing your problems into the mold of Jesus or Satan. And if you don't develop the ability to think abstractly you might as well be an animal; because if you aren't using your mind, you are an animal. The good book can't save you from that.These kids are absolutely sure of concepts they don't understand to any depth, and they have been indoctrinated to believe that doubt is basically sin. But doubt is what would help them cope in life, AND help them recover from these damaged childhoods. Doubt is good. These kids couldn't argue their way out of a paper bag because they have no idea what the alternatives are. It's unfortunate that children really don't have any civil rights until they remove themselves from their parents influence. The founding fathers should have framed some sort of children's bill of rights because surely kids deserve to be free of influence this nasty &amp; lost; religious hate, histrionics &amp; abuse.Becky the large, blond woman who spearheads the camp is actually the saddest, most pathetic figure of all; so intolerant that whenever she is shown in her home she is alone. No wonder. No one else can bear her. Even when shopping, she admits, anything that she comes across is evaluated for propagandistic value; i.e. How can this item be used to further ruin kids minds, and continue their transformation into moral simpletons? She doesn't trust a child to have any thought she hasn't programmed into them. She exists as the ultimate betrayal of authority, joyfully depriving children of their minds.There isn't a single word in the bible in praise of thinking or common sense. If God wanted me to believe in him, he would have offered me some goal more appealing than spending eternity with arrogant hypocrites who spent their living years aggravating conflicts and ruining entire nations; he would have devised something other than shrill, bottom-feeding fanatics to get the message to me. Amidst all of their foibles, I would still be able to see the beauty of their minds shining through. There is no beauty in these minds. Anyone who thinks cannot bear to spend more than a few minutes with an incorrigible ignoramus.Ultimately militant Christians are their own worst argument; there is no weaker endorsement of Jesus' love than the fact that the power-mad people in this movie clearly believe hate works better. And there isn't enough grace in the universe to turn an ignoramus into a treasure.It's Christian's biggest fear that gay people MIGHT be doing the things that Christians actually ARE doing: Christians want to shove their lifestyle down your throat. Christians want special rights. Christians recruit. Christians prey on the vulnerable. Christians exploit &amp; brainwash children. Children are just a means to an end for this twisted crew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Religious fundamentalists train children to fight and die for Jesus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A must-see film! I first thought it was a pro-fundamentalist film, but it's quite the opposite... a scary documentary about people who train kids to die for Jesus. It starts with a heavy-set female Pentecostal children's minister who drags kids to a Jesus Camp, where they undergo some pretty heavy brain-washing. The children look like they're 8-12. They talk about being saved at 5, pledge allegiance to the Bible, and listen to "Christian heavy metal rock'n'roll" (which sounds exactly like regular heavy metal, just with different - religious - wordings). The kids are yelled at by the female Pentecostal children's minister (FPCH) for reading Harry Potter ("You don't make heroes out of warlocks!"). She also makes them cry and confess their sins. On her computer, the FPCH photo-shops a poster with the legend "The Punishment for Sin is Death" in scary, blood-dripping goth lettering. An 8-year old girl says that God is not in every church, "he's not in those dead churches where people sit still. God only comes to churches where people jump up and down, talk in tongues and yell HALLELUJAH!"When the FPCH has softened up the kids, they meet a creepy smiley-guy who tells them that they will save the world with their faith. And to prove their strength and determination he gives them a big hammer with which they're supposed to crush to smithereens mugs with "Government" printed on them. "This means war, children!" Creepy smiley-guy talks in tongues and keeps bobbing his head the way praying Muslims do. He also hands out little doll-babies, the kind you put on baby shower cakes, and say they represent their aborted brothers and sisters. The kids then talk about the wonderment of being a missionary ("those people die for God and they're not afraid. They're called martyrs and everybody loves them!")SOmeone drags out a life-size cut-out of George Bush, and he is prayed to and prayed over.Then the kids are ready to met Ted Haggard, a mega-church minister in charge of 30 million fundamentalists. he talks to president Bush every Monday. He tells one adorable 12-year old baby-preacher, who worries about the contents of his sermons,"just use your cute act until you're 30, then you'll know what to say."This is the same Haggard who recently had to step down from his ministry when a male prostitute came forward and said he's been servicing Haggard, a married man with five kids, every month for the last three years.We also get numbers in "Jesus Camp" - 43% of born-again Christians are saved before the age of 13. 75% of home-schooled kids are evangelical Christians.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning portrayal of the indoctrination process at work among America's youth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jesus Camp is the best documentary I've seen all year! The camera follows a select group of devout children through the routine ceremonies of Pentacostal Evangelical Christian life and summer camp. Beware, this is not your average summer camp! Regardless of your religious views, this film is a compelling portrayal of textbook indoctrination practices. I love the scene when the camp head master (Becky Fischer) draws comparisons between Islamic fundamentalists and their own tactics. Her quaint distinction is: "Because we have...excuse me! We have the truth", exemplifies the myopic intransigence of religious dogma. Bravo to directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady for pulling back the curtain on this rising movement in America that seeks to extirpate the hard won separation between church and state.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing, Disturbing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have two words: UP and SETTING. This documentary details the events of the "Kids on Fire Summer Camp" led by Evangelical Christian leader Becky FIscher, a woman who, in my opinion, must be stopped at all costs. This country-wide movement, encouraging Christian warfare, now boasts a membership of around 80 million Americans, a good portion of whom are children being subjected to brainwashing techniques. These children are tortured and manipulated psychologically to think that they are damned creatures who must constantly repent their sinful natures, starting as young as the children can speak. Kids are home-schooled, and in addition to being trained to take over politically one day, they are taught the evils of abortion, homosexuality, evolution, and of all things, the campaign to end global warming. These fools actually speak in tongues and have their children say blessings on cardboard images of Bush, their poster child for godliness. I literally found myself sick throughout this film and anxious to find a way to stop this movement. If you value your freedom and have the smallest liberal bone in your body, I urge you to find this film. It will change the way you view our country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest horror film I've seen all year...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No pun intended, but Oh. My. God. Granted, i was not brought up in a religious family, but...this film is absolutely terrifying. I think I was most disturbed by the Evangelical pro-life rally in which children had plastic fetuses taped to their own small hands; the scene in which "Becky" described how she basically used cheap Halloween haunted-house props to "illustrate" Satan's grip on young souls; and the scene in which Tim Haggard encourages young Levi to prey upon his own. Throw in the bit in which the homeschooling bimbo mother is teaching the "absurdity" of Darwinism (and science in general) to her young proteges, and you have the absolute most terrifying documentary ever made. Like a former post mentioned, these kids are likely being abused in their indoctrination. It's soooooo scary. I had chills the whole time I watched this well-made, beautifully paced film. If I weren't so afraid of who they might become in just a few short years, I would feel sorry for these kids. God (truly) bless 'em, that they might come around and think for themselves.Good Lord help us! (again, no pun intended).</fullReview>

Brainwashing children to believe that they have committed sins and that they can pray for what ever they want; talking in tongues; homeschooling them in one viewpoint without other viewpoints available....scary!!!! and it's in your neighborhood....coming to a city or town near you....and the best part was Rev.

		<shortDescription>Jesus Camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmmakers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady determined to make Jesus Camp after they learned just how widespread and how, well, evangelical the evangelical movement is in this country. To tell the story, they chose to focus on a few people who are intimately involved in both one evangelical church or another as well as the "Kids on Fire Summer Camp" in Devil's Lake, North Dakota.Levi is a young boy who dreams of being a preacher,. His mother homeschools him, and has obviously done a credible job of it. That's what makes the next scene so disturbing: she proceeds to question him on such matters as global warming and evolution, both of which he categorically denies based on biblical accounts rather than anything relating to science.Rachael is nine. She's cute, energetic, and talks almost non-stop. In one scene, she's bowling with her family when she wanders over to a young woman at a nearby table. She very seriously tells the woman that God has told her she must speak with her, and that she must be saved. She leaves a brochure with the woman and returns to her family where her father praises her and tells her, "Way to obey!" Victory (Tory) is ten. She's a pretty blonde who loves to dance. She very soberly tells the cameras that she dances for Jesus, and then admits that sometimes she dances "for the joy of the flesh." She assures the cameras, though, that she's trying really hard not to do that.Becky Fischer is a youth minister and the founder of the "Kids on Fire Summer Camp." In her interviews, she shares with the camera that the Muslims indoctrinate their children at an early age, and that Christians must do the same. Later, she tells a radio talk show host that if she can reach children before the age of seven, she can turn them into soldiers for God.Much of the interviews and intertwined discussions are leading directly toward this particular summer's camping experience. At the camp, parents and children spend time in services and seminars all of which are geared to fire them up and to prepare them to overwhelm the political process to "take America back." At one service, small children are sobbing hysterically because they are made painfully aware of the fact that they're bad. They beg Jesus for forgiveness. A small blonde boy sits on the floor and sobs heart-rendingly. Soon, some children are "speaking in tongues." The adults appear pleased.Eventually, we travel with Levi to Washington DC for abortion protests on the steps of the US Supreme Court, and to Colorado Springs for a sermon by Ted Haggard (the now discredited pastor who, after gleefully mugging for the camera, gives young Levi some advice on sermon-making). In an interview, Haggard smiles his broadest, toothiest grin and says that evangelicals, if they vote, can win any election. Because the filmmakers have given us the occasional statistic throughout the course of the film, we've no choice but to acknowledge that Haggard is probably right about that.I can't tell you that I enjoyed Jesus Camp because I didn't. I did, however, find it profoundly disturbing. The featured children and, I suspect, many of the others, are smart as whips. They're also utterly convinced that everything they've been told is right, and that anything contradictory must therefore be wrong. They're intolerant of others at best because, as Becky Fischer puts it, they've "got the truth." In the case of those who are homeschooled (one of the film's helpful statistical offerings informs us that the vast majority of homeschooled Americans are evangelicals), they're grievously lacking in science knowledge and the ability to think logically which, in my opinion, seriously hampers both the individual and society as a whole.Fischer is, unfortunately, absolutely right about one thing: If you can get a child young enough and indoctrinate him thoroughly enough, he's going to grow up just as you intend him to be. And these children are effectively intended to be weapons. Oh, they may not blow themselves up as some Muslim children grow up to do, but I'm convinced the education process and the end goals aren't dissimilar. Both appeal to the highest and the lowest of emotions. Both employ fear and guilt at least as frequently as praise. And both are looking to convert everybody they can, and to subjugate everybody who won't convert to their own religious notions by force of law.POLITICAL NOTES: Any group that's out to infringe the rights of others as a matter of course is dangerous to freedom by definition. While it doesn't really matter to me what religion a politician may espouse, it matters a great deal to me if he takes it as part and parcel of his office to make the rest of us follow along. That's what the evangelical movement is apparently aiming for, and if that goal is reached, every one of us who doesn't toe the line will suffer one way or another. Although the Constitution assures us freedom of worship and speech, and even the Bible claims that God Himself granted us free will, the evangelicals obviously don't see it that way.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Jesus Camp is rated PG-13 for "some discussions of mature subject matter." I don't know that kids will really get Jesus Camp anyway. But any adult who's a little leery of those who would legislate morality (among other things) is going to find Jesus Camp a real eye-opener! As such, I recommend every adult see it. Know your enemy. However good and decent these people may be as friends, neighbors, and co-workers ? and they are ? if you value freedom, remember that their stated goal is to take it from you. And if that doesn't, at the bottom line, make them an enemy, I'm not sure what does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chillingly remarkable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, and I come from a medium-sized city in Wisconsin. I have not had good experiences with religion in either location; I had Catholicism shoved down my throat at home, and there are evangelical preachers shouting about hellfire and damnation (NEVER salvation) on my campus. So when I first saw the "Jesus Camp" trailer on YouTube, it made my skin crawl. I wanted to go out and watch it immediately--perhaps to vent some of my feelings about evangelicals afterward. But I was also disappointed, as the movie was only showing in certain cities, none of which were near me. So I resolved to go to it as soon as possible, with the expectation of viewing a gigantic rip on evangelical Christianity--something that I'll readily admit to wanting to see.But that was not to be. What's stunning about "Jesus Camp" is that it is not the new "Fahrenheit 9/11"; there is no propaganda or twisting of the facts here. What you see is 100% real, with no distortions. The camera-work is up-close-and-personal; you can see the tears running down the kids' faces as they pray in tongues. And while the nonchalance the adults speak with when they talk about how kids "are so usable for Christianity" (a direct quote from Becky Fischer, the woman who runs the titular camp) may turn your stomach, what'll really get you is seeing these children speak about their faith with a zeal in their eyes and voices that rivals a Muslim fundamentalist's fervor for his own God. These kids talk about "radically laying down their lives for God"--something that Becky Fischer and people like her are ready, willing, and able to help them do.However, draw your own conclusions. While I saw some things that alternately shocked me, infuriated me, and gave me goosebumps (not the good kind), I also realized just how even- handed this film was. There was no searing indictment of charismatic Christianity, nor any statement that said, "This is wrong." No, what sets "Jesus Camp" apart from and above all other similar documentaries (especially, in my opinion, Michael Moore's work) is its straight- faced and unflinching approach to its subject matter. And while my only gripe about this movie is its surprisingly short length (less than 90 minutes), it's my firm belief that if you want to be informed about the growing evangelical movement; shocked by what happens when organized religion goes too far; or just have something deep and heavy to think about, then "Jesus Camp" is perfect for you.9.5/10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Provocative presentation of a controversial subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In subject and in style, "Jesus Camp" is nothing short of provocative.Through a close examination of the lives of several children immersed in one of America's most prominent sub-cultures, Christian evangelicalism, directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady offer up a filmic meditation on this unique brand of faith and the discussion surrounding it.Levi, Rachel, and Tory are three pre-teens from Missouri who have grown up in the tradition of evangelicalism. Like many evangelical children, all three are home-schooled by their parents and all three participate regularly in organized Christian activities, including a yearly pilgrimage to Becky Fischer's "Kids on Fire" summer camp. Fischer, a dedicated children's minister, has boldly declared that her life's mission is to create an "army of God" among the nation's youth. Along with the other children at the camp, Levi, Rachel, and Tory commit themselves wholeheartedly to Fischer's cause. As members of this "army," they pledge to spread the word of Jesus Christ among the population of un-saved Americans, to refrain from participation in a multitude of sinful activities, to revere our Republican president, and to join the fight against abortion, among other things.While the devotion of these children to their faith is quite a compelling story in itself, Ewing and Grady complicate the subject of their film by interspersing segments of commentary by Christian radio host Mike Pompantonio, who criticizes the evangelical movement as a threat to American democracy. Horrified by the attempts of Fischer and others to secure the dedication of children to their cause, Pampantonio condemns their efforts as a form of tyrannical indoctrination.Unlike many contemporary documentaries that engage polemically with questions of social morality and political opinion, "Jesus Camp" contains no directorial attempt to pass judgment on the debate at the film's core. Rather, Ewing and Grady seem more interested in the juxtaposition of competing ideas, leaving the viewer free to make his or her own choices about the issues presented on screen.Indeed, what makes "Jesus Camp" fascinating as a documentary film is this very even-handed presentation of a contentious subject. Supporters of the evangelical movement could easily recognize plenty of evidence in this film to support their cause, as could those who contest evangelicalism. Enmeshed in the comparatively-organized structure of the film, for example, the very same incident often concurrently upholds and decries the same idea.At times, perhaps due to the potential for the same image to contain diametrically-opposed meanings, traces of light irony become apparent in the film. Cutaways sometimes seem mismatched to voice-overs, the presence of landscape shots is puzzling at first, and the pace of some of the transitions between images can be startling, but, taken together, these peculiar elements ultimately serve to illustrate and/or create points of humor within the content. While the narrative structure propels the sort of alternating analysis that characterizes the overt storyline, the visual construction of the story implicitly establishes a tone of wry observation, which constitutes the only kind of commentary Ewing and Grady seem to offer."Jesus Camp" is not without flaw?one concern in particular centers on several unlikely coincidences that lead to questions of the film's integrity?but the product of this collaborative endeavor is without a doubt one of the strongest examples of documentary film to emerge in recent years. With this film, Ewing and Grady exploit the highest potential of the form; "Jesus Camp" is sure to enlighten and stimulate all who partake.This review was first posted on www.cinemattraction.com.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's just plain sick what they do.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've seen the documentary "Friends of God" (made by Nancy Pelosi's daughter Alexandra), then you'll be prepared for what "Jesus Camp" portrays. If not, then prepare yourself to nearly get frozen to death. These evangelicals may reside on Earth, but they literally live in their own universe (in which George W. Bush is God and Harry Potter is the devil). As can be expected, they teach the children that Palestinians raise their children to be suicide bombers, and that either you love Jesus or you don't (and that even if there is such a thing as global warming, it's all God's doing); of course, since they believe that only subscribers to their narrow-minded view of Christianity love Jesus and will go to Heaven, that means that at least five sixths of the world population is going to Hell.If you find it incredible how these people can exist in the 21st century, then just remember that these people have plenty of Washington politicians pandering to them. And of course, there's Ted Haggard, the self-proclaimed homophobic who after this got filmed was revealed to be meeting with gay prostitutes (I actually thought that he had sort of an affected accent, a little bit like Paul Lynde). I, for one, hope that something like that gets exposed about all these sorts of people, just so that everyone can understand what hypocrites they are.All in all, it's important for people to see just how sick these people are and specifically how manipulative the leaders are. It would be kind of funny if they didn't have so much influence in Washington. Given how negatively they speak of anyone not like them, I'm surprised that they haven't gone to the extreme; maybe they would like to claim that the Looney Tunes are gay (think about it: Bugs Bunny often dresses in drag, Daffy Duck lisps, Porky Pig walks around half naked, etc).But I digress. It's a really good documentary and I recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this was probably one of the best docs i have seen in the last 5 years. the directors did an amazing job of balancing the material in a unique and un-obvious way. for instance, instead of getting the opposing POV to the Evangelicals from an predictable liberal source, they used the POV of a Christian radio talk show host. having NO religious upbringing whatsoever, these aggressively opposing voices WITHIN the Christian groups had never even occurred to me. also, when i saw this film at the amazing Silverdocs Film Festival outside of Washington DC, the directors were present and were asked if they had a difficult time gaining access to film the Evangelicals without apparent restriction. they responded that all of the Evangelical families were more than accommodating, completely open and had nothing to hide at all, and were proud of their lives, beliefs, and culture and wanted people to know. this was definitely not what i expected.for such an eyeopening film with such sensitive topics (President Bush, God, children, etc) a vague agenda definitely became apparent within the film, however it is important to note that it never felt like it became judgmental.HIGHLY recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest movie I have seen since Halloween and I was 7 then.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't the kind of scary movie involving twisted carnage or shock value. If you are an intelligent human being that asks questions, this is the kind of movie that will scare you to the core of your being. This is probably the first time in many years, in which I was intensely frightened by a movie. It is also the best kind of documentary. One in which you sit back, not add any commentary, and let the images and sounds speak for themselves. It is funny to think that the filmmakers genuinely intended this movie to show a softer, more personal side of the Christian Evangelical movement in the US.The whole premise of this documentary is to follow around a group of children, their parents and the camp they go to. A religious camp that inspires and teaches about JC. JC in the house!! JC as in Jesus Christ. There's nothing wrong with JC, if you actually follow what he taught - love and acceptance. It is clear (even before watching this) that Evangelicals have an agenda. It isn't just religion, but rather more a neo-fascist organization veiling itself in JC and the garbs of religion (American for Americans, American for Christians, etc). I use the term fascist because fascist ideals used nationalism and the idea of one-people-one-country to justify an us against them agenda. Again this is nothing new. There are parallels in the Islamic and Jewish faiths as well. The Islamic version have been called terrorists. Funny, I don't see much of difference in ideology, just methodology. Evangelicals seem to have embraced the 21th century and its advantages. Instead of terror, why not divide and conquer and take over everything from the inside. They prefer the silent coup. They are not afraid nor lackadaisical. Their political power has grown consistently. While we sleep, they take over. They are the Starbucks of the 21st Century. They'll soon be on every street corner dishing out red bracelets and pamphlets. Islamic fundamentalists have other issues and methods, but I bet you if the Evangelical's methods stop working they'll be resorting to blowing themselves up soon enough. I mean they use the term war frequently during this movie. They call themselves Christ's Army. Is this any different from Jihad ? Isn't burning Harry Potter and witches a bit 17th century, not to mention violent? It is also funny to think most Evangelicals support the death penalty. At times, it almost seems like the Evangelicals praised the recruitment tactics and "teaching" methods of the Islamic fundamentalists. It is as if they are striving for the same results.Early indoctrination is key in both. Get them early and bombard them constantly with rhetoric. Add group influence and it becomes difficult to deal with. It is the way cults work. Break their individuality and then re-form them into the community, where they get acceptance by the "mob". What they are taught is intolerance and linear thinking. If you are not a Christian then you are not one of us and don't belong in this country. History is also molded to reflect this. Apparently the architects of the United States of America used Judeo-Christian beliefs to found this country. Things like the Bill of Rights ,the Constitution, freedom of religion, the separation of church and state and the Age of Enlightenment (Age of Reason) are fabrications of the liberal media and Satan himself.I am torn. I feel terrible for these children, but at the same time I fear them. These kids will probably grow up to do the same to their kids. Its their right to teach their own kids as they will, but please leave me and mine out of it. I don't go around telling other people what do to do and especially not what they should believe. Evangelicals do not have that separation. It is JC, 24/7, whether it is bowling, running a power point presentation, dancing, singing, talking or buying groceries. Everything relates to JC. How are you suppose to have a discourse with a person who not only will not listen, they wont even consider the possibilities outside of their sphere of knowledge? This is the inherent flaw in everything fundamentalist. Discourse is not an option. You either are with them or becoming one of them or you're not.The only comical moment was to see Pastor Ted Haggard, in light of recent news. It was alleged that he had homosexual activity (which he is against) and even used crystal meth. Apparently he used to frequent gay bars and invite gay men to his congregation. I believe that is the most original pickup line I have ever heard. Kudos Pastor Ted, kudos. The allegations were so false, of course, that he resigned or was forced out. After 3 weeks of intensive counseling, he was heterosexual and drug free. This is the kind of stuff that give credence to my arguments.Watching this documentary reminded me of Invasion of the Body Snatchers or maybe one of the many movies about the Inquistion (like the Name of the Rose). The idea that organized religion is not a beacon for truth, but rather a tool of chaos. Those who don't follow the practices I do, are inherently wrong. What is more saddening is that this is all done in God's name. Much like M. Bennell, we need to find the pods and nip them in the bud. Till then, keep alert and ever vigilant. They are out there amongst us and we must unite.-Celluloid Rehab</fullReview>

I understand that there are evangelicals who feel the film is unfair; I (who am not an evangelical) feel it was completely neutral, that it presented the events as they happened, and let us listen to folks speaking as they really speak.There is a radio talk-show fellow who is a Christian but is anti-evangelical -- he does comment on the general issues but one needn't see him as the voice of the filmmakers.But it's the kids -- as separate in most ways from the more general society as are Amish kids or Hassid kids -- that make me sad. Will they ever see that they were brought up on pure propaganda, or will they go on to become adults who try to replace our secular democracy with the theocracy their parents and pastor clearly yearn for?

		<fullReview>This is a very important film-- and about time too--about events that I have personally experienced, in many cases beyond anything this film depicts and I'll invite any interested readers to email me at yurshta@yahoo.com. I myself was one of the little "soldiers for Jesus" at one time, a victim of brainwash. And even to this day, I'm not sure how exactly I escaped, because, in majorem, relatively few escape it. But I'm not alone. Dan Barker a former preacher did.It's a fact of psychology: take a child, any child, and due to the credulous and unquestioning nature of a child's mind, you can indoctrinate them in anything you like from Marxist ideology, to racism, or any religious nonsense you like. My own sister and her husband, both missionaries, are connected a camp such as the one in the film--so in some ways the movie hits too close for comfort-- only the **** camp is overseas and is geared for children of missionaries.After the fall of the USSR, most if not all of the Eastern bloc countries opened their borders for the first time in many years to American missionaries, and a massive flood of American Protestants have entered these countries, so that countries like Russia, Ukraina or Romania, can have all the crappiness of the American Consumerist lifestyle and with it Pop religion. Like they really need McDonald's, Wallmart and the good ol' time American fundamentalism over there! Those of traditional faiths like Russian Orthodoxy do not like these Americans, but their hip modern methods with hundreds of millions of dollars of advertising and all the film-flam and hype and media blitz of a fortune 500 conglomerate are hard to compete with, in a word, impossible.I know all too well the difference between the "dead" churches and the "live" ones...and I have seen with my own eyes some horrors this film doesn't even begin to address. With assets in the billions of dollars, the movie market is being flooded with films now, some rank deceptions, others more direct such as the Left Behind series that promotes the Fundamentalist-Evangelical agenda. To just "believe" is no longer enough, you better have "signs" of your faith, you better get militant, Baby! You better crush Satan and his minions wherever they can be found---his textbooks, his newspapers, his magazines, his music. These guys find the Devil behind every nook and cranny and have talks with him so often it makes you wonder sometimes who they flock around when the moon is full and night upon us! This movement towards homeschooling by fanatical Christians who refuse to allow their children to be exposed to modern science, humanism and naturalistic philosophies can only lead to the decline and fall of the United States as a nation. The threat to the security and freedom of Americans is far beyond that of Hammas and Al-Qaeda, but because it's quieter, less visible, it is sneaking in the back door. The separation of church and state is every day being eroded a little bit here and a little bit there and nobody notices it, because it's not a blatant frontal assault. Science will be the first to get clobbered, as the scientific community prefer to hide behind formulae and test tubes and just pretend if they ignore this assault on free scientific inquiry that it'll just "go away". That is just as blind and stupid as the doctrines of the fundamentalists themselves.When we have biologists, geologists and astronomers with legitimate degrees teaching a 6000 year old Earth, intelligent design, the "gap theory", a literal flood, America is going fall light-years behind the other nations of the World. Whenever the Bible contradicts science or reason, they always prefer the Bible, which a priori, cannot ever be in error, hence the mainstream scientists are all wrong. As one doctor friend of mine told me "Back when religious doctrines dominated medicine, people were lucky to make it to 40." The Evangelicals see the Devil behind every nook and cranny, and only the 1st Amendment right of freedom of speech-- the master right, upon which all other rights hang-- stops these guys from a complete takeover. If it falls, all else falls with it. It's that simple. And it can happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing documentary, a must see for all Americans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My boyfriend was raised as a Charismatic Christian and it has greatly affected his life in a negative way, so I was very anxious to see this film and gain a better understanding as to what he experienced. They are just like a cult- trying to brainwash their followers (and starting at a young age). He (my boyfriend) was fortunate to "see the light" and stopped attending church in high school (much to the dismay of his family). They pray for him regularly so that he won't end up in hell. But he and I are both of the opinion that anywhere these crazy people aren't is going to be a better place for us to spend "eternity". This is a very important documentary to see to gain an understanding of how a large population of American's think. It is also important because it will hopefully instill a desire in everyone to vote. Many liberties we take for granted as American's are on the chopping board with Evangelicals holding the knife. It is sad and sickening to see so many bright and energetic children not allowed to develop their own opinions about how the world around them functions and the role they will play in it. Who knows, Levi could have discovered a cure for aids or cancer but unfortunately his religion doesn't teach or believe in science....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indoctrination and Brainwashing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The reason that you go for kids is that anything they learn by the time they are 7,8, or 9 years old is pretty much there for the rest of their lives.""I would like to see more churches indoctrinating.""You could call it brainwashing, but I am radical and passionate in teaching...""It (democracy) is ultimately designed to destroy itself because we have to give everyone equal freedom and ultimately that is going to destroy us."These are the words of Becky Fisher. And they frighten me to the core of my being. This film is amazing. Simply amazing. I know Becky Fishers in my own community. They use youth to propagate their message of hate and fear, they are absolutely no better than those who created the Hitler youth in the 1930's.Conservatives have been saying for the past few years that liberals hate and want to destroy America. However, it is conservatives who teach their children that the separation of church and state is WRONG, although it is one of the greatest things about our country. It is these religious nuts who want to destroy everything which is great about our country-- its diversity and policy of acceptance. The only thing for which I am grateful is that Becky is dead wrong about one thing. I was a subject of youth indoctrination by a Christian Organization at the age of 5, and have now overthrown what tormented me as a young woman. And I can only hope that many of the children at "Jesus Camp" are able to develop their own mind and see what is truly happening to them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely accurate portrayal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My whole family is from the south and i was 'raise' Christian (ie: they tried to pound it into my head) because that's what you were supposed to do to be good Christian parents. I remember experience many of the tactics that they use such as telling you that you are the devil is after you...yes YOU...and that you will burn in hell for ever because you are such a bad child and you have to repent and tell 'God' what a ad person you are and beg him to save you. Also telling children that they are bad and sinful just for doing normal children thing. There was a young boy who was terribly troubled after telling that sometimes he did not believe what the bible said. They tell you that there is something wrong with YOU if you don't believe. That messes up children horribly. It took my whole youth for me to reconcile that i was NOT bad for embracing truth and REASON and rationality instead of fairy tales and mythology. This film was very well done and i must say as someone who has "survived" that type of childhood that it is completely accurate portrayal of the evangelical movement. Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is nothing with religion, but these seemed more like a cult than religion. The kids (especially Levi), seemed to be brainwashed. I cant accept a 10 year old child definition of the world and whats wrong with it. These children just regurgitated what the parents have been telling them. I wonder if the the children had a chance to decide if Christianity was for them or was it just force upon them. I cannot get over how disturbing this movie is. I know that there were extremist, but I didn't realize that it was to this level. Disturbing, yet interesting. I don't know who scares me more, the radical Christians or the radical Muslims.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From The Perspective Of A "Right Wing Christian"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start this by saying that I'm a Christian. I also support president Bush. I started watching this today and couldn't turn it off. I have to admit, this was one of the most shockingly disturbing films I've ever seen. There were aspects of this film that reminded me of my family, and those things rattled me to the core. Now, personally, I don't disagree 100% with everything that the Christians say in this film, and that's coming from a person who's not all that religious. Like, I don't personally think it should matter whether creation's taught in school or not. The more information our kids get on various ideologies and opinions the better in my view. I don't think science should be force-fed anymore than I think evolution should be. Or anything should be for that matter. Teaching is okay. Indoctrinating is not. And I think the thing that upsets me the most about this movie is the false impression it gives that all Christians are this way. They're not. I also hate that it gives you the impression that these are the backward views of everyone who happens to support George Bush. I find that very insulting. On the other hand, I'm writing this as a very positive review because I positively cannot fault the filmmakers with bias considering that all the footage is essentially of these people burying themselves through their own words and actions. The only part of the entire film I didn't like (and the reason I gave it an 8 instead of a 10) was the recurring scenes of the radio talk show host. These scenes took the movie away from being 100% objective. When you start having someone there who's "speaking for the audience" as it were, you by definition begin to underestimate the audience as well. I didn't need to be hit over the head with the message of the film. The footage was disturbing enough without forced context and more than spoke for itself. As I've said, I think it's unfortunate that some - or any - people who watch this are going to come away from it judging all Christians, all Bush supporters or all conservatives on this extreme example of everything that's so wrong with each. I'm not completely convinced that that's not what the filmmakers were going for to be honest, but as I said, I'm not going to judge them for what is essentially a pretty objective film. I don't even know personally how there would be a way when filming people that are this fanatical to show the "positive" aspects of conservatism. It all gets to feel very dirty by the end of this film, which I suppose was the point. As long as you watch this as an example of the worst kind of perversion of a faith that is practiced without these harmful tactics by the majority of Christians, I'd highly recommend it. I'm sure there are plenty of Liberal fanatics out there who don't represent the views of all Liberals. I hate knowing that when I go to the polls I'm most likely keeping this kind of company, but there's bad people in every ideology. It's such a shame. And this movie is excellent and well-made for what it is. I cannot deny that for a minute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The rise of the Christian Taliban or, How to be a good little robot for Jesus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a must see film as it helps to expose the true nature of Christian fundamentalism.To me these Christian fundamentalists are as potentially dangerous as the Taliban.They too believe in a theocracy where their bible is the only source of knowledge and law. If these people gain power they will happily drag America into another dark age.These children are taught that science is just an opinion and evidence doesn't matter. This sweeps away the scientific method and makes scientific enquiry and the quest for knowledge obsolete. Basically they are taught to embrace ignorance and question nothing.They are taught to take the bible literally and despise and fear anything not condoned by it. This is rather concerning when you realise that the punishments proscribed are nothing less than public stoning.If only one of this films most prominent advocates, Pastor Ted Haggard had listened to his holy ideals and hadn't spent years taking drugs while indulging in adulterous homosexual sex with prostitutes. Ah well, he can always confess and be forgiven.The most sickening part for me though is around 35 minutes in, where they make these kids submit to public humiliation for daring to think for themselves.I have tried to keep this short but there is so much more to this issue, There is an amazing source of superb videos by true academics on YouTube (it isn't just for drunks fighting you know). You all know how to search so go there and see for yourselves.Final thought, Fox News has been throwing tantrums over a school class being asked to sing a song mentioning President Obama calling it indoctrination. Why silence about this?I recommend this film to any rational thinker whatever your beliefs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ulta Views for Ultra Chrisians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film just proves that like Islam, there are many different factions and degrees of Christianity some being more extreme than others. The movie follows an evangelical Christian named Becky Fischer that starts a bible camp for young Christians. Unlike most bible camps, this camps goes through intense seminars and demonstrations using extreme sensational tactics to get the point across. Example "People who sin will die" was a term used in one seminar. Another extreme tactic is passing around a 7 week old plastic aborted fetus to demonstrate abortion. This all being said and shown to children ranging from 5 years old to teenagers. Another approach is to home school the children so that many of the things being taught in school (evolution, global warming, science) won't be part of the children's lives. Becky's view and goal of the camp is to start to train young Christians into soldiers for tomorrow against the government and the dangers in the world. This film is a shocking and compelling look on one group of Christians and some of the tactics they have decided to use in their fight to win back America. Definitely a movie that will raise controversy, one that you'll either strongly dislike or like based on your own views. A very well made documentary that just let's the viewer watch and then make your own opinions on a very difficult issue.P.S. I'm from Lees Summit, MO and we're all not as ultra-Christian, right wing fanatics as some of the cast in the movie portray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An honest look at something most Americans don't know about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this documentary after the 2006 midterms and after Ted Haggard's secret life was exposed, so this did not have all the potency it might have had when it was first released, although the irony added to my enjoyment of it. I will let others debate the proper place of religion in society and whether or not what happened to these children constitutes abuse, but these directors have done an excellent job letting their subject speak for itself. This is not a gonzo-style Michael Moore movie where they thrust themselves into the story, and there is no sense of selective editing to bend the conclusions one takes from it in a particular direction. The fact that many Christians responded positively to this documentary suggests that the directors did not let their biases guide them. I hope the rumors of a follow-up are true because I am curious to see how these kids turn out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mental in Fundamentalist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an atheist I love documentaries like Jesus Camp which show both the dark and absurd sides of religion. This happens to be one of the best and is scary, upsetting and at points quite funny.The scares come in the form of some pretty shocking mental child abuse in the form of brainwashing. As pointed out by fat Harry Potter hating Preacher, Becky Fischer, children are easy to influence at young ages. She openly admits that this is what she does, and what should be done to all kids. With worldwide hatred against child abusers stuff like this gets ignored and that's frightening.What's worse is that this is taking place in the 'land of the free'. I can't imagine many of these children were free to choose what they wanted to believe (or not) in. If they were then they'd be outside having fun with other kids, or inside reading Harry Potter and The Orgy of Filthy Sin.The upsetting parts come from seeing very young children being shouted at to the point of tears in some cases, by a fat woman, a creepy drill sergeant/paedophile and a guy with a terrible Hawaiian shirt.There are amusing parts too, what with Becky's cringe worthy, vomit in my mouth "what about the rest of me" line and the insane teaching tools for the long haired wannabe Jesus, Levi. I couldn't help but dislike him and the younger girl as they come across as preachy little know it all's (probably not their fault I know). They clearly have no understanding of the world and their ignorance is plain to see, although this might have something to do with the fact that the boy at least, has been taught that the earth is 6000 years old and people used to ride to work on Dinosaurs.If you're into Religious documentaries then you should defiantly check this out. Oh and one final thing. Harry Potters a Wizard, not a Warlock. You Stupid B*tch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie made feel repulsed &amp; angry at the same timeI saw someone post the words Child Abuse (which this clearly is) However, these children must have parents who wish their children to be exposed to this kind of frighting Mind-F*%# (Which is unbelievable to me!)The roots of this movement are based in the fact that the Republican party receives huge sums of money &amp; hundreds of thousands of votes from these dangerous groups, but then they expect their stone age views to be forced upon us, as if they were a viable sector of American ideals &amp; thought ! But they are insane &amp; its just that simple. &amp; wrapping hate &amp; intolerance in the supposed love of god/Jesus does not make it any less dangerous.The time has come for(Normal)parents to show their children that these people are dangerous &amp; detrimental to society as they teach hate &amp; bigotry along with silly ideas about science &amp; life that distort truths &amp; promote idiocy.I teach my children science &amp; the glorious wonders of life on our planet &amp; the universe &amp; you can see their eyes light up with joy &amp; the natural hunger for knowledge. The fact that the majority (Not the minority) of the people in this country still look for life directions in the year 2007, from a group of books that were written by angry men being persecuted by the Roman Empire is just shameful.Nero (The roman leader labeled the devil 666 in Revelations) died a long time ago &amp; the catholic church did the same damn thing as the Romans did once they obtained power. (What difference does it make if you are put to death by a roman emperor for not bowing to him or you are put to death by a pope for not bowing to catholicism ? - None ! its the same thing.The fact that the actions of the people in this movie are tolerated without extreme outrage makes me wonder about the future of this country. Just remember that when Ted Haggard (who states in the movie that when his army of idiots vote they determine the outcome) was caught as total fraud who regularly purchased homosexual prostitutes &amp; meth for personal use, He simply blamed the devil (Are you kidding me? The Devil ? Its 2007 ! The Devil ! Grow Up ) But whats really scary is that he is correct about the voting issue That is how powerful these freaks are in the U.S.A.Sorry for the soap box rant here, But this is the one subject that makes my blood boil &amp; the fact that this movie shows them targeting &amp; brain washing young children just makes me want to be sick.Take this movie seriously Because these very dangerous people are as serious as a heart attack.</fullReview>

Its the most fascinating and disturbing thing to me, I just can't understand it. I am so so very afraid of what these people are teaching children. Fisher should be jailed or psychoanalyzed, perhaps both.No matter who you are and what you believe, the stuff in this movie might strike you as the Christian's answer of Islamic Fundamentalists.

		<fullReview>Jesus Camp (2006) ****Jesus Camp is not a technical masterpiece in any sense of the word, but what it lacks in technical prowess in makes up for in its authenticity. The documentary on evangelical children's summer camp does not attack or praise evangelicals, it simply drops into the middle of it all and lets the cameras roll. It is incredibly rare to witness a documentary that is virtually bias-less such as Jesus Camp. The filmmakers, Ewing and Grady, never make a mockery of their subjects, they let them talk and do as they please, and the things that these people have to say may be incredibly fascinating or incredibly horrifying depending on your point of view, or maybe its both.The film pulls the curtain back on the evangelical movement, and to me and surely most others, allows for some truly shocking and horrifying insights - Fisher, on a radio call, admits blatantly that they indoctrinate these children, and calls for more indoctrination in churches. You have children expressing their wishes to die for Jesus, speaking in tongues, even condemning Harry Potter and raging that in the Old Testament "Harry Potter would have been executed, and entering into what generally seems to be a militant fundamentalist mindset at the behest of their parents and peers.The filmmakers were able to get close to Becky Fisher and her camp members, and they say that they generally do like them, and it is a token that they do not themselves insult them; rather, similar to the methods of Errol Morris, they just let them say what they will, and if they make fools of themselves then so be it. The lack of bias in the film is evident in that Becky Fisher, the leader of the camp, has stated that she feels they were portrayed fairly and actually sees this film as a positive.The directors have stated that they plan to do a follow up to the film in 5 years or so, similar to Michael Apted's 'Up Series,' and I for one really am very interested in seeing just how these kids turn out.The honesty of Jesus Camp really elevates it to another level and allows for a very touching experience - how it touches you depends and your own beliefs, and in documentary film that is quite rare.4/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady's documentary Jesus Camp plays like a horror movie. It doesn't feature werewolves or vampires or other creatures, but it does follow a group of evangelical Christians, headed by Pastor Becky Fischer, at a summer camp that indoctrinates children to "take back America for Christ."For some of us, that's terror enough.Jesus Camp doesn't demonize its subjects (they do that to themselves). The filmmakers mix interviews with footage culled from a summer session at the "Kids on Fire" camp in Devil's Lake, North Dakota. The camp differs from other Christian retreats in that its end result isn't just to celebrate a love of God, but to prepare children for active political service. For the evangelicals, as featured here, America was created from Judeo-Christian ethics; division of "church" and "state" should not exist. Elected officials (like Bush, whom they hold up as their ideal) should support and legislate from the word of God. And if you aren't with them, you are going to hell.People who aren't with them include those who defend pro-choice, advocate (or at least don't punish) homosexuality, and, it seems, all those who believe in all other forms of Christianity as well as any other religion. "One nation," they say in their pledge of allegiance, "under a Christian God." They also believe in a "Christian" democracy. The way evangelicals have manifested their voting block in the last ten years proves they may one day have their prayers answered.Like I said, it's a horror movie. And for those too smug to be bothered, keep your eyes closed, ignore them, and pray they'll go away. Or, better yet, see the movie, understand how the number of evangelicals continues to grow (80 million and counting), and prepare for the "war" they blatantly say they are waging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sovereign God demoted to good-versus-evil struggle for children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie doesn't portray anything new. For those who have been around this brand of American Evangelical-Fundamentalist Christianism, it's nothing shocking. It's just sad.Unfortunately, a large and growing segment of American Evangelical-type Fundamentalists and conservative Christians are unwittingly locked in the mentality of a Sovereign God who has been demoted to a good-versus-evil struggle against a personified power of Evil. This movie portrays a not-uncommon camp for children where they are indoctrinated or reinforced in these beliefs.Life for these people is reduced to a dualist black-and-white view of the world, of material objects, and of every action as being either "of God" or "of the Devil." This burgeoning sub-cult of Christianity fails to realize that their beliefs are not the historical, nor the Biblical, nor the Judao-Christian view of God as Sovereign, the Lord God Almighty. God is demoted to the willfulness of a human, yet with supernatural powers. And in this movie, children are trained and indoctrinated through emotionally-charged events and experiences where fervency rules, rather than the Sovereign Grace of the God who they profess.Sadly, most people of this persuasion are both strong-willed and forceful in their single-minded quest to "destroy the Devil" in this good-evil battle, and since the 1970's days of Jerry Falwell's "Moral Majority," they are increasingly active in political movements with the goal of shaping America in their image. Anyone who is not of their mindset is suspect as a deceptive agent of Satan.This movie is a powerful illustration of this mindset. The indoctrinating and candy-coated mind-programming given to these children could easily be placed in many settings where any religious-political group is attempting to shape young lives. The movie could easily portray the early rise of Nazi youth, or Islamic freedom-fighters, or Amway salespeople, or even a high-school pre-game rally. Wherever "us versus them" is a mentality, the tactics portrayed in this movie would be applicable. As one child says in the movie, "We're being trained to go out and train others, train others to be God's Army." Unfortunately, there seem to be few camps for children which offer an emphasis on humility, discipleship, compassion, or learning that the God of Judao-Christian tradition is Sovereign Lord who has already conquered sin and death-- not one who judges children and decides whether they are going to heaven or hell on a moment-by-moment basis of their actions, turning Salvation on and off like a light-switch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too little criticism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary starts with a fat woman (likely obese) talking about not being a lazy and fat Christian and to do some fastening. The rest of the film shows us the same type of nonsense and contradictory facts being babbled and acted by those so-called Jesus lovers.The documentary basically follows the life of this woman called Becky (or something like that), the summits she hosts, the bible camp she organizes and the children she, along with other adults, brainwashes and indoctrinates.It also gives evangelist leader and Bush administration adviser Ted Hagard some of the airtime he loves so much. Not as much as he loves drugs and having sex with young lads, as it was discovered later. 1% of the film is given to a Christian radio show host to express how crazy is the behaviour showed in the other 99% of the documentary. That is, a Christian uttering how absurd other christians are.Leaving aside the significance of this, the problem I find in this production is the lack of real criticism (or reason) of what is showing us. I'm aware that the documentary pretends to tell us how the fat woman and other delusional people are trying to mold children into what they are themselves, although it is annoying to have to simply cope with 90 minutes of stupidity and have to swallow it all raw without much of a word muttered clearly against it. Save the already mentioned radio host believer.Now, these people are obviously either delusional or stupid beyond comparison. Probably both. Unfortunately, this is nothing new and the world is literally littered by millions and millions of individuals who think that there is an invisible being up in the sky who loves us all but will damn you to eternal torture if you don't follow his orders. Go figure. I have to wonder what all this belief is doing in the quantum world when it comes to mind over matter. There are other millions who believe that there are more than one of these up there, although the 3 big monotheistic religions are the most dangerous and absurd ones. We all know America is a world on its own and the cradle of nut jobs and fruit cakes, however things have been getting out of hands for a while now. I am not afraid of schizophrenics, psychopaths or child molesters like the people in the documentary, yet I can see how this is very, very scary. The kids showed in this film are unmistakably mentally scarred, traumatized or otherwise mind-damaged for life thanks to the idiocy of adults who find children -quoute- "usable" for their religions. However, I don't feel sorry for the kids. They will grow up and shall bring destruction and even more stupidity upon this Earth. If any pity should be felt, all my sympathies go to the near-future planet and the non-human inhabitants who will have to suffer the consequences of these highly disturbed people and their legacy, all for an invented set of absurd ideas called christianism copied and twisted from an even older set of myths. If you are serious about learning how to fight back the imbecility of the world, I recommend Religulous, The Virus of faith or some other Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens work, for example. At least with those you see some active opposition to the "enemies of reason".As a final message to all those evangelists, anglicans, mormons and related crazy folks: if Jesus of Nazareth had been a real historical figure, he would nail himself to the cross once he knew what a big bunch of lunatics say and do in his name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a person who grew up in the Bible belt, I can heartily testify that religious lunacy like what is presented here is a daily experience. I admire this film's caution about painting Christians with a broad brush, but it isn't hard to find people exactly like the ones the film primarily focuses on. If I had a dollar for every time I have been aggressively witnessed to,scorned, looked down upon, or judged harshly by victims of brainwashing similar to that examined in this film, I could probably buy a new car. I am so glad that these film makers have given everyone the opportunity to see the evangelicals as I have always seen them, monstrous enemies of reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I objected to so much in Jesus Camp that it's hard to know where to begin.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jesus Camp follows a group of children as they're indoctrinated by fundamentalist Christians at a summer camp; it is a documentary that leaves one both angry and incredulous.At the centre of it is Becky Fischer, a fat, obnoxious egotist who serves as the main speaker at the camp. We see Fischer preaching emphatically to these young minds, permeating their innocence with fear and guilt until they cry hysterically. So ridiculous and damn risible is her fanaticism that she even condemns Harry Potter, spouting that 'Warlocks are enemies of God! Had it been in the Old Testament Harry Potter would have been put to death! You don't make heroes out of warlocks!' ? clearly, a religion of peace.What is happening here is not religion, it's child abuse. The children aren't given the opportunity to think for themselves, they are inundated and imbued with bigotry, absurd reactionary values and a completely zealous devotion to God. Fischer and her creepy minions are quite open about what they're doing, she even refers to it as 'indoctrination' in one instance, but they see nothing wrong in it, in fact she even says ? 'I would like to see more children indoctrinated!' When asked why she targets children, Fischer replies candidly and without shame ? 'The reason that we target kids is that whatever they learn by the time they're 7, 8, 9 years old is pretty much there for the rest of their lives.' Much of what you see is deplorable, but it truly passes a boundary when the indoctrinators use the language of violence, speaking of things such as 'God's army', 'fighting' and 'war'. After many children have been driven slightly mad by the suffocating mania of Fischer and her misfits, they are encouraged to pick up a claw hammer and manifest their religious zeal into violence by smashing mugs that represent all things satanic.It's this 'God's army' mentality that produces the most disconcerting behaviour amongst the children. One child speaks of how she feels like a 'warrior' and that she's at 'peace' with death; her point is expanded upon by 12-year-old Levi who says ? 'you know a lot of people die for God and stuff and they're not even afraid.' It is not only entirely abnormal for children to contemplate their mortality like this, but also a scary indicator of what could happen if America's political landscape was to descend into bedlam - I could see this pernicious, insane devotion to God becoming very violent indeed. They claim that their cause is purely spiritual, but that is nonsense, the real purpose of their dogma is to create a Evangelical overhaul of the government.All of this incessant madness and irrationality is interrupted sporadically by Mike Papantino, the Christian co-host of radio programme Ring of Fire. The camera captures Papantino in his studio as he articulately despairs of these people, highlighting the alarming scale of the Evangelical movement and how this affects the democracy of the United States. Although I disagree with his religious views, Papantino reminds the viewer that there are normal religious people out there that believe in the separation of church and state just like the founding fathers of their country.Despite the input of Papantino, the documentary is, to its credit, largely impartial. Directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady just let the cameras roll on their unhinged subjects; to insert their presence into the documentary and make any judgement would be unnecessary. Jesus Camp is an important insight into the deeply troubling Evangelical underbelly of the United States.79%www.hawkensian.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that evolution isn't a straight line ? some get left behind and some even go backwards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This made me recall watching "Bells in the Deep", a documentary by Werner Herzog with an American friend of mine. The documentary is about the beliefs and superstitions of northern Russia (Siberia, to be precise). My friend commented on how outlandish the orthodox priests looked, how the Russian form of baptism bordered on child-abuse and the absurdity of people worshiping the so-called "wandering Jesuses" (there's virtually a whole army of them in Russia). Upon discussing the film, I asked him what he thought about "Jesus Camp", to which he replied: "Oh, these. These are evangelicals. They're all around ? one get's used to them." I think he made a good point without realizing it.In my mind there are three "protagonists" in "Jesus Camp": For one there is preacher Ted Haggard. This brings to mind the Academy Award winning documentary "Marjoe", in which a (former) child-preacher shows all the tricks of the trade. This was filmed in 1972 and if this were the age of reason, tricksters and film-flam-men like Haggard would already have died out (or in prison).We have Beck Fisher, perhaps the most spiteful person I've seen in a documentary in the last few years. Even a second semester psychology-student could diagnose serious mental issues and a personality border lining on psychopath. Those watching from the outside might find her antics, talking "in tongues" and rants about Harry Potter hilarious, but that would be like pointing out that Hitler had a funny mustache. I dare say, had Ms. Fisher been born in my country and a century earlier, she would have had a great career in the camps (today she would merely be in prison).And then we have the victims.In his book "god is not Great" Christopher Hitchens dedicated a chapter to the question "Is religion child-abuse". That depends on your definition of abuse. If abuse is only physical and/or sexual, probably not. If you consider psycho-terror and brainwashing abuse, a definite yes in the case of "Jesus Camp". Seeing those helpless tots wailing, weeping and mimicking the schizophrenic behavior of their elders, you'd have to have a heart of stone not to be touched, saddened or angered. In the IMDb-storyline I read: "Jesus Camp seems to pose a clear question: are these children being brainwashed?" ? pardon my flippancy, but that is like making a documentary about the pope which "seems to pose a clear question: is the pope a catholic?" The second saddest thing about this documentary: It doesn't offer a straight answer on how to stop this madness. A wise man once said on the topic of how to deal with a village idiot: "A) Don't argue with the village-idiot but rather walk past him and B) don't shape your society according to the need and wishes of the village-idiot, than your society will be alright. Thinking of this scene were the "Jesus Camp"-kids are forced to worship that "golden calf", a cardboard cutout of George W. Bush, I would like to add to that, "and C) don't make him your president".In this day and age, I frequently hear the question: "Why have atheists become so militant? Why do they argue so vehemently against religion and can't they just leave believers alone?" The answer: Watch "Jesus Camp".As a documentary I'd give "Jesus Camp" 8/10 and can honestly say: I'd dread to see a potential sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Eye-Opening View of Religion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people seem to think that this movie is offensive to religious people, and that it is biased. However, this is not the case. As this movie points out, you can have your beliefs without forcing them on others, especially kids, who are compelled to do anything these persuasive adults tell them.Jesus Camp focuses on pastor Becky Fischer, an overweight woman who runs an Evangelical summer camp for young children. As the film progresses, it gets terrifying. And this is no horror movie, this is really happening! Children are driven by their parents, almost brainwashed, to belief science is useless, that they are all the next Saint or something, and some are nearly traumatized by the adult parents. One scene shows an older man shaking a little girl by the shoulders violently until she bursts into tears, telling her to see "the vision", and while Fischer claims to be against exploiting children for political and religious purposes, she has them smash coffee cups with the word "government" painted on them, has them dressed as soldiers, tapes their mouths shut and seriously her first few lines are, "children are so usable in Christianity!" These children are taught that Harry Potter is a warlock, and would be put to death in the old testament. They are compelled to go up to complete strangers and pass out Jesus pamphlets like little travelling salesmen, and one girl admits to being guilty to dance for her own fun and has to correct herself every time she isn't "dancing for god." I don't think this is at all an offensive film. I'm an Atheist so maybe I'm the wrong person to give an opinion on that, but this movie also features a Christian radio reporter who says he finds Becky Fischer's camp and the methods of these parents to be appalling, and warns of the dangers of mixing church and State. One boy is told by his mom that creationism is the answer to every question in his science textbook. There's a rather eerie little girl who listens to Christian heavy metal and wants to open a nail salon "in the name of god". Many of the kids are wearing shirts with Jesus emblems, such as "Jesus-Peace" (Parody of Reese's Pieces Chocolates). At the camp, kids are punished for telling ghost stories at night and Becky Fischer in a very strange scene is praying over her computer so that "Satan won't destroy her PowerPoint presentation".This is a great documentary, really worth seeing, and points out that children, for any religious purpose, are not just "usable".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Disturbing and Alarming Films, and Probably the Most Frightening Documentary I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jesus Camp is one of the most disturbing, alarming films, and probably the most frightening documentary I have ever seen. Frankly, it's a horror movie. It permeated the rest of my day with an air of depression. It put me in a bad, paranoid mood. Perhaps I shouldn't have watched it so close to such a pivotal presidential election.It taps into every fear any sensible person has about the state of the country and the cancerous growth infecting those in control. How much more powerful is a delusional person than a clear-headed one? Why is it easier to motivate the former and why is it more difficult to motivate the latter? This film is not an indictment of religious people, not by a long shot. It is an indictment of the exploitation of religion to an extent that, if this were fiction, would be hilarious satire. What makes it the opposite of hilarious is that this is a documentary, dead serious in showcasing its completely unstaged images. Wouldn't you laugh if you saw a dramatized movie in which a woman brings a life-sized cutout of Bush to the front of a church, and children stretch their hands toward him? Well this is something that really happened that is included in this film.Jesus Camp is about Kids On Fire, a Christian summer camp run by Becky Fischer, who looks like a completely unsuspecting WalMart shopper or national park tourist. The film focuses on three children at the camp one summer, Levi, Rachael, and Tory. The film cuts between footage of the camp and a children's prayer conference held just before the camp at a large church. This particular church is so transparent in its intentions to any objective viewer, which is the source of this film's power. It's hardly a church. Rather, it's a theater, a big, gaudy theater with a stage, spotlights and a parition that seems like a rock concert audience. A big clue into the indoctrinating effects of its charismatic showmanship is Rachael's early comment that she does not think approvingly of non-charismatic churches, "dead churches," feeling they aren't "churches that God likes to go to."All three children are obsessive Christians. But through this whole process of spiritual awakening, the only thing instilled in them is self-importance, an egotistical ambition that seems a human feature beyond their years. Levi, who has ambitions of being a pastor, has already preached several sermons. He is homeschooled, as are many campers, and learns from a book that generically merges creationism with science. He is taught that global warming is a deception and Earth's temperature has a history of natural fluctuation not caused by humankind. What is so disconcerting is how easy it is for a na?ve and uninformed child to believe these things, as their parents seem to have grown up with the same perspectives built into them at a young age too, with very small, petty comparisons and justifications that come nowhere close to covering the scope of such urgent issues. For instance, the global warming denial is justified with the notion that the Ice Age was not due to humankind. As he is taught this, he and his mother scoff at the idea of believing that global warming is true. Levi preaches a sermon at the camp declaring that his generation is key to Jesus's return.There is no clarity instilled in these children. Rachael is seen praying over a bowling ball during a game, and repeatedly passes pamphlets to onlookers. Tory dances to Christian heavy metal music, and feels ill at ease about "dancing for the flesh." These are ways of thinking that are far beyond a spiritual belief that a God exists and wants to teach any kind of acceptance. My being an agnostic has nothing to do with my reaction to all of this. I know Christian Conservatives who would share my reaction. In fact, the film includes a debate between Fischer and Mike Papantonio, a radio talk-show host for Air America, a Southern Christian who sees the threat of Kids On Fire.Fischer passionately emphasizes the necessity for children to cleanse themselves in order to be part of God's "army." She deeply thinks that children need to be at the head of turning America toward Conservative Christian values. There is a scene where Levi and his family go on vacation to hear a renowned pastor, drug abuser and gay rentboy, Ted Haggard, only months before the scandal, swaggering across the stage, lionized by all these people, and stating what should perk up the ears of every single American: "If the Evangelicals vote, they determine the election."Its flaw is that it's valued by many Christian fundamentalists as well as many who strongly oppose that movement, each side feeling it gives ample evidence for their positions. So what progression is provided by this film? It ultimately preaches to the converted on polar opposite sides of this distressing issue. When we see shots of little children, little girls and boys who at the beginning of the film seem bored, restless, dragged to the camp by their parents, now looking up at the ceiling with their hands folded, tears welling up in their eyes, praying and speaking in tongues cluelessly, we should not be let off light with these images. We can't say to ourselves whatever we want about them, that they will grow up to be devout and faithful Christians. This film needs to present a bit more of a challenge in its depiction. What do you, Christian, atheist, old, young, think that these children are really thinking?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indoctrinating the kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the closing credits roll we hear Norman Greenbaum's "Spirit in the Sky." The lyric goes something like, "I got a friend in Jesus...He's going to set me up with the spirit in the sky...when I die...I'm going to go to the place that's the best." A similar point-blank irony suffuses this engaging documentary by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady. Norman Greenbaum had his tongue firmly in cheek, of course, but Becky Fischer and her fellow molders of children are serious. She believes in indoctrinating the children and she says so. She points out that in Muslim lands the children are similarly indoctrinated, and even more so. It is a war. The word "war" is used repeatedly at Jesus Camp which was located (ironically, I guess) in Devil's Lake, North Dakota. It's a war that must be won, and implicitly the war is against liberals and mainstream American culture, but explicitly against science, especially biological evolution, and against other faiths. Becky pretends to apologize before telling us that Christianity has The Truth and therefore should triumph over other religions, creeds and cultures. She believes that. There can be no question about the sincerity of her beliefs.What struck me most powerfully is what was REALLY being taught at Jesus Camp. That is, methods of indoctrination. Behind all the rhetoric about Jesus and being saved was the political agenda for the fundamentalist movement. Part Nazi rally, part revival meeting, part Brainwashing 101, what really came across were all the persuasive techniques that Becky Fischer, Ted Haggard and the others had perfected. Suffer the little children indeed. Get 'em while they're young, Becky tells us. The impressions made and beliefs instilled in children before the age of, say eight, will last a lifetime, she tells us.She says she loves America. We see out of a car window the endless sameness of asphalt roads, telephone poles and electric wires, KFC restaurants and car dealerships that form the main streets of most any American town. I doubt that she loves the America of the Museum of Modern Art or the America of Benjamin Franklin or Thomas Jefferson or the redwoods or the Grand Canyon. Becky says that she loves America, and then she says she prays to get away from this awful world--or words to that effect.I find it tough to find credence in people who devote their lives to manipulating the emotions of children in an effort to create a new generation of opportunists (or zombies) to mindlessly champion the slogans of their political and social agenda. How sad it was to see young Levi O'Brien--bright, talented and impressionable beyond his years--being molded into a future TV evangelist. He will learn the clever deceit practiced not by people like Becky Fischer, who as I said, is a true believer, but more like Ted Haggard himself or any number of moneyed evangelical personalities who preach one thing in public and in their private lives do something else. He will learn the same techniques that Becky and Ted have learned, techniques of rhetoric and persuasion, of indoctrination and the manipulation of emotions. He will learn what leads to success in evangelical land, that truth comes from religious authority and political and economic power, and that anyone who thinks differently is an enemy.Becky Fischer thinks liberal America will be worried after seeing this documentary. Her ability to mold children into her brand of Christianity should scare us, she thinks. But revivalist America comes and goes with the passing of time. We've seen it all before. What is different today is that evangelicals were able to elect somebody like George W. Bush and to control the Congress and cow the media. I think America has seen where that leads, to the weakening and embarrassment of America; and I am betting that America has learned its lesson and that the politicians who would do the work of the faith-based, ignorance-based, head-in-the-sand, evangelical movement will lose out to more enlightened leadership. After all, unlike Becky, most of us and our children must live in this world without the fantasy of imminent rapture, and therefore must work toward making the world a better place for all of us.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Jesus Camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jesus Camp is a horror movie. And the horror is real, not made up, doesn't rely on cheap special effects or tried and tested techniques to make your heart jolt. What's horrific is the systematic brainwashing of children, to have them believe something so abstract, by using devices such as toys, and fear. Children are highly impressionable, and watching the little ones put through a regime of highly charismatic thought processes, and perhaps even empowering them, what you get are little monsters. Angelic faces, but with hearts so demented, they are children no more.And the persons to thank, are the evangelical preachers, who, like perverse adults, find pleasure in indoctrinating young, easy to mould minds, to serve their sick cause. What made it worse, is that these folks find immense pleasure in recording their deeds on tape, and then going home to review them, watching their handiwork all over again. If success at robbing someone makes stealing candy from a toddler count, then these folks surely find this method the easiest, and the one that scores the most points.It's a pain to watch how these children believe, in raising their arms up high, thinking they can feel the holy ghost possessing them, writhe in imaginary pain on the ground, and cry so much crocodile tears, they think the more the holier art thou.It's flat out hypocrisy, one that bears warning about the false prophets that permeate society these days. And how cowards like those target the helpless and those who are in their formative years, to fill their brains with cow dung, and more selfishly, in preparation for the future, where their political ambitions include taking over the government, followed by world domination. They idolize George W Bush (can someone recall something about worshipping idols?) and call non-Christians enemy combatants, whom they want to emulate (short of bearing arms, at this point). They revel in their "enemies" ability to make their children handle bomb vests, while secretly hoping that one day they can do that to their own kids too. Religions are always about love and peace toward all fellow mankind (or all god's creation), but here, the preachers twist words and sow the seed for the future - one of their own designs.Watching how they lambast and so believe their own non-"Dead Church" ways, I think it'll take years for any of those kids shown to be de-programmed from their dangerous thoughts. The "jumping up and down" ways in Church will naturally be appealing, as it goes against the grain of the usual congregational behaviour one would perceive in holy places of worship. And you know, anything that seems rebellious, fun (c'mon, rock songs, free love, etc), and counter-establishment, will always find a place in the heart of a child/teen. And seduction, is always sweet.You can judge me to be critical and non-approving of the behaviour demonstrated, and frankly I don't care. What I would like to see though, is come Judgement Day and for the unfortunate (likely?) reason I can't pass through the Pearly Gates and have to head southwards, I sure like to see those false prophets there with me for eternity.The film managed to portray, in its short 90 minutes, the content, but really, left judging it on your own. What I found a little distracting at times during the documentary, is when the camera has difficulty putting itself into focus, resulting in many shots being focusing shots, from blur to clear, making it a bit nauseating. Should there be a sequel or follow up (say 10-15th Anniversary DVD Edition), it sure would be a blast to see the outcome of these children in their teens, if they have realized their follies, and left their "calling", or worse, fallen prey into deadly Sin that they have been warned time and again. Stay tuned when the end credits roll for a little coda, where the kids clearly demonstrate bigotry and generalization. So young, but already so set in their minds, in the wrong way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is perhaps the scariest film I've seen. It documents an unprecedented premeditated attempt at a power grab of the country. I guess the evangelical right has been studying the lessons of mass persuasion, religious hysteria and the effects on children of early indoctrination and they've gotten it down to a science. No wonder the country is going away from reason and truth towards blind beliefs and actions based on doctrine.This is a must see movie, it will show you the way America is being subverted. Unfortunately, those who embody freedom will never employ the nefarious methods of those who will do anything to have their own way, and for that reason the people who are on the side of fairness and freedom will probably never be able to overcome the power of these people who will even sacrifice children to their own ends.

		<fullReview>I think everyone who sees this movie will come to it with a bias, and what they take from it will be that which confirms their bias. Secularists and more liberal Christians will find some mighty disturbing material, whereas Evangelicals are likely to be exalted. It is a credit to the movie's objectivity that this is so.The movie attempts to document the Evangelical movement by concentrating on one committed person, Becky Fischer, and her spiritual guidance of a group of young children in the 8-13 age group. The main focus is on Becky and three children at the "Kids on Fire" summer camp at Devil's Lake, North Dakota (yes, there is such a town, I checked). From what we see, the adults running the camp are very successful in delivering their message to highly suggestible young minds, since the kids' actions and words testify to their being filled to the brim with the spirit of the Lord.The accuracy of painting a whole movement by extrapolating from a single point is open to question, but my concern about this was somewhat assuaged by the appearance on film of Ted Haggard, the leader of the National Association of Evangelicals at the time this movie was made. Haggard is filmed inveighing against homosexuality and abortion as Becky and the kids sit in rapt attention.Mike Papantonio, a Christian radio commentator, appears several times on air as he expresses some concern about the mixing of politics and religion that Evangelicals have become known for. The movie documents the goal of the parents to shield their children from any opposing views that might challenge them to think for themselves - 75% of all children from Evangelical families are home-schooled. It would be most interesting to see a follow-up with these kids ten years hence. For example, what was their reaction to learning about Ted Haggard's homosexual adventures?While Becky and her cohorts are not advocating that the kids strap on armored belts and blow themselves up in the cause of their faith, there is talk of the kids being soldiers for God - at one point Becky raises her arms and exhorts, "This is war. This is war."The film itself is not polished and that adds to its credibility. In the tradition of good documentaries the camera simply opens its lens and records what happens.Whatever your bias, I think there is enough here to make this worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow - I don't know how to come up with 10 lines to describe this film that will more fully flesh out the basic idea that my summary says.The indoctrination of these poor defenceless kids into radical Christianity should be a criminal offence in my opinion. I don't see how this is *any different* than what is done in the Madrasah's around the world where they teach hatred of non-Muslims (unbelievers) - the so called minister in the film flatly says 1) "there are two types of people in the world: those that believe in Jesus and those that don't" (since the Muslims believe that Jesus was a valid prophet, does that make them "believers" then?) and 2) that she can see Christian kids being (I'm accurately paraphrasing here) soldiers for Jesus and fighting for the Christian way.Watch this film and be afraid - be VERY afraid. And remember: teach tolerance wherever and whenever you can: if we could all just accept each other as we are and recognise that all forms of belief are valid, perhaps we can stop killing each other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The general notion about the content of this docufilm seems to be one of disgust and shock. This is all very fine and understandable but let me say something here that might give u some hint of direction if u seek out the why's and how's about it.You are living amongst a breed of completely deranged species called mankind or humans. A species that for no other reason than fear subdue themselves to any interpretation as being the ultimate truth, calling it science, religion or the holy words of your talking doorknob. We are living in a physical universe which doesn't allow for any observer to witness anything other than an observation. And the 'fact' to me, that almost anyone I ever met, could not even try to understand this notion, is only a little frustration on my part.Being indoctrinated or brainwashed is not only going on in this docufilm, it is what is currently taking place to close to 6.000.000.000 people (gosh, that much already?). It is a very natural process, logically speaking, and it obviously serves some purpose. What is shown in this movie is no more shocking than the general transportation of animals for the production of food or the way some people use punctuation in their movie-reviews.The only thing that makes this docu the shocking experience it is to so many, is the clever use of very young kids. It takes the mind back to the glory days of the Nazis's or any other episode of mankind in which the marvellous intellect of mankind rediscovered that programming someone at a young age will probably have a better short-term effect than to force-feed some issues at a later age. "The use of young children in this doco"? ?yes, that is what you are watching isn't it? It would not have served the impact of this film if they had apes in it playing with their dung while listening to recorded speeches of Jimmie Swaggart. (If these practises were held that is) To those that fear the uprising of a new fundamental religious group, taking over control over society; fear them enough and they will grow exponentially. Mind you, there is not a single moment in "recorded" history where large groups of fundamentalist believers did not exist. Natural equilibrium mean anything to you? Don't I feel sorry for those kids in this movie? Well? the future has to provide the outcome of this kind of upbringing to each individual case. I'm sure that most of them will not benefit from it in conventional views but neither will so many other elements which most of society finds passable. And how would u measure it against these other elements. I'm sure that in 200 year's time we loathe much of our current era or simply forgot about it.All in all I found this documentary clever in the use of kids, clever in the way they didn't paint it's opinion about it on the walls (which works great in the post-Moore docu era in which we currently reside), comic relief aplenty..7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is This Our Future?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a look at the next generation of folks who want to turn our government into a theocracy. I saw the film today, and it is scary. I know that these folks believe deeply in the rightness of what they are doing, but the thought that kept running through my head as I watched the movie was, "This looks like child abuse to me." The film is well made, with no Michael Moore-like editorial comment, save the scenes involving the radio commentator. The subjects are allowed to speak, unchallenged, for themselves, which, I think, was probably the right approach. All in all, an enlightening and (for those of us who are not Born Again Christians) disturbing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin Movie Show Review (scary but important)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The documentary is brilliant ? it's the content that's scary as Hell! "Jesus Camp" tells the story of an Evangelical Pentecostal preacher named Becky Fischer and her mission to turn young children into martyrs for Christ. She proudly states, "I want to see kids as radically willing to lay down their lives for Christ as Muslim kids are in places like Palestine and Pakistan." She sounds like she's advocating little Christian suicide bombers! This film examines the Evangelical Christian culture where home-schooled kids don't believe in science and aren't allowed to read "Harry Potter" because (as one mother put it), "Had it been Old Testament times, Harry Potter would have been put to death." Small children who still suck their thumbs are talking in tongues and praying over a cardboard cut-out of President Bush."Jesus Camp" is also a chilling study of the power of the Evangelical vote in today's political climate, and having the power to sway a presidential election gives Evangelicals the indirect power to appoint Supreme Court Justices. It's scary, but we have to know that it's out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film depicts just how horrifying a future we have to look forward to in this country if we don't stop listening to hardcore conservative right-wing extremists try to dictate what is "moral" to the rest of us. The way that these people prey upon children is criminal. I grew up in a very religious right-wing conservative republican family, although once I became older and started formulating my own thoughts I ran as fast from my family's church as I could. I still believe in God and acknowledge Christ as the son of God and our savior, but the things that are shown in this film have absolutely nothing to do with Christ or his message to us. This is what happens when you take a religious faith and inoculate it with radical extremist ideology and political agenda. Warriors for God? Are you kidding me? Since when did Christ ever ask us to be warriors? Didn't he in fact tell us to love our enemies and turn the other cheek? I don't know, seems like I read that somewhere in a pretty important book. Oh yeah! I remember, it was The Bible! We live in times that are troubled enough. Honestly, ask yourself. Is more intolerance, purposeful ignorance and condemnation what the human race needs right now? Anyone who has sent their children to a camp like this, shame on you. Our children are supposed to make the future better, not worse. People, open your eyes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The hypocrisy of beliefs and the blatant brainwashing of children. They wrongfully promote violence with there tone and choice of words. Last time i checked that was against the grain of what the ten commandments lays out as a guideline. Also seems like they have a complete disregard for according to there beliefs some of the big G O Ds other creations (essentially mother earth and all of its glory.) Its crazy, I once was a hard core believer in the church and the trinity, i have attended some of these overnight Born again retreats when i was a teen with kids I knew from school. I ll just say that do have a way of persuading youth, as it took a couple of years of art history and the desire to learn about the history of religions (not only Christian) to convince me that what i had learned was just a ton of spin. I now make sure i preach to my children that the only way you can make the right decisions in life are to look at the whole picture and to look at it from every single angle. It is your choice to choose right from wrong, not some writing in a great fiction novel (aka the bible, although possibly based on some actual happenings its more fiction then fact). I couldn't t sleep last nite after seeing the movie and being reminded of the "jesus youth" and its "holy army(quite the contradiction)" and basically thinking about the Nazis and the ideology of false sense of superiority. I just more stuff is exposed like Ted Haggards blatant hypocrisy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jesus Camp" is a provocative - and quite disturbing - look at how little children of Evangelical Christians are brainwashed in pastor Becky Fischer's "Kids on Fire" summer camp in Devil's Lake, North Dakota. They are taught to become Christian soldiers in "God's Army", and told, among other things, that "Harry Potter is an evil warlock and would've been put to death in the Old Testament", "science doesn't prove anything and there's no such thing as global warming" and "all homosexuals go to hell" (Ted Haggard himself says that). One of the girls says that she couldn't care less about Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, who sing about boys and girls and stuff, and that's not what someone should think about. I agree that we really should avoid "artists" of Spears' caliber, and that Harry Potter is not classic literature or anything special (come on, junk culture is inevitable and often harmless, unless when used in big doses), but keeping your kids away from reality and brainwashing them by saying that they go to hell if they do this or that, is just plain sick and dumb. So all that freedom of speech/free will agenda has died? Did it ever exist? Young directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady avoid the political tone and let the images speak for themselves, making "Jesus Camp" one of the year's best films. I still think that "An Inconvenient Truth" deserves and will win the Best Documentary Oscar next Sunday, but I wouldn't mind "Jesus Camp" winning at all because it's an important and brave film as well - a must-see, no matter what's your religion, political view or creed. 9.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "Jesus Camp," the viewer is plunged immediately in the middle of Evangelical Christians and that's where they stay for most of the movie with a few merciful counterpoints delivered by a liberal, Christian radio host. We see pure, unadulterated indoctrination of the very, very young. The leaders of the camp in question, the children's parents, and every other adult we see, admits that they are intent on creating an army of conservative zealots. Fundamental Christian tenants like "thou shalt not kill" fall by the wayside when the Iraq war is in question but are suddenly important again when, abortion, for example, is brought up. Global warming and evolution are disregarded by name in lieu of Creationism and rhetoric. Science is claimed to have proved nothing but then cited when proving that a fetus develops human features early in the womb.And the worst part is that all of the information is being fed to children, some under five years old.Bonus points for Ted Haggerts cameo (telling young Levi to use his "cute kid angle" to win converts until Levi can develop his preaching style), coming right before he is nationally exposed for the hypocrite he is.An excellent, eye-opening documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two Words: Holy S***.I have NEVER had a documentary affect me in the way that this has. I am literally shaking in anger and awe after seeing this. I had to stand up and walk around the room a few times to collect myself and tell myself that the people in the TV can not hear me.I literally had tears in my eyes as I watched. I don't even know how I can explain it. Just being an Atheist and seeing how these children have absolutely no chance to make their decisions for themselves, or even be allowed to acknowledge the possibility of anything besides what the man with the microphone in front of the church says.I honestly can not see how the average Christian could ever stand for what these children are being taught in the Evangelical churches and homes.A group of children were told not to tell ghost stories because they do not glorify God. They were bused to Washington DC where they wore red duct tape over their mouths with the word 'Life' written on them to protest abortion. These children aren't even teenagers yet! They are being told to praise a cardboard cut-out of George Bush and to be prepared to give their lives in the name of God via martyrdom! If ANY of you were wondering why the USA is the way it is, the two women who made this documentary have found the answer. It doesn't matter if you are Christian, Muslim, Jewish or Atheist; this is probably one of the most important documentaries I have ever watched.If you have the opportunity to watch this, please do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>its revelations are truly scary.Two things happened to me while I was watching this movie.First, I wanted to walk out several times. Not because the movie was bad, but because what I was watching was so extreme. The indoctrination the children were being put through, the religious fundamentalism being displayed, it was very nearly too much.Second, after the movie finally ended, I felt like I really needed a shower.Make no mistake, this is an excellent documentary on a side of America that I think a large group of people know little about. Everyone should see this.The documentary starts out by showing days-in-the-lives of a couple of the kids who go on to attend the summer camp. Then it shows snippets of some of the activities held at the camp. All the interviewees speak freely about their points of view, no leading questions are asked, there is no fancy editing to show just the "juicy" bits, and there's no Michael Moore-esquire narrative voice to tell you what the documentary is trying to tell you. No judgements are made, and balance is provided by a radio talk show host, who presents a single negative, opposing voice to the positive praises of the rest of the people in the documentary.Some consider this to be more propaganda than documentary. I do not think it is propaganda. No single virtue is being extolled over all else, and dissenting opinions are not being excluded or discounted. This film simply shows a slice of life for a segment of America as it is. It aims to inform, and generate debate, exactly what a documentary should do. Regardless of one's reaction to the subject matter itself, I think it cannot be denied that as a documentary, "Jesus Camp" is a commendable effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OMG! Jesus Camp is crazy good. A very powerful insane movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jesus Christ! What is wrong with these American Pious? Why are they so disturbing to watch? Directed by Rachel Grady and Heidi Ewing, this documentary showcase, the dangers of paramilitary indoctrination, by visiting an evangelical Christian summer camp in North Dakota called 'Kids on Fire', where children take part in controversial programs designed to strengthen and intensify their beliefs. The camp's founder, Becky Fischer, discusses her mission to indoctrinate youths in the word of God, as if she was running the Christian version of Al-Qaeda. From her own crazy point of view, she's thinks it's safe. After all, it's no different than the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine or CDD. However, that isn't the image, most people see, when watching this movie. Talks about 'army of God' and telling the kids that they should be ready to lay down their lives in the name of God sounds very similar to the same indoctrination that Muslim extremists used on their youth. Indeed, seeing young people being forced into Christian military style reenactment is a bit scary. It remind me of something out of a Hitler Youth camp. I don't think that is what Jesus was saying, when 'turn the other cheek'. Honestly if you ever see Becky Fischer, ask her, that. WWJD? Because I don't think, he would love this. Its gets even weirder that Becky Fischer was OK with showing all this, in the film. Not only does, she say that this film portrayed her camp accurately, but she also thinks, this film would be a good evangelism tool to bring Christians followers closer to God. I really have no clue, what cloud, her mind is flowing on, but she clearly has to be, crazy, or that she never watched the film. Because films like this, make me want to stay away from the Church as long as possible. Clearly, this movie isn't for everybody. Not only does it, fuel negative reactions and more harsh criticism to the Christianity religion from the outsiders, but for normal Christians like myself, I found it to be, very embarrassing and troublesome. Most Christians don't act this way. Yes, some Christians do have a trouble with LGBT communities &amp; yes, they might protest outside of an abortion clinic; but most of them, are not telling their followers to worship a cardboard cutout of President George W. Bush as if a Saint and destroy mugs that represented the government. That's red flags to extreme Christian fundamentalism right there. About them, showcasing the children of the Pentecostal congregation speaking in tongues to Jesus. Yes, it sounds like they're worshipping the devil, more than Jesus, but I found that scene to be, more silly than scary. Let me be clear: becoming excited, emotional, even hyper-emotional with crying, even ecstatic, for praying is somewhat alright, however, I do believe that going with whatever sounds your mouth might utter under this trance is not what the Bible describes when it speaks about the gift of tongues. It's utter nonsense. Nevertheless, I found it somewhat harmless, unlike the next scene, where the children were somewhat forced to pray for forgiveness for being kids. I really didn't like that scene where Becky Fischer mentally abuse them. The camp seems to do that a lot. A very horrible method of making the kids cry and then using their emotional tumult to really cement their message. It's very sinister tactic for indoctrinating child soldiers. If anything, Becky Fischer is more of a hypocrite than the kids. First off, she called them to fast, yet she looks like she ate the whole supermarket for breakfast. Then she calls Harry Potter, an evil warlock that need to put to death, when Jesus was put to death, for nearly doing the same thing, many years ago. Also ghost stories are bad. What is the Holy Spirit then? Another mindless rant, she has is the separate of church and schools. I guess, she never heard that you can indeed pray in school, but it's unlawful to lead it. After all, this law, also protected Christians as well. How weird, would it be, if everybody was forced to pray toward Mecca every two to three hours? Now that would cause everybody to out-roar. Even her straw man arguments about the dangers of science and believing in global warming is full of fallacy. After all, Becky apparently thinks that power outages and equipment failures are the work of Satan. How bat-crazy stupid, can you be, honestly be? That is by far, one of dumbest statement, I ever heard. I think the worst one from her, is her criticizes of democracy because democracy means giving everyone equal freedom. Wow! What a horrible person! It's even more hypocritical and hilarious in hindsight, when the pastor of New Life Church, then head of the National Association of Evangelicals, Ted Haggard is featured later in the film. Ted Haggard's condemnation of homosexuality is ironic, seeing how he was later revealed to be sleeping with male prostitutes at that time period. Also, take notes on the arrogant, mocking tone he talks with the person holding the camera &amp; also the way, he talks to the kid. What a jerk! I'm glad, I'm not the only one that thinks they are asses. Many conservative Christian viewers like Mike Papantonio, a radio host considered these people's rhetoric message and harsh methods way over the top and ignorant. I'm glad, they feature him. So level-headed. The kids in the film were also alright, even if they were a bit brainwash. I can only hope the best for them, growing up. In the end, the film met with so much controversy that led to the closure of the camp in 2007 due to vandalism and threats. Since that date, it hasn't yet open back up. Overall: The film is fascinating, eye-opening, and well shot. It's worthy to be watch. Glad, it was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 79th Academy Awards. So check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only decided to write a review for this documentary because after reading through pages of reviews on IMDb, it seemed to me that a lot of people failed to understand its purpose. Many people giving it 1 or 2 stars because they believe this documentary to be disgusting or cruel or child abuse etc, clearly failing to understand that the entire purpose of said documentary was to highlight these exact problems!I'd been meaning to watch this for a while because I'd heard stories from friends in America about Bible camps and the like, where children are sent for what is realistically brainwashing Personally, I find all religions to have some for of mental torture involved (especially for children) so my point of view is definitely biased. However, this doesn't change the fact that this documentary does an excellent job of highlighting some major flaws with how people teach religion. If you are delusional enough to believe that religion is all good, I highly recommend watching this documentary. When you think that these children are going to spend their lives sheltered from reality, sheltered from learning, sheltered from experience, sheltered from truth: you can't help but think that these children never truly live. One issue with this documentary is that it doesn't really delve to deep into any one area of these camps. It is nothing more than an edited observation of such a camp with the occasional statistic appearing on screen. While this is a downside, it also works as a positive aspect because this documentary is only 1hr 30mins so it doesn't really drag out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crazy people living in a bubble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a cultural bubble caused by full-on immersion in Christian dogma and lack of contact with the secular outside world of different people, experiences, food, places, smells.For a (surprisingly large) group of evangelical Christian fundamentalists, there's no other life, and this documentary shows how religious intolerance, bigotry, one-sidedness and violence can be fostered through childhood indoctrination.Not that the kids in Jesus Camp are actually trained to do anything specifically anti-social, many are just brainwashed into the modern tenets of conservative Christian ideology; pro Christian governance, anti-secular schooling, anti-abortion, and of course support for US military intervention against false religions. (barring, of course, the support for Israels right to a national homeland, despite the fact that the spiritual ideal bares zero resemblance to the injustice and bloodshed in the modern state of Israel.)The most disturbing facts about this doco are the sect's anti- abortion stance. You can easily argue (and people do) for and against an individuals right to terminate early term pregnancy. Governments do of course, but then play puppet strings with the economy and peoples jobs as well. in Jesus Camp, the idea of impressing anti-abortion dogma on children (not young adults, children) is positively CREEPY. In fact, the overall tone of fetishistic reverence for gospel and imaginary Christian holiness is creepy throughout the whole film.Jesus Camp isn't really about religion per se, more the concept of childhood indoctrination, and how it fits into the larger concept of midwestern 'megachurch' businesses that supported and answered to the Bush administration during the making of this film. While the documentary doesn't take aim at the concept of faith in general, it does show the invasive and frankly crazy nature of Christian teacher Becky Fischer and her North Dakota group of pre- teen fundamentalists. Their camp activities were closed after the release of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there's one thing guaranteed to cheer me up it's religion . I don't mean I'm going to be spiritually touched by the hand of God , I mean I'm going to feel morally and intellectually superior to some Muppet talking about eternal afterlives and other nonsense . A documentary about evangelical Christians might just be the sort of thing to lift me out of festive gloom ( Christmas humbug) and if this had confined itself to deluded adults spouting metaphysical mendacity it probably would have . However a factual feature consisting of child abuse isn't going to cheer me up and neither does I suspect to any other rational , decent human being The film opens with Mike Papantonio hosting his radio show decrying the religious right with Christian callers phoning in saying they can't understand this new militant type of evangelical Christianity . Of course right away you might think this is merely selective and biased and the callers might be criticising rival Christian sects . God might love us all but he really hates heretics does he not ? Cut to a stage version of APOCALYPSE NOW with children is cameo face paint dancing to a heavy metal soundtrack . Instantly you're reminded of the line in the movie where Chef states "This is pagan idolatry man" . You said it mate . This event is the brainchild of Becky Fischer who lives up to every outsider view of Americans . Loud , ugly and clinically obese by many pounds she wastes no time in making this audience member concerned with the junk coming out of her mouth rather than the copious amounts of junk food she stuffs in to it "We have too many Christians who are fat and lazy" If you don't believe Americans suffer from an irony deficiency then this documentary will make a believer out of you , believe me . I'm doing my utmost best to be diplomatic and guard my back by saying not all Christians are like this , not even in the American bible belt . She continues and there's a rather disturbing use of the word "training children" . Let's think about that for a second . "Training children" . You train a dog , not children . Maybe she meant "condition children" since as human beings we're all products of social conditioning to a degree , but that would be concede Karl Marx is fairly correct in that a belief in God is simply down to cultural environment and the degree of belief and what God you believe in is down to culture . Worse Fischer then starts saying that children should be trained in faith in much the same way as terrorists are in the Muslim world . Hmmm train the kids to blow themselves and some infidels up you mean Becky ? Please tell me you didn't literally mean that ? The documentary then focuses on three children , Levi , Rachael and Tory and while Christian theocratic nutjobs like Becky Fischer need put in to a straitjacket and forcefed anti-psychotic medication the children here are poor wretched victims of deluded and bad parents . Tory shows us her dance moves and states "When I dance I really have to make sure it's really God because people will notice I'm dancing for the flesh and people sometimes notice that" Tory is a ten year old child FFS ! These children are victims of child abuse . It's not the sexual abuse associated with the Vatican based Christian cult but it's still child abuse and comes from superstitious nonsense . Maybe Chris Hansen and Richard Dawkins should join forces and do a show called TO CATCH A Christian CHILD ABUSER . If nothing else it's more evidence than God was , and is the worst man made invention</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the American heartland, evangelical Christians are pushing their agenda. It's the Children's Prayer Conference at the Christ Triumphant Church in Lee's Summit, Missouri. Becky Fischer is a Pentecostal children's minister preaching to little kids. She also runs an annual summer camp for evangelical children in North Dakota. She sees the indoctrination of kids in Islam and thinks Christians are falling behind. The movie follows several kids in their religious homes as they go to the summer camp.I don't like the opening with the radio talk show. It sets the movie off in a combative political sphere without putting the evidence out first. I rather the movie show what's going on and let the audience decide. The movie is simply pushing too hard its own agenda which puts this into a he-says-she-says territory. It may be eye opening for non-evangelicals or not from middle America but this movie is preaching to the choir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jesus Camp Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kids are sent to an Evangelical Christian camp to learn about Jesus and God. A couple of the kids are interviewed and some of the adults about their faith. All most all the kids would die for Jesus if they had too. All the kids had very emotional and intense experiences when they would go to church and shout to God. Most of the kids had ideas about faith from their parents and their pastor. Also the pastor and adults around them put ideas into the kids for instance, about their stance on abortion. The adults in this movie had a very key and powerful influence on the kids. Most of the kids hope to be the next Billy Graham, who was probably the most successful Evangelical Christian. The camp that the kids go to is called Kids on Fire. Becky Fisher is the founder of the camp and she talks about her mission to indoctrinate these kids about God.Throughout Jesus Camp the children would have very intense experiences with God, mostly in the church. This movie showed a lot of the other side of the life of Evangelical Christians and how some of the kids are taught a lot. Sometimes people would probably question the way that Evangelicals teach and indoctrinate children, and this movie was a pretty clear example of that. I did not know that their were really intense and faithful Christians who would actually sacrifice their life for God. These children are ingrained with the political side of religion, even though it is a camp to become more religious. This film strongly shows the religious political cultism of Evangelical Christians. This movie really opened up my mind to the worse side of religion. This movie had a kind of cult-like theme, in the way that the children were almost encrypted with morals and ideas. Jesus Camp showed me the kids who were drained from a normal childhood and I was pretty surprised about this. These kids who went to the camp did not have a fun and creative childhood, but instead had a faith intense childhood about God and Jesus.I always thought that Christianity was one of the less faithful religions in the world, but after watching this I think that it is one of the more faithful religions. Jesus Camp showed me the cult side of religion and kind of the bad side of religion. Becky Fisher and other adults in the movie were basically putting the ideas/words into the children's mouths. They kept saying that the kids were the ones who would change our world, but the adults were almost brainwashing the kids to be like them, so in that sense the kids were just like the generation of the adults just younger. I would give this movie a 5 out of 5. I really enjoyed watching this movie. It gave me another view on what was actually going on in the world and religion. The format of the movie was very interesting to watch, it really did open up my mind. Jesus Camp showed me the other side and the worse side of religion. I really enjoyed watching the interviews with the kids and how they truly felt about God. And all the things that they said were really mind-blowing. These kids really would die for God. I think that the kids and their thoughts, views, and ideas really made the movie what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touch of Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To those of us who do not live in a part of the world where it is resurgent, evangelical Christianity appears a strange thing, one part madness, one part scam, and one part cover for vicious conservative nationalism. But the standard picture doesn't altogether prepare you for 'Jesus Camp', in which we follow the efforts of an apparently true believer to teach/indoctrinate the next generation. What we see is startlingly close to child abuse: indeed, it's hard to consider how this could not be considered abuse (in the purest sense) if it wasn't being done in the name of the established religion of the day. Quite how little of the doctrine is grounded in the words and spirit of the New Testament is also shocking, as is the way the kids learn quickly to behave as expected, and to express the same intolerant attitudes as their elders. If you hadn't thought of Christianity as a contest to prove who loves God the most before, then think again. If this documentary has a fault, it's only that it delivers the goods upfront: the first 20 minutes effectively summarise most of what follows. Still this is a pretty powerful denunciation of attitudes not just misguided, but close to pure evil, yet cloaked in false layer of suburban orthodoxy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the scariest documentaries I have ever seen?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After one hour and 15 minutes? I think this film made me atheist more than ever. Yep, I am an atheist, but I don't like to be called that way, first of all I am a man of reason, logic and reality. But we are not here to talk about that.This brave and insightful documentary is definitively one of the best I have ever seen, and also one of the most scariest. And why is that? Have you seen it? You better! When I say the best, I meant ? topic. And the topic is "The danger of religion". And this film really nails it. The eerie story of children abuse and brainwashing. Now, we see these kids. These young, from 7 to 8, maybe 8-10 year old children, whose religious parents are sending them to a special kind of camps. A religious camp. Of course, there are many religious camps in the US, but after this scandalous stuff, I think those camps are dwindling? And these poor children, are brainwashed by a really evil, sick people. Kids? at that age? what a hell are they doing with their lives? These children, at that age, should play with toys, well, not with toys, they should find some sports, some other interests? but religion? Man, that's insane. Of course, they are children, and they don't have a strong mental defense, and they are ready to believe everything they hear, especially from their parents, and their OWN parents sent them to that crap hole camp to learn something about Jesus? how dumb, naive, uneducated and weak minded yourself do you need to be to send your own children to that kind of place? Enter the lady? a very sick individual ?Becky Fischer. I just can't find a words to describe this woman even more? to find a words that she deserves. Becky is Pentecostal minister and she comes from a family of ministers? yep, a brainwashing family. She is a disgusting, eerie, brainwashed, stupid, irrational, unbearable to listen? a real monster! And then we cut to these poor kids. Take a look at their faces. They look very young, innocent, somewhat tired, excited, full of themselves? take a look at their eyes, so focused on the person next to them, when they are talking about god, or prayer. You can easily see the madness produced by their 'leaders'. Becky is making a god army for US. A bunch of blind, naive kids, who listen to orders like robots. These are some very, very scary and sad parts to watch? it is disturbing. The other, probably the most scariest stuff in the film are the scenes of kids praying and purifying? moaning loudly, falling on the floor in tears. Does people, especially the stupid parents of these kids know how hard this is mentally and physically for kids? Their mind is fragile and this is a prime example of raping your mind with stupid, primitive nonsense. After, Becky tells that they did good and that's good because they believe that George W. Bush is the best president to lead US in the holy war against enemy ? Islam. So, it's all Christianity and Islam fight again. Again this posing question, which religion is better? A time wasting question? let me answer that. None of them. They are all 85% same and they are all bull crap!I got really scared when Lou Engle appeared in the film. This guy? damn it! This guy is 200% a real pedophile. Have you seen him? Have you heard him? Have you heard that tone in his voice. It's a typical pedophile tone! Check it out, it's creepy. It's a raspy voice, combined with pleasantness, charisma and love? oh yes so much Christian love. Lou was there to tell children that abortion is bad and that we come from god, not from some primordial filth? clearly, this is an uneducated man? and people still let their children near him. Ted Haggard is also here. Haggard is happy that there are so many children in his religious company? Haggard is super scary? he is really gay, if you ask me, but brainwashing has been done many times for this guy, after that 2006 gay scandal? the guy is ignorant, uneducated, dumb, blind, and he sounds like a brainwashed c*nt. Poor little kids? Overall, I suggest this documentary to all people. All of them, even believers and all other non-believers. This is a very powerful documentary that discovers a real face of religious people and their evil plans. I say that, because there are religious people who just can't keep their religion to themselves. And that's why I think that they should watch too. Think with your own head, be critical, be suspicious, be smart and be reasonable? take care everyone. One other thing? don't be an a-hole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Embarrassing Emotionalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must preface my review with the information that I am an Evangelical Christian, myself. Many of my family members are Pentecostal, and I have attended a Pentecostal church (I am not a Pentecostal, but the reasons why I have attended a Pentecostal church are not germane to the subject at hand). As an Evangelical, I am sure I have a different perspective than many of the other reviewers. This review is more of an explanation to the uninitiated than a review of the technical merits of the documentary.While I probably agree with some of the subjects' doctrines (I cannot be dogmatic, since they did not communicate their doctrinal beliefs other than being pro-life), I disagree with their methods. Young children should not be burdened with the task of trying to improve the world. Appropriate Christian education is instruction in faith and virtue- changing governmental policy is not something preteen children should trouble themselves about. While I don't really like the group's focus, I would not equate the indoctrination of children with child abuse, any more than any other sort of religious teaching. I believe the pastor and staff are very sincere, but ignorant. Their zeal for God is admirable, but their religion has misguided them into believing that whipping oneself into an emotional frenzy is equivalent to growing close to God. I hope this doesn't sound supercilious- I know Pentecostals and love them, but I disagree with many of their practices (eg. speaking in tongues). While I disagree with my Pentecostal brethren on practice, we agree on Christ-and it is He which alone unites people with such disparate beliefs.There is an error in Pentecostalism of relying on emotionalism rather than rationalism (I know many people believe Christianity is irrational, but it is a system that makes sense to those who subscribe to it). I am not discounting emotionalism entirely, it has its place in the Christian experience, but it should be a minor aspect of faith- not the dominant force. In my personal experience, the more emotional a Christian is, the weaker his faith. I am not attempting to set myself up as an uber-Christian with special insight, I have been away from God for a while, myself. I know Pentecostals who are much better Christians than myself in their love, humility, and service to others. My remarks here are those of a dispensationalist. Dispensationalists rely heavily on Scripture and little else (some of us have gone too far in getting rid of emotionalism entirely).Unfortunately, many Christians of all stripes focus on minor sins of commission (not telling ghost stories, not dancing, not reading books like Harry Potter, etc.) rather than focusing on what really is important- faith and one's relationship with God and our fellow man (I have been guilty of some of this myself, so I know of which I speak).Yes, this documentary is embarrassing. Pledging allegiance to a cardboard George W. Bush, smashing coffee cups, and putting tape over one's mouth are all rather silly. Chanting and speaking in tongues cater to the flesh, and are not productive. I am sure many people believe this is indicative of all Evangelical instruction. I remember my own past Vacation Bible School days being taught the fruits of the spirit- there was even a song "Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, and self-control." I would like to see a documentary of this type of instruction, unfortunately, it wouldn't be esoteric enough to garner interest by those outside of Christianity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jesus Camp is a documentary about Evangelical Christians and the way on which their religion works. Religion can be a touchy subject and the filmmakers could have found themselves in a very awkward position had they handled this incorrectly. I'm pleased to say they made this documentary the right way. It gives an in depth look at how Evangelical Christians see the world and how they they worship while avoiding avoiding bias. It offers two different viewpoints, one for the faith, one more so against, and they let the audience decide which side to choose based on the information that is presented in the film. Even if you're not much into religion, like myself, the film is still worth a watch. It's subject matter is rather fascinating and it'll never lose your attention. This is the proper way to make a documentary about a sensitive subject, and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting documentary that it hauntingly low-key and nuanced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady's Jesus Camp takes us to "Kids On Fire School of Ministry" in Devils Lake, North Dakota, a Pentecostal summer camp for young children who are given fiery, lofty sermons on God, Jesus, abortion, and the afterlife by Becky Fischer, the camp's pastor. The film follows three children who attended Christ Triumphant Church in Lee's Summit, Missouri, and their experiences with Fischer and the camp, as they are trained at the tender, impressionable age to be militants of God. Fischer believes that because in the Middle East, young children are being indoctrinated with Muslim fundamentalist values, learning how to strap on bombs at the ages of four and five, she is responsible for turning young children in the United States into foot soldiers for God. Her goal is to create an army of children that would selflessly lay down their life for God and their neighbor, thanks to the creation of a church and a camp where such values can be instilled.Such material sounds like the work of a haunting dystopian fantasy, but Jesus Camp is a documentary and Fischer's plans for the children she ministers to are indeed legitimate. Within the first few minutes of the film, we see some incredibly haunting and telling videos. We see a crowded church, filled with young children and their parents, some of whom have brought their infant children along, with Fischer surmising about sin and preaching the gospel of intolerance for anyone who doesn't believe the word of God. Before these children can even recognize ideas of tolerance and acceptance of other people and learn the value of culture and knowing those with different backgrounds and religions than their own, fear and doctrine is instilled in their minds and they emerge with a narrow view on the world when they should be exposed to the complete opposite.The three children we follow are Levi, a young boy who has preached at his church several times, claims being saved changed his entire life forever, and strives to be a minister when he grows up, Rachel, one of the bravest young girls I've ever seen, who walks up to total strangers in public or in a bowling alley to tell them that God wants those particular people in his army to preach his word, and Victoria, a young girl who enjoys dancing, but fears she is using the outlet for the benefit of flesh and self-expression instead of the promotion of God. We see many of these children are homeschooled by their parents, using books deeply rooted in Christian theology; one boy's science book has a problem that tells the reader to state why global warming is not an issue. The kid responds by saying that the temperature of the Earth is only rising .6F a year and thus it's not worth worrying about.Can you blame the boy? Can you blame the kids who waltz up to random strangers and regurgitate words and sentences with little conception of what they mean? The answer is no, for the protectors of these children have gone far and wide in ignoring the outside world and keeping these kids wrapped up in the protective shells of the church, denying abilities to think critically and analyze science.Ewing and Grady, however, are too smart to direct their own anger, or even personal opinions for that matter, anywhere in the documentary. They confine themselves to the four walls of the church and the camp, completely immersing us into the rituals and practices carried out by fundamentalist Christians. The only dissenting voice is a mild one, coming from liberal radio host Mike Papantonio, who voices his opinion about the children being taught to deny science. Other than that, Ewing and Grady make sure the only way you're leaving with an opinion on the actions of a fundamentalist Christian church is because you came up with the opinion and not because you were fed it.That's the beauty of Jesus Camp on a documentary level; the film is shockingly low-key, thoughtful, haunting, but in a manner that is quite poetic in nature, and shot with an almost dreamlike nuance. It's a stunning contrast to the kind of material being shown on the screen, as we watch kids crowded around one another, bawling their eyes out over sermons, listening to lectures about the sin that is abortion, and even have kids publicly answer questions about their loyalty to God or whether or not they have truly served him.One little boy reminds me of myself in the film; he's a little blonde boy with the same kind of manners and speech patterns I had when I was a child. What he has that I lacked at about five or six years old is his bravery, as he stands before his peers and their parents and talks about the difficulty of putting your faith in something and building your life around something you cannot see or prove exists. He talks about how he truly tries hard to believe, but almost can't bring himself. I was taken aback to the days when my mother forced me to go to Sunday School and different Bible classes as a means of a babysitter while she was at work with a friend of mine; I was bored out of my mind and felt like I was left out of a big club that I had no idea how to join and no idea how to practice.Jesus Camp is a haunting, uncompromising must-see and the fact that it works to be unbiased in a narrative sense works towards its favor tremendously, especially on a subject that begs an opinion. It's the kind of film that makes me blessed to consider myself a free-thinker. if that means I'm headed to hell, I'll take my individualism with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Religion cam open minds to the wonder and awe of the world. It has shaped the good-spirited decisions of many people for centuries, and continues to be extremely influential throughout the world. That's all Christians these days want you to hear. When it is undoubtedly true that Christianity impacts our society in good ways, it is absolutely impossible to doubt it is one of the most degrading aspects of human mental stability. Anti-abortion, anti- homosexuality, and anti-... Harry Potter? These are just some of the basics that many Christians go ape over. The eye-opening documentary "Jesus Camp" follows the lives of multiple children at a Christian camp in North Dakota, lead by their crazy leader. We see these kids make themselves torture themselves emotionally due to religious guilt, making it one of the most distributing scenes in the documentary. Not to mention the camp has some lunatic come in and teach the kids how people are killing babies, also known as the practice of abortion. It astounds me how some people get so rattled by embryos and underdeveloped fetus' being removed for noble causes. There's plenty of dogma where that came from. We basically see the unfolding of the kids as they are influenced by the nonsense taught by evangelical Christianity during a summer. The truth is, many Christians practice responsibly, kindly, and rightfully. Sadly, the nut-jobs believing earth is 6,000 years old and abusing kids emotionally by feeding them crap continue to infiltrate our society detrimentally. 'Jesus Camp" proves there are kids being taught real- life fairy tales with sickening dogma destroying their minds, and adults who even believe in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...doesn't quite succeed, however hard the filmmakers try. They try hard to strike a balance, or at least appear objective by giving viewers the camp administration's point of view and by allowing the moderate radio host to voice his more centrist opinion. The church being featured in the documentary is politico-extremist (if that's an expression), at once claiming to be truly American while stumping on the very principle of separation of church and state, but nothing is shown in a truly sarcastic and/or demeaning way (which could have been very easily achieved!) That was my opinion after one view: the film is reasonably balanced, but I changed my mind after a closer look and a second viewing. A non-fiction film is really akin to a fiction media object, generated by less-than-perfect humans who can't fail to utter their own approaches and opinion on a given topic, but I always (naively) search for the perfect truly non- fiction film! That never existed and never will, but who knows? In Jesus Camp, the first audio belongs to conservative voices, either in the media or in churches. However we do not see them as the camera lingers on the physical and geographical settings of the films. The very first human face we see belongs to the moderate radio host and that, in my humble opinion, is important: a story's theme and perspective is always set in the very first images (whether written or audio-visual media) and viewers' own POV is indeed manipulated in this manner. I always thought interesting that although the title of the movie is Pocahontas, the very first images of the film happen to belong to John Smith in England; Pocahontas comes after the credits! The POV has been established, viewers' identification as well, hence manipulation of the viewers. In Jesus Camp the first visual we have of the church itself is of kids with war make-up, dancing a battle dance to a call-to-arm music and lyrics. Becky will come later on to compare Islam indoctrination to... well, her own, making sure viewers don't miss the point... Highly recommended, helps explains, at least partially, this country polarization.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is an average movie. Although it is interesting to see the extremist side of the Christian religion I found that the quality of the movie wasn't good. I also felt it lacked creativity. The movie Jesus Camp follows several young children as they prepare to attend a summer camp where the kids will get their daily dose of evangelical Christianity. Becky Fischer runs the camp, called Kids on Fire. Through interviews with Fischer, the children, and others, you see how the camp is brainwashing the kids. Footage from inside the camp shows young children weeping and wailing as they promise to stop their sinning. Child after child is driven to tears. In this movie it is crazy to see children driven to tears by their religion. It shines a new light on Christianity and I think this movies provides food for thought. It makes you wonder not about the extremist view of other religions and if the camp is really worth it. To improve this movie I would have liked if they focused more on one or two kids vs all the kids. I think this would have a larger impact on the audience and share more insight to what the camp was like.</fullReview>

I was shocked to see how much a religion can influence people. Jesus is surly a strong influence to people around us. However even Harry Potter? seriously? These kids are seriously brain washed, they say that they are completely aware and not in a trance, however just watching a few kids, "pray", i got scared. They actually looked like they we're possessed. Did you see how the kids looked at the boy who said he watches Harry Potter with his dad secretly. They looked at him like he was an outsider, in this day and age, go around and id on't think you would be able to find more than a handful of people who actually haven't watched the movies before. Its the way they have been trained by young. Also isn't it a good thing to celebrate the lord, why are these children drawn to tears? Do they really feel so strongly about it, or is it just because they have been trained to do it from young. Also kids sin all the time, why is it such a big deal to them? Overall i think it is a pretty scary and interesting movie however they tend to leave a lot of questions unanswered.</fullReview>

I'm not saying that's not true but it certainty should be a decision they make on their own, even when they're older. This ignorant woman has the audacity to raise both of her children's hands, thus forcing them to join the crowd of the "God will fix everything" people. Let's not forget the God hates Homos and the other wonderful verses and teachings this church has to offer. What a sick joke. These children may just become the next generation of "intelligent design scientists" that accept anything that hasn't been proved by evolution yet to be "God's will" and everyone knows when the brainwashing Christians can't answer a question, their immediate response is something along the lines of "Don't try to understand the ways of God, you're too dumb and inferior, just accept it." I'm not saying all Christians are this awful, but maybe they should reconsider before sending their kids off to these so called "Jesus Camps"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our fanatics against their fanatics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was at least one television show that was influenced by the documentary Jesus Camp. Law And Order had an episode where Sean Astin plays a fundamentalist reverend running a camp just like the one you see Becky Fischer running here. At the end of the episode Sam Waterston had a pronouncement something to the effect that our fanatics will one day be battling their fanatics. A concept I could like except that in that fight there will be a whole lot of collateral damage done to people like me who just want to live and let live.Fischer started Jesus Camp because she sees radical Islam raising fanatics who will die and kill for the faith. This is what she thinks America needs so Jesus Camp is born. Paralleling that notion is the one where America itself has to shake off the comforts and liberties of liberalism and get behind the fanatics she's raising. We've got to forget the idea of respecting other people's beliefs and doubts and the antiquated notion of freedom of and from religion and get us a god fearing American public. For the little ones that go to Jesus Camp above all things we can't allow kids to be kids. They have to be kept from heretical ideas and things that are dangerous. One thing is Harry Potter. Those stories where a young warlock is a hero are dangerous, kids might dabble in the black arts. No doubt Daniel Radcliffe is hell bound as is S.K. Rowling.Jesus Camp gives us a terrible vision of a world I wouldn't like to live in. Ironically Ted Haggard has a part in this film before his fall from grace. Naturally homosexuality is of Satan and gays have to go back to the closet where they belong. That of course would include Ted Haggard.This documentary is a must see, especially for people who don't want to see their liberty chipped away by religious zealots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jesus Camp starts off with a roar, heavy metal Christian music, children chanting, almost as though it is a satanic cult. However we quickly learn that it is a film about evangelical Christians and in fact, this is a Christian camp. This movie follows several young children as they prepare to attend a summer camp where they will get a daily dose of evangelical Christianity. Through interviews with works on the camp, the children, and others, Jesus Camp attempts to show the unwavering belief of the faithful. There is footage from inside the camp shows young children weeping and wailing as they repent and promise to stop their sins. Many children are driven to tears and we start to wonder what is the real intention of this camp. Compared to the what I've seen in movies such as God's Jewish Warriors and the Footnote, where there are extremists of Judaism and Islam, who devote their entire lives to the cause. We can see one great commonality between all these people, that they were all brought up with extremist values in their religion, or experienced certain events which change the course of their life such as Goldstein who opened fire in the Cave of the Patriarchs. This movie is similar in the sense that this Evangelist camp is sort of trying to create and "army" by instilling extreme values into children, things like don't accept other religions and other such things but without learning the ideals and the beliefs of other religions. Perhaps this is the root for all the religious conflicts that we learn about, these extremists don't understand other religions, they don't even understand their own they are simply blindly following it and believing what others tell them to do. This is why people think Jihad means suicide bomb for Allah and have other misconceptions. In conclusion, this movie really made me think and it helped me to understand the cause of people's misconceptions of religion. I realized that I need to learn and really understand other religions before being able to judge them and perhaps that is the reason for the class of world religions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enlightening, yet, still disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jesus Camp" is a documentary made in 2006 revolving around the Christian summer camp which aims to unite Christian children to make them understand their role to take back America for Christ. Led by Becky Fischer, this Evangelical Christian camp is called the "Kids On Fire School of Ministry" and is associated with the ministry, "Kids in Ministry International". The film interlocks scenes between a radio show debate between Becky Fischer and Mike Papantonio, and then kids and their experiences leading up to and during the summer camp. The three children that are featured the most are Rachael, Tory, and Levi who are all a part of very Christian and traditional families. Throughout the documentary, it can be seen that the kids who attend camp do firmly believe that God has given them the gift to see prophetic visions and the role to pass on the power of Christ to the people around them. Common theories such as Darwinian evolution and global warming are shown to be disregarded as false, or constructions built out of political tensions. It can almost be said that the kids, especially Rachael, have had some sort of brainwashing that have made them 100% devote to their beliefs and the Christian religion, despite the fact that none of them have reached their teenage years yet. The issues that arise in this film include the stance that this camp takes on pleasure &amp; entertainment, abortion, homosexuality, and the universe as a whole. To me, this movie really served to show me how perspective really does vary depending on region and upbringing. Both nature and nurture contribute to the way an individual decides to view life, however, often times, nature and nurture will contrasts, which provides for a more balanced out perspective. The main characters of "Jesus Camps" are children whom nature and nurture have run the same way, and therefore, they really only have one perspective of the world. In educational institutions nowadays, many students learn about the beliefs and faiths of religions and are exposed to the extremities of said religions. Students are not, however, forced to undertake a perspective that parallels the religion. Kids who attend the camp in this documentary are shown to have mimicked whatever beliefs and rationale that they see around them, without fully understanding or comprehending the polarity of that world view. The core issue of this generation comes down to the fact that when passionate adults force on their perspectives to the children of the future, then there leaves no room for growth and development. As Beck Fischer said herself, everyone is targeting the kids? the enemies and the church and that is because the kids are the leaders of tomorrow. How can we, as a nation, or even as a common race, allow the more innocent of us be forced to participate in rallies and protests that are so critical just for the sake of our own benefit? Mike Papantonio was write to have asked Becky Fischer about her true intentions on targeting children. Is it because she wants to expose the lost faith of Christ to them? Or is it because she is looking for the fastest way to build an army of religious extremist?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from the movies that I have watched in Religion Class, this was the first movie that discussed the effects of religion, that I had watched outside of school. This movie was both intense but also very meaningful. Throughout this movie, we see children being intellectually immobilized in the name of goodness and purity. They're chance of being exposed to all the opportunities in the world are taken away, instead they are told that their job in life is to point out the error of others. You can also see that because the children are so highly impressionable and will mostly believe what adults tell them. This film reveals the morality and theological world view that exists everywhere. It is a theology where in one hand, some believe that our countries can be saved by teaching the children the gospel and basing everyday life on the bible. This film also shows the extent to which some adults will take their children's opportunity of living a normal childhood, in order to ingrain their own political and religious beliefs. Not only are the children in this film being forced into moral and spiritual value, they are also being manipulated into thinking the wrong things. At the end of the movie, I was still hoping that the children in the movie will in the future be able to have more exposure to reality and experience more, so that it can ensure that they will be able to build a life that is productive and caring, and they are able to become people who can accept the different views and diversity in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review is kind of long. Part-1 disclaimer. Part-2 plot overview. Part-3 quotes. Part-4 conclusion. I made an account solely to review this cinema. I don't know where to begin... This movie is practically neutral. I say this as it is not directly influenced (as near as i see) it is an actual political.. I mean 'religious' movement. It's showing actual arguments, indoctrination, and beliefs of modern Evangelicals. Now i don't think it should be confused with educated, mature, adult Christians. This is an extreme, as there are extremes to all views. Politically correct disclaimer out of the way, this movie is disturbing. By disturbing, i mean i sincerely believe Child Protective Services needs a few calls. The movie shows predominately children being raised by Extremist "parents" (not they deserve such a loose title) it shows kids before, and during a season at Jesus Camp. (Given a few years it will be another kind) it focuses partly on the obvious political motives, while using religion as a cover. The other main parts are a women who pushed for the camp's establishment. And several kids on route to being the guys who stand on street corners handing out bibles, and ignoring science which contradicts their views. Though it has an overwhelming core in creating a 'god army' it makes multiple stances teaching to 'fight' 'destroy the government' 'rid science' 'join the army' 'create 'god's kingdom on earth' etc. (Insert angry German chanting) and a kid aspiring to be Billy Graham. Oh yes, and they teach kids to pray in tongues, and literally pray in tongues to a cutout of George Bush at that. Amongst the destroying cups with 'government written on it' the home schooling where the mom says things like 'what if a teacher said you're stupid for being a creationist?' 'Evolution isn't a controversy' (she's right it's accepted by science) and a kids video about 'thousands of years ago, there was an explosion, and goop made life. silly right' or 'creationism is the only possible answer' or the main woman 'i want our kids to have the same zeal they have for scriptures as Islamic kids with grenades, and guns' or a guy showing models of fetuses to kids saying '1/3 of your friends might have been here today, but they were killed' or a pledge of allegiance about the bible. 'Harry Potter is a warlock, he would be put to death in biblical times! Don't worship warlocks!' To be fair, he's a wizard. Warlocks are all summon demons &amp; stuff. Wizards are inherently magic. And a young girl talking about 'loving to dance, but being worried it's dancing for the flesh' and my favorite, a kid going up to speak, and saying 'i sometimes have a hard time believing in god.. You can't see him, or hear him. Sometimes i even doubt the bible is true..' He then enters a weird yoga stance and the scene cuts. The main woman's face is priceless. In short, this is going to be insanely hated/ loved. I think everyone should see it. The Evangelicals will probably make their kids watch it Clockwork Orange style. Everyone else should be aware this kind of child abuse (which it is) is happening. It might help shed light on why adults can be so blindly arrogant, and ignorant in face of any shred of logic/ evidence. Watch it, but let it teach you the right lesson. To call CPS on this woman trying to make kids info soldiers. To summarize: i was much like the kids, half the movie i was laughing, the other half crying. Go with reason~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jesus Camp Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of Jesus Camp I didn't know what this was about, all I knew is that it was about kids who go to bible camp. I wasn't prepared for what I saw, all these children are strong believers in Christianity and most of their lives revolve around Christianity. One of the girls even mentioned that when she listened and danced to music she only listened to music that was directed towards Jesus, she said she didn't like other artists because their songs weren't important. However, this girl said there were a few times where she would dance for herself and this made her feel bad; I find it extremely sad that a little girl would feel bad for simply just dancing for herself. As the documentary went on there are many times where the kids are at the camp, the part of the movie that stuck most to me was when the lady was saying "Is there anyone here who believes god can do anything?" and a few of the kids didn't raise their hands but their parents raised their hands for them. I do believe it is important for people to have beliefs, but I feel like many of kids had been incredibly forced into this. Finally, the last part that stuck the most to me was when one of the boys said that he felt that people who were not Christian were like candy, that they would eventually make you sick. I was incredibly surprised because I thought that Christians were supposed to be open to others and accept them. Overall, I feel like I'm going to be thinking about this documentary for a while. The children all have strong beliefs and I feel like many children have been forced into this, I strongly hope that the children don't become like the owners of this bible camp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about children who attend a Christian camp and learn about sin. They shared stories about how God saved them and they worshiped him. They would poor water on their hands and bow down to God. They would scream his name and raise their hands in the air. It was really interesting because there are a lot of Christians in the world that don't do that. Most Christians do pray to God but these kids at the camp were weeping and wailing as they promised to stop sinning. When the kids were praising to God, it looked as if they were in a trance. It was really scary to watch because they're only little kids. The radio host discussed global warming and said that these evangelical Christians believe that global warming is not an issue because God will eventually come and destroy the world and save the ones who believe. At one point, the kids were telling ghost stories in their dorms and one of the adults came in and told them to stop. He said they should only tell stories that were true because that's what God wants. Ghost stories are only myths and should never be told. This other girl and her family would recite the Pledge of Allegiance and some prayer while touching the bible before every meal. Also, one of the kids said that God doesn't like going to churches where people are quiet and don't put their whole mind into praising him. He likes to go to churches where people are screaming his name and are fully engaged. A boy who was around 10 or 11 was getting ready to talk about sin. He said that it wasn't him who was coming up with the ideas and writing it down. He said God was the one who did it all. Sometimes when he writes, he can feel someone holding his hand and controlling his writing. And when he's talking, he can feel the lord's power speaking for him. Personally, I find this extremely strange. It's almost as if he is possessed by God and is being controlled. Overall this documentary was very interesting and had a couple of parts that were kind of scary. But it showed the other side of Christian's that I have never seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jesus Camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Jesus Camp is about "The Kids On Fire School Of Ministry." This documentary was made by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady. "The Kids On Fire School Of Ministry" is a summer camp set in North Dakota, run by Becky Fischer, a Pentecostal children's minister. The camp is an annual summer camp for evangelical children. Evangelicals believe that to be saved, you must be "born again" and accept Jesus as your salvation. Becky Fischer believes that children are very usable in Christianity. The main characters of the documentary are the three children who were at the summer camp in 2005, Tory, 10, Rachael, 9 and Levi,12 . These three children are already considered very devoted. The children are believed to be able to talk and connect to God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. An example of this is when Rachael tells a stranger that God has "special plans" in her life. Rachael believes that man's decision and opinion don't matter because God is the one who is going to judge you on whether you go to Heaven or Hell. Tory only dances to Christian based music. She doesn't believe in songs that are based on guys and girls. All the three children pack their things and prepare for their summer at the camp. Becky Fisher believes that the Devil tempts children with sin. She claims that in church, children do as they are supposed to. However, at school, they sin like everyone else. She washes the children's sin away. In the camp, the children must undergo many strict rules and regulations of Christianity. Some examples of this are they aren't allowed to tell ghost stories and they aren't allowed to watch movies such as "Harry Potter" because there is witchcraft in it. Rachael believes that God will only enter a church where everyone is praising his name, he will not enter a "dead" church. Levi feels that when he comes across someone who is not Christian, that they are sick. In her camp, she aims to train children at her summer camp to be in "God's army". They believe that God has ordained praise in silence. They put tape to cover their mouth while preaching to God.Becky feels very passionate about teaching and training children to praise God and to be in God's army. She believes that Christianity is the most important religion in the world because it changes people. I thought this movie had a very interesting and thoughtful concept. Personally, I found some parts of this movie quite disturbing because I never knew that this type of behavior towards religion even existed. Especially not from such young children. Although the way Becky Fisher acted towards Christianity seemed peculiar, I really thought that she was very passionate about this situation and that she genuinely cared about the children. The main reason why I enjoyed this film was because it showed me how adults' believes and values affect children. Overall, although some parts of this film was disturbing, I enjoyed it. Rachel Grady and Heidi Ewing did a good job representing the subject is an unbiased way. I think that it was made in a way that both sides of the story can enjoy and support their own views.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For my movie review I chose to watch Jesus Camp. Before watching this movie I had heard mixed reviews about this film. So I decided to watch it for myself. The movie follows three kids from Missouri and there experience at an evangelical Jesus Camp. Levi, Tory and Rachel are evangelical Christians. Levi, 10 years old wants to become a pastor. Tory wants to be a pro-life leader of abortion. Finally Rachel, age 9, wants to work at a nail salon and tell people about Jesus. Young kids are being brain washed about all of the modern things happening in their lives. They are told that homosexuality is wrong and prayers must occur during school. This film also shows scenes of mothers homeschooling her son about the evolution of the world. The attendees of the camp even pray to a cardboard cutout of George Bush. This movie was ridiculous horrifying. At times it even made me frightened of what the kids and their parents were doing because they would run around and chant. Although this movie was crazy and strange I still enjoyed it. I didn't expect anything like it. I would defiantly recommend this to anyone over the age of twelve because it may be frightening. Overall I would give this film a eight out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exposes the darker side of Christianity and its influence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you weren't aware of the issue of religion before, now you will be with this in-depth documentary.It follows the lives of young children who get brought into a Christian camp. What they do there is very pro-Christian, and really changes the minds of some of the children. Presenters come up and give talks and sometimes the kids will give talks themselves. It goes on to show said children actually approaching strangers to ask them questions regarding Christianity and talk to them about it.I, for one, was not aware that such things were happening across the globe. 25-30% of all Americans are Evangelists, and this documentary really exposes the extreme side of it. That they are "brainwashing" the children with pro-religion materials is the main idea that I draw from this documentary, and it is not a good one.I understand that it does in a sense put extremist Evangelists under a bad light, but they still have be moderate in their teachings. As the Radio Host says, the separation of Church and State has worked for over 200 years. Perhaps it shouldn't be changed.Overall, it is a very eye-opening documentary. The only thing that gets me is how it puts Evangelists under a bad light as a whole. 8 out of 10.- Pawin J.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 2006 documentary, 'Jesus Camp' follows three devout Christian children: Rachael, Levi, and Victoria, who all attend Christian summer camp just outside of Devil's Lake, North Dakota. This documentary maps out their journey, as well as shows how these children view the world as a result of their faith.It was really different for me to see such devotion and how into their faith these young children got. When I was younger, I never really thought much about my faith; it was just a package deal that came with my family. The other people in my Catechism class were like me, thinking it was more of a chore than a choice. We would constantly grumble about how it was so boring. However, the children shown in this documentary weren't like that at all. The children were open about their religion and strongly believed in their faith. They even seemed to enjoy their religion, something that I didn't think happened often with young kids.After watching this documentary, I learned that even at a young age, children already start forming their world view. One major component of this is faith. When kids learn what is right and wrong from the Bible, they see it as black and white. There is no grey area. For example, in the documentary, the children protest abortion rights in America, after being shown models that illustrate life beginning at conception. These kids already made up their mind that abortion was wrong, based on their faith. Overall, I found that 'Jesus Camp' was an insightful and interesting documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jesus Camp Review/Summary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Movie/documentary "Jesus Camp" by Magnolia pictures, shows the standpoint and lifestyle of Evangelicals Christians on the topic of religion. The lifestyle of Evangelical Christians as portrayed in this documentary represent them as radical and fundamentalist. Jesus Christ plays a major role in their fanatical actions. He is seen as the ultimate power, they must put values of God before their personal goals and preferences. 'Evangelicals believe that to obtain salvation they must be "born again" by accepting Jesus as their savior.' Another key player in this documentary is Becky Fischer. She is a Pentecostal Children's minister and an Evangelical Christian. She believes that the separation of the church from school is unacceptable and that their nation was founded by Christian values. So when Christ is taken from schools, the schools start falling apart and no one will be able to recognize their country. Such a viewpoint may seem taboo in todays society, but this is not even scratching the surface of idiosyncratic ideas sprung by Evangelical Christians. They also believe that they should quickly use up the worlds oil supply and cut down more trees because Christ is going to save them when the world is trashed to the brink, so why not take advantage? Not only this but they also do not believe in intelligent design and evolution. So looking at these opinions wouldn't children who are exposed to this eventually become skeptical? The answer to this question would be No. Children of Evangelicals are indoctrinated with their parents beliefs from a very young age. Becky Fischer acknowledges this and considers it acceptable because other religions are doing the same. Ted Haggard, the President of the National Association of Evangelicals, states that the reason for such positive feedback is because "Kids love the Evangelical message, God loves them, the bible is the word of God, they are gifts from God, So with all the public schools telling them they are animals, a product of natural selection. we tell them God loves you, Gods has created you and have a purpose in life." So although their message may not be too good, they do know how to very effectively teach children. They understand that children in this age learn by sight and sound. "Its very difficult to for them to sit down with a book, tablet and pencil and try to learn they way we have learned, they learn visually, they learn by demonstration, and they learn by modeling." She goes to a toy shop and picks up 20 things that can be used for demonstrations. One was a model gelatin brain. She demonstrates that bad thoughts can stick to your brain by having nasty green goo thrown on the brain. In conclusion although the fundamentalist Evangelical Christians may have distorted beliefs and brain wash children, the movie outlines their ability to teach children effectively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jesus Camp" is a documentary about the Kids on Fire camp, where children are taught or rather brainwashed into becoming evangelical Christians. The young children are made to believe that they are sinning and many cry and weep, for they believe they are evil. In the camp, they even tell the kids things such as Harry Potter being evil for being a warlock, saying things such as "warlocks are enemies of God". These children are young and at the learning and development stage, and so they are extremely impressionable. Because of this, I believe this camp is incredibly wrong in their forceful brainwashing of children. They are forcing all this information inside these children's heads to the point where these children believe themselves to be evil people. This is the opposite of what we had all learned about the teachings of Jesus, how loving and forgiving he was to all people. The camp cannot take advantage over the still undeveloped minds of these children and force them into a religion. I believe religion has to be slowly encouraged, and in the end religion should be the child's own choice. The film however was extremely well done, showing both the extremism of the camp and comparing it to scenes where of moderate Christianity in the form of the interview of a moderate Christian radio host. I would recommend anyone who has an interest in extremist religion or just religion in general to watch this award winning documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strongly Religious Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jesus Camp is a documentary about a group of evangelist Christian kids going to a summer camp to further develop their Christian faith and to help America be "born-again." Even though it is a documentary, several effects and precautions were used while directing the film. The directors, Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady, do a good job of making sure everything in the film was just right. Ewing and Grady use unique camera angles while they are getting different points of views from several sources of media. When President Bush talks, the camera always shows outdoor scenery such as cars on the road, billboards, or trees. When Mike Papantonio, the radio broadcaster, gives his opinion, the camera angle changes and shows images of the microphones instead of showing his face with his lips moving. Also, when Becky Fischer preaches, the camera is pointed at different children in her audience. The directors did this to show how many children Becky was truly affecting.Becky Fischer does an accurate job at preaching to these vulnerable children. It is in her desire to try to teach them to live as she did ? to worship God and to live for him. Her goal is to convince America to follow in her footsteps and be evangelical Christians. She attempts to change America by teaching as many children as she can to be like her. She starts with the children because they do not know any better. They have no way to think for themselves, so they think what they are told to think. Fischer preaches that they should do everything they do "in the name of God or Jesus," because God is the only pure, righteous, and holy way to live.One of the scenes that struck me as shameful is the bowling alley scene. The little girl Rachel addresses her bowling ball while she throws it by saying, "Ball, I command you in the name of Jesus, make a good hit." This makes me believe that the children under the influence of Becky believe that just because they ask God for it to happen, that it will happen. In my opinion, they do not fully understand the concept of the world. Another scene that caught my attention was the scene where Becky begins to pray for the PowerPoint presentations and the lights and the microphones. She commands the devil, "in the name of Jesus, you will not prevent this message from going out." I believe that because of these two certain scenes, it is evident that every evangelical Christian honestly thinks that by praying to God and asking him for anything they will be in no harm and will have all of their prayers come true.Within the documentary, we are introduced to three young characters, Levi, Rachel, and Tory. These three kids are all home-schooled, meaning that their only influences are their parents. The parents teach them things that they believe such as creationism is the only possibility and that there is no such thing as global warming. The children all believe what they are told because they know nothing else. They were brought up to believe that God is the only answer, so that is the way they will live. Levi wants to be a preacher, Rachel wants to spread her beliefs to everyone she can. Tory loves to dance to Christian rock music. She does not want to be like Britney Spears or Lindsay Lohan and show skin when she dances; she only wants to dance for the lord. Each of these children have their own personalities and ways of worshiping God, but their thoughts, stories, and backgrounds are all similar due to the fact that they were all raised and taught to be evangelical Christians. For the most part, all documentaries are meant to teach their audiences something new. Therefore, when I watched this movie, I was not surprised to learn new information about this religion. I learned what it is like to be an evangelical Christian. I realized that these children are being brainwashed in a sense, because they are vulnerable and have no way of knowing if their religion is right or not. They were taught at such a young age and they were not exposed to any other type of religion for them to have a chance to think on their own. I am glad that I watched this documentary film, because it gave me a new perspective on religion. These evangelical Christians have their own beliefs as I have my own. Now I am able to think of my religion and see if it was brought upon me or if I chose it.When all is said and done, the preacher Becky Fisher indoctrinates a large group of children about her personal faith and beliefs in an attempt to convert America into a nation of evangelical Christians like herself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Faith is a beautiful thing in this life, but can there ever be such a thing as too much? The documentary Jesus Camp makes this question a reality. Becky Fischer is a Pentecostal children's minister in North Dakota. She attracts children and families from around the United States to come to her Evangelical camp in Devils Lake, North Dakota. The name of the camp is "Kids on Fire" and it is not your average Bible camp, to say the least. This documentary focuses on three children named Rachel, Tory, and Levi who are fully involved in their Evangelical faith. It is a very radical lifestyle filled with ground shaking beliefs.Jesus Camp is a shock to those who are ignorant to the extreme religions that are in the United States, including myself. It is incredible that this brainwashing can occur and be kept undercover. Children's minds can be so easily molded it seems sick to teach them such extreme beliefs at a young age. Faith is a very critical component of life, so I believe that this aspect remains important. These children are being raised to coordinate their Evangelical beliefs in every aspect of life.This film brings about the strong value of a child's mind. They are susceptible to anything that is taught to them. This can be dangerous when they are told to be "soldiers" for their religion. These children are commanded to be ready to die for their faith at any moment. They practically live in fear each day and don't get to enjoy being a child. It is such an extreme religion that Fischer compares her beliefs to that of the Islamic belief. She wants her children to be as prepared as the kids with the grenades in their hands in Palestine. Jesus Camp had some ironic scenes that they used as fillers between the camp scenes. They were usually a peaceful meadow or an open pasture. This was such a contrast from the chaotic church scenes with young children crying over their sins. It was also ironic, but no coincidence, that the children's families they focused on all had consistent environments at home. Conversations were all based around the evil in our government and school systems. They prayed regularly and swore on the Bible to act according to the set rules.Another commonality was that they were all home-schooled. Homeschooled children need social interaction to have a chance at being normal. It sadly shows through that these children had little to no social interaction. Levi even tells the camera that people think that he is weird but it does not affect him. He thinks they are the ones in trouble because they are not prepared to be a soldier for God. Overall, I have sympathy for these children because they truly need to be integrated into society to ever be normal. To discover that this sort of extremism is prevalent in the United States is slowly increasing is frightening to me. These children don't even know the different religions they have a choice to believe. They are told they are the generation that will change this country and they now believe this is their mission. Some of them even started protesting in front of the white house at the age of ten. I could not have prepared myself for this documentary and it was something I would have never picked on my own. The radio really seemed to be the opposing force throughout the whole film. No one came up to Fischer throughout the film to confront her or question her. It was only at the end that the radio went directly to her to get some answers. People were too shy to say something about her outrageous religious methods. President Bush was a huge supporter of the Evangelical faith so this was probably a reason why people were so afraid. The man in charge of this country was a supporter and no one wanted to go against the President. Jesus Camp brings about the question of what else children are being taught around this country. There could be so many other religions or cults kept in the dark for fear of controversy like in the movie. Children have minds that can be molded so quickly and easily, parents need to remember to give their children space to explore. It is unfair to control their children's lives to such an extreme extent. Overall, I found this movie shocking. The fact that this sort of brain washing is being ignored is frightening. This religion is trying to turn into a version of Islam for the United States, which should cause fear for our citizens. There is no need to make five-year-old children soldiers when they cannot even fully understand what they are fighting for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very hard watch but a good one. Victimized a little by the lack of opposition and the directors thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One does simply walk out of this documentary without feeling completely conflicted about thousands of issues. Not only the issues discussed here about faith, religion, brainwashed cults and all but also issues concerning filmmaking techniques and presentation of a controversial discussion. Something tells me I'm the only a little bothered about the latter, to be fully explored in this review. "Jesus Camp" is about a evangelic summer camp led by Becky Fischer, where she's trying to make kids aware of God and Jesus existence and preachings and also training some of them to be preachers like her. We get the chance to follow some of the kids who are about to become little evangelics, their thoughts, the reunions they attend and all. And there's also a radio host and his concerns about the future of America but every time he's on screen it seems a waste of time and air to watch him making incoherent speeches about his beliefs. His last appearance deserves some recognition when he talks with Becky, complaining about what she's doing with the kids. But both are too one-sided just like this film. And we couldn't end our visit to these people without mentioning the trip they made to a reunion led by Ted Haggard. If you're not familiar with names he's a preacher, at one time President of the National Association of Evangelicals who was caught by media's attention when a male hustler said about having an affair him, being paid for that and to keep it a secret. I might forget a name but I don't forget a face. So, when he popped on the screen I reminded of his appearance on Oprah (an infamous episode in which she accidentally slap on his hands, shocked with his revelations). What's more shocking about his small appearance in the doc? His preachings about illicit acts, sins and homosexual actions. Hypocrisis at its worst.I don't need to tell my beliefs or disbelief's about anything, just check out my other reviews and you get the sense of what I'm about. But, one needs to paint a righteous picture of what was presented here regardless of anything. A&amp;E and the directors made a very good film on a impactant and feared theme, raised a lot of questions about the importance of teaching kids about religion and God. However, they left me with plenty of doubts. To me, documentaries not only have to present a discussion but also have to bring opposition, questioning, two sides. What I've seen was simply following a group, letting they speak what they wanted, make their case and that's it. The directors leave the criticism and the thoughts with us viewers without putting their voices on the line neither people who are against what Becky does. Or did, since the camp no longer exists due to backlash after the film's release. By putting voices on the line I mean, their opinions, their side of the story. Just following someone, present what you see from her or his isn't good enough. This created more doubt in me because the people we see here talk of what they think are right but we only get distorted and wrongful conclusions about them and their talk, no one is opposing her (except the useless radio host at the conclusion) and that's it, we're left to our thoughts. As a matter of fact, I'm not even putting much of my thoughts on this issue here except that this was one of the most difficult views ever while watching films all of these years. I leave those to you.But, even following those walking clichs of America was quite an interesting and meaningful experience. Some viewers really feel sorry for the kids and what they go through (it's upsetting to hear them speak some things) but there's plenty of awkwardly funny moments as well. "Harry Potter shall be put to death because he's a warlock" or something like praying for the Power Point presentation to work, or even the hypocritical stuff bought like Ken and Barbie dolls to present Bible teachings about Adam and Eve. Believer or not, "Jesus Camp" is a must-see for those who love to be provoked, shaken up with the high flies of controversial themes. But I warn you again, it won't go easier on you and it will raise a lot of questions during and afterwards. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jesus Camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie Review: Jesus CampJesus Camp is a documentary (from 2006) about Becky Fischer, an extreme Evangelical preacher of Christ, training the new promised generation of young Evangelical Christians at the Christian camp called "Kids on Fire School of Ministry". Becky's goal is to raise an army of God, dubbed "God's Army" that is equivalent of the (by all personal opinion of Becky herself) army that the Muslims are raising themselves (An army of a new generation). Becky claims that the Muslims in the Middle East are training their children at the age of five to handle grenades and machine guns, therefore they should also start teaching the children about the power of God at a young age. Fundamentally, Becky is teaching the group of children at the summer camp to have extreme opinions about Christ the Son of God.In the end, the true face of Becky Fischer was revealed. "Make war with them", "this means war, this means war, this means war, are you a part of it or not". These quotes were said without context. However, simply by judging the tone of these messages, Becky is not a preacher of peace and harmony.This documentary is unlike any other documentaries about Christ and Christianity. By looking at the methods of the teacher, Becky (cause), and the way the children behave (effect/outcome), it seems like the process of "brain-washing" has taken place. The evidences of this form of "brain-washing" are from scarring scenes of when children go into a trance and try to speak using a lot of tongue, when all the kids cry because they believe they have sinned and have become impure, and when one of the kids fell on the floor and started to have spasms in the entire body in ecstasy of the presence of Christ (according to the Evangelical Christians, Christ is present and with them), just to name a few incidents.Another unusual thing that happened was their reverence to President Bush. They believe that he is a holy man and it is thanks to him that Christianity has flourished so much over the past few years in America. Aside from the "holy deeds" by Bush, the kids also learned to stress the importance of God over others. To paraphrase the little evangelical girl, she couldn't care less about what other people think regarding what she does, only God matters, she only cares about what God thinks because God is the sole decider of her fate. The same girl also claimed that the other churches (other branches of Christianity) are "dead churches" because they are dull, they sing, but aren't active. From this one can only assume that the kids have been taught that the other branches of Christianity are tolerable, but only Evangelical Christianity is truly right. These Evangelical Christians seem to have been blinded by obsession (for example: An adult said that Bush is with them, brings up the card board figure of Bush, and everyone is revering the card board paper and touching it) and that this is more serious than anyone can imagine.-EdwardSC</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jesus Camp Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch Jesus Camp, a 2006 documentary directed by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady. Jesus Camp documents a summer camp for evangelical Christian kids in Devil's Lake, North Dakota. The film follows a very charismatic teacher, Becky Fischer. Becky Fischer trains the children to be soldiers in "God's army". Lou Engle (an American charismatic Christian leader who talks to the kids about being pro-life) and Ted Haggard (an American evangelical pastor) are also featured in the film. Ewing and Grady strove to make the film as neutral as they could as they also included the opinions of Mike Papantonio, a liberal-Christian radio host who is critical of the Christian fundamentalists' methods. Overall I thought this was an intriguing film. One thing I liked about this documentary was that the directors laid archived recordings of news reports and presidential speeches that had a Christian aspect to them over clips of the North Dakotan landscape. They conveyed a sense that slowly the separation between church and state is being blurred. Also, the archived recordings reflect the hopes of the Christian fundamentalists. For example, at one point of the film I heard a recording of George Bush appointing Judge Alito to the Supreme Court and the part that followed was the relief of the Evangelical Christians associated with the camp. Another thing I liked about this documentary was the soundtrack. I felt like the music reflected the essence of each event that was filmed. In addition, transitions from one event to another were very smooth. One thing I thought the directors failed to do was create a neutral viewpoint. I thought at the end of the movie I would have to decide which side I agreed with. However, when I got to the end of the film, I felt like the decision was made for me because the film was very persuasive in portraying the summer camp as a brainwashing facility. A motif in the film was the separation between church and state. The Christian fundamentalist adults in the film revolved around the idea of "one nation under God". From this film, I learned that a separation of state and church is important because things can get very messy. Things that are supposed to be spiritual and religious can easily become political issues and therefore lose their original messages if there isn't a barrier. I also learned how extreme people can get about Christianity. Seeing the kids at the camp break down in tears, chanting, and speaking in tongues really shocked me. I've never watched such intensity in kids, it was almost scary. However, I don't think the camp itself instilled this in them because kids were already displaying such intensity on the first day. I think it came from somewhere else, possibly their parents or their regular church. I think the camp took advantage of the seed that was already planted in the children's minds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jesus Camp Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Jesus camp shows the lives of three children who attend a religious camp called Kids on Fire School of Ministry. They are all incredibly pious Christians and aren't ashamed of their faith proclaiming many times their love of God. One of them has already given sermons, and the others are just as devout. There are two events which are shown in this movie. They are first at a prayer conference and then at the Kids on Fire ministry.Predictably the documentary doesn't really portray Christians in a positive light especially the evangelicals that are shown in this documentary. They are shown as being right-wing science bashing people who adhere to their beliefs no matter what evidence is to the contrary. Also significant is their hatred of Islam which leads them to call Islam the enemy. One of the most controversial things that was stated in this documentary was that a future president could perhaps come from one of the Kids on Fire Camps.I think that this documentary really showed the dangers that can occur if a religion goes too far and becomes cultish. Indoctrination and blind worship without any thinking processes is never a good recipe for success and this example of brainwashed kids spewing mantra they have heard from birth does nothing but reinforce this idea. The ideas which are similar to violent Islam help show how although we may believe that Christianity is a peaceful religion there are segments which are violent and the minority, but somehow still get all of the attention. Likewise people focus on the violent side of Islam rather than the billions who don't blow themselves up.This documentary is very important since it calls attention to the Christian youth who are being brought up to become warriors in the army of God similar to Al-QUeda. Showing how or problems with terrorism and bias and ignorance aren't limited to Islam and religions other than Christianity helps us understand the underlying problems and themes with these people such as blind obedience, no room for compromise, and violence as an answer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jesus Camp is a documentary about a summer camp devoted to the Christian faith. The film is based around three devout Christian children who attended the camp. At the camp the children are taught that global warming is only speculation, Islam is the enemy, homosexuality is wrong and that this generation is the key to bringing Jesus back (referring to generation of Levi, Rachel and Tory). Jesus Camp does a good job of revealing the zealous upbringing of the future generation's devotion towards god. The documentary exposes the Evangelical American community and their ideology to the ill-informed people around the world. As a person who does not particularly believe in any one religion I am alarmed by my naivety towards the more arduous followers around the world. It is almost frightening how I had to endure the shocking images presented in the movie and how the children in this camp are being taught such parochial ideas. Is watching Harry Potter actually going to perverse the mind? From a secular view it seems the people depicted in the documentary have very myopic views on the world and are not accepting to other people and their views- something that is encouraged in all religions alike. The movie highlights the innocence of young children and how easy it is to indoctrinate their minds. The shocking scene of children crying as he swears to stop sinning will forever haunt me as well as the encouragement to be part of the "army of God". It's ironic how most Christians forget that they share the same god as their Islamic brothers; why else is it called the "Abrahamic religions?". Maybe if the camps focused on teaching about religion and the understanding of other religions maybe they could end the theoretical "war". Maybe it would helpful for Christians to know that Jesus is also considered a Messiah in the Islamic faith and is highly revered. When looked at critically the three Abrahamic religions have more in common than they in difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just the Start of the Conversation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jesus Camp (2006) *** (out of 4) Controversial documentary taking a look at a summer camp where children are taught the "word of God" as the owners of the camp want to make sure that their religious beliefs take over the world through these kids. The goal of this camp appears to be that they want these kids to grow up to have powerful positions in America so that they can help spread the word of God. I must admit that I didn't see what all the controversy was. I guess I can understand if you've never heard of something like speaking in tongues or if you simply don't believe what is being taught here. I think I had a problem with some people attacking this movie simply because of what the kids are being teached. I'm the type of person who believes that anyone can believe in whatever they want as long as it's not hurting others. The question here is whether or not these kids are being brainwashed. I guess this here could be debated because anything you're taught could be misapplied to being a message forced on you. I guess I, and others, would have felt better had these kids being given options and they selected to go to this camp and learn these methods. For the most part I don't think there was anything too bad here. Yes, the abortion and homosexuality things are going to stir up a debate among religious and political types. I'm sure many are going to be upset that children are being used as an Army of God. A question on whether a parent should push their beliefs onto their children is something else brought up. Does this rub people the wrong way because these parents are pushing God on their children? Would it have been different if they were pushing a sports team, a music artist or movies? Jesus CAMP isn't a masterpiece and some of the filmmaking could have been better but the subject matter is certainly something interesting and I think the movie is at least a good starting point for conversation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard many of the messages from the movie in real life, so they are not that new to me. But there were also things that are novelties to me; such as talking to the a cardboard image of George W. Bush, discussions about social issues within the church... etc.As far as many reviewers' fear of what would happen when these kids grown up, I have some few insights. I've been with many of these similar kids when I was young; going to Christian schools, being taught as warriors for the Lord... etc; and I've known many of them in their 20's. Some of them became atheists, some ceased going to the church, some still remained. Human are rebellious and hedonistic in nature, it is difficult to become a life-long radical in a free society. Not saying if it's good or bad, it's just human nature.The church depicted in this movie is just an extreme form of Christianity.

		<shortDescription>an unbiased look into life of few evangelical Christians kids in a bible camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched the documentary "Jesus camp". I intend to share my opinion on the documentary. It was a huge eye opener for me. I consider myself to be someone who is neutral with liberal bias. Before watching the movie and during the movie I tried to clear my mind of any prejudices I have and watch it with a neutral eye.The movie shows events as it happens in a summer camp for children ('Jesus camp') run by Becky Fischer. Fischer is a steadfast believer in Jesus Christ. She can be seen saying "how could I enjoy heaven with the knowledge that I never told people that meant so much to me about Jesus Christ". She believes she's doing God's work by showing the children what God wants them to do, that is be the warrior of God.We get to hear some of the parents' rational for sending their children to such camps. They believe that God has given them these children and expects them to bring up the children with the belief in Jesus. They teach their children how the evil-minded liberal's could pollute their mind with false information (evolution, global warming etc) and prepare the children to defend their faith and believes.As a child in the camp, the viewer can see that the child has plenty of things to like about the camp. He or she gets to play with other kids in the camp (we get to see kids go-karting). Participate in social events like singing and dancing. Being told that each one of them is unique created by God with some unique purpose in mind. The documentary focuses on three kids Levi, Rachael and Tory. Levi, who has ambitions of becoming a pastor, is one of the favourite students in the camp. He can be seen preaching to the kids in the camp that their generation is key to Jesus' return. Rachael believes god wants her to spread the his word, can be seen going and talking to strangers telling them that Jesus loves them. Tory loves to heavy metal music and loves to dance. But Britney Spears' and Lindsy Lohan's songs are not among the songs she likes because they are about "boys and girls".Although I am against what they preach, I could bring myself to hate these kids. I especially liked Rachael. She genuinely believes she would helps people by talking to them about Jesus. When I look back at these kids, I could only see highly opinionated and motivated kids. It is very difficult to dislike these kids how-much ever one may hate the message conveyed by them.I found few things Fischer said disturbing. Fischer wants these kids to grow into adults who would be ready to give up their life for their religion as some Muslims do. During an assembly the speaker asks "How many of you would give up your life for Jesus?". All the kids raise up their hands happily. I'm sad to see someone telling children that it is acceptable to give up life for any cause before the kids even know what life is. I'm also disturbed by the usage of words "war" and "soldier" in their preachings. Accepted, Fisher could just be referring to ideological war, but assuming that kids would all see that as purely ideological war is far fetched.I found few things ironic. In one of the scenes, we could see that the children break ceramic cups with "Government" written on them, symbolically destroying the government that opposes their beliefs. In another, we get to see the same kids blessing Gorge W Bush who was head of the government at that time. In another scene, Fisher requests kids to come forward and wash their "sins" in holy water. I wonder what "sins" these kids of age 10 could have committed and to top it all the water was from a distilled water bottle (Nestle I guess) which is a product of science. In one of the scenes you get to see Ted Haggerd using a palm phone, what could arguably called a poster child for innovation in science.To summarise, I liked the movie. The directors have been very careful not to support or ridicule the subjects in the film. An evangelical Christian could watch the movie and be inspired by the dedicated kids. A liberal could watch the movie and get horrified by the way children are groomed. The movie is just a time-capsule that gives the viewer an unbiased look into life of few Christians and lets the viewer form his own opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched Bill Maher's religulous before this. Watching it I wondered how the adults in that film came to be so obsessed and devout to their respective religions. Well, now i know. As much as I don't believe in "god" or an afterlife or any of that crap, I still don't have much of a problem with somebody if they want to believe in it. However, that's only if they have made their choice intelligently and independently. To force your beliefs on someone else is unfair and to do it to children when they are and at their most vulnerable and naive is just wrong.I read that the makers of this film didn't want it shown at Michael Moore's Traverse City Film Festival and had it pulled because they didn't want to be seen to be taking a stand for or against the people involved, that they were making an objective film. Well somebody should. Becky Fischer is the lunatic responsible for the camp and the brain washing but come on lets face it, I think the real villains here are the parents, they're the ones who are letting their children be deceived. To me they are no better than these parents who ruin their kids lives just to make them famous, ridiculous.great documentary.... crazy people</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this is so shocking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent documentary, well-balanced, captivating and even shocking.I found this shocking, because I had no idea how bad the indoctrination of children really gets. And it's not just in the 'Jesus Camp', at home as well. We witness a mother educating her children at home instead of allowing them to go to a public school. She teaches them that evolution is ridiculous compared to creationism because creationism is 'the only answer to all questions' and that global warming really doesn't exist. That's not educating people, that's lying to people.During the movie children appear speaking 'in tongues', preaching, crying, yelling, etc. The idea of God is so real to them that it transcends all reality and they are absorbed into the moment engineered for them by the staff members. It is downright sickening to see adults leading children into such states of delusion - and make it out to be the highest truth. I bet even most religious people would feel their stomach turn when viewing this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always qualify that when I review movies involving the dissecting of segments of religion, that I come at this from an atheists mind. I will say I did think this movie was fair. What I notice usually in these types of films is that , the participants , usually willing are 'given enough rope' , so to speak. Becky Fisher , the lady in charge of this Jesus Camp was an easy target. She willingly, allowed the access and seemed quite proud of these brainwashing techniques on these young children. This was much in the way as Al Qaeda Training camps. Obviously, not exactly. No preaching of suicide bombings. There was however, the usually gab of anti-homosexuality and anti abortionists. To be truthful, these parents are to be blamed as well. No one put a gun to their head to send these kids to this regimental, brainwashing religious camp. Of course besides the hypocrisy of the very obese Becky Fisher, you had Ted 'out of the closet' Haggard. Film made before his 'transgressions' were revealed. Mrs. Fisher should also be aware that gluttony is one of the deadly sins. This is a fine piece of work and I think the greatest tragedy of all , is that these kids are not allowed to be kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jesus Camp" follows a group of eager, preteen evangelicals through the insular world of the religious right. Expecting a fun summer, the kids enroll in bible camp only to surrender to a numbing line-up of prayer and propaganda.The fun, such as it is, is organized by camp director Becky Fischer, a hefty, zealous woman of questionable taste and morality. Under her tutelage, the children are humiliated to the point of tears, made to view disturbing material, and urged to praise George W. Bush.In this weird world of twenty-four-seven salvation, harmless camp traditions, like ghost stories, are frowned on. Even heroic, goody-two-shoes Harry Potter is denounced as evil. The kids, many of them home-schooled, deeply religious and obedient, take it in stride. And this appears to be the mission of the camp: coercing children.In a hard-nosed interview on "Air America," Fischer actually endorses brainwashing as key to achieving a radical Christian majority. It's an approach, she notes without a touch of irony, practiced by Islamic fundamentalists. It seems that the ultimate goal of these camps is less about finding Christ than stuffing the ballot box. Aware that their views on evolution, separation of church and state, and abortion are spurned by most Americans, the movement aims to turn the tide with the next generation.It's a plan that's sure to fail. As their preachy line in the sand gets swept away by science, only the ignorant will stand behind it. (The camp closed in 2006, due to public reaction to the film.)</fullReview>

Why should we repeat history, although with another way of religion. Anyone telling you how to use your mind, training you like that, is sickening and evil within itself. These children are raised to be followers. What if someone went crazy one day and decided that they should sacrifice them selves or others for no particular reason and will result in the event I mentioned above. I feel passionately about this because our children are wonderful beings, who deserve to be raised with an educational and loving environment. Not trained to be Jesus robots that don't have a mind of their own. Who gives this women the right that every thing she says is true ? It is a sad attempt for her to feel better about herself, by brainwashing people. This sort of thing should be illegal. It doesn't matter what religion it is, controlling someone, is controlling someone. I want our children of that future to have minds of their own.</fullReview>

I had to watch the film in four isolated sittings to finish it, and two friends only made it to the first "break", and would not resume it at any point.But this is actually a complement to the documentary. In other words, the film makers were able to convey, well, the reality of these people, this camp, etc. The most amazing thing is that they pretty much just filmed what they saw, and let the material speak for itself...creating more cringe worthy moments per minute than anything in recent memory.Additionally, the fact that they pretty much left the footage alone, other than maybe a little timely background music and editing surely was the reason these people in the film allowed them to make this in the first place. But I have to wonder if they (campers) realized at any point what the point of this doc was...or did they think they were being painted in a good light? Or was this a well scripted practical joke using actors, along the lines of Blair Witch? If so, it fooled me...but that would make more sense that this being a voluntary documentary.</fullReview>

Honestly, I'm confused. Was this documentary supposed to turn people to religion or away from it? To me, religion is a kind of mass mind-control. It's quite sad, but it's also quite fascinating! Even if those kids would have had any question that their god was a made up lie by desert dwelling nomads, their parents indoctrinate them at birth, and continuous force them to recite the same prayers, pledges, and rituals... All of their friends and family believes the same lie, and thus it MUST be true! Countless viewers sum up this documentary in two words, "Child Abuse."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While watching this movie, I was certainly shocked to see the types of behaviors coming from young kids. I found this movie to be about a small groups of Evangelical Christians where religion obviously plays a large role in their life. Maybe even too large in my opinion. Many sections of this film gave me chills and I found myself frowning in confusion. Confusion because I have never seen anything like this. Something so over the top and dramatized. The parents, churches and ministers are the main influences in these children's lives, but sometimes I wonder whether the influences are positive or negative. It was stated in the movie that about 75% of children homeschooling are Evangelical Christians. Could there be a correlation? Thinking back to the movie, what comes to mind is all the crying, and speaking in tongues. I found that very interesting since I had never seen anything like it, but I also realized how insane and psychotic it is. I felt extremely uncomfortable watching a particular girl speak so strongly about her belief in God and her dissatisfaction with "dead churches". According to her, it is the kind that where people are sitting there, not raising their arms and saying hallelujah and yelling Jesus' name. I thought that's what churches were, not the strange kind where people really are throwing their hands up in the air and yelling Jesus' name.I found that religion is often important in children lives who's families are religious, and children's religious beliefs are usually influenced by their elders and who they spend time with most. I felt uneasy watching this movie, but if you really want to watch a movie where you will turn it off feeling disturbed and bewildered, you would find this film fascinating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary testament to the horrors of religion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very scary film and it is decidedly unpleasant to watch. It depicts a horrific indoctrination of little children by fundamentalist evangelical Christians in a straight-forward documentary manner.Seen with northern European eyes this film is a decent into a darkness that most people (who lacks first-hand experience of the USA) probably didn't believe existed. What makes this film unusual as well as powerful is that there is no real counterpoint, no voice-over, no balanced account. What goes on is seen entirely from the Christians perspective. The only slight counterpoint consist of a more liberal (read more sane) Christian radio host. The actual families portrait can't have anything to complain about, they get to tell their story without any counter-arguments. They get the whole show.Normally this would have seemed imbalanced (and in a sense it is) but this is exactly what makes the film so effective. No counter-argument is required, these people are just that scary. So instead of arguing the film-makers simply give them all the rope they need to hang themselves.For this very reason some religious nuts actually like this film. All I can say about that is this: if you watch the treatment of these children without feeling sick to the stomach then you are (and I choose my words very carefully) utterly beyond redemption.This film is very unpleasant to watch for anyone with a hint of morality in their character. It will probably make you angry, it might make you sick, it might make you cry. But you should watch it anyway because it is that important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...warned about by the preeminent adults of this somewhat disturbing little peek into the world of fundamentalist evangelicals and the malleable children ("Kids on Fire!") caught up in that world, I found this documentary fascinating viewing. Directors Heidi "Freakonomics" Ewing and Rachel "Ditto" Grady follow three highly impressionable Missouri children (and peripherally, their families) to a summer camp in, of all places, Devil's Lake, North Dakota, where they are brazenly exhorted, berated, indoctrinated, propagandized, manipulated, praised and pilloried, seduced with glibness and reduced to tears of fear and remorse, all in the name of Jesus and right thinking . "Give me the child until he is seven and I'll give you the man," or so the saying goes; those Jesuits were smart folks. So were the Nazis, and so are the followers of radical Islam, to name but a few. Get 'em while they're young--blank slates, so to speak--and write what you will upon them. Charles Manson knew it, Jim Jones knew it, and so do Pentacostal practitioners like the ones in "Jesus Camp" (and they're proud of it, you betcha!) The filmmakers offer brief counterpoint from moderate Christian attorney/columnist/radio host, Mike Papantonio, but the bulk of the film (nicely shot by Jenna "The Lord's Boot Camp" Rosher and Mira "Dearly Departed" Chang) focuses on the kids and the adults bending them into what they believe is their best shape. I can't say much else; the film needs to be seen to be grokked. I know I'd love to find out what's happened to these children since, whether or not they've been able to break free of their conditioning, or if they've simply hewn to the lines of demarcation drawn for them by their parents and pastors. The ironic appearance of a later disgraced Ted Haggard only adds to the poignancy of the film, as does a brief cameo by a cardboard George W. Bush, and the obsessive rocking of noted anti-abortion zealot, Lou Engle. Highly recommended as a genuinely unsettling revelation.Edit: Got a chance to listen to the directors' commentary, and am more than satisfied that not only were the directors intent on presenting an evenhanded examination of their subjects, the subjects themselves were quite happy with the results. This makes the film even more disturbing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie about darkness, alienation, hatred toward difference, lack of empathy, humanity and above all lack of consciousness. What can be said about those people is unfortunately true as well for a lot of people in others religions.They talk about God all day long, they go to their church/mosque/synagogue very regularly to hear their preacher but they still don't see that the true nature of God is in every human being, on this planet. Was it not Jesus that said "Love your enemy " ? ( even if there is no enemy in reality ) I really wish that some day, what they call God, will put a tiny bit of its love and compassion inside their heart and mind, so they can get out of their darkness and see for themselves</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I ran across this documentary on netflix. It was one of the best documentaries i have seen. There is no moralistic voice over to tell you how you should interpret the events in the movie. No narration is needed. The Christian fundamentalists hang themselves. You almost don't want to believe that the brainwashing is real. I found myself asking over and over "is this staged." The fact that kids were told to pray to a cut-out George Bush is just sad. The woman who runs the camp then goes on the Mike Papatino show and lies about the camp's political nature. Of course the politics isn't nearly as bad as when the preacher makes the kids cry because of their "sins."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching Jesus Camp. It literally took me years to build up the courage to watch it because I thought it might be too depressing or outrageous. Thankfully it wasn't. The tone of the movie is pleasant enough. It reminded me of an extended This American Life segment. The movie shows a somewhat extreme indoctrination of children by Christian adults. From the film, it appears that this is a relatively small segment of American society. What was most encouraging to me about the movie was the thought that some of these children are smart enough to resist this indoctrination. I myself was raised in a very religious household and I attended churches with very similar beliefs and practices from age 4-18. Around the age of 12 I began to resist and by the time I was 14 I was an atheist. I don't begrudge religion or the religious, but I do disagree with those that would brainwash children like this. I was most struck by the young boy of 9-10 with the blonde bowl cut hairdo. You could see on his face -- he wants to believe what he's being told to believe so badly, but he simply cannot bring himself to. He's too smart.The other thing that left an impression on me was a near-complete lack of child-like happiness. Only in perhaps two moments through the film can children be seen happy and having fun as children would normally do. Whenever the children are having fun, either their own indoctrination or a nearby adult comes along to clamp down on that fun. The young girl who is seen dancing wants to make sure she's not dancing "in the flesh." The young boy telling a ghost story is told that ghost stories don't glorify god and therefore should not be repeated. That is the saddest part of the movie. But some of these kids will escape.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jesus Camp(2006) This is a terrifying movie. I still cannot believe what happened at this place. This documentary scans a camp where a bunch of kids are sent to during one summer and see exactly what these kids are being taught.Jesus Camp needs to be seen to believe. We get to witness the kids become soulless and judge-mental. As the camera scans the campers, some of the kids even mention that they are not allowed to watch Harry Potter movies for a truly ridiculous reason. We get to see some of the adults running the place and what they do to scare the kids into believing and the manipulation could have not been done better. It's utterly despicable.These kids are taught one thing: that this is the only religion. No messages of love or respect. These kids get involved in politics, dragged into protest rallies, and the worst, never question their own beliefs. It would be amazing if any of these poor souls will ever live a decent life.These kids parents must be ashamed of themselves. The only time the parents show any emotion is when they see their young take the bait. What got me the most is when the kids meet Pastor Ted Haggard, who is apparently 100% heterosexual despite having a three year meth-laced affair with a gay hooker.This is a truly disturbing documentary that breaks the boundaries and may cause great anger among many. In our world, it's full of colors, in their world, it's truly black and white. This did send chills up my spine. Everyone needs to see this. A remarkable piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jesus tap-dancing Camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had my very first job interview ever last December for a summer camp I attended for six years as a child; it was a Christian camp, but that was nowhere near the main focus- I was there to be with friends, to play dodgeball, and to sing a few songs during chapel, if I wanted to. It was tolerant, fun, and peaceful. The first question in my interview, however, was, "what would I say to God if I found myself standing before him this instant?" The follow-up was, "do you interpret the Bible literally?" Needless to say, the interview went downhill from there.I found out later (after I took a job at a non-religious summer camp), that the camp I had known was gone- it had been bought out and turned into a "Jesus Camp," much like the camp "Kids on Fire" in the documentary, where children are sent away for the summer by their fundamentalist parents (who, ironically, homeschool their children because they believe they should be the ones teaching them and not some stranger) to become self-proclaimed "Warriors of Christ." I'm reminded of George Carlin's line in Dogma about how he wishes the church could "hook 'em while they're young" as well as the tobacco industry.Directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady obviously wanted to make these people look maladjusted, but they didn't have to swing their bias too far to do so. They capture several cringe-worthy moments both at and away from the camp, such as children watching an informational video in which an animated dinosaur tells that it's silly to believe in evolution or global warming. Later, they are shown models of fetuses and told that they could have had a lot more friends if only the evil women of the world didn't get abortions. And as for Harry Potter? Well, let's just say the kids tend to shy away from a kid at the camp who looks like him.The camp is led by Becky Fischer, and yes, it is scary to hear her talk. When we're alone with her, she tells us how she wants the same mentality in her "warriors" as Muslims have when they're given hand grenades and told to die for God. She claims that the children love the camp and her, but the red, tear-stained faces of the children during many of her sermons tell a different story: these kids are scared to death, afraid of being cast away and condemned, and not given any option except to listen to someone tell them that unless they completely and totally devote themselves to this they will burn in hellfire forever. At first it may just be an act so that the grown-ups won't get mad, but soon the ideas of the likes of Fischer and Ted Haggard, who makes a frightening guest appearance, start making sense. There's a word for this: brainwashing.The downside to the film comes in Ewing and Grady's lack of a counterpoint, as they contrast the fanaticism of Fischer's camp with only about five minutes of liberal radio host Mike Papantonio's tirades against such organizations. While he berates the religious right and the lack of separation between church and state, the "Kids on Fire," bow to a cardboard cutout of George W. Bush for being so openly Christian. The film climaxes with a conversation between Fischer and Papantonio, but it doesn't amount to much more than an exchange of a little mild language- personally, I would've loved to see her protesting outside an abortion clinic or a Democratic rally with her army of zombie-children cheering her on.We learn that born-agains and evangelicals make up a significant voting block and definitely have the ability to swing an election; we hear the kids being taught how the earth is only 6,000 years old and that anyone who disagrees hates Jesus; and we watch in horror as children have their mouths taped shut to somehow teach them a lesson about life. The film has gotten what it came for: we hate the adults and feel sorry for the kids. But there is hope: IMDb.com says that the response to the film led to an angry outcry against Fischer and her ilk, and the eventual shut-down of the camp for an indefinite period of time. Hallelujah.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most frightening movie since "The Ring"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily the scariest and most frightening movie I've seen since "The Ring"! I could barely sit through the movie. I've known about the subject and what the "Jesus Camps" were like, but seeing it is a whole different story. It is just beyond me how these fundamentalists can brainwash 9-12 year old children with things like:- Bush is a messenger from God - Harry Potter is evil and would have been put to death (because he's a Warlock) in the old days - Science doesn't prove anything - Democracy is a great system, but allows too much freedom to believe other things/religions - and more...What I really liked about the movie is, unlike Michael Moore documentaries, this movie has no narrative, no commentary, just whatever the people on camera were saying. There were no pointed questions and no questions aimed at embarrassing the main characters. It is as even handed as documentaries go (I've heard "No End In Sight" is another even handed documentary I still need to see). The only snippets where you can detect the directors' personal opinions is when the Christian radio host talks about how small groups of fundamentalists have hijacked his religion. But even those parts are logical and fair.Without a doubt, I highly recommend people watching this movie, and forming your OWN opinion on the subject. It's one of those movies where I can see everyone, from atheists to fundamentalists appreciating (for very different reasons). Rent it, watch it, and make sure you turn the night lights on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to join anyone's argument by commenting I just want to say what I thought of the movie. The movie shocked me. It shocked the straight *beep* out of me. Yes kids are innocent, and they hold the keys for the future of the world. It's respectable that Becky Fisher sees that. Yes I believe in God, but the God I believe in isn't one who makes little kids weep. I definitely don't feel that Becky Fisher is going about this the right way. Yes the world is a *beep*y place sometimes, but you can't take children, little children, and expose them to how crappy it is. They have to learn it on their own. You should find God on your own, maybe with some help, but not a camp where people are speaking in tongues and you are made to cry. It's awful. It scares me so much. Those kids seemed like sweet kids, nice kids, like the little girl approaching the woman in the bowling alley, but...some of this stuff is just down right terrifying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a horror film fan, THIS film scared me like no other!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you hear about children in fundamentalist nations who learn to sharp shoot or turn into human bombs before puberty, you think how glad you are it doesn't happen HERE. Um...it does. Not with guns or bombs, but rather arming children with political agendas(!) and emotional abuse that breaks them down (like all good cults do) and utterly closes their minds. To see young people crying over issues they cannot possibly comprehend (abortion, supreme court nominees, etc.) and whipped into a frenzy of theatrics and chants, truly breaks your heart. The camp director, (commandant might be more appropriate) Becky Fischer, is a vain (obsessing over her hair spray and makeup while cosmetics cannot begin to reach her true ugliness), egotistical, fascistic, bullying monster who encourages her charges to worship a cardboard cut-out of former alcoholic/cocaine user George W. Bush as if it were the Holy Grail. The cardboard cutout DOES seem to cover the depth and intellect of the man, but the way these kids WORSHIP it! Separation of church and state, anyone? Please?? I have a novel idea; let these kids BE kids (including reading Harry Potter; whom Fischer feels should be condemned as a warlock; HE'S A WORK OF FICTION, YOU NUT-JOB! Remember the Wizard of Oz? Did it lead to a sharp rise in wizardry??) and teach them simple things, like arithmetic, grammar, etc. and let them develop into human beings with their OWN values! Teach them the rewards of empathy toward others (not pushing idealogical dogma; but to listen and understand OTHER points of view) and to respect the ethics and beliefs (or even lack of beliefs) of ALL of "God's" creations. The kids in this film are emotionally battered; pushed to tears over their alleged "sins." While Fischer whips up her 'army for Christ' (much scarier than Sam Raimi's "Army of Darkness" any day of the week), Ted Haggard (of the recent homosexual sex scandal) flashes his fake smile over a hostile message of intolerance cloaked in righteousness. Hypocrisy at its core. This film teaches that if we can beat the 'kid' out of our kids, we'll have a brainwashed legion of soldiers...ready to slaughter in our all-too-adult wars. If this film were a piece of fiction, I would find it stretching credibility. As a documentary, it is the scariest horror film I've seen in a long time. Little children and religious/political dogma should NEVER go together! I would love to see these kids in a follow-up film 10 years from now; just to see if they're alright. God help them!</fullReview>

Every which way is accepted to indoctrinate, but they have to remember a lie is a lie!

		<fullReview>This documentary about preaching to kids manages to deliver without preaching to its audience. Others have explained the subject matter well enough, so I won't go down that road again. I just have to mention a few good quotes:*** Spoiler Alert ***During her call-in to Mike Papantonio's radio show, Becky Fischer said "I'm not going after my kids politically." Yet she has the kids give blessings, speak in tongues, and shout "Mr. President, One Nation Under God" to a cardboard cutout of Bush.About democracy, she says it's "ultimately designed to destroy itself, because we have to give everyone equal freedom, and ultimately that's going to destroy us."Everyone's favourite role model, Ted Haggard, head of an Evangelical organization of 30 million Americans, makes an appearance, preaching that "We don't have to debate what we think about homosexual activity, it's written in the bible." Then he looks at the camera, points his finger, and says, "I think I know what you did last night. If you send me a thousand dollars, I won't tell your wife." This generates big laughs with his congregation. Until he was kicked out of his church for doing meth and fornicating with men, he had meetings with Bush and his staff every Monday.Creeped out yet? I'm glad I'm not American, but I'm saddened that I live next door to these freaks...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arresting survey of America's bible belt which tries to show the increasing domination afforded Christian conservatives and evangelicals in politics through the mesmerizing footage captured at a popular Christian camp for children a few years ago. By introducing the current climate of the US being predominantly dictated by these right-winged usurpers, Jesus Camp is frighteningly profound as the depressing introduction gives way to documenting these young, extremely hypnotized lives as they relentlessly pursue a religious dogma their eyes and hearts have trouble accepting. Such is the extremely uncomfortable experience this harrowing documentary turns out to be, as innocent children riddle the screen with statements they want to believe in, they think they believe in, but are simply too young and pure to convey with any sense of certainty. In watching these young ones explain some of their fundamentalist beliefs, viewers experience the kind of deep rooted psychological stains on these young, beautiful minds in seconds, where it takes years to realize in our own lives. That is not to say that what these kids believe in and the kind of support system designed to empower them is any less valid then someone else's reality, for it is not the repetitive teachings themselves that discredit this kind of learning experience, but the very nature of these kid's vacant souls, as they relay the precise information on how a soul should be, that articulates the potent horror that lies beneath nearly every frame. Capturing many painfully ignorant and blissfully aware moments, Jesus Camp neither embraces nor ridicules this little documented culture of extreme Christian childhoods, and though the evidence used as it is in this film painted in my mind a distinctly unflattering portrait of this particular methodology, I would be remiss not to express the overall class these youngsters had when compared to their peers. The gray spaces that occupies the morality of this movie is usually what makes it so continually fascinating; a subject so preordained to filter through any given viewer's specific standards, that one will be lucky to appreciate the overall effect this acute documenting brings to the table.The political landscape has slightly changed since this movie came out, and the hard-hitting controversy of Ted Haggard (one of the countries premiere fundamentalists, who is in the movie pre-scandal) will likely be the nail in the coffin for many who already strongly disagree with these kind of people, and the sentiment is not without merit, but do not let the bitter hypocrisies of these parodied leaders ruin your willingness to open up to these children, and in turn open up to this distinctly powerful documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a documentary not from the Michael Moore school of film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jesus Camp is a documentary about a US-American evangelical summer camp. Just from that information, you could already throw together a visual pastiche: a bunch of pig-ugly hillbillies sippin' on a Big Gulp and mouthin' off their bizarre theories on evolution and homosexuality to staccato music, cut against soundbites from evangelical leaders, and finally some white-bearded talking head making sense of it all.In a way, it's all there -- the bizarre theories, the whackjobs and the wise lefty talking head -- but not as you know it. This is a real documentary, not a propaganda piece. It follows its protagonists and what they do, but it doesn't try to ridicule them or make them look bad. It's a slice of life. Although the filmmakers clearly don't agree with their subjects, some evangelicals might actually enjoy the movie.The special effect here is that the film lets us into the alternative reality of radical Charismatic Christians, where chubby-faced children speak in tongues on prompt, bless their bowling balls and proselytize the odd mallrat between two rounds, pledge their allegiance to a cross-spangled banner and communicate through painstakingly studied soundbites ("I got saved at five, because I wanted more out of life!"). The film mainly follows two children and their plucky minister during church services at the eponymous summer camp, but rounds off the picture with additional segments, such as a trip to Washington DC, to a service by Ted Haggard (this was filmed shortly before his sex&amp;drugs scandal broke), showing the protagonists being home-schooled, and tying in the appointment of an "Anti-Choice" supreme court judge. The estrangement from mainstream America couldn't have been greater if the subject had been the dung-eating she-midgets of Polynesia. For my taste the film makers could have lost the segment on a liberal talk radio host, the movie is really best when it just focuses on the kids and leaves out the big issues. Even so, this is one of the best documentaries I have seen in a long while.</fullReview>

There is absolutely no difference in what is going on in these churches and camps than the Muslim madrassas, and they even admittedly take their cues from the Muslim.This is scary stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing about "Jesus Camp" is that no matter your religious views, you can't hate it. Pentecostals see it as a good vision of their message, while atheists will see it as a very good horror move. Jesus Camp never takes sides. It simply tells the story of an evangelical summer camp how it is. Liberal audiences will be horrified as children are brainwashed to the ignorant beliefs of Young-Earth creationism and worshiping a cardboard cut-out of George W. Bush. But the fundamentalists will love how they are taught to fight the injustice of abortion and instruct kids on how to be good public speakers. It is revealing for all. It goes deep into the lives of the children, Levi, Tori, and Rachel, so much, that at the end, you could swear you have met them. It goes into the movements dark, ignorant, intolerant, side that believes in YEC while at the same time showing how they are teaching their young to get involved in politics. Near the end, when the camp's leader is in a debate with a liberal talk-show host, it becomes clear that the fundies wish for America to become a theocracy, showing that the growing movement is becoming a threat to American freedom. The final scene is in a car wash. I didn't know it was possible to pack so many metaphors into a documentary. This movie is film making genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched this movie twice, and both times I was stunned. It was so astonishing to see in our modern society these idiot fundamentalists. I mean as a Muslim (I don't practice) I was upset with the Islamic fundamentalism and for a moment I could understand the all the insults and remarks on how Islam is full of hate and is 'retarded.' However, after this movie I realized, "What the f-ck have I been thinking?" Anyways that's a lot off topic. The thing that amazes me is how young these children are and how full of hate they are. Five year olds were crying! The weirdest part, by far is when the preacher of the camp attack Harry Potter. (SMALL SPOILER, but don't worry) She says that Warlocks are evil and that God hates all Warlocks. I thought to myself, "hmmm, this is dumb." And continued listening. She began to say how if it were written in the Old Testament that Warlocks were sinful God would have killed all of them. Everyone raised their hands and began to chant.....and cry. All in all I highly suggest this movie. However, I will warn you the ignorance and brainwash in this movie is nauseating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I keep on hearing that this is the scariest and most disturbing film of the past year. So finally I had a chance to see Jesus Camp, and boy oye oye, this is one eye-opening and bizarre documentary.By now you should know what this movie is about. If you don't it's simply a glimpse into the lives of strict Pentecostal, Evangelist children, parents and higher-ups in this "hardcore" Christian faith. It pretty much follows Becky Fisher (the tongue speaking woman in charge of the Pentecostal Jesus Camp), and two little kids, Levi the little rat-tailed kid who enjoys quoting his mother and father, and little Rachel who is most likely going to be the next Becky Fisher.While watching Jesus Camp I was first watching it in a way where I wasn't judging anything, but just letting everything flow. Becky Fisher was talking about something, most likely something about how the crowd in front of her is the future of America. At that moment they start showing the crowd. It's little kids who are completely unaware of what the hell she's talking about. Sure there are lil robots like Levi and Rachel who are digesting everything and nodding their heads to everything that's said, but that scene was dedicated to showing how bizarre the whole scene was. You see lil "Billy" looking at his shoe-laces, lil "Tristan" day-dreaming about angels, and even lil "Homer", yes even lil "Homer" twiddling his cute lil fingers. It was just a bizarre-ass scene. And the movie is Chock-Full of them. From Becky Fisher telling everyone at Jesus Camp that Harry Potter would have been put to death, to lil Rachel going up to a young woman at a bowling alley, preaching a few lines and handing the young girl a "jesus freak" pamphlet. And believe you me, these are only two of probably a couple dozen scenes where you'll just shake your head. Sure, when it comes down to it, these Jesus Camps and preach lessons aren't really professing negative thoughts, but in the long run it's programming these little kids into being incredibly close-minded adults....just look at the parents.Again, this movie is bizarre. The tongue-speaking is beyond mental....very reminiscent of some middle east "hardcore" praying. What happens when you get two countries led by completely close-minded and mental religions....war baby. Pure war. Strap a bomb to one of these lil robot kids and you better believe they'd run into a crowd. Ha! Oh my God, if you can't see the oddity that this movie displays, you need to recheck yourself. The most bizarre thing to me about this movie is that Jesus Camp is run by a closet lesbian.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this documentary after hearing about it.I wasn't shocked or surprised by anything because I have attended different Christian churches like Anglican,baptist and pentecostal before so watched it with an open mind.I have been to Christian camp when I was younger and attended different youth events across North America and had good memories of it and met a lot of nice people.Now that i'm older and have experienced life and different stuff i'm not sure where I stand.The sad thing about these kids is that they don't seem to have free will.They are not bad kids and most Christians have high morals and are very nice people but I agree with what the man of WCBT radio said at the beginning and the caller about the political right and the fanatical teachings.These fundamentalists are preaching intolerance and hate. These kids should figure out stuff for themselves.I do resent some of the comments on here saying that this documentary is like a horror movie.These kids are just as normal as any others and it's sad to hear them being picked on.I don't agree with home schooling since there are Christian schools they could send their kids to.There is a scene in the film where one boy mentions that his mom won't let him watch the Harry Potter movies but his dad does, so it's good to see some of them not taking everything seriously. The thunderstorm scene was cool.That is one of the things I loved about camping by a lake.The scene when they are all dancing and singing "JC is in the house" made me laugh even if it wasn't intentionally funny.One part of the film I didn't like and found to be obsessive patriotism, was the disturbing part when they all prayed to a cardboard George Bush and held him in such high regard.He calls himself a Christian but is just a hypocrite since he preaches violence and intolerance.These types of Christians intimidate the crap out of me with their judge-mental ways.They go against what Jesus taught and i'm sure God isn't thrilled. It would be nice to see a sequel or follow up to this documentary 10 years later and see what becomes of these cute kids Rachel,Levi and the others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A reasonable yet restricted view of evangelical Americans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been a number of good documentaries that have come out over the past few years that speak to the elevation of the religious right from a political standpoint. This film serves as an accent mark that reflects the faith component.My only gripe/concern about the film is that for many people viewing, the context of what happens during a prayer service is so radical that those who are not accustomed to it or understand the reasoning behind what is going on are left to interpret what they are seeing within their own frame of reference.There are children crying. There are people in levels of emotional and spiritual elevation. There is a point where a girl is 'on fire' and this is not just a saying - look at her face and you can see that she is experiencing a significant physical flush.These are phenomena that occur in services and to throw them on celluloid and expect a secular audience to make anything out of them is silly. Just like wafers and wine look silly, or the practice of Sati or any other religious (or cultural) matters look barbaric and silly from the perspective of someone living outside of that culture.It's true that the filmmakers were 'evenhanded' in that they left the footage raw, but on some level this is like creating a film documentary of an open-heart surgery without commentary. Shown to someone with no context and without a knowledge of medical practices and it looks like a bloodbath and butchery - yet there would be folks who would walk away from it and felt they had developed an informed opinion during the course of the film.That being said, this film is so raw that anyone seeing it is more apt to reinforce the attitudes they already have rather than learn anything new. If folks are interested in actually learning more about how America got to the cultural point this movie is presenting, there are other documentaries better suited to that purpose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever watched a movie/documentary and thought to yourself, 'Gee! That could be me?' Well, that was me watching 'Jesus Camp'. Seriously, if this video was filmed of me when I was around 15 till the time I was 20, it is very likely that I would be participating in the very same activities as the people in this documentary.'Jesus Camp' is a documentary about Pentecostal summer camp where kids from all around the country flock to receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit and to be empowered to be an army of Christians to save this next generation. The film goes out of its way to emphasize the comparisons between fundamentalist Christianity and radical Islam. Granted, a lot of the footage was taken out of context and edited to purposefully make the group look bad. This doc was still a sobering look inside the Christian right.They show a lot of footage of children weeping and crying out as if they've slaughtered millions. Watching the film, you'd swear these kids were former drug dealers or baby killers. Really, what is there you've done at the age of ten to warrant such penitent outburst of shame.Many of the scenes were all to familiar for me. I don't necessarily regret my past, but at the same time I wonder how I could have possibly been a part of all of that. I'm so far removed form that culture at present. Although I still go to church, and the theology of the church is rather conservative, their expressions of worship and methods of evangelism are much tamer.If you've ever been to a Christian kid's camp or youth camp, I totally recommend you watch this film. It's interesting to see these things from the viewpoint of a total outsider, which is what the filmmakers are. If you've never been, you may want to watch if you like documentaries in general. This one garnered an Academy Award nomination, and as documentaries come, it was pretty decent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent documentary about raising Christian children!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie style documentary demonstrates the differance in opinion when it comes to raising children as Christians. It is NOT Evolution verses Creation, but more on liberal verses fundamental! I believe it is a very good argument! I find it hard to pick sides when watching this movie.It's focus is on "Mike Papontonio" a talk show host and "Becky Fisher" a Children's minister. Mike accuses people like Becky of brainwashing children and Becky contends that she is nurturing children to be what God expected of them.The children that are the mail focus are by first name only "Levi" age 12 and "Rachael" age 9. At first there is an introduction of the children and we are taken to "Kids On Fire" summer camp in North Dakota.Closeing the movie is Becky's call to Mike on the air. Then they have a rational conversation but do not agree. I will not say my opinion about any of the content or the opinions expressed. I just say this: Love it, hate it, have no opinion (your choice, but) "WATCH IT!".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do they need to brain wash/indoctrinate children? Is it possible that they fear that if they don't beat it into these kids minds night and day they will see that "THE TRUTH" depends on the puppet-master; what is their "TRUTH" is just another's taint. Why not teach them to respect one another and let them grow up &amp; then decide to believe or not to believe once they are old enough to understand the difference between choice and coercion.CARBON DATING. You see we can measure things like how fast atoms of carbon decay, its measuring the half life. Well this is what they call a constant. The rate at which carbon decays doesn't change from minute to minute, hour to hour, day to day, so on and so forth. So by measuring the state of Carbon decay we can date how old objects are. To teach these kids that the Earth is only 6,000 years old is to betray those that gave their lives and stood up to the catholic and later other churches and said things like the EARTH IS NOT THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE. That the planet is not flat and C.Columbus and others would not "Fall off an edge", because of science and math. They are the brave scientists that first supposed that people got sick, not from acts of "GOD" but from tiny objects so small that we can't see them. They were put to death for heresy. Since the invention of the microscope, we now know these to be bacteria and viruses, not GOD's divine punishment.Right b-4 she gets her car washed at the end of the movie, Becky says she loves America and the "American Lifestyle" &amp; being a part of the 21'th century; BECKY'S EXACT QUOTE: "I wake up everyday excited about what I am going to do, but at the same time I look at this sick old world and I go, "GOD LET'S GET OUT OF HERE."" They don't believe in GLOBAL WARMING SO THEY CONTINUE TO ACT LIKE WHATVER THEY DO TO THE EARTH AND POISIONING THEIR FELLOW AMERICAN'S (CHRISTIAN AND OTHERWISE IS FINE IN THE NAME OF CORPORATE PROFIT); then I say RAPTURE THEM AWAY AND PUT A HURRY ON IT! ON SECOND THOUGHT (to the CONFEDERATE STATES) YOU MAY GO!!!!!!! I wouldn't be happy if I didn't point out that (2) of the SEVEN DEADLY SINS are Greed and Gluttony - Why is Becky so willing to point out the Sins' of others (TO CAST THE FIRST STONES IF YOU WILL) when she herself knowingly embraces (2) of the deadliest? Gospel means the good news, not the one and only "TRUTH". Men wrote these words, BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHO? ...30-60years after Jesus died. Others with their own agenda's copied by hand these books. The "King James" Bible is a hand picked (4) gospels MMLJ out of 35 total Gospels of Jesus's life. Why those 4? Ever read the Gospel according to Thomas? Or the Gospel according to Judas Iscariot? Or the Gospel of Mary Magdalen? You won't read them in the K.J. Bible because the they were deemed long ago to be heresy? Why not display them and let US make up our own mind? Is it possible because they speak of the Gnostic ways...that God -&gt; Jesus will be known only to those who are learn'ed'. They speak of God being all around us not in a building or led by one who thinks they "know or speak and hear from God". Because to expose these gospels would tear at the truth that God created no Churches, that was man's interpretation! Through building walls and collecting money gave mortal MEN power, and PRIDE...SINS in GOD's eyes. Why when translated to "English" were 75% of the female names at that time akin to "MARY". Who might have wanted to portrait Mary Magdalen as a prostitute and not as a devoted disciple equal in Jesus's eyes to the others.Watch this movie before they turn America, into Tehran-Iran, or Riyadh-Saudia Arabia with religious police/minders.Last thing. Why don't they object when these rich right wing companies (DISNEY-owns ABC, G.E. General Electric-owns NBC, Viacom-owns CBS...why don't they object to these rich stock holders that vote Republican and put SMUT on TV? Don't blame that one on the liberals.

		<fullReview>I saw this film 2 nights ago and I don't even know where to begin.This definitely has to be one of the most frightening films I have ever seen in my wide and varied movie viewing life...and it is not even a horror movie. What this is, is a documentary film showing just how wrong and misguided the far-religious-right-wing bible thumpers that plague much of America are, and how they are teaching and moulding their young and impressionable children, nay, brainwashing them into a lifestyle that is neither funny nor dignified.I was appalled at how these children are "abused" mentally by the false, cult like leaders of one of the most damaging and disturbing movements in the so called land of the free....this is pure out and out brainwashing....these kids don't even have an honest fighting chance to make up their own minds and develop spiritually at their own chosen pace....with their own views.....they are taught from a very early age all that their elders want them to believe as far as God and religion is concerned.This is some very frightening viewing.Here is a portrait of everything that is wrong with America and the current administration in the White House and once you have seen this film you won't be as surprised at the mess that has been made in Iraq by the fools that were voted in by the misguided souls you will meet in Jesus Camp.Enjoy. 10/10****/****a must see film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The part of this movie that scared me was when Rachael, a little girl, began talking about dead churches. Not respecting other people's religious choices is problematic. This country was founded by religious outcasts escaping persecution. On the other hand, this movie leaves a good deal up to the viewing audience to figure out themselves. I think that viewers should respect the rights of the subjects of this movie to practice their religion as they see fit. Let's not be judgmental against them and hope they return the favor to us. I don't think I really benefited from seeing this movie. I feel that the filmmakers made a weak case for their cause. Just as weak as the rational handed out by the counselors at Jesus Camp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not always amazing movie-making, but its subject matter is so compelling on its own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things that should be credited to the filmmakers on Jesus Camp is that they didn't make their hand of judgment extremely on an immediate side. I think that both the left and the right wings of America, the atheists, the more moderate Christians, and even the Evangelicals, will look at this documentary in different ways. But for the Evangelicals or fundamentalist Christians on which this film puts focus on- primarily on the effects on children- I'd imagine that watching this wouldn't be entirely an affront to them. Even with the footage of the Air America radio host who pops in now and then to make his points about church and state and how there needs to be order with what is happening with the 'born again' movement in America and its effects on everyday life as well as in politics, the filmmakers don't immediately come out and say 'this is wrong wrong wrong'. If anything, they do a good job letting the footage and interviewees speak for themselves. On a personal level seeing this is disturbing, and shocking, though at this point living in this country I know also that it shouldn't be. But somehow it still strikes a chord on something overwhelming with the un-settling feeling that a Jesus camp is not something abstract or too far-out to think could exist. It's something a neighbor could be taking their kids too, in providing Becky Fisher a way to live her life as a hardcore, bible-thumping extremist.And calling her, or for that matter all of the adults (and if you'd like some of the kids by proxy) extremists is not far out claim either. Fisher even compares the camp she's set up to the camps that Islamists create to teach the kids to use machine guns and to kill. The filmmakers put her camp into the context of three families, two girls and a boy, who over the course of the film show on screen what has come out of a) home schooling, b) indoctrination of 'born-again' values, and c) a disavowal of practically anything but in what is in the control of the adults in this world. I almost thought seeing the the characters early on what these kids might be like in ten years or so on, and what a documentary on that might be like as well (there's a mention, too, that that same thought process by liberals is just stupid). And what's part of feeding these children their everyday method of evangelical information (and feeding as opposed to teaching really)? Creationism for one, which includes videos and books detailing how the world is 6,000 years old; an absolutely firm pro-life stance, which during a camp ritual includes showing off models of fetuses at 7 weeks old; the hard-pressed notions of Harry Potter as being evil and that George W. Bush is the next best thing to God. I haven't even gotten to Ted Haggard, who's scenes become all the more fascinating after the sexual scandal he was in late last year.As I mentioned before, this isn't necessarily always great documentary movie-making- the style is just to follow the kids and scenes, and to see what goes on in the camp scenes, with only some footage outside of that set-up (Fisher gets more screen time, which is all the better to see more and more how, maybe all too depressingly, she'll never know herself that she might be wrong). It's almost a little too easy as well to cut back to the Air America guy in the radio room, not that they're bad scenes by any means. What ends up making Jesus Camp essential viewing though, in the end, is that it stirs up an immense amount of conversation. In the interest of disclosure, I should mention that I am probably on the complete other side of the spectrum of evangelicals (if not atheist just about close), so in seeing this it becomes an act of seeing not just the American system of Church &amp; state separated breaking down, of a form of pure propaganda at work right in the heartland of this country, or it's the kind of institutional framework of brainwashing that will never go away as long as grown men &amp; women give money to people like Fisher to operate. But more than that are seeing the children in this environment, where everything is now all completely set in their heads for them, and with not only a 'rule-of-law' mentality put in regarding what is God and what it is to be a sinner or to go to Heaven or Hell, but that there's no other real form of acceptable fantasy (the Harry Potter bit is the best and most mind-boggling example) even if the possible idea that what they could be practicing day in and day out is such is completely admonished and abhorred in lieu of talking in tongues and radical preaching.So whether you agree with what the people in the film are shown to be doing, or if you don't (I'd think that probably it would be more for the latter, at least those who are reading this), at least to such an extent as this, it always makes for usually watchable, and even occasionally (unintentionally) funny documentary film-making. It's a section of life that you may not totally believe to be seeing, but that it exists is that much more important.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jesus Camp misses the Larger idea.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jesus Camp, a documentary that takes us into the daily lives of Evangelicals in the United States, is a delusional and frightening look at the influence this cult -like group has on the American politics. The film starts out with children speaking in tongues, and being preached to, and at times compared to the army children in Palestine and Israel. The title, Jesus Camp refers to a camp that brings children to a camp in North Dakota, where they are further brainwashed into becoming the foot soldiers of this larger, greatly influential machine.This Jesus Camp is specifically geared towards children, no matter what age, from 5 years old, to pre-teens. The pastors and preachers at this camp have the children crying and screaming until they renounce their faith, and utterly sacrifice their lives for Jesus. We see how determined the pastors are, as they blatantly inform us that the only way to save the United States is by getting to its youth.The main character of the documentary, a pastor woman, is asked about her brainwashing tactics towards these children, and replies with a comparison to the "enemy", referring to the Muslim and Jewish extreme fundamentalists. Unfortunately the films setting and idea becomes repetitive way too quickly, showing short radio snippets of the opposition to this extreme pseudo-religious political integration.The idea and part of the content of the film is shocking and hopefully an eye-opener for most of the sheltered community of the United States. The intensity of the camps is what really jolts the initial reaction of unfathomable reasoning into us, and then asks if we are ready to accept Jesus into our lives. What really frightened me was one particular character, a young girl (8 years old or so) completely subdued and hypnotized by this fear of going to hell. She seemed psychotic during her interviews, and interaction with others, which will probably just intensify as she grows older. Jesus Camp acts much like a television serial, finishing with an open ending. It would be much more interesting to see all the characters 10 years from now, and if their descent into this mad world has been circumvented by any logic, or if they have taken this path to its fullest capacity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jesus Camp is without a doubt one of the most disturbing films ever made. Child abuse, brainwashing, cults, anarchy, just awful. I never once thought that Christians of all religions could be like this, I have never been more wrong. These people are more than radicals, they are close to being evil rather than holy. I am a Christian, but after I watched this movie I felt ashamed to be one. The children that are involved in this group are being mentally tortured to the point of no return, the Church of Satan looks like the Holy Trinity compared to this. putting duct tape over the child's mouth, making them cry, making them think they are possessed. This should be illegal, it is without a doubt child abuse. I encourage every person who is involved in religion especially those who are Christian to watch Jesus Camp. I found it very hard to sit through, but very eye opening. A film that cannot be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jesus Camp" is an excellent portrayal of extremist religion in the United States. It provides a stark contrast to the negative publicity that "extremist Muslims" have received. Some of the images shown in the film are deeply moving and equally shocking. Several instances cemented my belief in the fact that there is not necessarily a god, for if he did exist, then these atrocities (i refer to them this way because there is simply no stronger adjective)would never have occurred. One such incident involved a young boy. Among other young people, the juvenile blond-haired boy proclaimed that he had sinned, for at times, he had wondered whether or not what was written in the bible was real, he then, with other "sinners" sobbed uncontrollably. This shook me to my core, for it showed that the United States, although advocating free speech, still has 80 million people in it's population who are scared to challenge what a book (yes, it IS a book) tells them, just as you have the right to deny the theories of Charles Darwin, you have the right to challenge the theories of the bible.This is what Beckie Fisher has done, she has SCARED children into being "obedient", into being mindless robots, with no opportunity for outside thought. "The Bible is a book. It's a good book, but it's not the only book", explains one of the lines from the last scene of the scopes monkey trial play "Inherit the Wind", this is exactly what the policy of the American government should be. Restricting the freedoms of every American based on the beliefs of some (I refer to the life/choice debate) is a blatant smack in the face of a somewhat democratic government (which in actually fact appears to be a slightly "closet-Nazi" government, engaging in ridiculous racial profiling at every turn). What Mrs Fisher does not realize, however, is the ludicrous hypocrisy that she herself demonstrates. As she begins her sermon near the start of the film, she asks the crowd how they like her hair, her eyebrows, how they like "the rest of her", she then begins preaching that the punishment for sin is death (scaring the children again). First of all, she is a very heavy set woman. Now, i find nothing wrong with this, except for the fact that it clearly states that she is a sinner, for it is evident that she is a GLUTTON. second, she seemed very PROUD of herself near the beginning of the sermon. An interesting paradox, one that i thought deserved to be pointed out. These instances are but a few of the scenes i found most ridiculous and shocking. And gave the movie a very well-rounded argument.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was great that the film maker was given such access to these people. In fact, so much access that I would be willing to bet someone will claim it was staged. That aside, it was very scary to see how they were effectively being brainwashed. Of course it's fun to go to camp with kids your own age. So disguising this as a "camp" makes it easy to sucker parents and kids into believing this is harmless. It isn't. It will lead to these kids being very screwed up as adults. They will soon find out that this was always a secular society and they will have a hard time being accepted. It wouldn't surprise me at all if some of them didn't become a serial killer or bomb abortion clinics or hospitals. The kid with the wicked mullet has my vote. The adults get kids to break symbolic objects with a hammer because they represent the government. Talk about training an army to stage an overthrow. Telling kids to make war against anyone or anything that isn't Christian. Telling kids that America is a Christian nation and Christian Americans are the only ones worthy to live here. So much for the Jews and the Muslims. They worship George Bush like the Hitler Youth worshiped Adolph Hitler. They decry science as fake and that only God has all the answers. They use kids a political cannon fodder over abortion and telling them that Satan is behind abortion. At least the radio announcer added some sanity to this movie.It would be very instructive if this movie was intercut with scenes from film about the Hitler Youth to show the similarities. It would be very instructive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Scared the Heck Out of Me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A documentary on kids who go to a summer camp where they learn about Jesus from an evangelical standpoint. Dirty thoughts, ghost stories and Harry Potter are banned in this camp.This film really scared me, because this was a real-life example of kids being taught ignorance and hatred. Yes, you can learn ignorance (rather than question things, science was automatically bad when it didn't serve the Bible). And you can meet Ted Haggard, the very epitome of hypocrisy (after this film, Haggard -- a preacher who knows George Bush personally -- was caught with drugs and a male prostitute). Oh, and they even have a big cardboard cutout of Bush. Creepy! Some of the kids were scary, most were just sad cases of parents exerting themselves too much. One of the main kids, Levi, wanted to be a preacher and was already "born again" by age ten. He seemed bright enough ,although his preaching was very hollow and meaningless. His actual words meant nothing other than a generic sense of booming authority.This film isn't for everyone, and many will find it boring or offensive. I wasn't offended, but did think it got boring at times. There was not really all that much material to cover. The contrast with the radio host who was Christian, but more liberal, was interesting. I don't know if this is a real documentary as it seems very one-sided, but maybe it's just that the truth is so one-sided. Who knows? Glad I watched it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to say that as an American, I feel bad that we as a country have 80 million plus who feel this way. The sheer ignorance displayed in this piece really makes one realize that not only am I in the minority, but that I am in the wrong country. This is a perfect example of white trash ideals and "deliverance" type religious motifs that have ruined this country. They had the kids touching the cardboard cut-out of George Bush. Say hello to President Bush. WTF!!! The camp director says that in the old testament Harry Potter would have been killed because he is a warlock. The over-glorified army for God and soldiers for the word of God. This was disturbing and above everything else, I felt bad for the kids. They keep making reference to the kids being president someday or being a congressman. I'm thinking they are on the fast track to serial killing and worse when their little Christian belief system starts to unravel. Even the dumbest people in the world have let downs when they pray and life still takes a gigantic turd on them. The most unnerving thing about it all is that I think God and Jesus are wonderful things. I think the bible and what it represents is truly uplifting and I respect all who glean from its passages. What is displayed in Jesus Camp is neither Christian nor is it American. Ted Haggard makes light of the fact that at 80 million strong, the evangelists sway the vote. The last time I checked, democracy was about having a choice. Not being one who believes in democracy because that is not what we have in this country, we should still have a choice. This whole thing has about as much to do with God as I do with quantum physics. Religion and politics is about nothing anymore but making money. For those of you true Chrisitians and other devout religious followers, please accept my apology in that blanket statement. To Ted Haggard, George Bush, Becky Fisher, and the rest of the evangelists, I hope you all burn in hell for eternity and curse your slimy, dirty, rotten souls. Those kids don't have a chance at all. Hey George, where do you think you are gonna go when you die? Heaven? Are you sure?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK I love scary movies, a good atmospheric horror film, etc. But I never expected to have the hair raised on the back of my neck and made to feel so disturbed as I've felt seeing Jesus Camp. Its one thing to be disgusted by the levels at which the neo Conservative extreme right will go to brainwash their followers. But to mix their political agendas so sinisterly with religion and indoctrinate that into the very core of young children, is as disgusting and dark to me as studying how the Nazis kidnapped children from their families and indoctrinated them into the beliefs of fascism. This is not Christianity! This is purely political right wing strategy out of control! Or at least one woman's right wing political agenda that she's imposing on the impressionable minds of children in such a despicable way that it seriously made me squirm to watch this. This is an excellent documentary though, and one that you could tell is made to warn people that these things are going on in our country and that we all should definitely VOTE when our time comes and not let the purely evangelical conservatives dominate the polls and control this country allowing more war mongering, monkeys like GW to send our children to die in his rich man's war.

The thing that bothered me the most about this documentary was that they focused on teaching kids about political issues such as anti-abortion, evolution vs. creationism, and praying for change in our government. Most of the camp sermons focused on their anger with how wrong the world is today. No sermons about how kids should go back to their schools and show love, peace and joy to their classmates and share Jesus in a gentle, non-intimidating way. One ironic segment of the movie shows Ted Haggard, former senior pastor of New Life Church who was outed recently about his dealings with a male prostitute, talking about the evils of homosexuality. Funny timing on the release of this movie indeed. I think these evangelical Churches need to focus a little more on compassion because many of these so called "sodomites" are in their own congregation and clergy. But anyways, I highly recommend you watch this interesting documentary because it will give you more insight on the people who make up such a large percentage of our nation today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The opinion from a not brainwashed European.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a well done documentary, about one bad subject. A subject that shouldn't exist: The education of little children to prepare them for a holy war! This could easily be an Islamic movie, of preparing the kids to be suicide bombers, because these evangelic people in the movie think they are superior to other religions and cultures. It disgusts me, it like they are religious Nazis. Really! Once you've seen the movie, and if you are a person that has not been screwed up by religion, or censorship like these Americans, you will believe me. I'm a young adult (non practicing catholic), and I try to keep myself informed about different religions and cultures but these evangelicals they are just crazy.SPOILERS AHEAD: They even say that Harry Potter, or Lindsay Lohan are devilish. To them they are the only ones that deserve the so called "heaven" and every other person, non evangelicals are controlled by the Devil. This is something that everyone that has not been brainwashed and has a minimum level of IQ knows it is false. Even the creation of the world is taught has being made by God, refusing to accept any scientific fact. The Global warming is another example of the lies they teach to children. Everybody knows that global warming is a fact, and we are screwing up the Earth, but not evangelicals... For them everything is all right and we may continue polluting and deforesting that Jesus will save us. They teach/say every crap they can to refute scientific facts and well known truths.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not an American, so for me this film is like any other documentary about exotic tribes doing odd things in far off lands that you might see on national geographic. Only this tribe is huge and doesn't seem to be endangered at all. The documentation of the fascinating rituals of these rugged people, who live in a harsh environment (it appeared to be a smog-filled desert dotted with neon signs) is truly fascinating. One unique trait of these people is that they seem to hold obese female members of their tribe in much reverence, as they are given the position of Chief Shaman. Other traits seem more similar to those of other tribes I've studied, such as the painting the faces of the children for ritual purposes, and the worshiping of a figure representing the tribal Chief. The tribe prefers to live in isolation, and has a reputation for being warlike and very aggressive towards outsiders, so I would advice watching this documentary instead of visiting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Film, not nearly as extreme if looked at objectively</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When discussing a film like this, it's hard to give an opinion without someone thinking you have a hidden agenda. For what it's worth, I don't have an agenda. I'm not an evangelical, I believe that evolution is real (as is global warming, for that matter), I believe in the separation of church and state. However I'm also not reduced to tears when I find out that someone in the US has view that are radically different than mine.A lot of things that people allege are "scary" about this film aren't really scary, just weird. If I were watching a documentary about, say, a tribe on some distant continent, and people said that part of one of their religious ceremonies involved speaking in gibberish, I'd probably say, "Gosh, that's odd" or maybe, if I was being uncharitable, "That's silly." I wouldn't, however, be shaken to the core with fear. Some people reviewing this film seem to think, however, that if white, midwestern Ameriancs who are the ones doing the weird religious stuff, then it's extremely sinister and evidence of something terrible.The woman running "Jesus Camp" has a lot of really extreme political views that I don't agree with, such as the idea that global warming is a hoax, or that the US should be considered a Christian nation founded on Christian principles. I think that's wrong. However, it's her right to believe that, and it's likewise her right to teach kids these silly ideas too. Is it indoctrination? I don't know. But I have a hard time dreaming up a scenario where the government (or somebody) sweeps in and tells her she can't do that that doesn't sound like fascism.Likewise, consider the Ted Haggarty segment. I know we're supposed to hate the guy, because of things he's said in other forums, and because he turned out to be a hypocrite with regards to homosexuality. However, in this film he basically seemed like an affable, smiling guy. It's hard to see how someone could find him to be a menace on the basis of this alone.But these are comments about reactions to the movie. Here's a few things on the film itself. I don't really believe the filmmakers assertion that this is a straight, unbiased account. True, the woman who runs the camp says plenty of things that are bizarre, and I don't doubt that her opinions are being presented fairly. However because the filmmakers kept cutting back to the Air America commentator, talking about how Evangelism is taking over the country, it's pretty obvious that the filmmakers think that this strange form of Christianity is both bad and running things. They imply, for example, that the only reason Samuel Alito ended up on the Supreme Court was because of evangelical pressure, as if there was no other reason for him to be confirmed other than that.However the fact that the film has a clear bias doesn't make it a bad film. It's pretty interesting to see how the kids interact with strangers, for example. It would be interesting to see how they turn out in another 10 years, for instance. Likewise the film has a brisk pace and kept my interest the whole time, and the fact that it made me think is an indication that the filmmakers were doing a lot of things right.</fullReview>

Honestly I am glad that this is not happening near me ? but it will soon ? just few months ago there was an American organisation advertising a movie of Jesus for kids ? and after seeing this movie I feel really shared that someone is trying to plan those filthy weeds .

Their attitudes toward anyone who's "not with Jesus" are real.Even though the "Religious Right's" plans for world domination have hit a snag what with the Democrats taking back Congress, people like this are well-organized, and are SWIMMING in corporate funding (Wal-Mart is one such funder).

		<fullReview>For me this movie was really worth watching. It is not funny or ironic like Michael Moore's "mockumentaries", it's an image in a mirror, without comments, distortions, not even the questions that have been asked, just the things you see and hear. I was genuinely shocked people can be so easily indoctrinated. I am not talking about the children (who play the main role in this movie and who, at that tender age tend to believe most that is told them by adults) but their parents and tutors who adamantly believe that this is the right way to pass on to children Christian values. I wonder what kind of society this new breed of brain-washed kids will build. I hope every viewer with a minimum of common sense and - most importantly (!) - opinion of his own will discover the numerous contradictions and nonsense in the things people say in this movie (take for instance their attitude towards political involvement). All in all, as a Christian I cannot subscribe to a movement that instead of teaching children the joy of being together to PLAY bowling (did I emphasize PLAY?), encourages them to command a bowling ball in the name of Jesus... You have to see it to believe it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great documentary. Incidentally I watched it in the same time period I watched A Brief History of Atheism and This Film Is Not Yet Rated so it made me see beyond this movie presentation. I call it presentation because, except this radio host guy who is obviously opposed to the whole Jesus for kids stuff and who appears in a very small portion of the film, there is nothing but documentary footage. So I would say it is a rather objective movie.What it is about? It concerns some Pentecostal Evangelists, a growing religion in the US, who train their kids in religious camps with the same force and radicalism as the worst of religious sects. They brainwash children with things like "you are the army of Jesus" "you will change the world" "oppose abortion" "evolution is stupid" etc. A staggering number of people are Pentecostals in the US (like a quarter or so), they support George Bush and the conservatives and more, they do it openly in their children training camps.So where does that get us? To a mass of people that listen to the words of their preachers like it's the voice of God itself. If they are told to jump, they jump, or they vote, or they go to war. They also breed like rabbits and are trained from childhood to "spread the word". They deny the importance of the separation between state and church, they embrace radical views, they want a "One nation under God". They are trained to think country and God are inseparable.This is a movie everyone (and I mean everyone) should see. This is the way of the future, these are the people who are trained to actively seek power and then change the world into God, they would push the nuke'em button in the belief God will save all the Christians. They revel in the belief that Jesus will come and end the world. Horrible stuff. And they do it legally while in the same time undermining the very foundation of nation and law. These are the people who want Intelligent Design in schools and almost got their way. And in a few years, they probably will get it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard about this documentary on my myspace.com page. A group had wanted to add me as a friend because I consider myself an Atheist and at times even Agnostic. Anyways, I saw the preview on a myspace page and right after I saw the preview, I went straight to the digital movie store and downloaded it.It's very very scary and horrible how these kids are brainwashed into believing just one thing is right and all others are absurd. To a certain extent it reminded me of how I grew up in a very small Bible community, Mathews, Va. If you didn't follow what they taught and believed, you were an outcast. I recall from growing up going to Bible School during the Summers at Kingston Parrish right down the street from the Westville Daycare my siblings and I went to, and also where my mother worked.I keep ranting about how I grew up, but what happened then has opened my eyes and made me believe differently about religion. Little things like having my hair pulled and reprimanded for accidentally telling a four year old there was no Santa, being told to make a crucifix out of used and chewed Popsicle sticks. That to me, wasn't a way that Jesus wanted to be portrayed.The way she manipulates these kid's into believing what she want's them to believe is insane. Watching this makes me think she is teaching our future murderers, and Jim Jones'.A great documentary. 10 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the "camp" humor I thought it would be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"There is no question but that if Jesus Christ, or a great prophet from another religion, were to come back today, he would find it virtually impossible to convince anyone of his credentials ... despite the fact that the vast evangelical machine on American television is predicated on His imminent return among us sinners." Peter Ustinov Evangelical Christians are easy to pick on: Their certainty that everyone else needs to accept Jesus, their passionate expression of love for Him, and their incessant proselytizing elicit snickers from those liberals dedicated to ambiguity and the uncertain and random nature of life. But the film Jesus Camp is not the "camp" humor I thought it would be; it is rather thoughtful and probably accurate about a camp that prepares future Christian leaders in society.The personable founder of the camp, Pastor Becky Fischer, claims to "take back America for Christ." Her charges are indeed indoctrinated into fundamental Christianity with its emphasis on simplicity (good and evil) and the power of Jesus. She is a portly middle aged do-gooder whose sincerity cannot be challenged and whose mantra is about taking back America for Christ. She asserts she can "go into a playground of kids that don't know anything about Christianity and lead them to the Word in no time at all," She is worth seeing in action for light fall viewing. She's one of the best representatives ever of moderate Christian worship and doctrine.Ted Haggard, president of the National Association of Evangelists (30 million strong), claims to speak to President Bush and his advisers every Monday and brags that evangelists can deliver any election. Nine year old Rachael, the most fervid of the children, says being martyred for Jesus would be "really cool." Twelve year old pony-tailed Levi is already preaching for Jesus, although a career as a trial attorney or career politician would be my choice for this gifted believer.As the antidote to this Bush-like, uncompromising devotion is an occasional comment by Air America's radio host Mike Papantonio, who is a practicing Christian but miffed at the Christian fundamentalists' politics. Indeed the participants in Kids on Fire Camp are encouraged to bless a cardboard cut-out of President Bush to help secure a pro-life Supreme Court appointment. Somehow the filmmakers avoid the Michael Moore liberal slams that could easily flow from Jesus Camp and give us a film less about fanaticism and more about people who actually believe in something that moves them toward good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thursday September 28, 7:00pm, The Varsity Opens Friday October 6, at Metro Cinemas"Equal freedom is gonna destroy us!"For anyone subjected to Conservative Evangelical Christian dogma and culture as a child, Heidi Ewing and Rachael Grady's film Jesus Camp is the guaranteed recipe for a healthy case of post-traumatic stress. Filmed at the "Kids on Fire" camp, a Pentecostal retreat in Devil's Lake South Dakota run by minister Becky Fischer, this documentary offers a look at the sick and twisted interpretation of Christianity these fundamentalists use to indoctrinate children with fear, hatred and intolerance. What takes place is no less heartbreaking than similar 'programming' western media has exposed in any Islamic Madrassa. Regardless how revealing or well intended Jesus Camp may be, in the end it is little more than a pointless exercise in self-flagellation by the open-minded, tolerant segment of society, who are clearly the audience for which this film is intended. The very nature of an oppressive, fanatical group automatically excludes the concept of reasonable consideration."I wouldn't be different if everyone else was like me."."</fullReview>

They ask for money, in the name of the Lord, and they line their pockets, keep coming back for more. Dragging you down, chipping away, misleading you all with the things they say. What they feed you, you strive to believe, giving you just enough to make you need. By the time you wake up, they're already gone, looking for the next fool to come along. Shatters your world, spoiling your mind, keeping your heart, prayer divine." - Bobby Womack ("Stupid") A grotesque documentary by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady, "Jesus Camp" focuses on the life of Becky Fischer, a Pentecostal children's minister who runs a "Kids on Fire" summer camp in North Dakota. Here, hundreds of children are lovingly taught the teachings of Jesus Christ. Which version of Jesus Christ? The right-wing, ultra-Republican, George Bush loving, human hating, demon Jesus."Dear Jesus, please let the electricity not go out," a child whispers to the heavens. Later, children gather around a cardboard cutout of US President George Bush, putting their hands upon his body as though in a religious procession. The rest of the film offers an array of creepy preachers, creepy children and creepy indoctrination sessions, kids psychologically abused and human beings of all ages subjected to brainwashing programmes that have been honed by centuries of memetic selection to hook even the most resistant minds.Today, a quarter of the United States views itself as "evangelical Christian". Fischer's kids, though, might be termed hyper-evangelical. Her camps are designed to prepare kids for religious warfare, and she instills in their minds the idea that the "enemy" is doing the same. Judging from "Jesus Camp", this "enemy" constitutes atheists, Muslims, homosexuals, climate change deniers and those weirdos who believe in abortion, evolution and loving thy neighbour.It's easy to laugh at religion. "Jesus Camp", however, doesn't mock its subjects. You sense that Ewing and Grady, who specialise in documentaries about the impressionability of children, are interested in how brains are moulded and how personalities are forged by external pressures. And these pressures, intentionally administered or otherwise, affect all human beings. We are all brainwashed. We all inherit our desires, beliefs, actions and personalities. Even the behavioural traits of the most rational, sceptical and self-reflexive human beings are psychotic at best, or rational only within contexts that are themselves irrational. As a species, most of what we do is a form of shared psychosis. Most of what we do is crazy. Most of the beliefs which consciously and subconsciously guide our actions are wrong, illogical or make sense only in terms of situations, premises or assumptions that are themselves arbitrary. To be human being is to be totally nuts, and sanity is often but a matter of statistics. So if "Jesus Camp" has a flaw, it's its insistence that the behaviour of extremist Christians is somehow more grotesque that your average human being. As far as Homo sapiens go, Fischer's kids are kinda ordinary.8.5/10 ? Worth one viewing. See "Elmer Gantry".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jesus Camp is a documentary about a camp in North Dakota that promotes the belief system of Evangelical Christians. There's nothing wrong with that, except that the movie itself provides a very extremist view on the Evangelical population. The children and their families that are the focus of the documentary are not accurate representations of the entire Evangelical population, but the way this film portrays them is that all Evangelicals are the exact same way. Take Levi, one of the children, as an example. His mother is teaching him that global warming is fake because the earth's temperature has only been raised less than one degree, and she also believes that creationism is the perfect way to view the world, while evolution is a false illusion that is being taught to children. This view of hers leads her to homeschool her children because she believes she can do it better than local schools. The camp itself seems somewhat militaristic in the sense that the camp leader even refers to the children as the 'army' of God, a term that has a somewhat aggressive connotation. Overall, the movie's facts and representations are not accurate and I wouldn't recommend it to others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christianity is a religion practiced by many people in the world. I have been a Christian since I was three and I grew up in a Christian family. Even though we are not every Christian, we our family still go to church every once in a while. I have been to summer religion camps before and I do not think it was a appropriate for kids to get to know God at such a young age. Because when kids get older they will be able to make decisions of their own and they can make decisions on what religion they want to believe in. The documentary I watched is Jesus Camp. Jesus Camp went in depth with kids going to a Christian camp during summer. There are kids going to the camp with the "reborn" stage of their lives, like they have been enlighten by God. Kids would often prayed during the camp. One moment when there the kid walked up to the stranger at the bowling ally and said God wants you to follow him, and gave the stranger a book about God. To some that might be a brave thing to do, but to others they would think that girl is weird. The women that received the book gave the little girl a weird look. In the camp the kids were given fundamental knowledge about Jesus, they would learn about Jesus and pray in a big group. Some people would view this camp as meaningful because the kids are starting to know Christianity at such a young age, but some would see this camp as to brainwashing the little kids. There were quite a few scenes that little kids would start crying and tears would come down their faces. They would continue to sit like they would be meditating and hands up and look up at the ceiling of the camp. That moment I have a thought in my mind, that is not like Christianity that is like Christianity mixed with Buddhism. But that was a good thing for the kids because they get to meet God at such a young age and hopefully God will lead them to the correct path. This movie received quite a lot of criticism and controversy. Of the people I talked to about this movie, most of them believed that the leaders of the camp are brainwashing the kids. The scene when the kids began to pray and their tongues out and speaking Latin was disturbing to me. It got even more disturbing to me when the kid began to cry and continued to speak Latin. That scene gave me a feeling that the kids have no idea what they are doing but all the know is to pray and start crying. Personally, I think that this movie is both disturbing and meaningful to others. There was one example of how this movie is a bit disturbing for me, that is when all the kids in the camp started to cry and when one kid began to cry, many followed. It gave me a feeling that the kids are crying because the other kids began to cry, like group script. This movie gave me a feeling that the people at the camp are somewhat brainwashing the kids, making them believe God is everything to life. But that is not how I personally view this world, I believe that science played an important role in earth's creation and existence of human. But this documentary could be meaningful to Christians viewers, because it shows that little kids are being brought up in a Christian environment that could help them understand their existence and the reason they are here. Over I thought this movie was disturbing, disquieting and frightening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jesus Camp" is a documentary where children attend a summer camp where they are taught to become evangelical Christians. Becky Fischer is one of the camp instructors and her goal in life is to teach the word of God and spread God's message to young children. Her philosophy is that the younger the children, the easier it is to teach them about the Lord. Throughout the documentary, she has the power and talent touch the hearts of young children and adults. Children at the age of nine attend this camp in the attempt to try and reach out to God. This may be easier said than done, especially because you can't see God nor feel God. God is an abstract force.I did not enjoy watching this documentary. I thought that Becky Fischer was brainwashing these children into believing in God. Everybody should understand the many religions out there before choosing the one that you think best suits you. Everyone should embark on their own spiritual journey and find their true religion. I think that it is really hard to fully understand what you believe in at the age of nine. It takes a lifetime to truly understand each and every religion. You cannot simply slip in and out of a religion, which is why I think that children in this camp are being brainwashed.I would recommend this documentary to those who are truly evangelical Christians. I feel that they would enjoy this movie more than I would. Nonetheless, this was a very well-done documentary and transcends the true message of God.</fullReview>

My late trainer always called me his adopted son and I loved him dearly enough to say goodbye too him on his death bed before he died of cancer. This is nothing personal towards the makers and the participants of the Jesus Camp. What I didn't like about the movie they never spoke about God's Ten Commandments nor did their church display them. It is the same old age old story when it comes to religious films they are all reluctant to preach about God's Ten Commandments for what they actually stand for, and while I'm on the subject of churches and films being made in the name of God: How come none of them have banners put up for God that he is The King Of His Universe?? God also created the universe as well as other worlds,and the bible states put up your banners for God. Show me one church that puts up banners for God showing he is King of His Universe. I keep doing what I do, promoting the most powerful laws ever written in the history of the world mainly because God himself wrote them and trying to give God his unspoken and unwritten glory's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jesus Camp is a deeply disturbing documentary about radicalism in Evangelical Christianity by using children to preach the Bible and about Jesus Christ. Pastor Becky Fischer comes across as a well-meaning preacher but she really is not working in the best interests of the young children in the ministry. I was shocked also by the Evangelical Christians watching very disturbing videos on television that were cartoons but religious as well. In this documentary, the children are being given a mission to stop abortion and preach the Bible to everybody in order to save them supposedly. I now realized how different some parts of America are for those of us who don't want to be saved by them. The speaking of tongues, the blessings of everything from computers to the buildings, the children crying, and duct-tape on their mouths with regards to stopping abortion. It was all very disturbing. What was even more disturbing is that a majority of home-schooled children about 75 percent are Evangelical Christians. When I see the children in the video like Rachael, Levi, and Tory, I worry about their mental well-being. I thought Catholic School was bad but we were never indoctrinated all hours of the day. We even learned about evolution in Catholic school.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling Sojourn into the Horrors of Evangelical Christianity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I previewed this movie in that my church was having a retreat and going to view and discuss it. Give me blood and gore anytime. This film was truly terrifying.I was appalled by the guilt the adult leaders laid on these children. Because of this guilt, I cannot see how any of the children in this film can be said to experience a "normal" childhood. The red-headed boy reduced to tears because he knows he constantly sins and can't stop himself. The girl who knows whether she is "dancing in the spirit" or "dancing in the flesh" is pretty heady stuff to by laying on a ten year old. The older boy preparing to be an evangelist has got all of the patter, gestures, and moves down; he even idolizes Ted Haggard (I can't help by wonder how Ted Haggard's fall from grace impacted the boy).What is equally frightening is the realization that some churches will actually applaud what goes on at Jesus Camp and cannot see it for the potential danger it can hold for the children attending.The discussion the film generated on our church's retreat what awesome. Everybody expressed concern in the psychological abuse and harm heaped upon those children "in the name of God." I feel this movie needs to be seen more, particularly in churches and/or by church groups; my only hope is that they are realistic enough in their faith and understanding of the Bible to understand how anti-Christian camps like this are.</fullReview>

Regardless of your religious beliefs, this movie will send you into a spin of emotions. It inspired me to write this review (my first review).10 minutes into the film, I wanted to throw something at the television. As far as the movie goes, it was well done and well produced. If I could give advice, I would say do not watch this movie if you're wanting to watch something before you sleep because it will wake you up in anger. The scariest thing about the movie is the feeling at the end of it when you realize this stuff is real and happens.

The power these minister held over their congregations helps me to understand why so many so-called Christian sects or Megachurches have been racked with scandal after scandal after scandal. The likes of Pat Robertson, Al Sharpton, Ted Haggard, Paul Barnes, D.E. (Earl) Paulk, Jimmy Swaggert, Jim Bakker, William Dodd, and other so-called Christian leaders have all been caught in various types of embarrassing scandals and after watching Jesus Camp it is no wonder that these leaders are able to get away with so much monkey business. The Biblican prophecies of latter-day churches being established to get gain, of having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof all makes much more sense after one viewing of Jesus Camp. Hearing the mantra-like, repeated chanting smacked of cult-like indoctrination and mind control.I am speechless. This documentary should act as a disinfectant for anyone interested in joining one of these cult-like, so-called Christian sects. Buyer Beware!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A degenerate liberal's nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From all the things I read, I was ready to believe this documentary was going to show a bunch of people dressed in devil suits, screaming at a bunch of crying children about the evils of the world and how they must go out there and start a war for Jesus. Give me a break. These Evangelical types might be a bit extreme for those of us not used to being around that kind of crowd but the way they are spoken of as if they were some kind of lunatic fringe who "abuse those poor children" with their beliefs is pathetic.Levi and Rachel are both very bright, extremely intelligent, very likable young kids who seem very earnest in what they are saying. Of course, it's not like they had a chance to learn anything different, but whose child does? You grow up in the society and sociocultural or religious milieu in which you are born and you that is what you learn. But in the case of a bunch of Christians we are supposed to believe it's bad because... well, why? That is the question.The reason so many idiots are talking about this documentary in such terms (I myself found it on a movie discussion forum where it was mentioned in a thread entitled "Most depressing movie you ever saw"--stupidity) is that Christians are the people who created this country and it is their mores which all the degenerates, perverts, and deviants want to eradicate in order that they may feel comfortable.The people who will be "shocked" and "depressed" over this documentary--the self-righteous morons--are the same people who live in the big cities. The people who think teaching your child about creationism is so abhorrent and "backwards" as to be outrageous. These people will see Levi being homeschooled and instantly equate it with "weirdness" and some kind of a fringe ideology. What a shame it must be that Levi will never get to go to a public school, where his intelligence can be held in check until the stupidest kid in the class has had a chance to catch up, and where he can be properly indoctrinated with politically correct filth. And how about Rachel? Deep down inside them, the degenerate liberal scum know when they see a beautiful little girl like Rachel that she will never end up screwing around promiscuously in junior high, she won't enjoy her first "spliff" with some piece of subhuman ghetto garbage "boyfriend" who is ten years older than she, she won't have the gift of being "liberated" from a TWO-PARENT HOME (which liberal trash consider to be some form of slavery, since it goes against their every deviant streak) so she can run around like a little piece of trash all night long by the time she reaches her teens, and this is what really kills them. Another little girl sadly won't be taking lessons in whoredom from Britney Spears either, more's the pity.They are also terrified when they see Levi's mother pose the question, "What happened to my country," because they very well know what will happen if the people whose forefathers built this place wake up one day and put an end to all the degeneracy and filth all around them. Americans are supposed to believe their country belongs to every piece of disease-ridden, criminal-prone trash that wants to enter it, that they are "evil" if they insist on living in neighbourhoods composed of people who resemble them (unless you are not white, then you can live anywhere you like), that they are somehow twisted if they don't glorify homosexuals as cultural heroes or celebrated underdogs, and they are simply sick of it, especially now with this commie bastard in the White House.I think the people in this documentary are a bit...extreme, for lack of a better word. I sure as hell wouldn't send my kid to some camp to be "educated" and speak in tongues, but not so much because I think these people are "weird" or something. It's just because I don't really see the need to place such an emphasis on ORGANIZED religion in one's life. Going to church on Sundays is enough for me, or at least theoretically would be, since I don't do even that.This documentary was interesting enough. Nothing these people do is any worse than what Muslims do with their children, or what any religion or society does with its children: they teach them what they themselves believe. Big whoop. Get over it and stop acting shocked, appalled and "saddened," you leftist morons.</fullReview>

This lady preacher is shoving it and the kids don't know what they are being exposed too or have the true understanding of Christianity. I believe God gave us common sense and some of the things I have seen in this movie grossly goes beyond common sense in a not so good way. I pray those children get a more true understanding of Christianity than what that lady on the movie is shoving down their throats. In away I believe it is child abuse the way they are doing those children. The lady preacher on that movie is no better than those Islamic extremists that Carry ak47 machine guns or that blow themselves up in the name of ala. To me that is a very dangerous way of teaching and it could get very uncomfortable up in front of the pearly gates explaining ones self to God. Don't get me wrong Christianity is the only true religion in the world. However it is not the right way to teach it. So please who ever reads this pray for those kids that were exposed to that extreme teaching in Jesus Camp.</fullReview>

There's one salon I won't be going to.I went to Christian camp as a kid, but it was nothing like this. MY version of Christianity taught peace, love, joy and gratitude, not fear, sin, hate and elitism.This does help me understand how some adults are how they are (btw: Becky's comment on air about how kids are what they are by 9 is complete and utter bull.) Additionally, her comment about how democracy will fall in upon itself because everyone is given an equal vote reminds me of, oh, I don't know...The Crusades? The Holocaust? something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first rented this film, I thought "Cool, I can have some laughs while watching these overzealous religious nuts." However, this is a very even handed documentary about an Evangelical movement sweeping the nation and how these teachings begin at such a young age in these Evangelical families. I'm sure it gives some kind of solitude to those who are part of this movement or agree with it, and as someone who is against this type of thing it's a rather scary realization about the indoctrination of America's children into what is almost an army ,mentality, with these young people waiting to be in a sense, mobilized.

		<fullReview>I myself am somewhat religious, and I thought renting this film might be fun. It was, but in a much different way than I thought it would be.Plot: Becky Fischer is a Christian pastor who supposedly preaches Christian faith in a highly serious way. The people she decides to preach to are children. She tells her regular church members that she will be opening a summer camp. Many of the children show up at the camp very happy, without knowing their moods will soon change. Becky quickly begins to talk about how the devil destroys people lives, and generates tears in many of the helpless children's eyes. She also crosses the line when she calls them names like, "phony" and tells them their favorite film character (Harry Potter), will be executed. The 8-10 year kids are also talked to about controversial topics like homosexuality and abortion. Other radical practices, (even Ted Haggard of all people) are shown throughout the film.I was surprised that the children were fine with all of this and many of them expressed their personal opinions about religion. Examples: Levi: Wants to become and pastor and has a somewhat Autistic-like fascination with religion and Tori: Listens to Christian metal-core and as a Christian, does not believe in Britney Spears lyrical content. I was also surprised that Becky Fishcer, was not questioned by any of the children's parents and was clearly doing harm and putting false information in their growing minds. Just because she hates kids is no reason to tell the children that God hates them also! However, I'm not saying I hated this, I liked hearing everyone's personal opinion. This film is not for the faint hearted and if you don't like to see children in peril, you should not see this. I don't either, but the facts and knowledge of some of these people impressed and surprised me. I also liked hearing Mike Pap, he is clearly a smart man who knows what he's talking about. His interview with Becky at the end of the movie is spine-chilling and compelling. Religious or Non-Religious you need to see this! It is a great documentary with some good horror/thriller moments that help spice up the movie!</fullReview>

You witness children being brainwashed on a massive scale at this camp. A camp that preaches the wrong kind of Christianity.That said, I have minor problems with the film was made. They shortened film clips for the movie. But they also used those shortened clips and added their own dramatic music to give it a creepy feel.

This film can be disturbing, funny, or inspiring, but ultimately it is an intimate look into the lives of parents and children from a culture which many of us will only ever meet as street preachers, if at all.

Why are these adults not doing what is necessary in their own lives to make change now. More importantly, why are they placing their faith in the world that the bible told Christians to separate themselves from anyway? All this group of people is doing is setting others on the defensive, and making a mockery of what Jesus stood for such as love, compassion, empathy, and Forgiveness. If Jesus the perfect man came to this earth and was still rejected what makes these people or children or whatever more powerful than him? The focus should be on what is better than this world because as far as I am concerned this world is a terrible place to live in and if there is a heaven that is where I want to be not here not trying to preserve this place. Trent Reznor is coming out with an album called year zero and it's an album about the end of the world. Everything around us coming to a climax. Whether its the loss of faith in our government here in America or its the fear of nukes being dropped or gas prices or losing our money or global warming (which is having an effect on us, you don't have to be a person of faith to know that polluting our air is having terrible effects on our Eco system) or whatever.

		<fullReview>All that Evangelical propaganda will never have the power to infiltrate an reasonably intelligent mind. They know that - that's why they start with the young and impressionable.Putting aside the obvious, I was particularly fascinated by the observation that ALL the adults in the film are either fat or ugly or both, particularly the wiry camp counselor whose evil perverted look could have freaked out Jesus himself! Becky Fischer is evidently an unattractive obese woman living a miserable existence of flipping channels in her house alone. It is no surprise that she channels her anger into hate-filled sermons to the lambs of the defenseless.She claims that she LOVES America and the American lifestyle, yet in the same time she hates this country where evil non-Jesus-believers run amok so much that she wishes to get out of it. She believes that GOD bestowed men with the gift of free will, yet she thinks the others(less non-Christian evangelicals) should be terminated because they're using the freedom to "destroy" the world created by "GOD".It begs the question, if "GOD" gives his children the freedom to destroy the world, would it be logical to say that GOD has every intention to have this world destroyed? Then declaring war against men of other faiths would be the same as declaring war on GOD. If Gluttony is a sin, shouldn't Becky Fischer be on a diet for a while? Child pedophiles prey on the young and innocent sexually and physically, Becky Fischer and her likes molest them psychologically, mentally, and spiritually.There's always more than what meets the eye. The fundamental driving force for this well-oiled Christian Evangelic and all religions in the world is everything - greed, power, sex, perversion, stupidity - but spiritual. The finest example would be her "heavenly" co-star Ted Haggard and his secret affairs with drugs and GAY male prostitutes. If there's one thing I believe in "GOD", it has to be its sense of humor and irony. Anyone who can't figure this out may indeed in dire need of a lot of saving.Why can't "GOD" make his earthly army of righteousness more attractive, happier, or at least honest? Oh wait! Maybe Jesus is coming back after all, only in the form extra fat and ugliness? Just look around, the evidence is all in "God's chosen nation and people"! A word to the kid who thinks there's always something "wrong" with non-Christians, it's called ATTRACTIVENESS and COMMON SENSE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many of us adults who are well aware of the crazy fundies out there won't be shocked at this, but the disturbing factor is still not lost.I tried to run a scout group a few years ago, and one of the mothers wouldn't allow her son to partake in a pumpkin carving activity one year. The poor kid was so sad, and I printed out fall decor as a compromise, and the child could then do that, but not the faces (where is the logic in that? there isn't any) At another time, the kids were over and we were letting them play video games for a bit, and of course, when someone asked for the harry potter game, the fundy kid said he wasn't allowed to play it. i asked, sarcastically, if murder death and killing was OK, because i had army games. to which he said yes, that was fine. like most other evangelicals, this family was lost in their zealousness and lost sight of what was important. and that is the happiness and welfare of our children.Unlike what one of the deluded posters above said....it isn't fear that we feel when we watch this film. At least, it isn't fear for ourselves. It is for the lost children that have no choice of who to listen to except these ridiculous adults in their lives.Watching these children abused and mentally drained and their sweet minds twisted is one and one power only....Satan.Even Satan can use scripture to suit his needs, and evangelicals know this well....as evidenced by Jesus Camp and Beckie Fisher. Unlike them, it doesn't make me happy to know that their kind has a special place in hell. I just find it ironic that use that same accusation and threats to sweep innocent children to their side.i am an hour into the movie, and it is being turned off, this isn't worth finishing. i have seen enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this film was very fair in its treatment of its subjects - Pentecostal Christians, and in particular, Pentecostal Christian children. At no point during the documentary do the film's makers step in to editorialize. Instead, they just train their camera on their subjects and let them do the talking. Of course, you can also watch the DVD of the film with the commentary track on. However, even then the makers are talking more about why they included certain scenes and why they had to cut others than of their opinion about what is going on.In spite of the title, most of the film is not spent documenting what goes on at camp. It does focus on the activities and beliefs of just a few main subjects - two Pentecostal children Rachel and Levi, and also the woman who runs the Christian summer camp, Becky Fischer. It shows scenes of worship services, interaction among the children at camp, what goes on in their homes, and the children taking part in such typical activities as bowling. Prior to seeing this film I had heard some people say that the children were being coerced into witnessing and preaching, but I found that not to be the case. In particular the two children that the film focused on - Levi and Rachel - seemed to have an enthusiasm for their faith that was independent of whether an adult was around. Of course, taking the opposite viewpoint, children are always eager to please, and since these children have been immersed in this particular culture from birth, it is probably only natural they would have the world view that they do. The parents and Christian counselors involved also seem very sincere in their beliefs. You get the feeling that they are not trying to manipulate the children, they just want to save them from what they perceive to be an evil sinful world and get them involved in "the good fight" from an early age. What stood out as particularly alarming to me is that none of these Christian counselors, parents, or speakers ever seem to quote a Bible verse or encourage the children to learn the Bible itself, and that the adults seem to admire the kind of fanaticism that is present in the Middle East and think it is worth emulating that kind of indoctrination in their own children.The only person in this film that has a real Ick Factor is Ted Haggard. He winds up on screen because Levi is visiting Haggard's megachurch in Colorado Springs, obviously pre-controversy. Haggard is constantly making sarcastic comments to the camera person who is filming this movie, and you get the feeling he would throw the whole camera crew out in a second if he thought he could get away with it, politically speaking. What comes across as particularly slimy is when Levi goes up to meet Haggard and Haggard is giving Levi advice on how to play his "cute kid angle" to his advantage in his preaching. You can see from Levi's facial expression that he is not expecting this guy to be the disingenuous politician he turns out to be, but he is just too polite of a kid to be anything but respectful.This film is about Pentecostal Christians, not evangelical Christians in general. Evangelical Christian groups such as the Southern Baptists have a much more conventional form of worship than is displayed in this documentary. However, as the commentary track points out, most evangelical Christians, both Pentecostal and non-Pentecostal, do have most of the other viewpoints held in the film - most notably the intertwining of political and religious beliefs, the feeling that the United States was founded as a Christian nation, that it is both their religious and patriotic duty to bring America back to that standpoint, and that the children are the future of this fight. This gives a partial explanation as to why evangelical Christians continue to be a reliable voting bloc for people who are systematically at odds with their own best interests. For the ordinary and very genuine people portrayed in this film, their own earthly futures are unimportant, for they are constantly looking heavenward. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the politicians they vote into office and the deep corporate pockets to which these politicians are really in servitude.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear and Fearing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Jesus Camp several years after the fact. I was leery of it since certain of my friends were a little too enthusiastic about it. It wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. As a Christian I was mostly aware of this sort of thing. Sadly there has been too great a divorce from rationality amongst the religious folk of our times.These poor charismatics thought somehow that letting these folk make a documentary might be a good witness. It wasn't. They didn't realize that all you need to do to make queasy liberal folk truly nervous is show them what goes on in some, too many, of our churches. It's clear though that once again the Christians presented here are clearly imitating what they perceive as Islam, at least the radical factions of it. It is part of the post-911 American outlook which shows no signs of disappearing anytime soon.The filmmakers act fair, but their eerie music score leaks through quite a bit of the film and gives away their game. For them this is a warning shot and wake up call to the other America. They let one Christian DJ who rightly opposes this sort of thing speak as a measure of balance. But really it was through their feigned neutrality and lack of narrator that they speak with their own voice. A narrator might have required a bit of context. How did such a style of Christianity come to exist? Does it represent the the whole? The implication of the intertitles providing statistics lead one invariably to that conclusion.In a way the film provides a hyper-politicized context which is part of the the post-911 world just as much as right wing paranoia. Both the film itself and its subject are laden with unspoken fear. But context and research would have provided a deeper picture. It's a shame that most documentaries being made these days have to micro-focus, thus omitting any sense of history.An unexplored subtext for instance might have focused upon the relationship of this sort of pseudo-Christian approach with ways in which this approach to faith is most likely built upon the branded nature of our commercial culture. In other words these people are a natural result of the shopping malls and television screens of America... just as the filmmakers are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. I want to say now that these people were not evangelicals.The point of this film is to show that Christianity is no longer a belief, it's a mind capture that may make you a robot. Becky Fischer doesn't even follow the Bible. Not one time in this whole film does she look at the Bible. Its sick to see how she forced kids into all the devil worship. Yes. I'm an evangelical, and I know that this is not EVER how evangelicals act. Its hard to believe that a women would force money out of these parents and force them to go to some lame job camp where they teach them how to threaten. No you go up to a guy and ask for some time. Watch Way of the Master, to show real footage of how Evangelicalism should work. Evangelicals aren't creepy, the creepy ones r the ones who take their religion for granted.

		<shortDescription>Hands-off approach keeps the message of "Jesus Camp" objective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a subject as delicate, personal and even as controversial as religion, the wisest choice "Jesus Camp" filmmakers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady make is to keep their voice and presence out of the film and let their subjects tell the story. Documentaries are always better with some kind of guiding force and a hint to the film's intention, but as much as that's missing from this film, it's probably for the best."Jesus Camp" is one of those rare films that will likely resonate in positive ways for viewers with opposite viewpoints on the spectrum. We tend to think of documentaries as "exposing" truths or fighting for or against something, so the initial thought -- especially from those with a liberal mindset -- is "Jesus Camp" is intended to do just that. But consider the other side and the film could just as easily offer tangible proof for the powerful impact of evangelist teachings.The subject of the film is primarily a children's pentecostal minister in Missouri named Becky Fischer who runs a summer camp retreat for families in North Dakota with an emphasis on Christian faith and values. We meet a few of the children and parents who will be in attendance and interestingly enough, this camp is mere reinforcement for these people. They already seem to have strong Christian conviction, even at age five for some of them, so this is not a film about converting those of little faith.Ewing and Grady put subtitled facts on the screen, but other than editing, that's all the say they want in the documentary. We simply observe as these impassioned adults preach and these children -- often times reduced to tears -- become transformed to a degree most will never have seen before. Fischer draws a parallel to how Muslim children are trained at a young age to believe certain things about Islam (and how to use weapons, but that's another matter) and she wants to do the same thing but with Christianity and "good" principles. This idea will terrify those who defend separation of church and state and make perfect sense to those who believe they must be intertwined to make the world a place free of sin."Jesus Camp" poses the ultimate question about the capacity of children and how we teach them. These kids believe their generation has a greater responsibility than any before it to bring the light of God and Jesus into this nation and the world. The words of ministers such as Fischer strike them deep within, in some ways (in my opinion) terrifying them to the point of wanting to make a difference. Is this a paragon for forming outstanding moral behavior or is it taking advantage of children who know nothing else? Ewing and Grady merely want us to be aware of how many children receive this message in our country because of how large the Evangelist movement is. Regardless of whether its good or bad, Americans need to understand this perspective because it constitutes a significant portion of the country's religious/cultural landscape and one that has a fierce influence on the political sector.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you didn't get a chill out of this, I will stop watching horror movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most terrifying horror documentaries that I've seen in the recent past. Leave aside your exorcists, grudges &amp; halloweens. I've seen Gin gwai 2 a couple of days ago &amp; as far as horror is considered, Jesus Camp actually beats it. If this documentary doesn't send even a single chill through your brain, I promise I will stop seeing any horror movies in the future. A couple of quotes from the documentary.Becky Fischer: It's no wonder, with that kind of intense training and discipline, that those young people are ready to kill themselves for the cause of Islam. I wanna see young people who are as committed to the cause of Jesus Christ as the young people are to the cause of Islam. I wanna see them as radically laying down their lives for the Gospel as they are over in Pakistan and Israel and Palestine and all those different places, you know, because we have... excuse me, but we have the truth!(If I erase "The Book" from your mind Becky, Where/What is the truth that you are talking about?) Becky Fischer: I can go into a playground of kids that don't know anything about Christianity, lead them to the Lord in a matter of, just no time at all. They are so usable in Christianity.(Usable! Since when did Kids became some junk stationary.)Jesus Camp directed by Rachel Grady &amp; Heidi Ewing is a critically acclaimed documentary film which received an Oscar nomination but lost the award to Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth.In a nut shell the documentary is about a radical summer camp for Evangelical Christian kids run by Becky Fischer who is a Pentecostal children's minister. While showing the various activities being carried out at the camp, the documentary mainly concentrates on three children 13-year old Levi, 9-year old Rachel &amp; 10-year old Tory. It also gives the views (which are very fundamental) of Becky &amp; shows how children are systematically brainwashed into submission to god.A few minutes into the documentary, I saw my 1st shocking image which is of a 5 year old kid crying while praying. What kind of an intense brainwashing should make a child do that? When Becky was watching the tape and said the following words about the crying/praying child "She is not in a trance. She is well aware of what is going on. She is just hooking up with the spirit", I really wanted to cut Becky's tongue. I mean, Come on! What does a 5 year kid know about spirit? What does she know about sin or deliverance? My foot. You actually have to see the documentary to know how the above mentioned 3 kids talk &amp; think. Their views &amp; thoughts are unbelievable for a person of that age. Another disgusting image is the distribution of small plastic pieces of unborn fetuses to children. You can see how far they are going in order to destroy the minds of kids. In the righteous government scene, I dearly hoped for one of the kids to use the given hammer &amp; broke the head of that idiot instead of a cup. If you are thinking that I have something against Christianity, you are wrong because I follow no religion &amp; more importantly I think every person on the planet is related to every other (including me) albeit by a distance.One more reason the documentary was so shocking for me is that while watching it I couldn't stop thinking about the simple yet systematic brainwashing of kids that happens in every home of every religion of every country. Is only radical brainwashing dangerous? I think indoctrination of any kind is harmful because no matter how much you shout that your particular belief system teaches "love everybody", at the end of the day it only acts as another layer of separatism among people.See my other short note regarding the same subject. - http://amarsmoviejournal.blogspot.com/2010/04/no-title-for-this- post.htmlAfter the release of Jesus Camp, that summer camp was closed. But you really have to think above a single summer camp because this is not the question of a summer camp. This is the question of corruption of a young mind which happens in most of the homes.I have another thing to say. People, WE are in a right time of human history where we can see what is true &amp; what is false. In 1800 a.d there is not much against religion to disbelieve. If I was born then, I would have been a strong believer. In 2200 a.d, there will be nothing going for religion &amp; very few will be believers. But 2010 is at the centre, with the choice in your wise hands or should I say wise brains.This would be a sample conversation in 2200 a.d Person ABC: I always had this doubt. Person XYZ: What doubt is it ABC? Person ABC: I can understand that people of 1800 or before are strongly religious because they didn't know much about say evolution, astronomy or germ theory. But how can most of the people of early 21st century, with all the knowledge at their disposal, couldn't take a proper decision? What were they afraid of? Person XYZ: Oh ya, I too am having the same doubt.On a finishing note, If someone's sentiments are hurt by this or my previous post, I'm absolutely unapologetic. Once again Please don't brainwash your kids. They are your responsibility not property. If you are unable to come out of your blind beliefs, it's fine but at least spare the kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling and lingeringly disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Disclaimer: I do talk, very generally, about the end of this film, but I don't give anything specific away.)I think this is a mostly well-crafted documentary, which does a marvelous job of not over-accentuating the overall injustice of the harm done to these children and merely letting the lens (and the facts) do the talking. The filmmakers focus on primarily three children in the "Kids on Fire" bible camp, which gives the audience a chance to really perceive the toll that their religious instruction has taken on their individual lives. One of the children, Levi, is a somewhat shy though well-spoken kid, but he seems to be something of an outsider. He is home schooled and, though bright, is exposed to a very limited set of beliefs, which exclude for instance the theory of evolution. (At one point he is being delighted by a propaganda film which is blatantly scoffing at the possibility of evolution.) It is palpably shown that the feelings of resentment and disassociation towards the non-Evangelical community have been hammered into these children for some time, and it's easy to recognize how this affects the kids socially. One of the children, a little girl, is more than once seen verging on the point of being insulting to strangers due to her learned misconceptions. Though her intentions are innocent, she is completely awkward in her inability to comprehend what she is trying to preach and why, and at one point is congratulated by her father for "being so obedient," (presumably to the Lord, though the undertones were darker.) This same girl talks about being called weird by other children, and it brings up the unspoken point that this girl is most likely rejected by everyone else but the Evangelical community because she's been so boxed in, and therefore has nowhere else to turn and devote herself; which is probably the same for a lot of these kids, and their consequential suffering is evident in their frequent emotional purging during worship.So, it's easy to relate to this film on a basic human level, but the larger message, which chastises the non-Evangelical community for allowing this Christian sect to garner so much political influence, is less fleshed out. I believe this message is extremely relevant, but perhaps could have been made to work with the story of the children more harmoniously, rather than being peppered lightly throughout by the device of a radio talk show host. The segments with the radio talk show host to counterpoint pastor Becky Fischer's religious diatribes did feel somewhat disconnected from the film, but the eventual confrontation between the DJ and pastor Fischer was just unresolved enough to leave the viewer feeling disconcerted, well after the film's fabulously punctual and poignant ending; so perhaps there was a method to that madness.Another area that was left, for the most part, unexplored was the matter of Becky Fischer's personal life. Though perhaps somewhat irrelevant to the overall message, it still would have provided some sorely missed insight into why this woman has dedicated herself to using such misguided tactics to proselytize people and push the Evangelical agenda. Several times throughout the doc she makes a point to recognize how much of her life she's "given up" because she believes so much in preaching. Makes one wonder if perhaps there isn't much of a life to give up ? there's no mention of her having any children or husband to speak of and, from what the viewer is shown, religion dominates her entire way of life.I must end by saying that, whatever this movie lacks in confluence of ideas, it makes up for in its grippingness and evocative visual story, and is definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't that well done of a documentary. I thought the editing was poorly done. It seems like a camera was just dropped in the room. The onair personality was unnecessary.It still needs to be seen just to see those actual words coming out of an actual person's mouth. It needs to be seen by people who think insane religious fanatics building an army and indoctrinating people doesn't happen in the US.I really did think it was a stereotype of the crazy Christians and that there were just a few nutcase out there - but I was startled to learn there are a lot of them out there!This movie scared me! It angered me deeply! I pitied the poor children being indoctrinated in ignorance and blind faith. I was embarrassed and saddened to watch children not allowed to learn science (evolution, global warming, etc.) I've taken a class on Cults and "thought control"/indoctrination and these groups definitely used a lot of those techniques.People like this give organized religion a bad name! The good thing about this film is that it energized me to fight back against their anti-government, anti-science, anti-gay, anti-choice stances and attempts to infiltrate the govt and tell me how to live my life. If they're spoiling for a fight and creating "gods army", I think we have no choice but to stand up to them.After seeing this movie I made a donation to Americans United for Sep. of Church &amp; State and I'm thinking of upping my next donation to Planned Parenthood and any other group that "fights" these "warriors of God".Update: I wrote this review before reading anyone else's I see I'm not the only one disturbed by the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poignant, unforgettable look at pentecostal Christians in the making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just sat through most of a replay with comments of "Jesus Camp", it's late and I really ought to be asleep, but this is such a beautiful film I had to know more about how it was made. I found out that so many of the puzzlingly intimate shots of people struggling to awaken and give shape to their faith were just as depicted. It wasn't that the camera people were so extraordinarily skillful, it was that their subjects were far too preoccupied with their emotions to even notice them. The results are a filmmakers dream. The only big name evangelical they managed to include in the film was none other than Ted Haggard whose comments on homosexuals is really something to see given the scandals he was involved with shortly after this film was made (apparently). He stands out like a sore thumb against the backdrop of real believers like Becky Fischer.The kids they follow in this film are miraculously motivated and charismatic. Given their large roles, I would like to know more about the film's fall out from their perspective. It's sad to hear that the camp has closed down indefinitely. Except for Haggard, not one of the film's subjects means to do anyone harm, excepting perhaps the devil and a few Muslims. I'm quite sure this has been a sad and disturbing consequence for the directors, Grady and Ewing. In my opinion, they are clearly not to blame. Their film is an unblinking, penetrating look into this world, but it's completely non-judgmental as anyone who listens to a few minutes of their commentary will see.In that commentary, the directors sing the praises of the film editor and the musical score, and they couldn't be more right. I loved this film and it's depressing to see how low a rating it has here. I'm afraid that does not speak well of those rating films like this and I'm becoming increasingly leery of their scores.</fullReview>

Their little hearts were filled with the fighting spirit, yes and some hatred too. Jesus said "I am the Way". He did not say "Hate and kill". Remember his command, difficult though it might be..."Love your enemies!"I am so glad that the Jesus Camp has been closed down indefinitely. That is great news.

		<shortDescription>Objective Documentary or Not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They're taking their kids to camps like we're taking our kids to Bible camps, and they're putting hand grenades in their hands," says Becky Fischer in the 2007 documentary Jesus Camp by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady. A documentary is generally understood to be a work (like a film or television program) presenting political, social, or historical subject matter in a factual and informative way, often consisting of actual news films or interviews sometimes accompanied by narration. A documentary should present facts objectively without editorializing or including fictional material. This is a high and difficult goal for any visual presentation. Content such as the above quote from Jesus Camp unfortunately derails this film from its ultimate purpose. Jesus Camp tries to document a Christian movement in an objective way, but it fails to remain unbiased, and ends up casting mainstream Christianity in a negative light. Jesus Camp presents itself as a documentary about a Christian summer camp for children, where they learn how to make a difference in their country as Christians. Becky Fischer, the children's minister who runs the camp, strongly believes that children can and should be instrumental in bringing the country back to traditional, conservative values. The film follows the experiences of three kids before, during, and after they attend Jesus Camp. The camp sessions discuss hot political topics with the kids, such as prayer for the president, the need for righteous judges, and the issue of abortion. The children's reactions to the topics were dramatic: some cried, some rocked while praying, and one little girl was filmed shouting, "No more! No more!" The film tries to display these emotions in a non-editorialized way, but the emotions of the children still carry over to the audience. In addition, Jesus Camp avoids personal commentary from the directors about the events by not using a narrator during the film. And it does use the opposing voice of a radio talk-show host, to present a balancing viewpoint. The film apparently interviews its subjects, to provide information about their beliefs, in their own words. It investigates political, social, and religious topics in a factual and informative way. However, any film which motivates a director to produce it, carries a message, and keeping a message unbiased is extremely difficult. The main area where this documentary fails to avoid bias is in the emotional effect that it leaves. The photography throughout the movie shows empty roads, snowy fields, cloudy skies, seemingly uninhabited homes, which all leave a feeling of despair. While the film typically incorporates music that is part of the unfolding events, the directors seem to have chosen the most disturbing, tense, or strange music available. This gives the audience a gut-reaction similar to watching a suspense or horror movie. One of the best examples of how the directors are evoking an emotional reaction is the "car wash" scene, where Becky Fischer is listening to the radio ? a political and religious broadcast ? while driving through a car wash. The red lighting filtering through the car windows makes the water drops look like blood. There are references all through the movie to "warfare," "God's army" and "martyrs" without any explanation from the people interviewed about what they mean. Combined with images like the car wash, the audience tends to conclude that the fighting and dying is physical and violent, not spiritual and peaceful. Jesus Camp and Benny Hinn Ministry are identical in giving the wrong impression about Evangelical Christians. The directors of Jesus Camp give statistics -- as well as Benny Hinn Ministry-- about "Pentecostals" and "Evangelical Christians," lumping them together for the viewers, when they are not the same thing. As the movie unfolds, the audience watches the worship style of a Pentecostal Christian group, and draws the conclusion that most Evangelical Christians worship, behave, and believe the same way. Because of this presented misconception, general Evangelical Christians will conclude that the directors do not understand their subject matter. Such a conclusion could be fatal to a documentary, especially if it genuinely attempts to be circumspect and avoid alienating certain audiences. With all its efforts to be an honest documentary, Jesus Camp falls short. The photography, music, and commentary either guide the audience to inaccurate conclusions in accordance with the directors' biases, or indicate that the directors are giving subliminal commentary on a topic they do not understand. The overall effect of Jesus Camp, evoked mainly by the methods used to make the film, is an emotional tension, gnawing, sadness, or anger directed at the child-brainwashers: the Evangelical Christians. In 2006, Becky Fischer had to postpone Jesus Camp indefinitely, due to vandalism at the campground facilities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It makes you think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is a film that contains a very controversial subject. One should watch it with an open mind.I have three points to present here. First, this documentary is definitely interesting. It shows you the belief of some people in our generation. It shows us their goal and how if affects the way they live their lives. Are they doing something harmful or something good to society? A question we should think about after watching. Very interesting.Second, I like the way the narrator is sort of neutral in their view, BUT they should stop talking while they are interviewing these people. This is super irritating! I would have given this film a 9 if they let me hear the kids talk without interrupting.Third, I want to give my opinion about the subject of the film, about these Evangelical Christians. From my point of view, I think they are good people. I won't judge them as crazy or brainwashed, although I don't agree with all of the things they believe. I think it's bad to teach children that global warming is not real. And I don't agree that Harry Potter is a work of Evil and that homosexuality equals damnation. I don't think it's good to judge that there are only two types of people in the world; those who know Jesus and those who don't. It's like looking at the world in black and white. God doesn't create the world like that. He made it in colors.However, I am not saying that these people are ruining our society. Let's look at it this way. Are these kids going to grow up and become drug dealers or porn addicts or serial killers? No. They will grow up to be good people, I'm quite certain. They're far away from violence in the media and so many, many things that can turn kids into criminals today. I look into their eyes and I saw passion and dream and hope. These are children who believe they could make a different and make this world a better place, which is a good thing to start with, right? Well, as long as it doesn't go too extreme, I must say. What these people give to them is not exactly poison if these children grow up and learn how to balance what they were taught by the adults and what life teaches them, if they keep their strong faith, but learn how to express that faith in a different way, instead of judging others. They will do fine in life if they can do that. But if they can't, they'll be so lost. They might live their lives against God without realizing it, like those suicide warriors in Iraq.In my opinion, it's fine that Christian going around and tell others about Jesus, if they just want to share good news or just tell others about what works for them. I've seen people lives changed in good way after they've found faith in Jesus. Mine is one. BUT I hope that the evangelists won't try to make the whole world be like them. I hope that they give others space to choose for themselves. I hope that they won't go to war and kill Muslims and say that they do it for Jesus. As long as they don't go too far like that, I'm not against them. Actually, many of my friends are evangelists and they're really good people.Please go see this film. This one gives you a lot of things to think about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the Christianity of the Bible?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, unfortunately, another in a long like of pushes by the liberal evangelical community. I know that may be surprising, but these groups of charismaniacs are not biblically based believers. George W. Bush is not a biblical based believer. This is a movement spawned by Christian Identity, Replacement Theology and fanatical charismania. It has its origins deeply rooted in the Word-Faith Movement of Copeland, Hagin and the millions who have been led astray by these false doctrines and heresies. I sat down to watch this movie, both as an Evangelical and a Christian. I am evangelical because others say I am: I believe that we must be saved by Jesus Christ and share that with the world. I am Christian because the bible called the first believers in Antioch Christians. These were followers of the Messiah or what was known in Greek as Christos. I walked away from this movie looking deeply into my own life and the lives of my wife and children. I wanted to make sure we were not doing this to our children. These kids are being force fed this drivel about America's glorious beginnings and how we, as believers, have a duty to transform America. It's a shame.</fullReview>

Then he would just check up on Jesus every now and then.Oh, plus i'd have a little girl that would just cry every time anyone spoke of Jesus. she'd dance on her own free time, but not like those "dirty dancers." she'd grow up to be a prostitute most likely.That's what i'd do if i were Satan. errr.....wait a second. ooops, i guess they already made a documentary about him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not religious in the least bit, however I am very open-minded; I don't see anything wrong in someone being religious or having faith in God. This however, I do not agree with nor do I understand. Jesus Camp not only petrified me, but it made me laugh. I don't see anything wrong in having faith in something like God, or any other higher power, but this is just ridiculous. The people shown in Jesus Camp not only have faith in God, but they go way beyond martyrdom. This is really sick. These children are bilked into wasting their lives and into thinking that they are going to hell if they don't pray to God every second of their lives. I feel bad for the kids. I really do. The Evangelical adults are not teaching their children love, they are advocating hate and war. These kids aren't being taught to be open-minded, they are being taught that everything besides Evangelical Christianity is satanic and sinful. This is the most disturbing movie I have ever seen, and I believe it is the most raw, touching, and insanely poignant documentary out there. To see those kids like that is just really upsetting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kinda boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite disappointed in this film, though I'm a fan of documentaries. Maybe because I had already heard about the movie and expected it to be more shocking or upsetting than it was (reading on this site I discovered that the filmmakers were trying to be "objective" though I thought the result was rather bloodless). I found much of the information in the film to be old hat and not very revealing. It's not like it's any great secret that evangelicals are homeschooling their kids and that they reject Darwin and that they align themselves with conservative politics. Maybe I'm more informed than most. Bottom line, I felt sorry for those kids because they're already so frozen in their perspective, despite being awfully young. It's a shame they aren't allowed to have a broader understanding of the world. And I wanted to laugh when Becky Fischer said "God hears the cries of children." Hah! Tell that to the kids in the slums of Buenos Aires or Calcutta. Or for that matter, I wonder what Elizabeth Smart thinks of that assertion. Whatever. The film just added to my cynicism, especially the appearance of Ted Haggard, one of many, many high profile religious hypocrites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting But Needed More Focus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I missed seeing Jesus Camp in the theaters, so I was looking forward to it when it came out on DVD. For people who have not yet seen it, there's a benefit to watching it on the small screen, since it allows for deleted scenes. Of even more benefit is being able to rewind and watch selected scenes over again, to make sure you're hearing things right. There's a lot of rewinding in Jesus Camp. It's that kind of movie.The documentary follows a few kids as they go from their homes in Missouri to a bible camp in North Dakota called Kids On Fire. The camp is run by Becky Fischer, a likable, albeit a bit nutsy, middle-aged woman hell bent (pun intended) on molding future Christian leaders. The kids themselves are also awfully likable, if not down right adorable. We follow these kids, Levi, Rachael, and Tory, as they participate in, a hip hop gospel dance routine "Kickin' It For Christ," a prayer vigil involving a cardboard cut out of President Bush, a smashing of cups symbolizing the oppressive U.S. government, and a very unusual pro-life lecture, amongst other activities.By following the kids through Kids On Fire, the viewer gets an awfully good education of the main tenets of the evangelical movement in the United States. For people unacquainted with it, Jesus Camp will be eye opening. I was already familiar with much of the ideas and concepts in the film, but still found it fascinating. However, although there are interviews with the three kids, their parents and Becky, I felt that Jesus Camp needed more background on the main players. As a counter point, the filmmakers chose to include Mike Papantino, a radio host decrying the evangelical movement. Later, in the film, we get to hear a phone call between Becky and the host. Interesting, but not very helpful. So, some people reject much of what Pastor Becky and others are trying to do. It didn't inform the film much, and wasn't given enough depth, in my mind, to really make any insightful statement. I think most people not associated with the evangelical movement will already draw their own conclusions, and evangelicals already involved aren't going to be persuaded much by the briefs cut-aways to Mr. Papantino. I would have preferred more time with the kids and the camp.We also travel with the kids to Colorado Springs and the New Life Church, run by the currently disgraced, Ted Haggard. Because of the gay escort and drugs scandal, I can't say whether or not I was expecting Ted Haggard to come across as bizarre as he did. But, boy oh boy, does he seem flat out weird. In the brief clips we see of Haggard, he seems a little drugged out with his behavior. Haggard's attempts to joke by speaking directly into the camera, in both the final cut and deleted scene, are quite odd. His further discussion with Levi about being a child minister also comes out as cynical and uninspired. I've watched a fair amount of evangelists in my time Dr. Gene Scott, the Bakkers, and even Ernest Angley, but Haggard competes with the best of them in terms of out right creepiness. And, compared with Haggard, Pastor Becky and her group seem almost normal. I stress, almost.The film closes out with a field trip to Washington, D.C. and a prayer vigil at the Supreme Court. It's not clear to me whether or not these side trips are actually part of the Kids On Fire bible camp, and, as interesting as they are, these side trips detract from the main story of the camp and the kids. Again, I think Jesus Camp would be better served focusing more on what motivates these children to pursue Christianity in the way they do or what prompts Pastor Becky to be as involved as she is with these kids. The information is there, at times, I just wanted more background. By viewing the deleted scenes, I get a better understanding, but can't help but wonder why so much of these scenes were left out of the final cut. Jesus Camp is a really fascinating documentary, but an even better one was left on the cutting room floor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW! What can I say about this amazing documentary? I just finished the film literally minutes ago and I LOVED it. Not to say I agree with it 100% but it is very, very well made documentary. I can't see why everyone is saying that this is a bad thing? Why is being a Christian such a bad thing? I found this film very moving that there are children on fire for Jesus. I was touch by there actions. I want to say a few things about some things I have been reading about the film. People have been getting all over it because of the Harry Potter comment. I could not agree more with you when you say that was stupid. So what if there are wizards and things like that. Look at Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia; they have similar things in them but there are write by Christians. The Harry Potter films are good and I feel there is nothing wrong with them as a Christian. Many, many people have been going on and on about the Bush cut out. I think it was stupid to touch it and things like that, but I feel that we should pray for our president no matter who he is or what party he is from. He is our leader?PERIOD. I will admit that Bush has made mistakes; he is not perfect, but neither is Gore, Kerry or any other man/women you would put up there. We are all imperfect and therefore should not critique every little mistake. I have a few complains of my own. 1.) why is the overly obese lady speaking about fasting in the opening of the film? She looked like she had eaten a few to many hamburgers herself. The funniest thing was when she said that America is fat and lazy. Have you looked at yourself? I agree with what she was saying, but coming from her it just did not fit. 2.) I have a big problem with the Radio guy. He was a complete tool. He was claiming to be a Christian and yet clearly did not hold many of the values. He wants to talk about how Jesus is love, Jesus is a peaceful man, Jesus does not judge. He is all those things but he is also a man who stands up for what he believes, he is a man who knows right from wrong. My point is that even a lost soul knows that Jesus is love, Jesus is a peaceful man, Jesus does not judge; what about the other things he stood for? I feel that people us this card way too much and I feel that people mix judgment with agreement. If I do not agree with you, that does not mean I am judging you. If that was the case one could argue that for almost anything, and soon we would be a society that accepts everything and there would no accountability. 3.) I have a problem with the child speaking in tongues. I don't know where I stand on this issue as a Christian. I don't think it is wrong to speak in tongues, as I don't think it is wrong not too. I have never been called to speak in tongues so I know I am not supposed to. It is just hard to think that children are called to speak in something that most adults don't understand. (Just to answer any question here: I don't think this applies to all aspects of being a Christian. I believe that children can be called by God, Levi from the film for example). For me this film has inspired me that there is hope for the future. Children are the future and to see children on fire for God was moving. I loved Levi and I felt that everything that child say hit home and was 100% correct. I loved this film for the same reason I loved Brokeback Mountain, both films just show you something without picking a side. You as the viewer can make up your own mind. There is no one there telling you want to think. 9/10 Give Jesus Camp the Oscar for Best DocumentaryIndia is the most religious nation in the world and Sweden is the least religious nation in the world.

		<shortDescription>Brainwashed? Think Again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this picture last weekend, and thought it was a very insightful and straightforward look at a part of America that people on the Coasts don't think really exists. I was surprised, however, to read comments on this and other sites claiming that the children in this film were being "brainwashed" - perhaps this is true, but I have news for you...If your children watch commercial cartoons on Saturday mornings and absorb all those ads for sugary cereals, they're being brainwashed. If they spend hours staring at MTV, they're being brainwashed. Kids in this country are being brainwashed anyway, they're just being brainwashed to accept our consumer culture as the only route to happiness. And I say this as a "liberal" non-believer in the Jesus-Camp theology.Having said that, I think it will be very interesting to see what happens to these kids in a few years - it will be necessary to keep them isolated from others their own age (which the home-schooling does). This is necessary if only to keep the kids from questioning why a loving God would want to eternally torture their friends of other faiths. However, it will be very interesting to see what happens to them (particularly the gifted preacher-in-training Levi).One young child (about nine or ten years old), a blond boy, was actually brave enough to openly question the Bible in a "confession" moment. I liked that kid, and I hope he is able to continue to think clearly despite all the pressures on him.In conclusion, this is a good documentary, and come Oscar time, may be the "March of the Penguins" of this season - I hope so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Political Scare Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film documents the unsettling experiences of very small group of Pentecostal children. If it were presented merely as such a documentary, I would have no problem with it. Unhappily, the makers of this film try to use the lives of this small group to paint a picture of all of the Christians (75% of Americans), particularly those they would classify as evangelical or conservative.Watching this film, one is led to believe that the vast majority of Christians "speak in tongues", ignore scripture for emotionalism, nearly worship George W. Bush, and despise all scientific research. Homeschooling seems to be particularly target to be pointed out as a danger by the filmmakers, who, following one mother's anti-evolution / anti-global warming comments, flash a statistic claiming that 75% of homeschooled children are Evangelical Christians. I don't know whether this statistic is true, but I do know that a 2002 U.S. Census bureau study found that only 33 percent of parents who homeschool cited religion as their primary motivation. Also, according to research data, fewer than 10% of homeschooled children are from Pentecostal or even Charismatic homes.In making a weapon designed for the "culture war", the filmmakers use selected scenes in the lives of children in contact with one female "youth pastor" to try to convince viewers that Christians are scary people, are all blindly and rabidly Republican, and shouldn't be allowed to raise their children according to their beliefs or to participate in politics. This is akin to making a documentary about the life and death of Nicole Brown Simpson and claiming that women should never marry football players, because football players are obviously scary homicidal maniacs.In general film quality, the sound is good, but the cinematography suffers from poor focus. Scenes shift in and out of focus for no obvious reason, as if they were using consumer level digicams set on auto-focus. There were also some unhappy choices in shooting angle, but overall it's not too bad. The editing, cutting between scenes of the experiences of these few children and the ravings of a talk-radio commentator, seems to me to be made for brainwashing -- which is ironically the very thing the filmmakers are accusing the participants in this film of.If you are a political liberal with a dislike for Christians, you'll enjoy this film. If you're anyone else (other than perhaps a member of the particular small group presented), you'll be disturbed, both by what is documented and by how it is presented by the filmmakers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pointless documentary - info we already knew</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've previously complained about two recent documentaries, 'Who Killed the Electric Car' and 'This Film is Not Yet Rated', that were too lop-sided in advocating one argument. However, 'Jesus Camp' was a little too middle of the road to have a point or to be entertaining.The movie's overall theme is about how evangelical Christians indoctrinate their children through insane youth groups. It takes an almost patronizing approach as if all viewers know nothing about white American suburban/rural culture or the religious right. As someone who grew-up going to conservative Christian summer camps and dabbled in Pentecostal Christianity, I can't say I learned anything new from the film. It basically confirmed my worst fears and stereotypes of mid-west, rural/suburban conservative Christians.Over half of the movie focuses on an obese Pentecostal youth minister, Becky Fischer, and her relatively small summer camp ministry in North Dakota (there appeared to be less than 100 kids in the summer camp wide shots). Fischer's sermon, personality, and beliefs are interesting and entertaining, but the filmmakers don't really explain who she is, how she got into this business, or even basic biographical information such as whether she is married with kids. Instead, without explanation or transition, the movie leaves Fischer and follows a young camper, Levi, to a Colorado Springs mega-church and then to Washington, D.C., at a pro-life vigil in front of the US Supreme Court during the Samuel Alito confirmation.I suppose what really irked me was how anonymous the filmmakers were. Instead of actively narrating the film, the filmmakers chose to have a radio talk show host from an Air America affiliate break-in with dire commentary about the religious right's indoctrination programs. Also, they tried to maintain the unbelievable premise that their film crew's presence did not have an effect on the subjects. This premise was broken in Colorado Springs when a prominent mega-church pastor spoke directly into the documentary's camera and addressed what he seemed to know would be a non-believing, skeptical, Left-leaning audience.I was mainly disappointed that the filmmakers didn't bring new information. For example, who are these people who base their careers on indoctrinating kids? (The youth group leaders featured seemed to be interesting characters). Also, what is the REAL result of these youth camps? Do most kids actually follow-through in high school and after? Statistics tend to show Christian youth are not noticeably different than non-Christian youth -- at least in sexual abstinence. An interesting sequel to this documentary would be a five or ten year follow-up like the 8-up series to see whether the youth camp really affected these children's lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a hard movie for me to rate for several reasons. The production was very well done. Great sound, good camera work and appropriate music. However, it was difficult for me to watch children being subjected to severe religious indoctrination at first, then my sadness turned to boredom. The filmmakers capture scenes that are powerful then choose to drag those scenes on and on until they loose their meaning.While it was an interesting documentary nothing really happened worth mentioning. I think if the filmmakers would have cut 30 minutes out of the documentary not much would have been missed and it would have been more powerful.Moreover, I think if the filmmakers would have followed the subjects 10 years down the road to see what they turned into they would have been able to make their subtle point much more effectively.If it's late and you have nothing to watch then give it a shot. Other then that I don't recommend going out of your way to rent this.I give it 6 out of 10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi OK so I just finished watching this movie, and it was absolutely fantastic. You know, when I think about the camp that I would want to send my kids to, I just get so excited when I picture them crying and screaming, and learning to become martyrs in the name of Jesus Christ! No literally, this movie was terrifying. There is a time when people say "army of god", and they just mean people who defend of love god. But in this movie, the "army of god" are children aged aged 4-13, crying and practically having mental breakdowns because of their "love" of god. From most of what I know about the Christian faith, it is about loving god, loving others, and forgiving people. These "camp leaders" are condemning people, teaching kids to discriminate against people, and telling them that if "they don't (insert some generic radical Christian belief), they will burn in hell". But you know what, I've actually learned a lot from this movie. I never knew that Harry Potter was basically best friends with Satan, and that if he was in the Old Testament, he would've been put to death. It's good to know, because the next time I show a five year old any HP movies, I will take into consideration that they might learn leadership, friendship skills, or that they might just have a good time. Also, I've learned that God doesn't like quiet churches, in fact, he won't even visit those churches. God likes churches that condemns any other sexuality other than heterosexuality, and churches that really care about the critical situation of America. "One Nation under God". This was a very important part of Jesus Camp. The fact that church and government still remain separate, is a very distressing issue indeed. What really helped me understand the political situation of America was when the camp leader brought out a cardboard cutout of George Bush, and they had a ceremony where she spoke for him, and the kids answered. There is not one right thing in that entire situation. First of all, she spoke behind the cutout, which meant she said whatever she wanted to say to manipulate the kids. Then, she led the kids in a touching prayer, to all of America. The kids then proceeded to shout and plead on their knees with god, asking him to help Bush. This is not like the halfhearted "oh, please help". This is the on the floor, tears gushing from their eyes, red faced screaming and crying, as if they had just seen their dog get run over. Yeah, so this movie really educated me that it's not just Muslims that are radical and extremists. I don't know whether the camp leader saying : Oh yeah, Muslims have been training kids from a young age to kill themselves for God, and we want an army of children just as strong, and just as devoted as them? or, the kid that was talking about his dad's missionaries and how just before he left to a dangerous place, everyone would gather around and yell "martyr, martyr!", was more horrifying. Can I also mention that this kid proceeded to say that he thought it was cool that they yelled that, and that he would not mind laying his life down for the same cause (also, this kid is 13). So yeah.To be fair, this movie does not at all represent Christianity as a whole. The same way that ISIS doesn't represent Islam at all. This movie just focuses on one side of Christianity, and I guess kind of opens your eyes up because people think that Islam is the only religion with people who don't properly represent the religion. I definitely saw a dark side, but I think it's just sad that these kids grow up in these environments. Because if they know nothing else, how can they even begin to question what they're being taught. All I'm saying is that I believe in non violence, and I don't think this was appropriate at all to teach to kids. I'm not trying to offend anyone, you can have your thoughts, and I can have mine. I also think that these kids should have a chance to have their own thoughts, so I highly disagree with this method of education.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thanks you Rachel Grady and Heidi Ewing, I can only imagine the true grit it must have taken to be around those people filming as long as you did. This film shows a very dangerous subculture of people that have the potential to exert their extremists Christian beliefs on the American political system, or should I say, more so then they already do. Paradoxically, these Evangelical Christians are neither Christians nor Americans. True Americans believe in democracy. If these extremist got more political power, they would be intolerant of people who didn't share they're religious zeal. True Christians do not seek to exert control over other people. True Christians understand that all religions are not a matter of different faiths, but simply different tactics used to teach peace and compassion to others. Religion can be a real conversation stopper, especially when such zealots are as closed-minded as many attending these camps. And what these Evangelicals don't seem to comprehend is that it is only open dialogue that has maintained American democracy since the birth of this nation. When religion is blended with politics, we no longer live in a democracy. What Evangelical Christianity boils down to is a politically oriented fascist organization.If these evangelical Christian gain more political power, It would mark the end of the two-tear system. They are incapable and unwilling to compromise; these people would use their faith as a scapegoat for political immunity. Many do not believe in global warming, and in many case placing George W. Bush at the forefront of their religious movement. It makes me really scared. We should all be horrified after watching this. Ignorance kills people. If this shocks you, I hope you remember to vote in 2008. We may not get a second chance.Also, to Grady and Ewing, I wish you guys luck at the Oscars this year.

		<fullReview>Ever since Sunday school, I've regarded modern Christianity as innocuous if boring. At its best it inspires a few extra people to volunteer at the homeless shelter, at its worst, its a bureaucratic waste of time and money. If evangelical minister Becky Fischer has anything to say about it, this kind of soft-core, innocuous Christianity is on its way out.Jesus Camp explores the ministry of Fischer, who administers and teaches an evangelical summer camp for children. Fischer is a charismatic person that wishes to, in her own words, indoctrinate children with the one true religion. Moreover, she wants to indoctrinate the children with a philosophy of action and war, to cleanse the "sick world" of its maladies. To this end, she uses devices similar to self-actualization workshops/cults, -- dramatically calling the wicked children within the camp to be cleansed with water and renounce their secular lifestyles -- praises the piety of Islamic suicide bombers, brings children to the (now defunct) Ted Haggerty ministry, and invites in guests to speak about political topics like "right-to-life." Jesus Camp is sure to galvanize viewers. Secular and religiously moderate viewers will have a difficult time maintaining the opinion that the growing Evangelical movement is just another innocuous branch of Christianity. Those within the movement will find it to be honest and will likely embrace Fischer's philosophy of education.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found the topic boring and the presentation a bit heavy.This is a camp for like-minded members of a pretty conservative group of Christians.It reminds me in many ways of my experiences at Catholic retreats when in high school, where we learned how the Chinese Communists tortured the Catholic missionaries, and how Our Lady of Lourdes cured millions of paraplegics. As an impressionable teen I might have believed that stuff for about twenty minutes, and then moved on. As I type this on my Chinese made computer, I chuckle. Somehow, I am supposed to believe that the Chinese miraculously recovered from their bad habits of missionary killing to become the great friends, and personal bankers, of the US.In other words, chill. Kids that are dumb enough to believe this stuff turn into adults that believe this stuff, with or without the benefit of Jesus Camp. I mean, look around you. Guys like Michael Wiener Savage go from hippie herbalists to Atilla clones all the time. It works the other way too.Unless you start the indoctrination at about the third trimester of pregnancy, most of it wears off. Kids who aren't allowed to eat candy become sugar addicts. Catholics and Orthodox Jews, indoctrinated against sex from the age of 3, sustain the growth of the porn industry. Recent studies show that anti-smoking ads promote smoking among teens, and that kids who participate in DARE programs are more likely to abuse drugs.Maybe there's even a bright side to Jesus Camp. If they keep busy trying to brainwash their own kids, they might not have enough time to try to brainwash mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vicious hit piece on Christianity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed during a period when George Bush was nominating a justice for the Supreme Court to replace the retiring Sandra Day O'Conner, Jesus Camp is a hit piece on Christianity disguised as a neutral documentary about a minister who runs a summer camp for young Evangelicals and their families with the premise that they are being brainwashed into acting as foot soldiers for the Republican party. While the end result may be that it shows an almost fanatical worship for George Bush the film makes no attempt whatsoever to determine if this support is based on politics or the fact that one party is at this time more closely aligned with the moral beliefs of the participants than the other party. It also takes us until the ending credits to find out that the commentator works for the most extreme left-wing, Bush bashing radio network in American media. It's like watching a train wreck in progress, and even though you know the train is going to crash it's such a fascinating, beautifully filmed wreck that you can't stop watching it. Propaganda films were made with the purpose of inciting the audience to hate the antagonists and as propaganda this film is a masterpiece, so in that respect it earns a high rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the comments and reviews I've read regarding Jesus Camp, there seem to be an awful lot of folks that check under their bed at night for evangelicals. The producers seem to have gathered the support of individuals that parrot the divisiveness of those dangerous, perverted Christians. The same religion that gave them countless, inalienable rights, including the right to make the following remarks about the movie Jesus Camp: "?for people who worry about religion encroaching into the political arena." Claudia Puig, USA Today"Every scene is loaded enough to infuriate some and rouse others." ? Jeffrey M. Anderson, Oakland Tribune"Alarming? " Anita Katz, San Francisco Examiner "?WILL LEAVE SOME VIEWERS 'SHAKING IN THEIR BOOTS'?" "?a scary and sobering inside look." ? Ann Hornaday, Washington Post"?FRIGHTENING,?" David Edelstein, New York Magazine"?it may be the scariest movie you'll see all year." ? Ken Fox, TV Guide "One of 2006"s most frightening films." ? Jennifer Merin, New York Press "?more frightening than the entirety of 'Village of the Damned'". ? Jan Stuart, Newsday "?innocence perverted." ? Nick Schager, Slant Magazine After the foregoing, I'm wondering what our media has come to. This style of alarmist commentary conjures up a draconian scene of a dark night on a dusty street in the 1930s, in the deep south. An angry mob is storming down the street, torches blazing, rope in hand, garnering all the support they can, in order to justify hanging an African American whose only crime was accidentally making eye contact with a white woman while performing a courteous act for the lady. Sound a bit extreme? Not really.Are these commentaries from journalists genuinely ignorant of their subject matter, or do they have some kind of an agenda? Do they care about framing their subject matter truthfully, or will publishing it preclude them from a raise, a promotion, or possibly their job? (I can't be far off on that one.) Truth is really simple: if you aim a camera at the ground, walk around filming dirt, grass and rocks, then after :82 minutes come away with the epic title "Secrets Of The Earth Revealed", do you think that people of sound, rational, minds are going to be impressed? So it is with the same camera, the same producers, in one "evangelical" church on the North American continent, calling their film an accurate representation of evangelical America.Here's my very realistic challenge to all readers: Do you really want to know the truth about evangelicals? If you prefer to join the rank and file media, OK. But if your answer is yes, visit 3 different evangelical churches, beginning this Sunday (Saturday for 7th Day Adventists). Talk to people after the service, ask questions. Then decide if you want others doing your thinking for you. Finding the truth is that simple.And the beat goes on? "An admirably even-handed film." - Washington City Paper "It offers a clear-eyed view of a religion that might seem on the fringes but in fact claims huge, ever-growing numbers.'" ? Cheryl Eddy, San Francisco Bay Guardian "REMARKABLY UNBIASED." Ken Fox,TV Guide "The filmmakers'grace and fairness coupled with the power of their material might?" - Kevin Canfield, Gannett Newspapers</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Documentary of an evangelical youth camp in North Dakota.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to come right out and say it: "Jesus Camp" is a lazy documentary sensationalizing the stranger aspects of the way evangelicals express their faith.The "eyebrow-raising" content mentioned in other reviews can only be described as such by those who grew up with no connection to a deeply-religious community... but if you did, then you'll just nod your head and say "Yep, it's weird, but that's the way they worship." The documentary is filmed during a small and brief bible camp at Devil's Lake, North Dakota led by the super creepy pastor Becky Fischer. You get an intimate glimpse of the rituals, preaching, and forms of worship that evangelicals teach to their children. You hear the children speak of their rather intense faith in their own words, and see them preach and approach strangers in attempts to convert them.It may disturb some that these children are taught that abortion is wrong and evolution is false. However (this is directed to others who have written their reviews as though this film exposes some sort of wrong-doing), keep in mind, in America, we have a little thing called Freedom of Religion.The truly disturbing part of the film comes when children are encouraged to more or less worship a life-size cutout of George W Bush. This brings a little color to the occasional allegations in the media that evangelism is becoming increasingly nationalistic.This film would have been interesting if it had couched this bible camp as a microcosm of a larger national trend of nationalistic Christianity. The filmmakers tried half-heartedly to do this with opening and closing radio snippets about Alito joining the Supreme Court, but they failed to truly make the connection, possibly because they were avoiding the work and research that would have been necessary. Instead, it comes off as patronizing urban liberals sensationalizing a rural and suburban conservative religion that they just don't understand. I wanted to hate the evangelicals in the film, but instead I just saw them exercising their rights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary but fairly biased anti-religion documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watchable documentary painting a fairly interesting but slightly biased picture of a minority of fundamentalist Christians teaching children to grow up hating the non-Christian community at American summer camp style facilities. Not particularly cerebral or witty but lots of out of context quoting from random people to support the point the makers wanted to get across.As an atheist it didn't really interest me that much, re-confirming some of my opinions about religious zealots and bringing up the old argument of freedom of speech &amp; religion vs protecting the rights of others. There's nothing particularly new here, pointing out that Christianity (like all religions) can be used by some as a platform to express themselves publicly where they would normally not do so. In this case the trainee Christian zealots are children but this is apparently acceptable behaviour as it's in the USA constitution.I could go on about the arguments of the documentary but it would turn into a rant. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie does Not represent the Christians of America. This is a sectarian branch that is intimately tied into conservative politics and "evilising" everything and everyone in sight that doesn't agree with them, which is not very Jesus-like at all. I am a devout follower of Christ and I must say that I can in no way identify or support what is going on here. I believe the most appropriate thing to do is call Child Protective Services and shut this thing down and save these children from any further emotional abuse. Let us take a moment to consider Jesus and the manner he treated children. Jesus put children on his knee and reminded the zealous and ever-serious adults in his presence that the "little ones" understood his Father's kingdom better than they did. What we see here is modern day Phariseeism and should not be condoned at any level because it is brainwashing at the highest of levels. What an utter shame...</fullReview>

Wait until these kids get into high school and college and start interacting with kids from all different religions and see how they react then. It is a shame that someones parents would actually subject their child to something like this!! One part of the movie when the kid with the pony tail said that he feels weird and scared when he is not around other children that are like him.

I wonder what is going to happen to these children when they become teenagers and the hormones start kicking in. Then the rebellion starts to come in as well and no one can fight biology.

I first heard about this movie on Youtube.I figured it wouldn't be bad,but it was.I only had to see clips on Youtube to be the judge,but also having the misfortune to watch it.I got so upset that I couldn't stand still when I seen it.I hate child abuse,but this is child abuse taken to a whole new level.The kids at this bible camp in Devil's Lake North Dakota go through a lot of disturbing things.Being brainwashing and psychological abuse.There are also handful of points of idol worshiping and racism.I was completely stunned and shocked by how utterly disgusting a human being can be and how someone could mentally abuse a kid.I was a christain growing up,and I went to church as much as possibly,and likewise with Sunday School.But never had any of the pastors or church leaders abused us in this way.Becky Fischer is a child pastor that is followed most.She and the parents of the kids brainwash these kids into believing a lot of BS.Harry potter being the devil,and that science doesn't prove anything,and evolution is the work of the devil,and it's okay to hate other people of other religions.The main kids that are followed are Levi(12),Tory(10) and Rachel(9).And there are more kids,and one kid is crying almost every time he is seen in the documentary.There are so many different things in here that upset me.One,being that Levi's MOM brainwashes him.Here is a quote from here"What if you went to a school where they said creationism is stupid,and you are stupid if you believe in it.Or what if you went to a school where they said evolution is stupid,and you're stupid if you believe in it." Yeah,she is quite the model parent.Okay,you know I'm done talking about this movie.I'm already upset by this movie enough as it is,so I don't want to lose my temper.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abounding with paranoia and insensitively!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is both a film about a fringe Pentecostal group that uses a lot of strange indoctrination-style tactics to spread the word. While some of what they do seems very harmless, at other times their actions are a bit disturbing--seemingly brainwashing little kids.There is a serious logical flaw in "Jesus Camp" that unfortunately destroys the central message, though those out there that see the evil "religious right" as America's #1 threat probably won't notice the flaw. Let me explain. The summer camp and those who run it represent a very extreme and small portion of Christians in America--very, very small indeed. Very few Christians, even on the right or far right, would advocate the wide-spread speaking in tongues and brain-washing style of teaching done at the featured camp (such as smashing of pottery as the kids scream about how terrible their enemies are). Just because this odd group has small children spouting catch phrases that they probably don't even understand does NOT mean that this is Christianity as a whole or even Evangelical churches as a whole. After all, not all Muslims send their kids to schools run by Hamas or the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades and you certainly wouldn't say that all Muslims are evil!! HOWEVER, and here is where the film makers are very disingenuous, the message is hammered home by far-left talk show radio host Mike Papantonio that this small group represents the entirety of Evangelicals AND that Evangelicals are somehow plotting to destroy America. This is roughly akin to Hitler saying that all of Germany's problems were the result of Jews or Homosexuals--overly simplistic and a great example of scapegoating.So, according to Papantonio's odd logic, only extremists are behind placing judges on the Supreme Court who are strict constructionists (i.e., will not see the Constitution as flexible but will interpret it as literally as possible). Also, only these "crazy Christians" believe that Global Warming isn't 100% true and that "these people" could care less about the planet (obviously Christians hate the Earth and want to destroy it)!! And, only the irrational right is behind President Bush. Talk about hyperbole. Neither the Supreme Court's composition nor Global Warming nor being a Republican are purely "Christian agenda" matters--many Atheists, Jews, Agnostics, liberal Christians, Muslims, etc. have the same political beliefs as this dreaded group from the "Jesus Camp" and the parallels are irrational.So, what you are essentially doing is trying to argue that Roe V. Wade was good and Global Warming is fact and Republicans are run by the farthest right-wing Christians proving this by showing one small group of bizarre Christians. By that same logic, I could argue that Atheists are all evil because Joseph Stalin (an avowed Atheist) was a mass murderer!! This logical is spurious and extremely illogical. Plus the popularity of politicians like John McCain in the primaries illustrate that the Republican party is not the "Pentecostal Party".Now, IF the film makers had simply let those from the camp talk and discuss their religion and politics, then this might have been a great documentary. After all, very few people would imagine the pressure put on these poor kids by this camp--it was at times brain washing. Heck, how far off the deep end this group was at camp shocked me and was worth discussing. BUT, by combining Mike Papantonio's rants (as a hammer for the film makers) and a complete dismissal of ALL of the beliefs of this group, the film is no longer a true documentary but becomes very transparent propaganda.So, I give the makers of this film kudos for the idea of filming the camp but also am angry that they chose to make this film a bigoted political and not a sociological message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a portrait of the fundamentalist worldview</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A decent attempt at introducing non-fundamentalists to a lifestyle not familiar to many. One has to remember, before comparing this camp to Hitler youth, etc., that the Bible does form a basis for American culture, and that those who take it as God's word would indeed say with Paul the apostle, "Let God be true and every man a liar". It is very likely that the parents of the children in this movie genuinely do fear where this country is headed, just as liberals fear what would happen if such religious fundamentalists were in control. That is the beauty of our democracy: no extremist viewpoint can maintain control of our society (and I view those who react strongly to what is portrayed in this movie as extremists on the opposite pole). Depending upon one's point of view, what is seen as decline to reds is seen as progess to blues! Those who decry what is being taught to these kids as "brainwashing" would probably not be so quick to decry the incidence of sexual behavior at younger and younger ages in our culture, the role of Hollywood in fashioning values of youth and foisting them on the rest of the world, or the official denial that design may indeed be observable in the physical world. There is undoubtedly a culture clash, but without it, we would just be another Europe. It is deceitful to compare Christian fundamentalists in America with Moslem fundamentalists, simply because the Bible is not the Koran, and belief in the Bible has been foundational to the development of what is American culture. Furthermore, these children WILL have an opportunity to judge for themselves the validity of what they have been inculcated with as they grow older. Fear not. Let democracy do its work. This film can be helpful if it opens the way for healthy, reasoned discussion. If it is an indictment of a lifestyle, only time will tell which lifestyle that is--whether the one its subjects decry, or that which its subjects represent. Until then, hopefully our culture will be able to accommodate all perspectives!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pentecostal Fundamentalist does not equal Evangelical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an interesting movie but its message is fundamentally flawed. The filmmakers use scenes of a few very dedicated Pentecostal Fundamentalist families to leave the impression on the viewer that they have just seen a representative sample of the 80 million or so Americans who self identify as Evangelicals. Statistics about Evangelicals are occasionally flashed on screen as we watch the Pentecostal Fundametalists, in an apparent effort to equate the two groups.As an Evangelical, the movie opened my eyes to how many Americans may view us and our perceived political movement.There was a great deal of focus in the movie on "soldiers" and "warfare", while Jesus Camp was being portrayed on screen as a Christian equivalent of Islamic madrassas. To the non-Evangelical this can easily appear to be a scary thing. The huge difference is that these sort of camps (not just the one in the movie but what I have personally attended), don't feature AK-47's, hand grenades, or strap on suicide bombs. The children are being trained to engage in spiritual warfare, not physical warfare- and the movie fails to make that clear.Do they go too far with their indoctrination of the children? That is a legitimate question but I don't know that the film brings anything new to the table. Children become just as enthralled and emotional about a wide variety of things as these children are about Jesus. Regardless of their indoctrination, each will still have to make a personal choice on following Jesus when they get to an appropriate age- and none of the featured children seem to be mature enough to have made that decision yet.So the real question here to me is- should parents be allowed to subject their children to such indoctrination? If you believe in freedom, you've got to say yes. The indoctrination going on in the film may be different in content but it is not different in form from any number of competing ideologies that children are exposed to, and yes, indoctrinated into every day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It totally amazes me that at this day and age, we would have shed such outdated backwater, voodoo beliefs that make secular religion the way it is. It only proves we never learn from history. This film reminds me of several things. First, you have the parents that live their lives as the fanatical "soccer mom/dads" that are so absorbed in themselves and of living precariously through their own children without any regards on how allowing their own children learn to be individuals in their own way of thinking. Which by the way makes us unique as humans. Then there is the "My religion is better than yours" closed minded thinking. We've seen this before for thousands of years. The result? war, hate, destruction, corruption. All this thinking based on what is being touted as fact, when it really isn't fact at all. Thats why they call it theology (Greek for Study of Theory). But the film does show a good insight about the hateful, separatist mindset of just one fanatical religious sect.Christians may disagree with me, but look at it from this point of view. If this same movie was made using Muslim, Jewish, or any other secular religion, how would you emotionally accept it then? That's the way that a true independent thinker will look at this film.</fullReview>

Then the film proceeds to show how minors (even 5-7 years old kids) literally start having seizures, they start speaking like they are hallucinating that "Jesus is about to get inside me!" and personally I heavily misunderstood that and many other quotes that just are misleading into thinking about sexual subliminal messages in they're words.

		<shortDescription>How to Make a Movie That Misrepresents and Lies About Its Subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2006 movie "Jesus Camp" follows three children who attend the Kids on Fire camp in Devil's Lake, ND led by Becky Fischer, director of Kids in Ministry International. The movie producers claim to be objective in its presentation of Evangelical Christianity. That claim to objectivity is a pile of crap! Here's a sampling of deliberate content manipulation and editing designed to demonize the camp: 1. Music can affect the emotional content of what is caught on camera. If the filmmakers want you to be disturbed, you will hear creepy-sounding music. This happens when the kids are speaking in tongues near the beginning of the film. Be afraid. Be very afraid.2. There's Becky's cry "This means war!" Actually, we're not talking about a war between people and people, as the filmmakers would want you to believe. It is a war against demonic forces that happen to have human POWs. See Ephesians 6. We're not giving the kids hand grenades, AK-47s, bomb-belts, or RPG launchers. That is never explained in the film, and if an explanation was given, it was edited out.3. No, those kids ARE NOT PRAYING TO PRESIDENT BUSH! They are praying FOR him. The cardboard cut-out was provided to facilitate a Pentecostal practice of laying hands on the person that they're praying for.4. Tracy O'Brien, Levi's mother, addresses the camera and we hear her say, "There are two kinds of people in the world, those who love Jesus and those who don't." What you don't hear is the other half of the statement that the editors cut out: "And both are worthy of dignity and respect by virtue of the fact that Jesus died for them." 5. The O'Briens listen to a kitchen radio, but the editors superimposed audio that was not actually playing on the radio.6. The creation video that Levi and Luke are watching was brought in by the film crew. The O'Briens did not own the video and had never seen it.Overall, Jesus Camp was a cleverly devised film designed to deceive the public into believing that Christians are just another form of terrorists. If the movie disturbs you, do yourself a huge favor and find out the facts before you lynch someone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mockery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As opposed to what mesaman22 said, I believe the creators of this film knew exactly what they were doing, and conveyed exactly the message they wanted to convey. The producers, so I understand, aren't Christians, and this Anti-Christian film makes that clear. An Evangelical Christian myself, I was quite discouraged and disturbed after seeing "Jesus Camp," but not for the same reasons most other commenters apparently are. You see, while there are sects of Evangelical Christianity that represent the extreme Conservatism observed in this film, this is not an accurate representation of all of us, and I am sorry to find that many Liberals see us misrepresented so. I believe it was the intent of the film-makers to present to the "unsuspecting public" an extreme side of Evangelical Christianity, and make it appear to represent the whole of us. Plus, the film-makers obviously had an agenda when they took quotes out of context and turned up the creepy music when something "Christian" (for lack of some all-encompassing adjective I'm looking for) was going on... They made Christians look like unintelligent fighters with a political agenda. That's not the Christianity Christ taught, and it's not the Christianity I - and many others - live out. This film was created as a mockery of the Christian faith, and was incredibly deceptive, misrepresenting me and the majority of Evangelical Christians in the world.I'd also like to point out the fact that if such a mocking film were made "documenting" the Muslim faith (which I would never support), the creators would be eaten up by the media and, likely, put on a hit-list. Why is the media, and the world, so unrelentingly contemptuous towards Christianity, yet wouldn't dare mess with other religious faiths? (I'm not sure if this comment contains a spoiler or not, so I'll play it safe and say it does.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Breeding a generation of fanatic Christian terrorists! No child should be subjected to those lies. Never being given a chance to make their own mind about god, Jesus or religion in general. When a child is saying he was saved at five years old that scares me to death, saved from what? all the sin he had accumulated up to that point? This movie is more frightening then the Omen.This is how I see young radical Muslim families teaching their children.I think this movie will have the opposite effect intended by the creatorsFear this movie and these people!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sick. Pretty much just sick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, lets create a religious filled government with more republicans who can't think straight. Good lord, this is possibly the sickest thing I've ever seen. First off, why would people thing this is a reasonable thing to do? In the preview it has the woman talking about "the tip of the ice berg". What next, world domination by a religion based on myth? I'm open to many religions, but you can't just close yourself in, build a hatred toward others, then hurt them. If people thing the idea of a "Jesus camp" is good, you obviously are a close minded American. Of course you may say "You've only seen the preview". The preview is enough to tell that this movie is complete bull. People. Be reasonable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sick to my stomach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello, I don't think this movie deserves a 1, frankly I only saw a couple of minutes of it. No, the 1 is given out of nausea from the content. For being made the way it was, I think it deserves a ten.I think summing up the first few minutes I saw, will get the idea across. What is shown is the brainwashing and the indoctrination of small children by their parents who bring these kids to religious cult gatherings which reminds one of the way things were done during the Naziregime. All that really was left out were the uniforms, banners and typical arm-movements. But maybe they were present at the bit where the actual jezuscamp was shown.I have nothing against religion, I have nothing against adult cults, but this...truly gut-wrenching, to use but a term.Im not easily shocked, truly I'm not. And me turning this off after only 15 minutes is saying a lot. I guess watching child abuse can make you feel that way.Beyond the shockiness, I don't believe this to be entertaining either. Educational value? sure.. If you liked this entertainment-wise, I would suggest Faces of Death as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Disgusting Repulsive Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie as well as other "Christian" movies to be the most repulsive movies to further push the ignorance of Christianity to the people of the world..........People need to stop blindly buying into the ignorant ideals of the Christian faith along with the other shall i say cult beliefs and look at the big picture. The world has already suffered irreparable damage from us and what we need to focus on is finding out what we will do when all resources are gone and we are completely screwed. Religious ignorants look at it as GODS WILL but its OUR FAULT."Think For Yourself" "Fear NO God"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ephesians 6v12"For our struggle is not agains't flesh and blood, but agains't the rulers, agains't the authorities, agains't the powers of this dark world and agains't the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms." This verse introduces the armour of God- the belt of truth, breastplate of righteousness, feet fitted with readiness of the gospel of peace, shield of faith, helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit- which is the word of God. Quite obvious the Christian army is not a literal fleshly army but fighting agains't evil- i.e. like the salvation army. If this film portrays otherwise, it is either because these leaders are not Christians, or because the director's intent is that of deception. America used to be Christian, but Christianity is loosing sway as well as being perverted - for accurate figures and Christian growth agains't population check http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html#religions Christian growth is below the national birth rate, whereas secular, Islam, Hindu and Buddhism have a growth rate of over 100% each! This film is pure propeganda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hypocrisy of American Media!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen all of the negative comments about this film - i.e. these kids are brainwashed and mental robots etc. etc. If this was a camp to turn kids into gays or lesbians NOOOOOOOONE would have a problem with it. Also if this was a Atheist camp or a WICCAN Camp then everything would be just fine and dandy. But because this institution promotes Christianity then this camp and its programs are automatically vilified.Kids are taught "Its OK to be Gay" in Public Schools but are told The Bible is evil and should be shunned. They let you read "Why Heather has two mommies" but if you try to read the Gospels then you are shown the door. Who are the narrow-minded robots then? It is not the Christians in this film but the hypocritical bigotry of the leftist media.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why are all these women fat?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plump women strutting around, handing out pamphlets ain't gonna work on the masses! Those hicks behind "Jesus Camp" ought to get some lessons in advertising. Lesson 1 below:If anyone is wanting to convert, I suggest they watch this short video clip: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqKhvthxvSo Hell I've converted 8 times already! I also didn't think much of the special effects. This movie had the WORST fake tears I've ever seen! A particularly alarming scene showed a young boy having a heart attack on the ground. I wasn't surprised though, because he'd been hanging with all them fatties for so long. The worst of it was, they all just stood there and watched, presumably too blotted to move!Fat Lady: THIS MEANS WAR!!!... mmm... donuts... ARE YOU A PART OF IT OR NOT? WHAT!?! Weren't you Christian just a second ago? What the hell does that mean anyway? What war? What enemies? These people who try to turn fantasy into reality should stick to their craft and not try to turn reality into fantasy.Seriously though, this film (moreover what it documents) is really terrible, taking advantage of the naivet of children and hammering a recruitment order to their heads with catchy songs and rhymes, even throwing in a sweet record deal with "christian rock". Pfft, yeah, I know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If we don't do more things like this movie, more Columbines will happen. They kicked God out of schools and look what happened, Satan moved in. Exactly... either you are for Jesus or you are against him. This movie is fantastic. It is the truth, can't wait for more like it. We should be training up our children to be honest, forthright, truthful, forgiving, loving and get serious about the state of the world. Ditch the violent bloody movies and video games and get REAL. Some comments mention, "brainwashing"...well I would rather my kids be brainwashed with good things than what they are seeing in the movies of the world and the video games of the world where they look down the barrel of a gun. Canada, America...take note of the increasing violence and death, murder, suicide, abortion and get on the right road before it is too late. Eventually you will know the truth....but if you are wrong about Jesus, it could cost you your life. How could it hurt to love Jesus, do right and if you are wrong in the end....no harm done....not so with the opposite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome, more should join. This should be TRUE!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is awesome to show young people praising God from their hearts, and not just because someone is pushing them into the church and making them do so, and when they get out of the church, they go back to doing the same wrong as they did prior to going to church.I think this teaches young people as well as adults how to praise Jesus Christ in heart and in truth. Being real with Christ, Praising, and Honoring His name. Given the sermon of how to act outside of the church as well as inside of the church. Wrong is wrong, no matter how we look at it, and if we can prevent our children encourage our children to do better, act better, and have a knowledge of serving Christ, well, I think the better it is.As far as TV is concerned, I think all, absolutely all of the stations are sinful. Not only cartoon network, but ABC, CBS, fox, etc... and especially the Disney channel that has the movies on just as children are coming home from school. Parents need to look at these shows, and know what their children are watching. They are absolutely sinful, and can change a child's mind to be lustful, as well as to violent thinking. So if Jesus Camp can change a child's mind to think of Jesus, why not??? What do parents want their children to think of??? Sex, boys, girls, kissing, shooting, stabbing, car theft....what??? Jesus Christ???Praying for the President of the USA is not terrible, it was just a model of his body there, they were not using him as an idle. I wish someone would have me up there one day to pray for me. Some churches use pictures to notify the congregation of those who need pray. Is that wrong also? Everyone needs prayer, especially someone going up against an evil world like this one that President Bush is going up against. I say myself God bless him.I think Jesus camp is a success, and more like this should come about. I wish I could do something of this sort. If this camp is not a Ghandi camp, well go for it!!! At least the children aren't drinking juice to kill themselves for someone. Just water poured over their hands as a sign of purification. They are raising their hands to praising the God almighty. Praise, and Bless God from whom all blessings flow!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! Yes, I am yelling! Jesus Camp is a great movie. It is starting to open people up to a dialogue about "religion" and this country like no other film has in recent years. The children are enjoyable, funny and totally devoted to what they are saying in this film. They are normal children who have found something to give their lives to. I have read some people saying they wish they had as much faith in something in their own personal lives. A movie that provokes that kind of thinking in people is worth the money and time. Go see it and judge for yourself.While not every Christian will agree with everything in this film, every Christian will find something in it that they do agree with. "Liberals" will get angry, and maybe even scared. They should--these kids will be a powerful force when they grow up, in deed, they are a powerful force now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Values Voters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know why this documentary was made, don't you!?!? It's part of the liberal left trying to figure out how in the world George W. Bush was elected a second term by the "Values Voters". They are trying to find out how the "Heartland of America" ticks, so they can plan their strategies for 2008. Haven't you notice all of the media's "special reports" on "Faith In America", etc? We crack up laughing every time a liberal journalist suddenly shows up out of nowhere wanting to do a report on Christians in the smallest little town you've never heard of! Just another assignment to find the key to attracting the religious right to their camp. It's not going to work. All it is going to do is backfire! Just wait and see! All I hope is that some of those sad souls actually end up finding The Way, The Truth and The Life while they're on assignment.Personally, I am glad that this documentary least publicized the camp. I had not heard of this particular one before, but I would love to take my family there for camp! So, that's why I gave it a 2.What makes me sick is that anyone would even THINK that they could compare this type of camp to a terrorist's camp for children. Do you see any grenades in the kids' hands??? No, you see a pamphlet, or a Bible. Do Christian kids have physical weapons? No, they have SPIRITUAL ones. That's like Rosie O'Dumbell equating Christians with Islamic extremists. Now if that is not twisted, I don't know what is.</fullReview>
