		<fullReview>Ever been curious about the American film rating system? Then Kirby Dick's This Film Is Not Yet Rated is perfect. It does to US censorship what Michael Moore has done to others: it makes everyone look like jackasses, mainly because that's what they really are.The film explains pretty early on, through South Park-style animation, what kind of rating a movie can get in the USA: G, PG, PG-13, R or NC-17. The last certificate is the most unpleasant one, as a film with that classification won't get a proper distribution. And it's that particular rating that Dick wants to dissect.This documentary is divided into three sections: the largest one sees various filmmakers (Kimberly Pierce, John Waters, Kevin Smith) revealing the problems they've experienced because of the American ratings board, the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America). The second section features the director's efforts to uncover the identities of the film raters. You see, the MPAA is supposedly composed of average American parents, doing a fair job. Then how come no one knows who these people are? As the investigation continues, we learn that one board member doesn't even have kids, while several others' offspring are already adults. So what's really going on?The last part of This Film Is Not Yet Rated focuses on Dick's own censorship trouble, a really interesting version of the movie-within-a-movie gimmick: he sent a rough cut of the documentary to the MPAA, receiving the dreaded NC-17 (since there's some footage coming from other NC-rated films), and so we get to see his frustration as he tries to appeal the controversial decision.The best part of the film is the first one I mentioned, mainly because we get to know the rules of the game a bit better. Apparently, any kind of "weird sex" is not welcome: oral sex (Boys Don't Cry), threesomes(The Dreamers, American Psycho), gay stuff (Mysterious Skin, Where The Truth Lies), female masturbation (Jersey Girl, a PG-13 movie, almost got an R just because Liv Tyler talks about it)... the list is quite long. Of course, you're better off if your film is endorsed by a major studio. That's why a glimpse of Maria Bello's pubic hair got independent film The Cooler an NC-17, while Sharon Stone doing much more in the audience-baiting Basic Instinct was "appropriate" enough to receive an R. No wonder most filmmakers hate the MPAA! Hell, we even find out that Trey Parker and Matt Stone deliberately put distasteful material in Team America just to make fun of the ratings board.Another "funny" thing is, the NC-17 is only used against sex. No one ever says anything about on-screen violence. In fact, any movie can have the highest body count ever, and be rated R. If there's no blood, it might even get a PG-13. As people point out, all other countries have the exact opposite attitude, condemning violence rather than sex (I know, from personal experience, that most films rated NC-17 in the US are usually classified "15" or "16" in Europe, while excessive violence tends to lead to an "18").As someone wisely says in this hilarious, poignant opus, ratings don't really matter. If it's a film a lot of people want to see, no rating in the world can damage it. If it's a film few people want to see, then no rating in the world will save it. That might be true (although I don't necessarily agree: the huge success of The Passion of the Christ was largely due to the rating controversies), but this movie also made me realize that I would definitely not want to be a member of the MPAA. Their criteria are too weird for normal people to understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe Not Rated, But Definitely Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film rating system in this country is governed by a secret panel created by the major film studios more than 35 years ago. Since its inception the MPAA ratings board has functioned as a sort of 'black box' where movies go in one end and a rating comes out the other, with absolutely no transparency or public accountability of the process.The MPAA rating system is publicly proclaimed to be merely a voluntary industry system that nobody is 'required' to follow. Unfortunately the reality of the movie industry is entirely divorced from these innocuous proclamations. The rating placed on a film largely determines who gets to see it in a theater, and what sort of publicity for the movie will be accepted by television and newspapers. An NC-17 basically guarantees that only the small sliver of the public with access to art house cinemas will ever sit down in a theater to watch the film, and that there will be virtually no way to promote the film to the public.So, in the real world, the MPAA ratings board wields considerable unchecked power over the film industry. Since the organization is funded and sustained by the major studios, that influence becomes particularly problematic when applied to independent productions. It would be not unlike a small, local merchant having to go to board set up by Wal-Mart and Target to get approval for what he can put out on his shelves.Kirby Dick approaches this subject with humor, insight, and tenacity. He undertakes to blow the lid off of the black box of the MPAA rating system. In the process he creates a narrative filled with both information and humor. While I will leave his methods as a surprise for the viewer, suffice it say they are both unconventional and effective.The interspersing of interviews with independent filmmakers who have been forced to do battle with the MPAA to get their movies seen, provides an excellent counterpoint to Dick's quest to expose the star chamber like proceedings of the rating board to the light of day. As well, his side-by-side comparisons of similar films, one receiving an R rating and the other an NC-17, is illustrative of the particular biases present on the ratings board.If you care deeply about he art of film, This Film Is Not Yet Rated is a must-see. On the other hand if you just want to learn a little something and have a good laugh, this is a good pick for you too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must See!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is informative, but also funny and clever and kind of mind-blowing. It's not for the faint of heart because it contains quite a bit of graphic footage to illustrate the point that the ratings board is totally arbitrary (in fact, one former board member says there is absolutely no training or standards -- you come in on your first day and start to rate movies). That may seem not to matter, but it matters quite a bit to the film makers whose films are being rated and several appear in the film and make very strong arguments for why the rating their film received was unfair. There are also interviews with several other people (like a free speech lawyer) who add context to Kirby Dick's expose. This really is a must see for anyone who cares about movies and it's a lot of damn fun too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>perhaps not the 'best', but surely my favorite documentary of the year thus far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kirby Dick is a filmmaker I wasn't aware of before This Film is Noy Yet Rated, but now he is assuredly on my radar, if only for the determination in pulling off his main idea. Like Super Size Me, this documentary has a near-gimmick to it; Dick hires a private investigator in order to track down the anonymous "parents" who decide why a movie will be rated R over PG-13, and NC-17 instead of R. This even leads- more intriguingly- into the more deceptive group of appellant board members of the MPAA. So on the one hand the filmmaker has this extremely entertaining, guerrilla-style aspect to his film, with a hand-held camera in one moment in a fast-food place that draws attention to him, and detectives who will go to any length to get results. On the other hand he gets great interviews and clips and history about the film industry in the US and the near fascist style of the MPAA in relation to the several (corporite) studios.As a film buff this film already had my interest long before I saw it. For too long the topic of film ratings have both infuriated and fascinated me. Much of what ends up going on with filmmakers's battles with the MPAA to get their R (and indeed the difference between millions of dollars in grosses) instead of an NC-17 is staggering. That Kirby Dick get such insight out of the insiders (two of which former MPAA people, and two who kept anonymous), filmmakers, business people, and other types within the industry, is a good help to add to the basic argument that there is some inherent problems with the current ratings system in the country. This is accentuated in comparisons between NC-17 and R rated sex scenes from other movies, and clips from films that received the NC-17- or close to it- and the inanities and problems filmmakers have to get their whole vision against people who, of course, are not that creative. There are issues of gay sex in movies, how violence is vs. sex in allowance in ratings, and in the end how big business (and religion) are behind the scenes if not pulling strings then giving complete influence.All of this as a documentary ends up being pulled fantastically off, as it does at the core what a documentary mostly should- stir up conversation about the topic(s), and at the same time still being entertained to an extent. And Kirby Dick even has a slight Michael Moore tinge to him as he goes full-on after his subjects; one of which reminded me of Moore's own confrontation with Charleton Heston, as Dick puts himself in split screen with animated caricatures of his callers. But Dick also is smart enough to put such subject matter with good doses of humor. I loved the little animated explanation as to what each rating means (including dead orphan and Almodovar jokes), and as he revealed with a near relish the full facts on every member (most shockingly the appellate members). Even if you just have a casual interest in movies it should be worth your while, and especially if you're a parent- and try not to let the NC-17 rating deter you as it's in part just in spite of the mirror put up to the ratings board itself- it's especially prudent to see. It's got both tongue-in-cheek and dead-serious aspirations, and all the while making Jack Valenti look worse and worse. It's biased, to be sure, but for the right reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violence Wins Over Sex Every Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever wonder who the people are who decide the ratings of films? You know the G, PG, PG-13, R and NC-17? I'd personally not thought that much about it simply because I could care less what a film is rated. If it looks good, regardless of its MPAA rating, I'll see it. Not to mention the dichotomy between the American rating style versus European countries.Ever notice how phobic Americans are when it comes to sex and nudity on screen? We can put a bullet through a hundred heads but show a little pubic hair and you'll get slapped with an NC-17. Why is that? Why are we so afraid to show our kids and the general population a little skin, but we're ready and willing to let them see brain matter? In Europe, the exact opposite is true (they put the higher ratings on violence), and this is brought to the forefront in Kirby Dick's excellent documentary, THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED.What Kirby did was infiltrate the MPAA system by finding out who was on this incredibly secretive board so that those who make films ? and have them rated by these people ? know who stands in judgement of their cinematic work.Mr. Dick (love his last name by the way) dissects the MPAA system and discovers so many problems as to boggle the mind. There apparently is no tried and true way to rate a film. It pretty much depends on the MPAA raters and how they "feel" it. If they happen to be in a bad mood that day, you're screwed.The F-word is likely to get you an R rating unless you use it just once. A gay love scene will most likely get you an NC-17 but a "normal" man/woman sex scene (of the exact same type) will get you an R. Homophobia in Hollywood appears to be alive and well.The most disturbing element is that violence is condoned over sex. What message does this send our society? That violence is more natural than physical attraction? {shiver!} A James Bond film has never been given an R rating (all of them have been lower), but Bond has killed more people than almost any movie character. They get away with this by not showing the blood that results from gunshot wounds. How convenient. But films like BOYS DON'T CRY get slapped with an NC-17 rating because of their sexual content (never is a bullet let fly in Boys Don't Cry).When Kirby Dick puts up these side-by-side comparisons on screen, it's smackingly obvious how biased the MPAA board is toward human sexuality but very accepting of violence.Kirby hires a private detective to help him reveal who the MPAA raters are and to dispel the myth that these are infallible people. On the contrary, they are extremely fallible.My advice: don't go and see a flick based on its MPAA rating. Go see it because it interests you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast paced, sometimes zany slam of the MPAA's de facto movie censorship program</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fast paced, absorbing, at times comical exposé of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) film rating system. While it is in name a "voluntary" system, i.e., a filmmaker can choose whether to submit a film to MPAA for rating purposes, in fact the theater chains that promise wide exposure and revenues for a film they screen will rarely touch a movie that is unrated or that receives the most restrictive rating, NC-17 (no "child" 17 or younger admitted under any circumstances.) The ratings are allegedly created by a panel of "average" parents of school age children, according to long time MPAA CEO, Jack Valenti, and other officials. There are no experts, e.g., no psychologists who study the impact of media on kids' attitudes and behavior. Panel members are selected by the rating committee chair, Joan Graves. Members' identities are kept secret to "avoid pressures" on their decision making.Among other things, director Kirby Dick discovers that (a) there are no explicit criteria or guidelines for ratings; (b) ditto for selection of raters (who, if they work full time, receive annual salaries of $30,000); (c) one recent rater was childless; the children of several others were adults; (d) raters frequently discuss films with industry representatives, arguably the most important source of "pressure" on their decisions; (e) majority votes determine the recommended rating, but these votes are not binding; (f) in case of ties (there are eight voting members, including Ms. Graves), Ms. Graves also is empowered to cast a tie-breaking judgment; and (g) there is an appeals process.However, the appeals board is composed exclusively of representatives of the major studios, distributors and exhibition chains, and rarely do they controvert the initial rating. This is no surprise, since the MPAA is entirely financed by the six largest studios (responsible for 90% of the films released domestically) and their conglomerate corporate media owners (who control 95% of all media outlets in the U.S.) Details of all rating board and appeal decisions are kept secret. To create the illusion of transparency, two clergymen, representing Roman Catholics and Protestants, always sit in as observers at appeals hearings. But they too are required not to disclose information on the appeal decision process.Compared to a number of other rating systems that exist in various countries worldwide, the MPAA approach is by far the most secretive, and contrary to every other system, it is far more restrictive of sexual content than violence. Kirby Dick also cites examples that strongly suggest greater bias (i.e., greater likelihood of getting an NC-17 rating) against films depicting gay/lesbian sex scenes than those with heterosexual scenes.Dick mixes illustrative film clips, talking heads, historical notes on the evolution of ratings, a rundown on what appear to be the implicit criteria for ratings; a stalking investigation to discover the identities of raters and appeal board members; and his personal experience in submitting an earlier cut of this film to MPAA for a rating (it got an NC-17 for sexually explicit content). Atom Egoyan, Kimberly Peirce, Kevin Smith and John Waters are among independent filmmakers interviewed by Dick. Ms. Peirce raises the interesting notion that MPAA ratings may also be more biased against films with scenes connoting female sexual pleasure than films showing male pleasure.Dick generally maintains a tone of wry humor, especially in showing us his day-by-day use of private investigators to track down and identify raters. There's almost a Keystone Cops flavor to the stalking antics of the women PIs he has hired, with Dick along for the ride. His re-creation of phone conversations with Joan Graves and the MPAA Chief Counsel, when he protests the rating of his own film, are also as funny as they are biased. (He uses animation to visually depict these officials as mean spirited grumps in split screen scenes that simultaneously show real time footage of Dick himself at his end of these conversations.) Dick is less successful in his review of information suggesting the implicit or inferable criteria raters use, based on film content and actual ratings. He zips through too much information too fast for anybody to absorb. Still, this is a bravura piece of advocacy journalism. The film gives us ample information to conclude that the MPAA system of corporate control of ratings, when combined with control of film distribution and screening based on these ratings, effectively results in a clever censorship arrangement that would certainly violate First Amendment rights were it not for the illusion of "voluntariness" that is perhaps the most ingenious aspect of this system.Anybody is free to make a film about anything, of course. But whether it will be screened, or even advertised, let alone able to return revenues sufficient to defray the costs of production, is a very carefully controlled process. And what is the point of making a film that will not be seen? As in political campaigning, free speech is hardly free. Those with the most corporate clout rule both the campaigning and movie making businesses. What's worse, in our characteristic American manner, we shrink puritanically from sex on screen but remain inured to the effects of violence. My grade: 7.5/10 (low B+) (Seen on 09/10/06)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good insight in American censorship and media manipulation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>America is the land of the free, so in order to constrain people to do what you want them to do, you have to let them think it's their choice. How do you do that? You create a completely anonymous committee, supposedly composed of concerned parents, to rate the films that appear and, depending on that rating, they will get more or less media coverage, distribution, target audience size. You also finance this body with the money of the seven largest film studios in the US. This functioning censorship committee is called the MPAA.The film is highly biased, to a point where it gets a little annoying, but the information contained in it is sound, proved and makes one think about the way public opinion is manipulated, ever so slightly, towards a desired average point of view. If you ever wondered how Americans can seem so ordinary, yet have completely different opinions about the same subjects as any other people, then this movie will answer part of that question. Very insightful is the presentation of the seven major film studios who own 95% of the American film industry, parts of larger conglomerates that own 90% of all mass-media. Also interesting, the role of the clergy in movie rating. Yes, I did say clergy, as in priests. In the appeals commission there are always an episcopalian priest and a catholic one. No other religions get to add their input.A must see movie, not a conspiracy theory film, but certainly one that is against the system. The system here being the absurd movie rating system of the MPAA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since the Hays Code, filmmakers have had a lot more freedom over the content of their films. However, the MPAA ratings board still does exercise a certain de facto censorship power. Most people do not realize this. "This Film is not Yet Rated" exposes the arbitrariness, secrecy, and bias of the MPAA ratings board and makes the viewer question why movies receive the ratings they do. Kirby Dick puts together a nice cross-section of directors and "talking heads" who discuss the MPAA ratings board's biases when it comes to realism, sex, violence, gay themes, and other taboo issues in films. Dozens of major directors have had problems with the MPAA ratings board - they either received the NC-17 (or the old "X") rating or had to cut their films to meet the requirements of the ratings board. Some examples are: Kubrick, Tarantino, Lynch, Woo, Friedkin, Peckinpah, Aronofsky, and countless others. This film exposes the fact that the ratings board is made up of people who are given NO criteria and NO training for rating films, so they basically use their own personal (and obviously heavily biased) judgments to decide what rating a particular movie should receive.This is an important film because so few people realize how movies are rated in the U.S. Even fewer realize how problematic (biased, anti-democratic, non-transparent, not accountable) our system is. It is also well put together, so it is easier to watch than most documentaries. I would have liked to have heard more comparisons between the U.S. rating system and others worldwide, something that was only briefly touched upon. 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A look into the mysterious organization that decides what rating a film is given. And all sorts of other issues/arguments that are created because of it. Numerous actors, directors, producers, former MPAA raters and critics share their thoughts on the good and bad of the highly secretive organization.I have always found "rating reasons" funny and often absurd, which is why I make my own when writing these things. I have also always liked to look into second opinion on things so maybe whoever reads my little IMDb reviews will get that from them. Since, the often disturbing fact for film makers is the rating is something they have to live with and discussing it with the people who decided it is virtually not an option. And that ultimately decides what theaters decided to show it and how much, which is essentially how films money.The reason as many of you know for the infamous NC-17 rating is sexual content, especially if it is explicit, and that is basically the focus of this film. Which is both good and bad. Good, because they do a pretty good job comparing R-rated and NC-17 rated sex scenes which are not that different. But bad, because the issue of violence (in my opinion the most potentially objectionable thing shown in film) is attended to on a small scale. There are violent PG-13 movies (Ah-nuld's "The 6th Day" for one) which include bone breaking, dismemberment, and you get the picture. While on the other side you have R-rated movies with really minimal or much more accurate depiction of violence (Michael Mann's "Heat" for one). Yet violence as entertainment is condoned, but showing kids what violence really looks like is not. Darren Aronofsky and Kevin Smith make the film's only points on violence and it'll leave you wanting for more.Also there wasn't a comparison to other countries rating system, just a mention that those systems are a little less absurd, which is true if you look at the rating sections on most IMDb film profiles, but some thought here would have been invaluable to this film's argument.However, this remains a pleasantly fresh documentary that many, but mainly John Waters (haha), have been waiting for. 8/10Not Rated, contains: sexual material and some violent clips - There are many clips of sex scenes shown, but are shown and discussed from a critical perspective. The few violent scenes are discussed in the same manner. So bring your kids! They'll finally know what "it's not for you" means.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, let's just say it right from the start: the MPAA sucks. They make good films turn into films that are hacked up just to fit their 'moral' agenda, and they are the bane of the existence of Hollywood filmmakers. Being from Canada, I have the benefit of a much fairer system, but one that is affected by the MPAA nonetheless. So when a film like This Film is Not Yet Rated comes out, I definitely become interested. And interesting is what this film is.The documentary is about the NC-17 rating primarily, and the people and groups fighting against it. When it is not showing interviews and clips about the horror stories in trying to get director's films cut to a suitable R or PG-13 rating, it is about director and star Kirby Dick's hired private investigators trying to get the names of the members of the MPAA ratings board.Watching the film is a bit of an on and off experience.On because the interviews with directors like Kevin Smith, Atom Egoyan, Jamie Babbit, Matt Stone, and Wayne Kramer are absolutely fascinating to listen to. They talk about the troubles they had with the MPAA, show the "obscene" footage from their films, and even offer some ideas as to how the MPAA can change for the better, rather than completely tear the company up to pieces. All of these clips are excellently edited together, and in some instances, offer some pretty amusing anecdotes. Seeing the offending clips from the films was also interesting, as just simply talking about them would defeat the purpose of the documentary itself (which thankfully, originally got an NC-17 for having the clips in the film).These interviews also offer a lot of moments talking about the rules of the MPAA itself. Listening to how ridiculous some get can be hilarious, but it is also enlightening. For someone who is into film and only knows the basics of the MPAA, it offers a lot of information on the final process a movie has to go through before it makes it to the theatre. The clips offered a lot more information than I imagined, and they elevate the film greatly.Another element I liked was showing the hypocrisies of the MPAA, and interview footage of former head Jack Valenti himself. It made the film feel a whole lot more complete, and gave it more of an authentic circular viewpoint. If they had simply just included the viewpoints of the filmmakers, journalists, authors, doctors and lawyers (like I half expected them to show), than they would not have nearly had as much credibility as they end up having. Of course, these moments are practically the funniest in the film, but they still offer plenty of intriguing insights. I think some comparisons to other country's film rating systems probably could have only enlivened this credibility even more.Where I think the film fails and becomes off is in the almost obsessive search to find out the identity of the MPAA's raters. I understand that it is pivotal to the entirety of the film, but it just drags the film down into depravity and ridiculousness. It shows these moments in an amusing light, but they really are not that funny. They offer a bit too much information in some sequences (like blurring out license plate numbers, but having the private investigator say the numbers anyway), and the payoff just does not feel entirely proper. It does not have the intensity or the postmodern awareness that the interview clips do. They just feel kind of boring, and in some parts, unnecessary. Dick was already exposing the fraudulence and downright deceitful nature of the MPAA. Did he really need to go so far as to expose everything imaginable? I am unsure of why it the exposing got to me so much, but it just did not feel totally right in a lot of cases. I liked how much dedication Dick and his crew had for the material, but it feels more like two different films than it does one cohesive whole. The information does not become overwhelming in any scene, but it does feel like overkill in some parts. The film is just over ninety minutes long, but it feels like it could have been trimmed. And most of that trimming could have probably come from scenes involving the private investigators. They just are nowhere near as interesting as the insight and horror stories offered in the interviews and film clips.This Film is Not Yet Rated is an interesting documentary, and it offers a lot of insight that I seriously doubted it would. It is definitely a recommended watch for anyone who is interested in the film-making process, but for anyone else, it may just be something to casually watch part of and then turn off. I will hand it to Dick though. The final product is something I never thought the MPAA would have passed with any rating.7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie needed to be made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a documentary about the US ratings system. It argues the same grievances that independent film makers have been complaining about for years. Specifically, that independent films are given less guidance than studios (which own the MPAA), that homosexual content is treated more harshly than equivalent straight sexuality, and that sex is rated more puritanically than violence.I think these facts are obvious, but seeing clips of films side-by-side truly hammers it home.Film maker Kirby Dick presents a quick-paced, laugh-provoking case, although he gives short shrift to alternative views. One should go into the movie understanding that Dick advocates a specific view, much like Michael Moore, but this doesn't diminish the entertaining and thought-provoking elements of the documentary.Mild spoiler:Controversially, Kirby Dick challenges the secretiveness of ratings. MPAA chiefs have always asserted that the raters are a group of "ordinary parents" with children from 5 to 18 years old. Well, Dick hires a private detective to find out.The narrative thread of the documentary involves tracking them down one by one. The detectives methods produce some deep chuckles. In the end Dick shows us face shots, and vital statistics for every rater. I must admit I was a little squeamish when they're digging through a rater's trash, but the results are fascinating. Many of the rater's kids have long since grown into their twenties and thirties. (Still, I wonder whether it's fair for a documentary to name their names, and even show photos of their houses.)Finally, to top it all off, Dick has his own rough cut rated. Actually, there's been some news about this too. Apparently they made a copy of it, which may be illegal because of the very laws that the MPAA pushed through. They counter that Dick is just seeking free publicity for his movie. Could be, but he has plenty of it.***Bottom line, if you care how films are made in the US, you should make a point of seeing this film. Presumably it'll be on IFC later this year, uncut. That's more than can be said for many artist's work, and you should find out why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent documentary on the MPAA--the company that rates movies. It has been accused of favoring major companies (with less stringent ratings) than independent companies. Filmmakers are interviewed about what they had to cut and why to avoid the dreaded NC-rating. Some of the revelations are at once funny...and shocking. To find out more about the board a lesbian detective is hired to find out who comprises the board---the results are interesting.They also talk about the appeals process--when a filmmaker disagrees with the rating and files a complaint. A separate group of people are brought in to view the movie and give their opinion--but it was never revealed who these people are. Here we find out who they are--and the revelations are downright shocking. It shows that the MPAA is a censor board (despite what it says) and have a stranglehold on movies and what they're allowed to show. Basically, EVERYONE should see this film. Shocking, hilarious and thoroughly engrossing. HIGHLY recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting subject ruined by irrelevant material and incorrect message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was anxious to see this documentary because of its subject and because Kirby Dick's "Sick: The Life &amp; Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist (1997)" was excellent.Overall, this documentary has interesting stuff to offer the viewer. But I'm disappointed and a bit annoyed by several things: 1. There was no point in showing the entire "private investigation" saga. The whole thing could have been done behind the scenes, giving us only the results. Although private investigation could be interesting, I don't see what point it served except for stretching the movie in additional 45 minutes. 2. What's the point of telling us about the private life of the private investigator (no pun intended)? Does the fact that she is gay has ANYTHING to do with the MPAA? So the MPAA "doesn't like gay sex" and the investigator is gay... therefore... what? Therefore the MPAA hates the investigator or something? 3. I'm not an expert, but does it really take an investigator a whole month to get several names? What's so difficult in doing any one of the following:- Writing the license plates and getting the owners' details. Come on, any decent P.I. with minimum resources/connections can do that! (and don't tell me "that's illegal" - investigators do worse things than that)- Follow the car to the person's house.- These people are getting paid by the MPAA. It's a salary that has to be declared and paid taxes for. Can't the P.I. get this info from the income tax (again, with the right resources/connections) 4. OK, so the "big finish" of the movie was telling us the names of the raters? Hmm... OK. You could have told us that in the first 5 minutes. 5. The message everyone is trying to give is: "It's OK to show sex, but it's not OK to show violence (either cartoonish or not)". OK, this is C-R-*-P. I agree with the first part, but what are you trying to "sell" us? That there SHOULD be censorship/rating on violence? That action movies ARE the cause of violence on the street? That sane and rational people can't tell the difference between fictitious violence on the screen and actual acts of violence? Do me a favor.Don't get me wrong. There are some very interesting issues in this documentary and I learned a lot about the MPAA and how difficult it is for the indie film makers. But I was left with a bad taste because half of the movie could have been left in the editing room while providing us with the same knowledge, and it tries to push the "free sex" message so hard that it ruins its own slogan of "free decision" by telling us we can't distinguish reality from fiction when it comes to action movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: This Film Is Not Yet Rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Motion Pictures Association of America's ratings system comes under scrutiny in this documentary. The judgement that movies are given G, PG-13, R or NC17 are taken a look into, as its deemed quite biased and with great mystery that films are rated based on some arbitrary criteria, from a group of chosen anonymous few in highly non-transparent means.It's quite fun as director Kirby Dick digs into the system to try and look for answer, with hilarious results, especially when dealing with the bureaucracy. In particular, the main gripe here is how films are given the NC17 rating. Films are compared with each other, and it seemed that the board is more tolerant towards violence than sex, or in particular, female pleasure. Filmmakers like Darren Aronofsky, Kimberly Peirce, Atom Egoyan are interviewed for their views on the system, and reveal their puzzlement at the situation too.I thought This Film Is Not Yet Rated brought out the hypocrisy of the entire system, that "absolute power corrupts absolutely", that if Kirby Dick is to believed, then there are rules and regulations set which have been breached, especially on transparency, and the primary concern that the raters should be independent and not influenced by filmmakers, studios and the likes.I also enjoyed the entire investigations and social engineering techniques, including things like dumpster diving and impersonation, and exploiting the innate nature of man to want to help out strangers in distress, even though they are anonymous over the phone, and are "nice". You've got to salute their perseverance, all to get to the results of unravelling the mystery being those secret raters of movies, and those on the Appeals board that filmmakers can go to for redress.The bits of animation in the movie, combined with the sharp no-holds barred revelation and hypothesis and snippets of movies which suffered the NC17 rating, made this a very enjoyable, smart and fun documentary to sit through, especially when it delivers sucker punch after sucker punch at establishment, and makes a mockery of the powers that be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughts on NC-17</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was saddened to learn the fate of movies that receive an NC-17 rating, that they don't get marketed properly, and they are locked out of some opportunities by virtue of their rating and nothing more. That definitely smacks of censorship to me.This made me think there ought to be a system, maybe a website, where moviegoers can seek out NC-17 movies so that we can judge for ourselves if we want to at least try to see them if/when they are released on DVD.I think the popularity of independent films demonstrates a willingness on the part of moviegoers to seek out good movies marketed outside the studio system, so a website listing NC-17 movies available on DVD would be very popular, provided it also contained adequate summaries and trailers to view.That being said, I am glad the MPAA exists, and while it appears there is an obvious need for improvement, without the MPAA or an organization like it, I doubt I would be able to sit through a lot of movies being released today, as I count myself among the "sensitive viewers" that get warned before graphic material appears on television.Similarly, if a movie is rated R, I need to know why. If it is for sex, fine, great even, but anything containing graphic violence, I need to pass on. This has caused me to miss some movies made by some of my favorite actors, but there are certain visuals I do not want in my head and movie makers need to at least respect that, even if they don't understand it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-aimed attempt to restore some integrity to American moral censorship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who are those 'moral guardians of society' that prevent you or I seeing the films we want to see, in the form originally intended? In any philosophical sense, This Film is Not Yet Rated does not even attempt to make any serious exploration of censorship - but it does name names.In America, it would seem the big debate is not over what adults can see, but what minors can see, with or without an accompanying adult. The reason this is so important, as far as I can gather, is that the most restrictive of ratings means that the film is not likely to be shown outside of art-house cinemas and so, in practice, a lot of adults will not get to see it either. (The meaning of each of the ratings is whizzed over fairly quickly in an introductory cartoon, so non-US viewers may be well advised to acquaint themselves with the significance of the ratings first.) Not surprisingly, the film, contrary to what European audiences might think a film about censorship would include, has little explicit sex or violence. One of the most controversial shots is of some very soft-core, neatly-trimmed, female pubic hair.Director Kirby Dick makes a compelling argument, admittedly mostly by means of soundbites and innuendo, against the current ratings system. His lighthearted and largely non-graphic approach can be justified by wanting to reach (within the present system) as many people as possible. I would (personally) have preferred something a little more thorough, even academic and balanced, but there is no denying that Dick has made choices that are intelligently aimed to hit the target.Although Britain has long lagged behind continental standards, we now have a fairly relaxed attitude to censorship, enjoying fairly broad support by the public and the industry. Gone are the days of Mary Whitehouse and the mad moral crusaders. I say 'mad' because their idea of morality was based largely on Biblical Christianity which lags far behind the more enlightened human-rights based morality that is a mainspring in Europe nowadays. America, sadly, still labours in the middle ages in terms of its vocal moral majority - people (and presidents) that spout religious texts to justify state-sanctioned killing, bigotry and many abuses of human rights. Liberal Americans of moral integrity are aware of the dilemma and, like Kirby Dick, sometimes look to the arts and cinema to exert pressure for positive social evolution.The drawback of This Film is Not Yet Rated is that non-American audiences may find it hard to get excited about a primarily US problem. Its style is fairly repetitive, often showing 'outrageous' examples of violence that are allowed (surprise, surprise) and mild sexuality that is not. The American MPPA, looking at their website, has some apparent similarity to the British BBFC, yet, unlike the BBFC (Dick goes to some lengths to show), MPPA members do not have any film expertise or dedication to the arts - they are merely anonymous representatives of a hypothetical 'normal parent'. He shows the ridiculousness of such a position, many of the double-standards that exist, and suggests that 'audience satisfaction' with the system is probably because no better alternative exists or has been offered (He makes some constructive suggestions in this direction.) Through the course of a long undercover operation, Dick infiltrates various aspects of the MPPA system and, by means of this film, tries to bring them publicly to account.Although I found the film soporific in the extreme, it may yet be an important landmark for American cinema, so I still count myself a reluctant fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, But Not as Scathing as It Could Have Been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kirby Dick's expose of the MPAA's ratings process only confirms the suspicion that motion picture ratings are virtually worthless, arbitrarily assigned by an elite panel who purport to have our country's children's best interests at heart, but who seem to think that an exposed breast is more harmful to them than seeing a gunshot to the head.It's absolutely infuriating that the country's churches have a seat on the ratings boards and a say in what content is or is not suitable for consumption. It's infuriating that an NC-17 rating exists at all (the board is essentially usurping the judgement and decision-making abilities of parents), but doubly infuriating that it's used as a punishment to "encourage" filmmakers to alter their films so that they're more palatable for mainstream film goers. For a while I was kind of sad that home video and the Internet seems to be supplanting movie theatres as the preferred venue for watching films, but now I appreciate the democratizing effect of companies like Netflix and Blockbuster, who have made great filmmakers less reliant on corporate theatre chains to get their films distributed and seen.As a documentary, "This Film Is Not Yet Rated" is rather disorganized. Dick has good points to make, but their impact is blunted by tangents and off-topic tirades. Dick hires a private detective to track down the identities of the ratings board, and spends far too much of his 96 minutes following the details of that investigation. On the plus side, it's great to see directors and actors like Kimberly Peirce, Maria Bello and John Waters given a venue to vent their frustrations at the ratings practice.One of the main points Dick makes, and one I heartily agree with, is that the ratings board focuses far more energy on censoring sex in films than they do violence, a point that is unintentionally driven home by none other than the ratings board chairman herself towards the film's climax. Dick asks why his documentary received an NC-17 rating and she cites the sexual content that appears in some of the clips of films that have received NC-17 ratings sprinkled throughout the documentary. She seems to have no problem with some of the very violent content included in clips from some of those very same movies. What an idiot.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great eye opener about the inner workings of the MPAA rating system.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, before seeing this film, I didn't think it'd be all that interesting, just another movie to pass time. After watching this film my opinion on the subject and the film itself has changed dramatically. Those of you who haven't watched and thought as I did that "there's very little that goes on that I already don't know" will be surprised.The people who rate these movies aren't just your average moms and dads, but clergy members, movie studio heads, and theater owners. All these people inherently decide what's best for you, regardless of whether or not it's in your interest or not.Even better, the rating system is not up for question, those who rate movies are hidden from public view. Apparently this is so that they can't be pressured. What's funny is that they're in direct contact with studio heads on a regular basis, but apparently the public itself (who the movies are marketed to) is a bigger threat to the opinion of a reviewer than studio heads themselves.The financial effect these ratings have on film makers is much bigger than you can imagine, an NC-17 movie gets very little exposure outside of some theater's in big cities. This is pretty much a death sentence for a movie. So film makers are given the choice of making a MPAA/Religiously correct movie or not have it shown in 99% of theaters in the U.S.This was a great educational movie, that was very entertaining containing both comedy and information. Very worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see for anyone who regularly goes to the movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As anyone who sat through Hostel earlier this year would probably agree, the MPAA hasn't been doing their job in quite some time. The MPAA has always been a controversial subject, but it hasn't been until relatively recently that it has become a huge issue. 1999 is where it seemingly began with the release of such films as Eyes Wide Shut, American Pie, But I'm a Cheerleader, the South Park movie, and Boys Don't Cry all receiving NC-17 ratings, until scissors were taken to earn them the more commercially successful R rating. It is from 1999-2006 that This Film is Not Yet Rated is primarily concerned with. It details the past history of the MPAA and pre-1999 films that have had trouble with the ratings board, but it's the past seven years that get the majority of the topic time here and rightfully so as with each passing year, the MPAA becomes more corrupt. Director Kirby Dick talks to some of the best filmmakers working in the industry today including Kevin Smith, John Waters, Jamie Babbit, Atom Egoyan (albeit too briefly), Mary Harron, and Matt Stone about their past experiences with the MPAA and how frusturating the process is. Some are able to laugh at the situation while others are still are understandably very angry about what happened in their scenarios. All of the directors, however, come off as quite genuine and interesting people. There's no pretentious that one normally finds in interviews with most Hollywood directors. There are a few minor flaws with This Film is Not Yet Rated. While the point is made that extremely explicit graphic violence is perfectly okay to earn an R Rating but a realistic sex scene, or any kind of sex really, will earn an NC-17 rating, it could have been discussed a few minutes longer. Also missing is the fact that male nudity is more acceptable to the rating boards than female nudity. Regardless, This Film is Not Yet Rated stands as one of the boldest and best movies of the year. A must-see for anyone who regularly visits the multiplex. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting expose'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the movie "Dragonfly", Kevin Costner's character says the "F" word once. At that point in the director's commentary, Tom Shadyac says, "...You can shoot a guy 3,000 times and get a 'PG-13', but if you say the 'F' word *twice* it's automatically an 'R'. I'll let that be its own comment." This was when I first started really thinking about the movie rating system as such, though the subject of our society's (by which I mean primarily America) bizarre, obsessive, unhealthy attitude toward nudity and sex is something which I have thought about for a long time. We are obsessed with nudity and sex -- as the old saying goes, "Sex sells," (which is understood to mean nudity, which of course is *not* the same as sex) -- and at the same time, apparently utterly terrified of it. This split has led us, as a society, to a point of hysterical insanity on the subject, and given us the highest incidence of teen pregnancy in the world, and by FAR the highest incidence of rape -- close to 10 times higher than the next-highest country.This film offers a greatly detailed perspective on one major manifestation of the issue, the movie censorship system -- sorry, I mean "rating" system. The side-by-side comparison of R and NC-17 scenes was particularly revealing. It just boggles my mind that people get so twisted up on this subject.I love the irony that the very ratings board scrutinized in this film was required to watch it. If there are any honest members on that board, perhaps it got them to think a little more about what they do and how they operate.(P.S. the explanation of the ratings near the beginning is hilarious!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and particularly for those interested in issues of censorship and the actual business of film-making, "This Film Is Not Yet Rated" is an excellent piece of documentary journalism. Director Kirby Dick, who seems to have made a career for himself illuminating the sort of human oddities that become the subjects of ReSearch Publications, takes on the MPAA's film rating board this time around, and pretty much nails the organization's secretive and capricious hide to the wall. Interspersing interviews of various directors whose work has run afoul of the MPAA board (Darren "Requiem For a Dream" Aronofsky, Mary "American Psycho" Harron, and John "Pecker" Waters, to name a few) with a private investigation into the identities of the members of the ratings board, Dick paints a damning portrait of the board's covert and arbitrary nature, and limns America's puritanical repression of sexual expression and its hypocritical love affair with violence. Ultimately, Dick shows that it's all about the money, as so much of American culture is; the MPAA serves less as a watchdog of the industry's moral responsibility to its customers as it does a guardian of industry profits and public image. This comes as no surprise to any intelligent observer of the industry, of course, but given the ever-shrinking attention span of the American body politic, Dick's message is one that needs to be repeated as much as possible. The sad thing is that the people who would most benefit from seeing "This Film Is Not Yet Rated" are the ones least likely to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You're Waiting for Blockbuster to Carry This Film... Don't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After waiting 6 months for Blockbuster Online to carry this film, I gave up and rented it from Netflix. Needless to say, after seeing it, I now know why Blockbuster isn't carrying it and understand why they will never carry it. It's because this film criticizes them for not carrying NC-17 films, an action which supports a gender biased, sexual orientation biased, racially biased, violence promoting, mercenary, puritanical, duplicitous and just plain idiotic system- the MPAA ratings.Although I'm a tremendous cinephile, It's been a long time since I've been in a movie theater, preferring instead to watch everything on DVD. After seeing this film and witnessing the self serving manner in which the MPAA acts (under the guise of 'serving' the public), I'm glad that they get a substantially smaller cut from my $.75 DVD rentals than they do from $10 movie tickets. If I could watch films and not give them a single penny, I would. The studios have been tremendously powerful since they were formed- the manner in which they wield the MPAA ratings as a weapon to silence opposition and independent thought is one of many ways in which this absolute power is abused.The public isn't served, the film makers aren't served, the only people making out like bandits in this equation are the studios. The independent film maker has no chance in this scenario. This small group of studio execs (and, every day, getting smaller) makes the decision as to what we can and cannot watch and can effectively silence anyone that has a different perspective or who can't afford to pay tribute- just one more example of the wealthier getting ever wealthier and shrinking in numbers while the poor keep getting poorer and growing.It's not democratic, it's not just, it's not American and it's not right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been called Films With Rape and Orgasms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film has a very good premise; to infiltrate the inner chamber of the MPAA and expose who's rating our films. A team of private investigators is hired to track down who's responsible for evaluating films, but we soon find out it's not as simple as calling them on the phone.There's wonderful interviews with a ton of directors such as John Waters and Kevin Smith who have been urged to cut their films because of the content. Getting an NC-17 rating is a financial death sentence because most big, chain stores such as Walmart and Blockbuster will refuse to carry your film if it has that rating. This doesn't mean that a film-maker needs to cut down a film to get it released, just that it won't make as much money and needs to be independently financed.I can see the film being quite titillating for someone who doesn't want to bother with the plot of a film and just cut to the sex. There are some very astute points that are made, but I don't feel that This Film Is Not Yet Rated delved deep enough for me or showed enough history. I wanted to learn more about the social history of attaching ratings such as pre-code films, PMRC (the counsel that believes popular music causes rape, violence and other destructive behavior) or other rating systems that border on censorship. There's some interesting juxtapositions of sex scenes that look exactly the same (such as comparing American Pie to But I'm a Cheerleader), but got different ratings to show the arbitrariness of the the evaluation process, but after the 200th pelvic thrust, I got the message. There's quite a montage of sexual content in the film. I wanted to see more about the investigation. After watching the same (and I mean the same) clip from a film for the fourth time, I felt like I was watching documentary on the longest orgasms in film instead of a documentary about the rating system.I hope to see this subject approached in another film in the future. It's a very important topic. I remember the days before PMRC and listening to bands like Suicidal Tendencies when I was a teenager. I'm still alive today with no rapes or suicide attempts.Another film you might want to see if you're interested in censorship is Cinema Paradiso. It's not a documentary, but its about a movie theater where a priest cuts up films before his town can view them. You may also want to see Red-Headed Woman, a pre-code film about a woman seducing a married man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film they REALLY don't want you to see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The MPAA's intentions are good, but their execution is biased, corrupt, and dangerous. Kirby Dick, director of This Film is Not Yet Rated, explores the industry deeper to get the answers on who rates the films people make and what they consider R vs. NC-17.A number of filmmakers have been forced to edit their films to avoid an NC-17 rating. At first glance, people might not see what is so wrong with that rating. We think, doesn't that mean your film achieves the highest rating possible? That it's explicit, vulgar, etc? Isn't that a good thing? Well, in theory, yes. We think the greatest or the strongest is the best, but having an NC-17 rating attached to your film leaves you open for controversy and almost entirely closed for profit.NC-17 films aren't usually put in a wide-release. Meaning you'll have to resort to finding very cheap theaters to show your films, which will contribute to a very, very low box office revenue. Also, advertising won't be easy seeing as you'll have to wait until after 9:00 PM to show commercials for your film. Not to mention by occupying the NC-17 rating you're blacklisting your movie from places like Blockbuster, Wal-Mart, etc. It's a dangerous move to occupy the rating, but brave films continue to do it which is something that should be commended.I've always looked at the MPAA with an odd face because of their uneven consistency for rating films. Of course, every film is different, but why films like 2011's The Way needed an R rating because of one brief sequence of marijuana is beyond me. Drugs don't sit right with the MPAA. According to the website, if a drug, including a cigarette, is shown at one point during the film it automatically can't be lower than PG-13, which is understandable. But the fact that a brief scene of drugs, like in The Way can be deemed an R is unnecessary.Violence is another concept that somehow doesn't register with the MPAA. Robert Rodriguez's Sin City was a grim, bloody, violent, and brutal film but manages to sneak by with an R rating somehow. Compare that to The Cooler, another fantastic film, which was threatened with an NC-17 rating for showing a three second glimpse of Maria Bello's pubic hair. It's preposterous.We've already established the MPAA is incredibly uneven in their actions towards violence and sex. Instead of looking at the true moral of the film, they look at the context and whether or not it's like that for unnecessary purposes or like that to inform. Scorsese's Casino was almost stamped with an NC-17 because of foul language, when really, it wasn't doing it to be gratuitous, but to show how the mobsters really behaved and spoke. To even threaten to stamp the film with an NC-17 rating is a joke.I haven't spoke much about This Film is Not Yet Rated because it makes me think about the MPAA as a whole. The film is about filmmaker Kirby Dick who goes on a journey using private investigators to uncover dirt about who is rating the films people see. That's right, the people who rate films G through NC-17 are nameless to the public. Right off the bat, that's an unorthodox statement. Movies are released to the public, but the people who decide how movies are released to the public aren't? One person in the film is astounded how the film industry is such a public state of affairs, yet this one group who is so large has snuck under the radar and the individuals have almost all been nameless, and they play such an important role in every film.This Film is Not Yet Rated is a wake-up call for the public, a daring move on the industry, and a film that won't take "no" or "keep out" for an answer. Dick should be commended for his persistent efforts, and should also be looked up to for doing something no filmmaker with a bigger name could do before.Starring: Kirby Dick, Kevin Smith, John Waters, Jack Valenti, Kimberly Peirce, Alison Anders, and Becky Altringer.

		<fullReview>This was an excellent expose of the hypocrisy that goes on when a group of people decides what is best for everyone else. The system is shown to be generally arbitrary, secretive and Jack Valenti comes off as a slimy toad. The combination of the stories of the private investigators and the submission of the film for a rating works really well as does the comparisons of different movies getting different ratings despite having similar themes. I would have liked more history on the Joe Breen/Will Hays era and what kinds of things were specifically banned back then. Even though I was laughing throughout, I also was angered by the superiority and hypocrisy of the MPAA and particularly Joan Graves. It was truly satisfying to see their names revealed especially after the claim that they were anonymous to protect them from "influence" was refuted by proof that they were calling the big studios to tell them how to get better ratings. I really got involved and was rooting for the director and the PIs to overcome the evil MPAA!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may stand as one of the more important documentaries released lately, in an era where people have finally come to accept that documentaries can be important. While not picking up on Big Issues (tm) like global warming, fat rich white people, and multiple takes on the ongoing war in the Middle East, it does take a very pointed and serious look at an institution that most Americans not only have come to accept, but barely think twice about: The MPAA.Basically, anybody who's inquired at any rental store about why one movie is rated R while another one is rated PG-13, or worse, NC-17, will get an explanation along the lines of "Well, the MPAA is kind of arbitrary." What they won't get is a long and secretive history of a self-censorship organization that is curiously strongly guarded and anonymous--one interviewee in the film even notes that the only other American institution with that level of secrecy that he can think of is the CIA.The documentary itself is pretty decently crafted, with some amusing animations, a revealing scene-next-to-scene comparison, and some decent interviews. Honestly it does, I think, need just a bit more of "the other side" as there are still some aspects of the MPAA which seem to me, even after viewing this film, kind of important, though the key theme of accountability still holds.Also, since this film was finally released without a rating, it's a little difficult to find... the reasons which are explained within its own dialog with the MPAA. However, this film is pretty much mandatory viewing for any aspiring filmmakers, important viewing for critics, interesting viewing for cinema enthusiasts, and won't be seen or cared about by the mainstream. That's the way the MPAA likes it, and that's the way the economy behind film-making works.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely entertaining doco on Hollywood's Star Chamber</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hilarious, clever and eye-opening documentary about the studio-sanctioned, US rating system. We've always believed that the MPAA is much tougher on indie films than studio films, but the MPAA member interviewed disagrees. You'd expect him to do that. The truth is, the rating system was set up by the studios, is paid for by the studios, and is there to serve the studios. Their mission is to dominate every corner of the film exhibition scene and stop the indies from receiving another dollar. World domination is what we're looking at here, folks, although, thankfully, the MPAA doesn't dominate the world -- not yet, anyway. Director Kirby Dick has a lot of fun stalking the secret members of the MPAA's rating and review boards and plastering their faces all over the screen. It's always been apparent that the MPAA has a God-fearing agenda because, like our dear President, they're much more comfortable with knives, gun and bombs than breasts, love and orgasms. Various examples of their warped priorities are paraded across the screen and we're introduced to a couple of pleasant religious chaps who aren't too sure what they do at the MPAA, though we have a pretty good idea. Described as a type of "Star Chamber" by one interviewee, this voyeuristic look into the association's strange behavior makes for a hugely entertaining, never heavy-handed piece of journalism stuffed with fascinating interviews (John Waters shines bright) and zany graphics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great look at how the films we see are rated. The MPAA it seems is bordering on the edge of censorship. I believe that the whole concept of an NC-17 is unnecessary. If a movie has that level of sex or violence it should really be up to the parents of the children who are going to see these movies whether or not to let them see it. An R rating requires that a person under the age of 17 has to have an adult with them, so its not like 6 year olds are going to be able to "wander" into a movie showing sex anyway. The film does not stress or explain thoroughly enough that there should be an alternate to the MPAA rating system, not implying that no movies should be rated, instead having a different system to rate them in. This probably would not have any if all effect on G or PG movies, and not all too much in PG 13 movies, it would mainly deal with the R vs NC-17 ratings. It is a real problem for film makers who include adult themes to make a work of art the way that they intend it to be. Also the film does spend waaaayyy too much time on their investigation and not enough time making a stronger case for their ideal rating system. That was the only thing that really bothered me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Is Not Yet Rated provides a compelling view of how the movie ratings system works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this fascinating documentary of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) by director Kirby Dick (What a name!) on DVD. He interviews several independent filmmakers about their troubles with the board on avoiding an NC-17. Among them: John Waters, Kevin Smith, and Matt Stone who provides a fascinating tale of the differences of dealing with the board as an independent filmmaker-Orgazmo-and a Major Studio one-South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut. Mr. Dick also has himself filmed calling many of the members about this film and his own troubles. There's also some fascinating footage of a female detective he hires to find out the names of the board members and what she finds out about them. And then there's the stock footage of the ratings founder-the late Jack Valenti-that makes him look good and bad considering the surrounding scenes of the other interviewees and movie sequences. The entire thing is treated both humorously and seriously in a way that I'm sure there will be lots of discussion of just how influential this film is. So on that note, I highly recommend This Film Is Not Yet Rated. P.S. That scene of the leading character humping a pie in American Pie is from the unrated version, not the R-rated version that originally appeared in theatres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfying middle finger to the MPAA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This Film is Not Yet Rated" has a fine moderator in writer-director Kirby Dick, who comes across as a less imposing muckracker than Michael Moore, but no less cunning. His target is the Motion Picture Association of America (the MPAA), long the bastion of regulating the content of American films via the now-notorious ratings system; the focus is primarily on films and filmmakers who have had their work threatened with the commercially suicidal NC-17, tidbits regarding the incestuous relationship between the anonymous ratings board and the conglomerates that control the mass media, and a private investigator who, with the assistance of Dick's camera, finds out the identities of who is (was?) currently serving on the board. "This Film" is at its best when culling anecdotes from directors who have been "slapped" with the NC-17, and consequently forced to edit their work down for the more marketable R; Dick also gets good interview footage with film historians, critics, marketing heads, and former raters that bring considerable insight to the organization. That being said, "This Film" falters in its private-investigator subplot, which plays like a Michael Moore stunt writ large, and while coming to a payoff at the very end, brings the film to a halt every time it interrupts the directors' stories--with the intended effect of humanizing the subject through an outsider's eyes, it merely blunts the edge and comes across as heavy-handed. That being said, "This Film" is still a fun and very revealing documentary about, as Dick puts it, "much ado about nothing."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Is Not Yet Rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The public typically assumes that the MPAA, responsible for rating all widely distributed films, is a sensible, lawful governmental agency accountable to consistent standards; a necessary, helpful avenue for informing parents and consumers. According to Kirby Dick's 2006 documentary This Film Is Not Yet Rated, we're wrong on every count.This Film primarily focuses on the line between an R rating and an NC-17, positing that the difference between the two is more a matter of politics than fostering parental awareness. R-rated films are distributed widely, NC-17 films are not--the harsher rating is typically given to independent art-house fare, dependent more on tone than content. The MPAA--owned and operated by major studios--not only discourages but disallows any appeals to precedent, and cloaks its members in anonymity. Kirby's film gets a bit silly in its animated and investigative segments, but it comes solidly recommended for its content--the politics of distribution affect any serious film-goer, and the better informed we are the better. -TK 10/30/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Educational documentary to an overlooked subject..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as 2009's "Food, Inc." exposed the inner workings of America's corporate controlled food industry, "This Film Is Not Yet Rated" exposes the terrifying inner workings of the MPAA and how American medias (of all sorts, not just theatrical) are being controlled by a small group of people and corporations.Something to be appreciated with this documentary is that, just like "Food, Inc." (I compare the two because they have similar agendas for different mediums) it takes a headstrong approach to a problem that not too many people think about. The rating system for our media has been around for over sixty years now and it's simply become so normal that nobody questions the way it works or how it's possibly very flawed. "This Film Is Not Yet Rated" also doesn't shy away from using frowned upon tactics in order to get the answers it wants the audience to see for themselves. While some may consider this trickery a bit unfair, I believe most should see it as a means to the end. A majority of people don't know what really goes in to the rating systems or how much controversy there is behind the progress; but they should. The amount of sexism and unjust actions were kept in secret before this documentary's release and for good reason. The documentary also briefly touches down on topics beyond the rating system and into territory such as piracy, the contradictions of MPAA policy, and how the rating appeal process filmmakers have to go through is shockingly unjust.The direction of the film is a little bit choppy every now and then, and if you're not into documentaries you might find it overall a tad boring; especially if you're not familiar with the film industry. There's plenty of shocking interviews and humorous transitions to keep most entertained, I believe. Personally I found it extremely intriguing, very educational and quite disturbing at times. And after some research I discovered that the film doesn't lose it's educational value either, even after being almost six years old. All the information is still up- to-date and spot on. Also, if you're highly conservative I suggest staying clear of the film because there is an abundance of adult-themed, R-NC-17 rated clips from films ranging between 1970 and the 2000s; in order to help the filmmakers get their point across. Though I would also recommend trying to stomach these scenes because they aren't put in the documentary for lewd purposes; simply to make comparisons on unfair judgments made by the MPAA.Overall this is a documentary I highly suggest seeing simply to update personal knowledge about a system that affects more than some may realize. Rather you're a conspiracy theorist or someone who simply enjoys learning about the inner workings of life, this is an important documentary to the world of film and to Americans in general. There's always a good chance you could walk away from the experience with a refreshed frame of mind or even an updated one. And again, like "Food, Inc.", even if you don't get anything from it, at least you learned something new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those rare 'hip' documentaries that doesn't blur any lines, edit rolls of film, or anything like that to the point that it only delivers the narrator's point of view. (Like many of the Michael Moore productions). Granted THIS FILM does edit reels and focus on the inconsistencies of the MPAA, but I am sure, no, POSITIVE, that the edits were made to save us all time on the garble and bull of the responses from much of the MPAA resistances.The film takes place in 2004-2005 with Kirby Dick outlining the rise of Film and the rise of the MPAA. He does this extremely well, so much that you could never have heard of the MPAA or Rating System and become a pro within fifteen minutes of the film start. He then begins interviews with key directors to further enhance your outlook on what the MPAA really is and the inconsistencies of the Rating System. Including very very real proof. And for the most part the directors interviewed are veterans to Hollywood and are critically acclaimed; speaking out against the fascist state of the MPAA.Like most if not all documentaries, the mood will always be to make you hate the opposition. And like so many others, this is against the Censoring in America. But it's not a cheap trick like BLAME THE PARENTS or anything like that. We don't need any more films on how we can blame parents. I believe we're all professionals at that. Instead this cuts deep at the MPAA. And it doesn't treat the MPAA as some single entity. Kirby Dick hires his OWN Private Eye (Who does an awesome job) to find out who the faceless figures are behind the clockwork.Kirby uses quotes and citations from then CEO of MPAA and many of the figure heads or GUIDELINES and obliterates them with the existences of their contradictions. It's one of those documentaries that seems to hit on one thing and it opens several doors to other things, but Kirby only glimpses at these things, but stays on a steady line at the MPAA. (What I mean is; he will talk about studios vs independent films and how they are treated differently. He then exposes {not to any surprise} that the handful of studios own a great amount of media control and that those companies are owned by an even larger conglomerate with even more cultural and economic control.If you want a movie you can kick back to, learn from, and get all riled up about then watch this. It most certainly will spurn conversations for weeks to come if you have movie loving friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exposes new insights into the way the MPAA more or less censors our culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American public is no stranger to the MPAA ratings system and its inherent flaws. Everyone has his or her own opinion about the level of censorship that goes on in Hollywood and what is appropriate for what age group and so on. But you don't really know what it's about until you watch Kirby Dick's documentary "This Film is Not Yet Rated."Anyone who pays more than surface-level attention to the goings on in the film industry knows an NC-17 rating is a death sentence for a film. You kill off advertising possibilities, your film won't get played in as many theaters -- millions of dollars are at stake. What you might not know is that (as Dick and most would argue) NC-17 is not a rating so much as a way to force filmmakers to edit "questionable" material. In some cases it's as specific as "if you cut this, this and this then you'll get an R."Dick interviews filmmakers and their experiences with fighting the ratings system in films such as "Boys Don't Cry," "The Cooler," and "American Psycho," but his goal is to find out who the raters on this panel of ratings screeners are because America is the only country that isn't transparent with that information. He hires a private investigator to obtain the information and the methods and results are interesting. It's very guerrilla-style and quasi- professional looking but it works.There are only a couple problems with Dick's film. It wanders at times from the subject of film ratings into other censorship-relevant topics that while important deviate from his objective of learning how the MPAA operates in terms of ratings as far as what they don't tell the public. At one point he explores discrimination in ratings toward gay and lesbian sex and themes and only briefly touches on how violence is not rated as strictly as sex. Important stuff, but it's just not given enough treatment to be effective in the film.The tone of the documentary is very Michael Moore without the conflict. It's satirical and gives you a couple head-shaking moments of disbelief, but its impact is not all that impressive. You leave the film thinking "yup, what they're doing isn't right" and having gathered some new insights, but other than reminding us that a handful of companies control our media and that everyone is in everyone's pockets, namely recently retired MPAA chief Jack Valenti, there seem to be no solutions, no forward movement on the subject matter. Definitely interesting and a worthwhile watch for any movie-lover.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie rating has always been a problem for some countries, like India for example (my place) where the ratings board simply deletes all the parts they find objectionable. Some countries and cultures have a long way to go to attain the levels of Sweden or Netherlands! (come on, it is a fact! don't be a hypocrite!) Thanks for internet, i'm sure that i wouldn't have seen this without it in India or in uae where i'm working. I am sure that most people in Europe or USA won't be able to understand the lack of logic and reason in most aspects of functioning of a society when it comes to middle east and India. Just imagine this, Schindler's list and Borat are banned here, while most of terrifying horror/slasher films like Saw series,Texas chainsaw massacre etc are freely available in all DVD shops! Yes, this is very important -the cultures whom see violence and murder are natural while human attraction and depicting it in an artistic way is not, their future seems somewhat bleak. But what Americans are doing is not at all right.I just can't believe that their movie rating system is not transparent and they are doing it without any help from psychologists and human behavioural experts and.. everything connected to big corporations! uh and it is disturbing to hear that pentagon has been doing the whitewashing of defence for decades and this reminds me about the violent fascist society depicted in verhoeven's starship troopers. All are happy! That really sucks. 'The sole superpower', 'the guardian of freedom and freespeech and human values' should do better. This documentary is well-crafted, depicting all relevant and truthful information and comparing to other systems in Europe and.. it really widened my horizon on negative impact of violence in media on society and the importance of the right/competitive people doing the job. Hail Sweden!! (have read an article about their rating system) everyone should see this. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most interesting aspect for this viewer was the observation that mainstream Hollywood product is now more regulated than a generation ago (Hal Ashbys Coming Home being cited as a film that would probably get lumbered with an NC17 now). That violence is treaty more leniently than sex/nudity is of course no shock as the whole tenor of Hollywoods output is "bang bang" rather than "kiss kiss".As a non American it seems to me that the classification system is real problem. In most countries there is no advisory aspect with regard to a rating, if its an 18 then you must be at least 18 and so on, whereas the rule that an R means a child can see a film of adult nature if accompanied means the classifiers always have one eye on the potential child with guardian.Change the R to a stricter 17+ rating and the emphasis can be switched and the NC17 dropped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is review-proof. This film is virtually unavailable.But "This Film Is Not Yet Rated" is 98 well-spent minutes and then some. Indeed, be sure to check out the Q&amp;A with the film's director, Kirby Dick, and the deleted scenes on the DVD, which I had to purchase online.Though it's as heavy-handed as anything from that dirty liberal, Michael Moore, "This Film Is Not Yet Rated" holds a mirror to the moral spotlight cast by the Motion Picture Association of America's ratings board.And, upon reflection, the film illuminates some rather nasty, un-American habits of that body, which slapped an NC-17 rating on this movie for depicting too many bodies in, shall we say, compromising positions.Dick splices his documentary in a disjointed way. Quick scenes of sex and violence from other films, including commentary from critics, industry insiders, attorneys and filmmakers, are coupled with a bizarre whodunit in this 2006 effort."This Film Is Not Yet Rated" swings from visually to verbally vulgar. Yet the movie's point is one any real American must embrace: there is no room for censorship ? of any kind ? in a democracy.But a room does indeed exist where anonymous persons make decisions about what you can see. Those decisions, the director and those he interviews conclude, are based on unbalanced views of sex and violence. In these United States, Dick says, violence is acceptable in films, but sex is not. He uses the MPAA's own Web site to affirm his statement. And he doesn't stop there.As questions of same-sex marriage arouse passions of another kind, "This Film Is Not Yet Rated" puts forth the idea that heterosexuality is rated differently than homosexuality.Around the time that the identities of the film raters and the MPAA's appeals board are revealed, it becomes clear the film is about freedom and the other side of that precious coin ? responsibility. Censors, those who sentence films ? good, bad and ugly ? to an NC-17 rating and box office death, try to pair freedom with security, which, not coincidentally, the voting public will see ad nauseam into November 2008.But filmmakers of questionable value and values forget the true price of freedom. They, too, are at fault."This Film Is Not Yet Rated" raises many questions and answers few. If nothing else, it continues the slow, steady chipping away of the hypocritically political right's crumbling moral pedestal. Of course, each blow causes a piece of stone-cold truth to hit the collective head of the chisel-holding, mallet-swinging left, leaving everyone dazed and confused.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am gay and, after viewing this documentary twice, I allege that there is bias. The comments and observations, in the film, seem to be subjective rather than objective. Most of the participants appear to be gay, pro-gay or, at the very least, heavily invested in sex. Do I think that obscene language and violence is given more credence than sex? Yes, but a film's content, including sex, is supposed to maintain the integrity of a script. Since the 1960's, the use of obscene language, sex, and violence has been on the increase. I do agree, however, that sex--and, particularly gay sex--is being censored. The use of animation and special effects, rather than an emphasis on acting, is also on the increase. Sadly, these things are being used to distract from the theme of a film, or to compensate for poor writing or poor direction. Additionally, no film should carry a message that its conveyance of ideas or concepts are right or wrong. The viewer should be allowed to decide for himself or herself. Up until a person is of legal age, the parent(s) has(have) the right to choose how little or how much content is acceptable or unacceptable. In order to determine what is acceptable or unacceptable, one has to differentiate between freedom and license. An individual should be allowed to decide, for himself or herself, what is freedom and what is license. But again, until a person is of legal age, the parent(s) has(have) the right to choose. As individuals, we can change ourself, but we cannot change someone else. Yet, John Waters is absolutely correct. A child will learn from life experiences. As a child, I was taught by my parents, but I learned (negative, positive, and in-between) from people out in the world. Even a protected child becomes an adult, and cannot be sheltered forever. Not if the child is to grow. And, in order to grow, a person must be vulnerable to risk. Hopefully, a person will choose wisely, but there is a consequence (negative, positive, or in-between) to every decision we make.Allegations should be proved--in court, if necessary--and in the changing of the law. If the allegations in this documentary can be proved--I, for one, would be more than willing to participate in a class-action suit. In order to effectively pursue an argument, one must be persuasive, and one must choose the proper forum. A media circus only causes chaos and confusion. One must choose right from wrong, and two wrongs never make a right.This is a 'must-see' documentary because it makes one think--and, for this reason, I rate the film a 10 out of 10. Think, use critical analysis, and decide for yourself.MPAA REFORM... www.ifc.com/video/Film/Festivals/Sundance/Sundance-2007/443670580</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As entertainment "This Film is Not Yet Rated" is good. It's fun, it's fast-paced, it's humorous, and the interviews conducted with the filmmakers often provide insight into the thought-process behind some of these NC-17 rated films and the scenes that caused them to be rated that way. As a documentary I'm inclined to say that "This Film is Not Yet Rated" is unbalanced, biased, and not entirely fair. Still, the film shies away from overt lies, 'evidence' that has already been proved to be false, or other similar methods of documentary film-making that have been popularized by Michael Moore, Morgan Spurlock, and other worthless, talentless directors like them."This Film is Not Yet Rated" is really far from captivating for someone familiar with the MPAA's rating system and how it works. I don't doubt that a lot of people like this movie simply because it is public reinforcement for their opinions. Essentially, what this film does is it takes the usual arguments against and for the MPAA and emphasizes one viewpoint over the other, treating the other as simply ridiculous. Is the position of the MPAA ridiculous? Perhaps. I certainly think it is, but if I was making a film about their rating system I would interview filmmakers who support the ratings system (some must exist), and maybe give members of the public a quick lecture on the system then ask them what they thought of it.Kirby Dick clearly hates the system so much he doesn't just want to make an exposé of the system itself, but also of the people behind it. I found this humiliating and unnecessary, and frankly a little immature; couldn't he have given the same stats on their ethnicity, marital status, and what age their children were without going to ludicrous lengths to capture these people on camera and interrupt their lives.A documentary about the MPAA has been due for a long time. 2006 was the year that one was finally delivered, alas it is a film that can only loosely be called a documentary. Succeeding as entertainment, thoroughly failing as a documentary "This Film is Not Yet Rated" is ultimately neither here nor there and completely forgettable.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A suggestion for documentary filmmakers: when you say you're not recording a conversation, perhaps you actually shouldn't be recording the conversation. At the very least, you may want to consider not presenting it in your film along with a split-screen view that features your subject speaking her half of the dialog in animated form. This approach does indeed make Joan Graves, head of the MPAA's Classification and Rating Administration, come off as officious at best and corrupted by power at worst. Is the fact that it's, let's face it, a bit of a nasty trick more or less significant than the fact that director Kirby Dick is pointing out things that we might want to know? Interesting question.I'd also argue that "This Film Is Not Yet Rated" would have been a stronger effort if it director had reined in some of its tangents. For instance, there's a scene in which the private investigator whom he's hired to identify the mysterious figures who comprise the ratings board discusses her lesbianism. Mr. Dick ties this into the question of whether the board is more lenient with films depicting heterosexual as opposed to homosexual sex -- which is certainly a question worth asking, but bringing a contractor's private life into it made the words "stay on target" spring inevitably to my mind. (Especially given that the directors of "Boys Don't Cry" and "But I'm a Cheerleader," among others, are already on hand to offer their perspectives.)I'd have to say that this one works better as agitprop-lite than as responsible documentary journalism. Kirby Dick is clearly having a lot of fun here -- and why make a film if you're not, after all -- but I suspect that he could have served his legitimately relevant cause somewhat better with a bit more focus and a bit more fairness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its an artifact of the artistic pipeline that movies have to be packaged a certain way. They have to be so and so long, and have such and such narrative content, whether fiction or various kinds or documentary. We accept this as if somehow it is natural, just as we accept flat walls and square corners as natural to rooms instead of the manufacturing pipeline.This restricts filmmakers profoundly, because instead of discovering something and finding the right container for it, you start with the container and fill it. If you don't have enough stuff, you invent more.What we have here is film ? a documentary ? that has all sorts of extra, irrelevant stuff in it. It is restricted thus. Ironically, it is about how the industry and its manufacturing process restricts films.First the damage in the thing, then the damage it speaks of.There's an interesting case here. Its about how a small number of large powerful studios control the ratings system to make it difficult for independent and artistic filmmakers to market their films. It happens to be a secret process that is apparently biased and highly subjective. That's the story, how corporations stifle art. Its less about the arbitrariness of the process than that this dynamic exists.But that's not enough to fill a movie, or at least the way this filmmaker sees it. So he makes the fact that the reviewers are secret the centerpiece. Does it matter that its these controlled yaboos rather than another set? No, not really, but the mystery associated with the secret hijacks the picture. But even that isn't enough to fill the movie in this fellow's mind. So we get some kerfluffle about the chase, some business about detectives and stakeouts. But even that isn't enough, so we discover something of the life of our detectives, who happen to be lesbian housewives.All this is poured into the film because the form constrains. And this guy didn't see it coming. Michael Moore.But the point is a good one, the ten minutes he spends on it. We do get amazingly homogenous product. It is profoundly "safe" if you don't worry about fostering the most violent major society on the planet; if you are obsessed with sex and nudity; if you lose sleep about otherness. On the other hand, you need a large, restrictive inside in order to have an outside. Not all art has to come from the apparently deviant, I suppose, and its hardly enough. But it does seem to help.Here's a greater unintended feedback effect. Hollywood films thrive on a notion of romance that's puritanically pure. Its essential to the industry. That excludes depictions of relationships that are more like real life, that include hair, smell, sweat, amazing fluids and little deaths. Defining that away strengthens the channel, which constrains the form, which this fellow follows blindly.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's time to rate this documentary. I will give it a passing grade. It was very informative.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm glad, this movie expose a lot of how the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) honestly works. I was always curious, on how they rate the suitability of films' themes and content for certain audiences through their G, PG, PG-13, R or NC-17 ratings. For the most part, I never really had too much of a problem with the MPAA system, because in my opinion, people will go see, their type of a movie, no matter what. Plus, it help the viewer choice what type of a movie, they want to see or not. Nevertheless, I do see, where the film rating can destroy a film's profitable. A good example of this, is when they rated a film, NC-17. I get that, theaters have the right to show, what films, they want to show. However, I don't get is why the MPAA is funded and controlled by the big film studios, when it shouldn't. It's allow more leeway, for them, to get the rated, they want, than what should be deserved. No wonder, why so many risky interdependent films are on this NC-17 list and how few studios films are. Another thing, I don't get about the NC-17 rating is how it was supposed to replace, the X rating; which by the 1970s and 1980s, became more known for films filmed by pornographers. At this point, its hold the same stigma, as the X rating. In my opinion, I see, no reason for them to even have that type of a rating any longer; since Rated R &amp; NC-17 is nearly the same thing. Yes, I get that the NC-17, is the rating that says no children will be admitted at all, even with Parental Guidance, but it's not their job to play the parents. After all, like I said before, if they really didn't want the film to be shown in their theater. They have the right, not to show it. As a thinking American, I do find the MPAA to be a little more strict, to sexuality-charge movies than films of mindless violence to be true. It's kinda weird, how normal, explicit violence is to Americans, compare to other countries, are more against violence, that, then explicit sexuality. It definitely speaks to a cultural difference between countries. There is a huge problem in America rating system, if they consider sex to be more graphic than violence. Then, the double standard, in how sex scenes that contain male nudity is more likely to be censored compared to female nudity. Also, how homosexual love scenes can cause higher content ratings compared to heterosexual love scenes, among others. It's pretty clear, that was the film is showing here, is indeed somewhat true. Directed by Kirby Dick, this documentary explores, how the MPAA acts in a very notorious corrupt way, by pointing out the examples, I mention here, through the use of talking head interviews and film clips. Because of the film's criticize of the entertainment industry, a lot of the filmmakers interview for this film, couldn't be, too honest, about the industry, nor would the films clips had the approvable of the studios that hold it. So, this prompted the filmmakers to invoke the fair use doctrine. Because of this concept, the film clips and interviews, had to limit to a few frames. It's also kinda funny that despite all their bitching about illegal copying of their own films, the MPAA admitted making digital copies of this documentary after it had been submitted for review, against their own. It's also funny, how this film originally got NC-17 rating by the MPAA for "some graphic sexual content.", but the film had changed dramatically from the time of the NC-17 rating, the film cannot be released with an MPAA rating without the film being resubmitted for review. Talk about outsmarting the MPAA. However, it's not the MPAA is totally evil like this movie, makes it out to be. In truth, its rating system is way better than the Hayes Code of the early 20th century which really limited artistic freedoms. We, as the modern audience are expose to a lot more, different types of movies with mature content; than our forefathers, were. Like, I said before, people will see a movie, no matter, what they say. Anyways, the film really fail to mention, some of the goods that MPAA does; such as allowing films to gain access to global markets, creating jobs, helping build technology &amp; innovation within the film industry, allowing a large research and report database to access to the public, as well, as protecting the audience from child pornography, animal abuse, and epilepsy actions, that potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. The way, they act like the MPAA is an over controlling censor board, is a bit overreaction. It's not like the MPAA is spying on the filmmakers. If anything, the way, Dick crew's use of private investigator Becky Altringer to unmask the identities of the ratings and appeals board members is a bit too disturbing and somewhat illegal. Also, the use of voice reenactment scenes like the one for Joan Graves, head of the Classification and Rating Administration for the Motion Picture Association of America seem, somewhat misleading. The movie fails to mention that MPAA also rates film trailers, print advertising, posters, and other media used to promote a film. Green, yellow, or red title cards displayed before the start of a trailer indicate the trailer's rating. Nor the film mention the controversial "R-Cards", which parents could obtain for their teenage children, under the age of 17, to see R-rated films without adult accompaniment. You would think that would be mention that. Overall: This movie was indeed very fun to watch. Very good insight in American censorship and media manipulation. A must-watch for anybody curious about how films are made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This documentary has been misrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this amusing little documentary after listening to a podcast that explained something about the shady dealings of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), and how almost the entire income of the American movie industry depends on their cooperation. I already learned that the MPAA is a very mighty organization, despite the fact that it is a completely voluntary system that movie studios and cinema franchises have universally adopted, and was only designed for classifying movies into categories as a guide to parents.The most entertaining parts of the documentary are the personal experiences of directors who tell about how their movies (initially) received the heaviest rating, the ubiquitously feared NC-17. In practice, this means that no major cinema will show it, no studio will advertise it, and hardly anyone will pay to see it. I am still puzzled by how a protracted sex scene, frontal nudity, homosexual love as well as a female orgasm in film will instantly restrict the movie to audiences of 17 and higher, whereas a violent death or a man being pleasured can be seen by any minor accompanied by an adult. However, if one thing becomes clear, it is that the MPAA is never in a hurry to explain their reasoning and motives.It is gradually revealed that the MPAA was founded by the six biggest movie studios, and as such, they go much easier on their movies than on independently produced films. As the movie went on, I felt myself swinging between amusement and indignation as the double standards of the MPAA are revealed, as well as their untouchable status, since all their dealings occur in strict anonymity. The official stance of the organization itself is to just staunchly defend this system without any logical reasoning or accountability, much the same way in which they rate movies.I am less convinced by the makers' attempts to track down and identify these anonymous MPAA members. All it amounts to is that we learn that most of them don't fit the job description given by the MPAA; by that time, we are already convinced that the MPAA is a non-transparent, corrupted organization with limited capacity for self-regulation. It would have been much more informative if the makers had interviewed these people, or at least documented (failed) attempts at that. I also missed the Michael Moore-style 'search for the root of the problem', where we could get some insight into where this inconsistent morale about sex and violence comes from.In the conclusion, which is a nice example of 'life imitating art', director Kirby Dick submits this movie to the MPAA, and immediately gets an NC-17 for 'sexual content', despite the fact that those scenes are very brief and merely illustrate his point. He is allowed to fight the decision for a board of appeal, but cannot use any scenes of other movies to defend himself, so he looses the appeal. Apparently the MPAA cannot handle a bit of criticism.Filmmaker John Waters aptly describes the conundrum by saying that the MPAA prides itself on not being a censorship organization. But since it has no official 'rulebook' on what movie content is acceptable for a given rating, there really is no other way for directors than to look at examples of others for guidance. Which is not allowed by the members, who always remain anonymous and only answer to the MPAA itself. Weird.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Filmmaker Kirby Dick takes on the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). It interviews filmmakers and film critics. Kirby hires private investigators to find the secretive film raters. He also has a couple of former raters who are willing to talk.This documentary definitely has a point of view. It has some insightful stuff about the MPAA. It's interesting to see how secretive the organization is. The movie is one-side. I can't blame it on Kirby because I doubt MPAA would be any more forthcoming in any case. Kirby takes a bit too much glee in a couple of scenes. There is a Canadian movie from inside a ratings agency called "My Tango with Porn". There are some interesting insights like the clergy and film corporate insiders in the appeals board. Some very interesting filmmakers are sticking their necks out. This is by no means complete. There are some assertions that are a little more precarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrific documentary on film censorship, This Film is Not Yet Rated takes a look at the MPAA the organization who give films its ratings. Director Kirby Dick interviews some prominent filmmakers who have had their films certified with unwanted ratings due to the amount of explicit content in their films. The film shares the points of view of the filmmakers and gives us insight into how unfair the rating system really is. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and it does a great job at telling the story from the point of view of the people that make the films. For me, I think it's preposterous for someone to tell me what I can, and cannot watch. As you get older, you realize that film is an art form, and how wonderful films can be. By censoring them and telling the filmmakers they have to cut their work, the MPAA waters down, and in many ways destroy the intention and goal for the filmmaker to entertain its audience. Films should be uncompromising and many movies out there are tasteless, extreme and offensive, but the best judge of what to watch is you. This Film is Not Yet Rated is an eye opening film and it should be seen by every film lover. This is a near perfect documentary that finally tells the side of the filmmakers and how the MPAA butchers their art. Brilliant, funny and at times unfair in the sense that one organization has practically given themselves the right to judge what is best for us to watch, This Film is Not Yet Rated is a well crafted must see documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Heck with Hollywood...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the documentary THE HECK WITH Hollywood, we see some truly Independent filmmakers thumbing their collective noses at The Establishment. Good or Forgettable, they forge ahead with their movies and get them done. One can't help but admire (and envy) them. I'm also frankly surprised that, given the mind-boggling strides made in the past two decades in technology, that we haven't seen MORE filmmakers like them: the abortive COST of making movies is no longer the impediment it used to be- the coast is clear for one and all. Just the other day, I watched another in the endless line of no-budget zombie movies being cranked out by budding amateurs on the internet and one thing was obvious: with just a little time to refine their skills, these people could be talented movie makers... if they keep at it. (I've already seen some of these productions that fall just short of surpassing actual big budgest Studio films: maybe it's time the Studios invested in some of these aspiring Internet movie makers...) The only problem I have with THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED is that it deals exclusively with Sexual content. I would've been interested to see a closer examination of why movies like George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD were forced to go out without an MPAA rating (not that it really matters- certainly not in THIS day and age-, but it was a very Big Deal back when the movie was first released and it wasn't even afforded the benefit of the doubt like MARK OF THE DEVIL, which was released with an unprecedented V for Violence). To the credit of the documentarians, however, were the startling revelations that the members of the MPAA consisted of Right Wingers and- the biggest shock of all, to me- Religious Leaders. (Which still doesn't explain why DAWN OF THE DEAD was singled out for its Content: there was no nudity- a momentary shot of a woman's breast doesn't really count-, just the Violence that the MPAA has always preferred... although perhaps a tad more PRONOUNCED than in your average pre-DAWN OF THE DEAD Hollywood killfest...) Now that the kid gloves are off, it's time for movie makers to step up and really DO something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is an eye opener. I feel everyone passionate about film needs to watch this. I agree that some films get unfair ratings, and the appeal process goes in the MPAA's favor. There are films that have way better messages than other movies, and the films with a great message are what should be watched by people. I'm not saying raunchy comedies shouldn't be watched by people, I do laugh at those movies, but I know movies that don't get a wide release that deserve it. I really liked the interviews with directors who had their film edited not what they wanted. I think that movies with nudity deserve a R rating depending on what is shown, but if you give a movie with a sex scene with two characters that love each other an NC-17 and movie characters having sex with prostitutes an R, then what is wrong you. I think this documentary is great which is why it gets a 10/10. If you get a chance to see it, watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable, Childish, And Shockingly Informative. A Few Words That Describe The Subjects Of Kirby Dick's Documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched "This Film Is Not Yet Rated" about 3-4 times now in the space of 2 months, and every time I find myself wishing to hear more stories of just how ridiculous the MPAA's methods really are. I can understand the somewhat secrecy for the raters of your organisation (Everyone is entitled to a private life), but to then be told that there are still existing members working way beyond the 3-7 years of allotted employment baffles me. To not even follow your own protocols makes me question your methods overall, and the many film-makers director Kirby Dick interviews certainly have engaging and absurd experiences to share.The documentary follows Kirby's efforts in trying to figure out how the Motion Picture Association of America works, when the organisation remains one of the secretive corporations around. His efforts involves hiring the help of a private detective, and some thoroughly engaging stories from many directors both famous and independent. Films containing homosexual behaviour are more likely to be rated NC-17 than R, surprising levels of violence are OK and sex is not. You can also appeal your movie for a lower rating, but cannot refer to any other movies in your defence.The parts with the private detective leads to some wonderful discussions, yet I cannot help but feel that part of it feels fabricated. What is surprising however, is that both manage to unveil an exceptional amount of information regarding who is censoring what and how the MPAA is in bed with many surprising production companies. The Kimberley Pierce stuff is riveting, and there's plenty of humour to be had among everyone involved.Final Verdict: I don't really want to spoil it, but it is highly recommended. Ironically it received an NC-17, and the MPAA made copies against the directors wishes. Kirby's efforts are not in vain and no stone is left unturned. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this on a whim because I heard it mentioned and decided I wanted to check it out. I'm glad I did. I've always been interested in the MPAA and their ratings, and I have heard controversies involving them before, and this movie really brings it all to light.The movie essentially interviews film makers and talks about just how silly the whole MPAA is. They have no specific guidelines to how they rate the films, and constantly are biased against films that contain, say, gay sexual content or sexual content that is focused on female pleasure. A straight sex scene that gets an R rating for a film can be the exact same as a gay sex scene but that movie would get an NC17 because there seems to be a lot of discrimination about those kinds of topics. It really just pisses you off to see this kind of stuff going on. The movie also has a kind of side plot where the director hires an investigator to find out the names of the people who rate the films since their names are withheld by the MPAA. These scenes are pretty funny and are enjoyable to watch. I'd say that if you are a fan of films or a film maker, you should check this out because it gives a really good insight into the ridiculous world of the MPAA rating system.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never been so amazed by a documentary that was so informative yet so consistently entertaining. This is must-see for filmmakers who want to get their film rated someday. The film has no boundaries, it expresses the brutal truth about the MPAA and their unconstitutional hypocrisy with the way they regulate their sometimes confusing rules.So many flawed inconsistencies with this system when it comes down to violence vs. sexual content and the fact that the ratings board is completely anonymous. If your movie has a bunch of deaths without the presence of blood &amp; gore, it gets a PG-13. Yet if there is harsh profanity with some nudity and/or even the slightest implied sexual material, it gets an R. It also points out the issues of independence vs. studios. For example, if you're an independent filmmaker and you get a rating that you're unhappy with like NC-17 (a.k.a. box office poison), they don't tell you what to cut out. However, if you're backed by a studio and you run into the same situation, they'll give you notes on what to re-edit. Matt Stone was right, the MPAA makes most of their money from the six major studios who keep them in business and pay their bills.In conclusion, if you are interested in learning more information about the Motion Picture Association of America and have 90 minutes to spare, give it a watch and see the pros &amp; cons behind one of Hollywood's biggest secrets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always interesting to see a documentary about movies especially important ones but This Film Is Not Yet Rated isn't as dangerous as it's trying to make itself seem. Although it does have some serious moral implications as Kirby hires a private investigator to find out who are the anonymous members of the MPAA. The investigation is attempted to be presented in a cinematic way with reaction shots and closeups and all the coverage a film should have to be edited together, but its attempt feels contrived and unconvincing due to it being shot on DV. It attempts to be entertainment with caper music and graphics but this just takes away the sincerity. There were times when I struggled to agree with either side of the filmmaker vs. ratings arguments as all it seemed to be was merely a power struggle. However, when it got into the specificity of the details it had some interesting points, such as the implications of sex vs. violence and how sex is accused of hurting society more than violence, particularly homosexual sex. As well as how with guns shooting people with no blood is considered more acceptable than shooting people with blood and how the position of the camera for sex scenes that implicates thrusting is more acceptable than when it shows the trusting. It had a great payoff in the end as its conspiracy is revealed and the intentions behind the documentary are justified but the packaging does hold it back.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I made sure to read both side of the arguments for and against this movie before posting my own personal review and I must say, it's obvious that people have a hug problem with their own bodies. You will read a series of arguments saying that this movie is asking to have our children of six or seven years of age walk into a theater and watch hardcore pornography. What they fail to realize is how much an NC-17 rating destroys a film's budget.This movie makes an extremely valid argument that despite our supposed first amendment rights here in the United States, we have a secondary form of censorship. That is to say, the financial form. Taking a look at the MPAA's rating system they immediately uncover the moral duplicity involved in rating a film. From the difference between an adolescent male masturbating into an apple pie, and a fully clothed female masturbating to curb a homosexual desire.Our constant filtration of simple sexual acts that most humans figure out by their thirteenth birthday (with the rest realized by their seventeenth) is pointed out. The filmmakers interviewed are all victims of this biased rating system allowing them to voice the reasons behind certain scenes in their movies.I suggest this movie to anyone who would like to see how our First Amendment is held up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an investigation into the membership and methodology by which the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) reaches decisions about ratings for films in the United States.The MPAA will not disclose the names of the members who rate the films, saying only that they are parents of kids. There is a lot of inconsistency in the manner in which ratings are given to films and director Kirby Dick in this film addresses those inconsistencies, speaking to many directors about their dealings with the MPAA. Some of the revelations by the directors are quite interesting and speak to the seeming arbitrariness by which the MPAA operates. Kimberly Peirce ("Boys Don't Cry") is particularly poignant about the different treatment toward a woman dressed to pass as a woman in her film as opposed to more tolerant treatment toward a woman experiencing a similar sexual experience in other films. Kevin Smith speaks of why the MPAA rated his film an NC-17 and it is because Liv Tyler's character in his movie expresses pleasure from sex. Dick discloses the number of directors who have been forced to change NC-17 into R-rated films and it is a who's who of directors.If a film receives an NC-17 rating, it will have difficulty securing distribution or advertising-essentially ensuring that the film will be an economic failure. In retaining the ability to make directors change their films, the MPAA under the leadership of Jack Valenti and then his successor together with deputy Joan Graves, head of the ratings board (and very handsomely compensated), the organization seems like a willing handmaiden to the studio system in the United States. Even more byzantine and moralistic is the appeals board to which a filmmaker reaches out if he or she is unhappy with his/her rating. That board includes two members of the clergy who do not vote, but who are present nonetheless for the appeals from filmmakers as to why their film shouldn't be rated NC-17 and the board's subsequent response to their appeal. The presence there seems like a not-so-subtle message from the MPAA to filmmakers. It turns out that the appeal board members are even more invested in retaining the power of studios to control the messages conveyed by filmmakers in that all the members are important figures within the film business.For Dick, more annoying is the fact that the identities of the MPAA members are kept secret. This is done, allegedly, in order to immunize the members from outside pressure. This point seems to be undercut by the fact that during the film board members are reported to be speaking with studios about how to get a certain rating. And Dick learns that, contrary to the claims of the MPAA, the board ratings members are not parents of kids-for whose benefit the MPAA supposedly works. In any case, Dick hires an investigative company to attempt to identify the members of the MPAA which rates films. The MPAA comes off as small-minded and Napoleonic in its use of power arbitrarily to serve the power of the studios for whom it was essentially created. Dick makes an entertaining and insightful film and is very enterprising in wheedling out the identities of the MPAA rating board. All in all, this is a fairly entertaining expose of the myopia and secrecy of the MPAA.</fullReview>

It's definitely a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I have always been a film nut and everything about the movies has drawn my attention, the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) is one of those things that has fascinated me even though I didn't understand it. Movies like Jaws received PG rating. I remember Clockwork Orange being rated X; it was always a mystery what those ratings board guys were thinking. Kirby Dick's film This Film Is Not Yet Rated tries to explore how the ratings were figured in the past and how the MPAA is working in today's film world.The documentary is about the once corrupt MPAA and also and education on the procedures or rules that are applied to movies in order to obtain a rating for them. Director Kirby Dick apparently figures that he is teaching a classroom or making a 16mm how to film instead of making a documentary film for adults and film enthusiasts. Unfortunately his directing style is just too juvenile for such a savvy audience and had he stuck to just a boring talking head style documentary the film would have been better for it. This film takes on a lot of complaints against the MPAA board and tries to explain them rather than taking on definitions of the MPAA and its purpose head on. The members of the MPAA are anonymous as to keep feature filmmakers from appealing to them directly. Originally the ratings was the way to keep government from censoring the movies and Hollywood, but at least the government would have created solid rules to follow rather than the random and often conflicting way the early MPAA handled the film industry. The MPAA insists that it applies its rules evenly but the procedures are secret so nobody can tell what they are. If something is not allowed it is simply against the invisible rules.There is some good work in the film. Not a lot of history and not a lot of making sense of the nonsense, but some good work. There is Matt Stone from Southpark, Kimberly Peirce (Boys Don't Cry), Wayne Kramer (The Cooler), Allison Anders (Grace of My Heart), John Waters (Hairspray). While there is interest, especially to film geeks everywhere, the storytelling needs some censoring of its own. There is also a bit of one-sidedness the the film which is to be expected from any documentary except when that one side needs the other to hold the attention of the audience. After watching This Film is Not Yet Rated you'll no doubt be mulling the questions of censorship, government involvement in the Hollywood machine, how power can be misused and all that big machine power sort of stuff. Or you may more likely be wondering why this movie wasn't any better with such a topic to be trounced. ** The poster holds my attention and not because of the naked model. In some, if not all, the postings of this advertisement the butt has had to be censored by a black box. Sometimes the irony does make its way through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good hard look at the MPAA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the film takes a good hard look at the MPAA and its conflicts of interest, view of self-importance, and the effect that they have on U.S. culture.When a film receives an NC-17 from the MPAA several of the largest movie chains will not run the film - plain and simple. This rating also keeps the film from being advertised on the major networks. So an NC-17 is a box office curse. The MPAA "is in bed with" several of the major studios which is actually a conflict of interest and the Federal Government should take a close look at this.Filmmakers can put most anything into an NC-17 film but when simulated sex is seen as worse then shooting, burning and torturing people (see Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull) is rated PG-13. Also, check out Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End, also rated PG-13, when 24 people are hanged in the first three minutes of the film including a boy that looks to be about 9 years old - and this one is a Disney Film.Something is very wrong with a society that glorifies and approves violence for kids but hides sex (something natural for humans) and this film takes an honest look at this issue. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As one who works in the film business, i found this movie just one more terrifying glimpse into the politics behind censorship. the film brilliantly and very humorously stabs at the censor machine, and while some points are harder to agree to than others and occasionally waiver in their message, the overall theme comes roaring through. Brilliance, and a must see for everyone who believes in the freedom of expression and is opposed to censoring the arts. The fact that the film itself would not cater to the MPAA guidelines shows true bravery and shows some amazing bravery by those who would speak and appear on camera. Its scary how much we take for granted with movies, and how arbitrary the rules to 'protect our children" really are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Infuriating would be the word to describe Kirby Dick's eye-opening and upbeat documentary about the unfair practices of the top-secret members of the MPAA Film Ratings board. Personally, the film infuriated me because I want to be a filmmaker when I grow up, and this film gave me a preview of the kind of bullshit I'll have to put up with when I do. Basically the documentary shows how the MPAA rates a movie and their abuse of the NC-17 kiss of death which a great deal of extraordinary indie films receive every year. In the film, Kirby Dick interviews such filmmakers as John Waters, Kevin Smith, Atom Egoyan, Matt Stone, Kimberly Pierce, Jamie Babbit, and such stars of these dreaded 'NC-17' films like Maria Bello. I won't spoil the film for you by telling you anymore. Although it isn't by any means the best documentary I've seen, it's one of the most surprisingly engaging documentaries I've seen in recent years, and an ABSOLUTE must-see for anyone involved or interested in the film industry.

		<shortDescription>Lively, interesting documentary about double standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Film-maker Kirby Dirk investigates the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America), the self-appointed ratings board who give certificates to films shown to the American public. Who are these shadowy figures who decide what people can and cannot watch? And why don't they follow any set guidelines to base their decisions on? And why, to Americans, is sex censored more heavily than violence? On this last note with my plot summary, I must note the reverse effect the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) has and indeed European films in general have, which is that we're a lot more liberal with sex but more anal retentive when it comes to violence. A lot of the action films I buy I try to order on Region 1 from overseas because of all the cuts our censors make to them. It's an interesting observation on the different attitudes and hang-ups we have to what's shown on screen compared to our friends across the pond.Dick has struck a fine balance with this film, moving it along with a lively, humorous edge mixed in with some of the more taboo stuff that is shown. He charts the history of the MPAA with the profound effect it came to have on the American public over the years, while failing to flinch when portraying it's hypocrisy and double standards in it's certification of films.Overall, then, a well worth seeing documentary that delivers on all cylinders. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie, but incomplete.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie needed to be made, because the MPAA rating system is inconsistent, reflective of upper-class conservative morality, stifling artistic freedom, bigoted, corrupt, and unjustly favoring large studios, which are its financiers and main clients at the same time. At the same time, it's pervasive and unquestioned by the vast majority of people, so a movie that gets the word out about this institutionalized hypocrisy, and that educates people about its mechanisms, history, objectives, and consequences is an important contribution.And that is what this movie does, and it does it brilliantly, with sincerity and humor at the same time, exposing the MPAA and the people working for it.There is one question, however, that receives only a partial treatment, but which at least I felt needed more focus to complete the argument, and that is this: Given the fact that the MPAA (unlike the FCC in broadcasting) is not a government institution that executes law, but rather an industry organization that slaps a pretty much arbitrary label on the products of that industry, how exactly is its power constituted? The answer is of course complex, and is only touched on a few times in the film. There are theaters, distributors, advertising which take these ratings into account, often under the control or at least the strong influence of the studios. But there are also the viewers themselves, the people that feed this apparatus with their money---how much power do the ultimate customers have over the ratings? If the workings of the MPAA are not immediately accountable to the public, can we nevertheless use our power as consumers of the end product to either induce them to apply a more meaningful set of criteria or become irrelevant? What would it take for us to make that happen? Yet, a movie need not contain a "grassroots call to action" to be a relevant piece of film making, and neither does this one. It's informative, engaging, and entertaining---what else can one ask of a movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the film industry gets a much needed kick in the butt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kirby Dick's documentary "This film is not yet rated" is a pointed, slanted, slightly scattered examination of the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America), those fine folks who deliver arbitrary ratings to the movies. What the film uncovers is that the MPAA is a highly secret organization with a ratings board made up of a group of people whose identities are even kept from filmmakers "slapped" with the oft-dreaded NC-17 rating. Well, the members of this elite group are unknown until now. "This film is not yet rated" works two story lines. One is a straight-forward documentation of the history of the MPAA, with interviews with a number of independent filmmakers as well as a sampling of some of the edgier films that got stuck with an NC-17 rating and their similar mainstream counterparts that slipped through with an R. Many filmmakers were uncomfortable discussing the MPAA on camera, thus explaining the lack of representation by mainstream filmmakers. The other storyline involves the filmmaker's attempt to unearth the identities of the main players behind the scenes in the MPAA. The film Kirby Dick creates from these approaches is unsettling, as well as highly entertaining. It reminds the viewer that the film industry may often seem trivial and peripheral to the real world, but it is in fact rife with a political landscape demanding a watchful eye as might be given the folks in Washington D.C.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether you're a casual moviegoer or a die-hard cinephile, you may have always suspected that something was wrong with the MPAA's ratings system. How the most extreme acts of violence can get a free pass as compared to the most passionate, beautiful, natural sex scene ever filmed. How certain kinds of sex and the way it is portrayed on-screen can breeze by the ratings board, while others end up on the cutting room floor, not to be seen again unless they crop up as 'extras' on a DVD. How sometimes a movie can be stamped with an NC-17 when people aren't even doing anything sexual, but just having a frank discussion about it.Well, director Kirby Dick wants you to forget about everything you THINK you know, and show you what the h*** is really going on with his scathingly funny documentary, THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED. By means of the efforts of a private investigator and interviews with several top directors, whose projects have all had run-ins with the MPAA's mysterious rulings and even more shadowy board members, he shows in hilarious and infuriating fashion, how the MPAA is truly a censorship body, no matter how much the Powers-That-Be attest to the contrary, (and that means YOU, Jack Valenti).As caustically sarcastic and unashamedly biased as anything Michael Moore has ever produced, you have to admire Dick's passion and focus. He's a man on a mission, out to expose one of the worst cases of Hollywood's blatant hypocrisy and cronyism, and for the most part he definitely achieves his intended goal. But equally as effective, if not moreso, are the conversations he has with directors Atom Egoyan (WHERE THE TRUTH LIES), Kimberly Peirce (BOYS DON'T CRY), Kevin Smith (CLERKS) and John Waters (PECKER, A DIRTY SHAME), who reveal through their own experiences and anecdotes, how dealing with a regulating entity that shares not one creative brain cell amongst its members, can alter and even destroy the artistic integrity of how movies are made and presented, changing the movie-going experience in ways you may have never even considered! No matter who you are or what kind of filmgoing habits you have, THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED is definitely required viewing.</fullReview>

Don't expose your children to sex because it is REAL and they have far more access to it than a hand grenade or an M-16.We all have genitals! Eegads. You can see the problem. The movie industry is showing people having sex. This is far easier to achieve than re-enacting a scene from The Terminator.America was founded on Religious principles. There is no getting around it. For the rating board to have clergy on the appeal board it is utterly absurd.I do understand that there must be some limits to what is shown in mainstream films. I object to the way it is carried out and by WHOSE standards films are rated.Regulating morality is dicey and I'm not saying I would be better at it.

		<shortDescription>Capitalism goes to the movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kirby Dick's entertaining movie about film classification in America tells us many things that are wrong with the system. Firstly, it is shrouded in needless secrecy; secondly, it is more concerned with sex than violence; thirdly, that violence is oddly considered preferable if not depicted as shocking; fourthly, the "orthodox" sex is preferred to "aberant" behaviour; and fifthly, that the classification board makes a pretence of not censoring just classifying, although in practice the movie industry (of which it is part) only distributes films with a certain classification. Indeed, this is the real point: that the board exists to protect the interests of the industry (and remember, just 7 companies control 90% of the U.S. media), a point made most clearly by the fact that no child behaviourists are involved in rating films, presumably because the industry doesn't care whether or not its product actually damages children, just whether it is perceived to do so. Not every point in 'This Movie is Not Yet Rated' is right on the mark, but there's so much material available that the target is almost impossible to miss. It's an important film, I think; although, given the inexorable power of monopolistic capitalism, perhaps a forlorn one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The plot to censor what America sees</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember as a child that all films I saw were approved by my parents. There was no MPAA, so they went by the Catholic Church's rating system. I wanted to see Otto Preminger's new film "Hurry Sundown." I had a big blowout with my father because it was "Condemned" by the Church. He gave in, I saw the movie, and, while I really do not remember the details, I can safely say that there was nothing earth shattering in the film. Maybe they said something about the Church and that is why it was condemned; I really don't remember.The next year the MPAA was started and this film really exposes what this board is all about. It is censorship, pure and simple.The most amazing thing that was disclosed in the film was the fact that the MPAA is misogynistic. Any film showing a woman enjoying sex will be rated strictly. It is also homophobic. gay sex will get you in big trouble.I was greatly troubled about the fact that they have no sense of context. A film about the military is judged harshly for language and drug use. As a retired service member that has war service, I can assure you that the language of soldiers is raw and there is drug use. These are facts of life that should not be censored.I was also troubled greatly by the fact that it is OK to show all the violence you want as long as there is no blood. What kind of message are we sending to children? This film does a great service and should be seen by anyone who enjoys movies and cares about the process. The examples and discussion throughout with actors and filmmakers was stupendous.And, oh yes, the Catholic Church is still there involved in the process making sure that we don't see anything they disapprove of. It's a cinch that there won't be any realistic movies about pedophile priests.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spy documentary of MPAA rating mysteries.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The MPAA is the organization responsible for those ratings we see -- PG, PG-13, R, NC-17. Oh, did I forget 'G'? Seems that anything that is 'G' doesn't need to be rated. But I digress. The MPAA has a secret membership of parents with children under 17. These paid members watch movies submitted for a rating, and pass on their judgement. The filmmakers have no way to know who these raters are, have no way to question them about their opinions, or to explain why a rating might be wrong.Well, some of the secrets are out now. This film uses the interview technique with well-known actors, directors, and others in the film industry. All of them of course support the view that "censorship" imposed by the MPAA is out of control and, instead of helping to protect children, actually are there to support their sponsors' need to get theatrical releases into theaters with big audiences.But it also uses a private detective who, through a number of ways, including license plate numbers, secret video cameras, going through trash, and calling to ask "innocent" questions, shows us who the raters are. And, we find that many of them do not have children under 17, and some have no children at all. We also find out that the "appeals" are heard by industry executives, plus two ministers, a Methodist and a Catholic.It is all very strange. The movie is fairly well done, but most of the reason to see it is to learn how the MPAA ratings work. The film itself was submitted for a rating, and it came back as 'NC-17'. Naturally!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an intriguing, informative documentary. I've always thought the U.S. movie rating system was inconsistent and flawed?blood-soaked, gory movies dating back to 1980 ("Friday the 13th") get away with R ratings, while movies that contain one or two intense sex scenes between consenting adults gets the "X" or now "NC-17." The MPAA is a basically clandestine organization made up of ultra-conservative, most likely extremely Christian, Republicans, and was created by a former member of the Johnson administration (Jack Valenti). The fact that the identities of the raters is kept hush-hush, that their headquarters in LA resemble the CIA building in Langley in looks, and security, reveals all?why is this association so veiled in secrecy? The movie implies that the raters had gotten their jobs through cronyism, and are highly paid?to watch movies all day. There are certainly parallels to their counterparts in Washington DC. A group created to protect youngsters from adult-oriented movies like "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf," "Midnight Cowboy," and "Bonnie and Clyde" has become extremely politicized. The very existence of the MPAA seems rather irrelevant in this day and anyway?kids can surely see R-rated movies because of those difficult-to-monitor 25-screen multiplexes and easily rented DVDs. And cable TV and the Internet have exposed the same kids that the MPAA (ridiculously and idealistically) is trying to protect to material far worse than what is in any NC-17 movie. But who would want to give up those cushy, high paying jobs as MPAA raters? And Valenti and his successors must relish the power they hold in the liberal Hollywood community. The documentary could have contained more history of the rating system, and an explanation of how the "X" rating came into existence and why it was replaced with the "NC-17" (the X was never an MPAA-approved rating and in fact any filmmaker, even today, can apply an X rating to their movie). Director Kirby Dick hires a private investigator to attempt to reveal the identities of the raters, and she is largely successful. Perhaps the most incredible thing about this movie is what Dick goes through while attempting to get HIS movie rated. The out-of-touch idealism, extreme conservatism, bureaucracy, and borderline fascist ways of the MPAA are confirmed while Dick tries to get his movie an R rating (he ended up releasing it unrated, which is actually the best alternative?and a rather brilliant one, considering the subject of his movie). Interviews with actors like Maria Bello and directors like John Waters, Kevin Smith and Matt Stone emphasize the hypocrisy of the MPAA: Graphic violence and disgusting "teen humor" are OK, and get Rs, yet healthy, grown up sex, sex played for laughs by puppets ("Team America"), or same-sex sex scenes are instant NC-17 material. At one time, there must have been more liberal-leaning members of the MPAA. Some ex raters are interviewed in the film. I've often wondered how certain movies of the '70s and '80s got away with their ratings: Graphic sex scenes in "Coming Home, "An Officer and a Gentleman" and "9 ? Weeks" give the movie R ratings, when they surely would get NC-17s today. And foul language, nudity, and (in some cases) drug usage in PG movies like "Hair," "A Soldier's Story" and "Sixteen Candles" would get Rs today (not even PG-13s). The current trend of re-rating "Director's Cuts" of PG-rated '80s movies like "Amadeus" and "Cinema Paradiso" tells all-the director's versions contain some nudity, and God forbid our kids are exposed to natural female nudity. So once PG-rated movies are now stamped with "Rs." It is really infuriating. Be sure to watch the Q &amp; A with Kirby Dick on the DVD; he is a very entertaining filmmaker. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

It is indeed censorship, but it is hiding behind the fact that the government itself doesn't control it. But what most people don't understand is that the MPAA has so much power in government that it is practically the same thing. For instance (spoiler!), the Apple company has one lobbyist in DC who uses a rented office. The MPAA has a whole building. With that information, it was clear that what I already knew was only scratching the surface.For someone who fears censorship and monopoly-like power, this film was disturbing. There is so much going on here that I can't even write it all out. See the movie.

		<fullReview>This film consists of interviews with directors and actors, archival footage of public events, and clips of what the MPAA considers questionable taste from mostly recent movies. It's position is clearly a First Amendment one. That's my position too. And the movie is really funny.The MPAA rating board is a secret organization that determines who gets to see a picture, guides the judgment of potential viewers, or whether the film is shown at all. One clergyman who attends the screenings says, "Jack Valenti wanted this to be a totally transparent process but decided it would be bad to broadcast it to the public." The "investigative team" who start to dig into the process are good-natured, cheerful, iconoclasts, including a couple of lesbians. They try to film the nameless board members who leave for lunch, then follow them into fast-food joints and try to film them on spy cameras and engage them in conversation. Wearing latex gloves, they steal the garbage bags of film raters at night and poke through them trying to get some idea of what goes through their heads. The whole thing is carried out like a CIA operation. And that's what this film is about -- the investigation itself, and the attempt that follows to get a rating for the film about the investigation.I don't know that there's all that much new here. We already know that some people in audiences are liable to imitate certain actions they see on the screen. (Rape has a higher reenactment quotient than, say, blowing one's self up in a crowded place.) We know that our ratings are far tougher on sex than on violence, and tougher on gay sex than straight. We know that the emphasis in Europe is pretty much the opposite. We know that people making films usually throw in one or two sops that they know ahead of time will be rejected by the raters, so the raters can feel that they're doing their jobs. (Orson Welles did the same thing with Citizen Kane.) We also know, though the film doesn't tell us, that there's a lot more to the relationship between media and behavior than just copycatting. Canadian border cities like Vancouver, BC, get the same programming that American cities like Vancouver, WA, get -- and Canada has more guns per capita too -- and yet the homicide rate in BC is minuscule compared to that of Washington.Some of the funniest material comes from clips that show what has been deliberately sacrificed to the censors. I forget the title of the film it comes from, but one scene has an animated Ken and an equally animated Barbie engaged in sexual acts. The raters allowed a missionary position and a Barbie-on-top but required the deletion of Ken and Barbie going down on one another, anal intercourse, ondinism, and corpraphilia. You haven't seen ANYTHING until you've seen Barbie trying to dump on Ken's eager, smiling face. (I can't stop laughing.) John Waters is prominent among the many talking heads, contributing his invaluable and fulgurating insights. On the other side is Jack Valenti, grinning amiably and lying into the camera about the board members ("just ordinary people"), one of whom lives in a multi-million-dollar mansion.Can you imagine the job these people have to do? They sit there and watch movies all day long, keeping an eye open particularly for sexy parts, actually counting the number of f*** and m*********** words used? And to get PAID for it? And then to pass JUDGMENT on exactly how filthy a film is? It's enough to make the rotted corpse of Anthony Comestock push its way out of the grave and come crashing through the doors, demanding a seat and a pencil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's okay to enjoy sex....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie just reinforces the current belief, in our new, "enlightened" century, that it is all right with the perverts...excuse me, I mean the conservative right--to show a heterosexual white man in a movie enjoying sex, and such films will get a PG-13 or R rating, but a straight woman...or two women...or two men...doing the same in a film will get an NC-17. What's more, violence with blood, guts and gore can get a PG-13. So the message is: it's all right to kill a (female, lesbian or gay) cop, but don't let her/him enjoy her/his husband/partner f**king her/him. . .What a f'ed up society we live in in the "good ol' US of A!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good job, lousy investigators.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good documentary on a subject not often addressed in film, but often discussed on IMDb. The interviews with producers and and directors are very enlightening. Much easier to watch than other documentaries, especially with the film clips used as examples.BUT...they hired some lousy private investigators to try to identify the members of the Rating Boards. I've been a private investigator and I'd be embarrassed to do the crappy job for the length of time these investigators work on this case. It's like amateur night at a club. How did these women get their licenses? Sad to say, I think that there must have been two reasons they were selected: (1) they allow the director and a cameraman to come along on stakeouts, which is a huge no-no in the real world, and (2) they are lesbians themselves, which adds some emphasis to the film's hypothesis that gay sex scenes are rated more harshly than straight scenes.With that aside, give this film a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would probably have given this film higher marks if Kirby Dick were as skilled an essayist as he was a filmmaker. Technically the film flows well and the graphics are well produced, sound, music, etc. all top notch. I found the investigation scenes fairly exciting in the light hearted way they were presented.Where the filmmaker fails is in establishing a compelling argument. He does bring in some question about the quality of the ratings in light of other films. However, he tries to make a point about sex being judged harsher than violence, then produces paperwork from the garbage of the ratings board proving the opposite. He interviews a filmmaker who's upset about an "R" rating his film received, yet as a parent I would absolutely not wish to have my child view this unaccompanied (nor any of the other war atrocities he cites).I also feel it is a slight invasion of privacy to out people on the ratings board and publish personal information of this nature. I realize the argument is for "transparency," and the filmmaker feels that full disclosure is necessary. However, this outing only makes sense if the filmmaker were also willing to make the same disclosures about himself and EVERYONE ELSE WITH A VESTED INTEREST IN HIS MOVIE. Let's be transparent if someone is trying to make a statement.One main area upon which I agree is criteria for ratings. With the old "Hays Code" there were certain items that weren't allowed. I think if filmmakers were provided with a list of what will guarantee an "R" or "NC-17" than that would go a long way to solving the problem. I also agree with Kevin Smith that the MPAA is way to soft on violence towards women.Again, another nice try to make several points. Not all of them stuck. Next time I would recommend making only the points that do. I think Michael Moore's movies would benefit from that approach as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give is a good rating for the informational value, but man, this makes me mad. my outrage comes from the use of the word "censorship." these filmmakers claim that the mpaa censors their movies because filmmakers want PG-13 or R ratings so they can make more money, and the mpaa is denying them the ability to get rich. but no filmmaker claims that they are forced to make movies a certain way or is denied the ability to put their vision on film: they only complain that an NC-17 rating will keep them from making more money. I don't always agree with the ratings applied to films, but I support the system, even as secretive as it is. These people want oversight so they can complain more effectively. If they really want to be effective, all these directors and producers should boycott the mpaa completely and then when there are no rated films released and theaters are forced to show the same movies over and over and lose money, they will finally accept unrated films. But it's all about money. nobody is denying anybody their right to make whatever film they want. But when you want to distribute your film and get people to pay you for your product, you need to follow the rules. same as when you bake some cookies: you take them to work and nobody cares what's in them, but try to sell them at the grocery store and now you need to put the ingredients on the label and list the calories. it's the same thing. shut up and play by the rules. seriously. if you really cared, you would start your own system and avoid the mpaa...do it and stop crying. I think their hearts are in the right place, but man, now that we have people downloading movies and dvds being released sooner, the rating should matter less. it doesn't matter artistically, only monetarily. and stop digging through people's garbage because you think you have a right to know who is rating your movie, that really made me angry, you stalkers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging expose of the MPAA even if it is not as tight or controlled a discussion as I would have liked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I decided to watch this film I must confess that my views on censorship are such that I thought I might not "get" the film. Firstly I do support some form of ratings and I have no problem with the UK's classification system ? particularly now where we have moved passed the stage where Reservoir Dogs got banned etc and now we have a solid system where some age groups are protected but adults are mostly treated like adults. I know some people dislike this approach, but in my experience they tend to be below the age of 18. Now in America, I don't think that censorship is that tight given that you can see 18 rated violence on television in the middle of the day (but not swearing strangely) and also children can get into the US equivalent of 18 rated movies as long as they have an adult with them. And the dreaded NC-17? It is for adults only ? so what? Yes I appreciate that this reduces the ability of the studio to market films to kids but to me not everything is for children.So with this in mind about me I did think that a film that started out by listing the filmmakers that had gotten NC-17 ? particularly when so many of the names I associated with making films for a more adult audience. So when the film argues down this line, it left me cold because I wasn't able to meet it on those terms; for example the maker of Gunner Palace moaning about his R rating for a film with strong, frequent language and depiction of drug use? What is his point ? that is not censorship, it is classification. Fortunately this is not really a debate about what should be rated what but actually a look at how the MPAA works; or rather how it doesn't.The film is at its best when it exposes the inconsistencies in the ratings, for example the difference between straight and gay sex, studio and independent films and the way that violence is seemingly not a big deal but sex acts are frowned upon. The protected nature of the raters is also unusual for someone used to the rather open doors of the BBFC and it did draw me in by educating me on this and other things about how this system works. It paints a good picture of the organisation and builds a solid case against it that I did find fascinating. Of course it is not perfect. Some have claimed it is hilarious but it isn't, it just happens to be delivered in a rather irreverent and humorous fashion. Secondly it is not a perfect documentary as, although it does have sections that are really well built, I didn't get much from the whole private investigation thing other than it providing a nice frame and forward motion to the film. I got the point that the people are shrouded in mystery but learning who they were or how many children they had was weak compared to actual discussion of how they work.Overall then an imperfect documentary that doesn't debate as much as it should, has weak sections that don't really inform and perhaps weakens itself by at times implying that ratings and control on films based on content is wholly a bad idea. However it is very good when it is focused and makes the simple points about the MPAA being uncontrolled, inconsistent and setup in a very strange way. It is engaging even for non-US audiences even it is often not as tight or controlled as I would have liked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any film-fan, and especially those that are interested in independent films particularly should check THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED. Director Kirby Dick, along with the help of a private-investigator, uncovers the truth behind, and the identities of, the MPAA board-members that make the final decisions on the ratings of all films that are submitted for ratings under MPAA "guidelines". Dick exposes the hypocrisy and lunacy of the MPAA as a secret-society (that is, until Dick comes along at least...), and blows the lid off of the subject. The tone of this particular documentary is pretty "light" given the serious subject-matter, and is actually very entertaining. Best part, is there's a good bit of boobs, butts, and even a few bushes as Mr. Dick shows clips from some films that were rated NC-17 who thought their rating was unfair.Anyway - give this one a shot, both entertaining and extremely enlightening...9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At times cheap and slightly boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary definitely has something to say about the rating system:-NC-17 or R ratings making films less marketable, thus influencing the business; -violence being viewed as less "bad" than sex; -heterosexual sex being viewed as less "bad" than homosexual sex;-male masturbation and orgasms being viewed as less "bad" than female ones; -lack of psychological and psychiatric expertise among NPAA members; -most of the members not having YOUNG children and not any of them being homosexual; -ratings being seemingly random, given the secrecy of the NPAA and their lack of transparency and guidelines.Despite these interesting issues the documentary is very flawed. What annoyed me the most was the stalking of people that are supposed to be anonymous. Their privacy is invaded in a cheap and disturbing way that should have caused this film. Faces, names and surnames are all exposed. If I were a member of the NPAA I would press charges, you can't just shoot a film of me without my consent and sell that film to millions of viewers. How did they get away with this?Also, the documentary is judgmental and manipulative, the viewer is continuously expected to react to everything the rating system is revealed to do as "ridiculous" and "outrageous", even "fascist". This all seemed very exaggerated. These are just people trying to do the right thing and helping parents to see if a movie is fit for the whole family, their children or if those children should wait until they're 18 (oh my what a disaster, not being able to view explicit films until they're 18. Like children won't do that anyway...). I'm from Europe, a liberal and I do think the US are too puritan when it comes to sex and too gratuitous when it comes to violence. But I don't really see any major problem other than the business impact of a rating (less theaters). And usually the marketability of a film is not really caused by the rating itself but by a film itself. Do you really expect families with kids to flock to films like "Boys don't cry" or "The Cooler"? These are films for a different audience.The problems with the ratings have become clear and the system should change to something transparent (which will no doubt cause a lot of controversy, the whole nation will not ever agree on what is acceptable and what is not.) But this is something that could have been covered in a 30 minute documentary, this documentary just dragged on and soon became boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I missed the most in this "documentary" is why they didn't event talk about the businesses and institutions taking the ratings into consideration let alone ask them directly about it. Why should a film-maker care about the rating? Turns out certain store chains or movie theaters exclude films rated NC17. Well, who is the censor here, the MPAA or the stores and theaters? If the MPAA starts assigning R's to movies depicting "felching", the stores and theaters will ban R films. The rating does not matter, its usage by the others does. Anyway this whole controversy would seem pointless in a true competitive market. If there was no artificial monopoly enforced by the state (eg. copyrights), the movie distribution mechanism would have to be completely different, thus rendering a one centralized rating committee superfluous. At the same time private businesses should still be free to reject any movies they choose - which is basically what is happening right now, but was not explored in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Angering and Upsetting Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Film Is Not Yet Rated is a must for any film buff, and also for any parent. It's not a presentation of a single argument but rather a collage of different opinions competently juxtaposed by director Kirby Dick, who bravely showcases clips from unjustly rated movies which ostensibly earned them their harsh ratings, or not-so-harsh ratings. Each interviewed filmmaker, for instance, among ones such as Kevin Smith, Darren Aronofsky, Kimberly Pierce, Wayne Kramer and John Waters, seems to have a vastly differing take on the American film ratings system, and whether or not you agree with one or the other, it's interesting to note which ones escaped an NC-17 rating and which ones did not.Dick's daring delve into the least accessible facet of the film industry, the ratings board of the Motion Picture Association of America affords pioneering disclosure that the board seems as if regard homosexual material much more severely than heterosexual material, a claim strengthened by an MPAA spokesperson's declaration that "We don't create standards. We just follow them," or that the board's raters have nor are given any training and are calculatingly chosen due to their lack of knowledge in media literacy or child development, or that senior raters have exchanges in the custom of mandatory meetings with studio personnel following screenings, and that the MPAA's appeals board is just as guarded as the ratings board, its members by and large being movie theater chain and studio executives. And just when we thought there would be a social wrong in which religion is not involved, we see that included on the appeals board are a Catholic clergyman and an Episcopalian clergyman, one of whom could possibly have the privilege to vote on the appeals board's decisions.The most exciting portions of the film are the interviewees, mostly because it's always interesting to hear them speak about their actual experiences and the effect they've had on their careers. It appears that any kind of non-missionary sex is not approved of, like oral sex, threesomes, gay stuff, female masturbation, or even just the showcasing of a woman's orgasm. Evidently, you're better off if your film is certified by a major studio. That's why a fleeting look at Maria Bello's bare vagina merited Kramer's excellent independent film The Cooler an NC-17, while Sharon Stone doing loads more in the $50 million Columbia TriStar film Basic Instinct was only enough to obtain an R.Most film connoisseurs already know this, but it is verified as fact here that the NC-17 is just deployed as hostility to sex on screen, while ultraviolence pervades even PG-13-rated movies. If truth be told, you could stab a pregnant woman, kill a child on screen and decapitate 5 innocent bystanders and feel confident that you'll get an R. If there's no blood, you can rest assured you'll get a PG-13. All other countries with ratings systems have precisely the reverse approach.It is said by someone on the side of the raters in this uproarious, upsetting composition that if a lot of people want to see it, no rating can hurt it. If few people want to see it, then no rating will help it. Not true. There have been many films released to doubly whetted appetites due to reports of ratings disputes. By the end, we have realized that the MPAA is a bunch of bullies who, when confronted by someone about hearsay, shout, "I didn't do nothing'!" However, it goes deeper than that when we learn that some of the biggest media companies and movie distribution studios puppeteer them, one being Disney of course. They do not want independent films to do well. If you can presume why, you're right. If you can't, don't ask. If you still want to see this movie, by all means see it.Though the ratings board made me furious and frankly always has, at some point, I was wondering how the MPAA's opponents expected the ratings system should be run, by also, by the end, it is well understood that it's publicly declared to just be an optional industry system that nobody is obligated to abide. Alas, the reality of the movie industry is utterly removed from these false assertions. The rating ranked to a film on the whole shapes who sees it in a theater, and what kind of marketing and publicity for the movie will be agreed to by TV and newspapers. An NC-17 in essence assures that no more than the trivial shaving of the public nearby art house cinemas will ever sit in a theater to see the film as it was intended, and that there will be practically no way to advertise the film.</fullReview>

"Outing" the reviewers who work for the MPAA, filming one of them surreptitiously while she was eating a sandwich, and going through one of the reviewer's garbage was an appalling invasion of privacy. The movie attempted, with some success, to label this issue as one of free speech, censorship, religious nuts trying to tell me what I can see, secrecy and studio power. This attempted label is nonsense. The true issue is how do we protect our children from the purveyors of smut who would show our children anything in order to make a buck. The movie seems to say that the current rating system does a lousy job of protecting our children from scenes of violence, so the solution is to allow them to see explicit images of all types of depraved sexual activity. Adults should, and do, watch anything they wish to. The rating system has nothing to do with an adult's freedom to see what he or she wishes. Nor does the current system tell anyone what kind of movies to make. Those who own movie theaters are well within their rights if they elect not to show movies containing graphic details of sexual activity, just as parents are free not to allow their children to go to multi- plexes showing films with graphic sexual content - as many would. If anything, our current rating system is far too lax in not sufficiently warning parents about movies containing profanity, sexual acts, degrading acts against women, and acts of violence. In closing, this self-indulgent and self-serving film offered no adult discussion of the harm or lack thereof on children from their observing explicit images of sexual acts or violence or any reasonable alternatives to our current voluntary system of rating films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the MPAA is still a mystery...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie purports to want to do three things: Make the MPAA less mysterious, explain the ratings system, and explain what the MPAA does. It fails horribly at each.It claims that the MPAA "censors"; it doesn't. It merely provides a guide for parents in order to help them decide if the movie is appropriate for their children; that's what the ratings system in any country does. Last time I checked, "censor" at least implies that group forces edits on the movie; the MPAA doesn't edit or force the production company to edit anything. If a movie company doesn't want to make the changes, then it doesn't need to; after all, the rating it receives is just for parents. I appreciate that a movie that's rated NC-17 doesn't do that well, but then again a movie that's been rated NC-17 shouldn't be seen by the general audience; I would love to see an argument that sex needs to be seen by six-year-olds.It does briefly discuss what it takes to get certain ratings, but it doesn't explain the logic behind those ratings nor the purpose of the rating system beyond censorship. In that regard, it fails yet again. It points out that homosexual themes tend to get a harsher rating; it ignores that part of the ratings is to warn parents that there may be subjects that may need to be discussed, and current mores (unfortunately) make the discussion of homosexual themes something parents need to be aware of. I know that that may not be welcome by the gay community, but that is an unfortunate reality.It tracks down the various members of the MPAA; in that regard it succeeds at getting rid of some of the mystery. However, it doesn't show the logic of the MPAA, come close to showing its show purpose, and actually tries to create some sort of conspiracy theory. It even gets it wrong that the MPAA is some sort of public service and thus its employees should be outed; in fact, it's a private company and thus it doesn't need to disclose its employees (I would love to see an argument for Wendy's to disclose its employees). The producers should be grateful that the MPAA did not sue for invasion of privacy for that or that several conversations were recreated after being asked not to record them.It's a great movie if you think that the ratings are a form of censorship; however, a movie should not just preach to the choir. In that regard, by going after the members of the MPAA and looking only at the non-existent censorship issue, this movie does nothing to figure out why the rating system works as it does. And that's a shame, because the MPAA is less likely to let anyone in anytime soon...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrating failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are an aspiring documentary-maker, and want a good example of how to go about making a documentary that fails to prove its point, and skips over more interesting territory in favor of boring and irrelevant territory, this is the movie for you.I think a lot of the good reviews here can be explained by its choice of subject matter alone. I too am interested in the subject, and that's exactly why I thought this film was mostly just pretty frustrating. It really didn't explain very well what the NC-17 problem was, exactly. It was really obsessed with doing some stupid investigation to find out the names of the individuals who do the ratings for MPAA, where they lived, and who their children were. That, plus a few chopped up interviews with movie directors whining about their movies getting slapped with NC-17s, and that was most of the content of the film. Stupid.It spent about one minute, maybe, on the main part of the NC-17 problem, which is that many movie theaters and certain DVD stores won't touch a movie with an NC-17 rating, or, I guess, one that just isn't rated at all, which makes your producer not like you much if you get one of those ratings. But mainly all it does is just point out that this problem exists.Why, exactly, are businesses that show movies and sell DVDs treating adults like infants? And why do they have so much power over the movie studios? That's mainly all I'm interested in knowing about when it comes to the NC-17 issue. This movie doesn't seem to talk about the reasons at all. It just notes the problem and moves on, as if that's just as much a part of inexorable unalterable reality as the sky being blue, as if that's just as reasonable as laws against murder.It's easy to see why an independent movie is more likely to get slapped with an NC-17 rating, y'know, because the MPAA is really just the arm of the big movie studios, but this film just kind of makes a bare accusation about the MPAA discriminating against independent films, and doesn't really provide much evidence for this. I have no doubt it's true--but it would have been interesting to see some actual evidence.The movie argues that the MPAA is more likely to slap an NC-17 on a movie that has gay sex in it, or that has intense orgasms in it, or sex scenes involving views of actual sexual fluids, but it didn't provide much good evidence of this, which really kind of leaves you wondering whether the MPAA is really all that discriminatory against these kinds of movies.I left the film wondering if the MPAA was really all that bad, just in general. I am not saying the MPAA isn't bad, and for all I know, the MPAA is Satan incarnate, but I can't tell just from watching this movie. Clearly the movie was trying to argue that the MPAA is in fact Satan incarnate, but it was doing a very poor job of backing up its argument.I can see why directors would prefer if the MPAA used actual hard-and-fast rules or guidelines, spelled out in advance, about what gets you in NC-17 territory, or if you were allowed to base an argument in your MPAA appeal on precedent ("this movie got an R and it had worse stuff than mine" arguments, which apparently are just not allowed by the MPAA in its appellate process for who knows why), but the movie didn't really even spend much time talking about this kind of thing. Instead, the filmmaker seemed obsessed with actually tracking down the names of the individual MPAA employees and their children.I think it was really frustrating and poorly done. It's an interesting subject that there really should be a good movie about, so it's really too bad that this is the movie that got made. I hope someone else comes along and does a better movie about this one day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie makes an attempt to illustrated the nuances of how the Motion Picture Association goes about its business of rating films. While it does outline the basics of what level of unacceptable behavior will result in a more restricted rating, it does so poking fun at the notion that a board elected to rate the films may actually know better than the filmmakers themselves as to what is acceptable and what isn't for a 17 year old child. In any family with daughters, it is no surprise that parents are highly sensitive to the ratings on movies and what their children may (or may not) see. The opening scene in this movie is typical of the rest of the film. It shows a filmmaker who takes issue with the strikes that the panel gave her film. The studio killed the film because it had an NC-17 (no child under 17 allowed). The three strikes against the film were; Strike one, a scene with a shot of a boy coming up from "going down" on a girl but has his face covered in cum. Strike two is graphic scene depicting anal rape of a boy. The third scene is an explicit display of a woman's long orgasm.While the last scene may be acceptable for showing sexual gratification (R rating), it is a far fetched notion that any child should be allowed to see scene one or two. The filmmaker is completely surprised by the board's stance. This documentary styled film is an illustration as to why the Motion Picture Association has no business letting filmmakers rate their own films. The artists and the filmmakers themselves have no idea of vulgarity or beautiful scenery. While the film attempts to show both sides, it's tilted to the notion that filmmakers should be allowed more freedom. Want a movie with an agenda... this is the one for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the kind of documentary that gives documentaries a bad name. Billing itself as a film about the dangers of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), once you start watching the film it becomes clear that it is actually a movie about the brave Kirby Dick and his private detectives trying to unmask an evil shadowy organization whose sole purpose is hampering free expression and telling you what you can and cannot see.Opening with interviews with a variety of filmmakers whose films were originally given the NC-17 rating (which basically means Walmart refuses to sell them), the film starts out somewhat strongly. But the film never moves beyond that. The interviews devolve into piles of bad testimonials and unsubstantiated accusations. The film quickly goes downhill, as Kirby Dick takes it upon himself to hire private investigators to discover the identity of the MPAA raters. This is followed by scene after scene of them sitting in a car spying on the rater's. It quickly becomes apparent that the meat of the film isn't really informing us about the MPAA, and is instead Kirby Dick trying to "beat" the system. This comes to a head when he SEARCHES THROUGH A PERSON'S GARBAGE TRYING TO CONFIRM THEY ARE A RATER.In the end, the film provides no context, only the most basic overview of the topic, and no suggestions for how to better the system. It is an empty documentary, never going beyond trying to make people angry and willing to use overt manipulation to do it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i found it mildly entertaining,and informative to a point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>for me,this film was mildly entertaining at best.it has a lot of information,but how accurate it is,is any body's guess.the filmmakers have their view on things,and so the film probably reflects their views.i'm sure a lot of what they show and say is accurate to a point,but i think some things you have to take with a grain of salt,like most things.i think you sort of have to come to your own conclusions.this is just my opinion,of course.anyway,the film basically deals with trying to find out the identities of the M.P.A.A.the people who make up the Motion Picture Association of America.these are the people who give ratings to films.i found it interesting how the filmmakers went about trying to uncover their names but i also think that maybe the M.P.A.A. has has some good reasons for wanting the identities of its members kept secret.i mean, they may hand down a rating for a film which could negatively affect its box office and critical performance.that could mean lost revenue.you can imagine a filmmaker being angry over receiving an N-17(the kiss of death)instead of an R.so maybe thee identities of the people on the ratings board are kept secret to protect them.i don't really know,i'm just speculating.the other thing is that the ratings board is not part of the government.they are an independent body,and they are not elected,so in my view,they shouldn't have to reveal their identities.doing so might give them a better relationship with filmmakers though,or it might not..there is some other stuff in the movie,as well,but i found a lot of the stuff dry and not that interesting.i agreed with some things the filmmakers said and i disagreed with some things as well.anyway,i think the film is an OK way to waste 90 minutes or so,but i didn't find it profound or earth shattering.but again,that's just my personal opinion.the film might be more interesting if you watch it with a group of people.at the very least,it could provide some lively discussion,and get people thinking.anyway,like i said,theses are just my views.i should mention there is a lot of nudity and foul language in the movie,so this might not be to your taste.there is some violence,but i felt it wasn't that graphic.in my opinion,This Film is Not Yet Rated is a 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Provocative but one sided look at movie ratings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This Film...." is a provocative look at the MPAA rating system which makes it point in the first15 minutes of the documentary and then goes on for another 90 minutes making the same points over and over. The use of two rather low key and amateurish detectives to ferret out the names of the heretofore anonymous raters also detracts from the weight of the expose. The key points of contention for the filmmaker, Mr. Dick, is that the MPAA is funded by and influenced by the major studios, that the raters are homophobic, they are hung up on sex rather than violence, that contrary to the MPAA's assertion that they are not censors they in fact do censor and that they are anonymous. Jack Valenti and company are portrayed as well paid tools of the Industry and the chosen sound bites of Valenti and the Rating Board chairperson underscore the audacity and authoritarian manner in which ratings are adminstered. At the end of the day, I recognize that the system is imperfect but I sure would not want the various anti MPAA directors who were interviewed, including John Waters, rating the films for parents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film is Not Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching this film and was really disappointed. It presents a few good points and shows some of the hypocrisy of the MPAA ratings system, but it is completely one sided and offers not a single opposing opinion in the entire film. The problems I have with the movie that have not already been covered by other comments are:1) A huge section of the film deals with how sexual content will quickly get you a more restrictive rating while violence is not as problematic. We are given the argument that we should be more European and value the beauty of the body and sex. It seems that the filmmaker and everyone involved missed the point that the MPAA is to rate films for an American audience, not a European one, and not a liberal one. If the large majority of Americans agree with the ratings, then the MPAA is doing its job properly.2) The film expounds further on the sex topic by detailing how homosexual sex is rated more restrictively than hetero. Again, what a shocker! Does the filmmaker actually think that all Americans are so comfortable with images of homosexual sex that the MPAA is out of line?3) I didn't find the cases where filmmakers were given an NC-17 rating instead of a R very compelling. My fav was the glimpse of pubic hair that caused "The Cooler" to get an NC-17 rating. I saw a little more than hair, and I don't see what the problem complying with the ratings board would be. A 1 second cut would have fixed the problem and not detracted from the movie at all. The other examples included films dealing with homosexual sex, fetishes, etc. See point 2.4) An alternative to the system is never suggested. There is no mention of attempts to change or create an alternate system. If so many of these extremely wealthy filmmakers feel so oppressed then maybe they should spend a little money and time and try to fix the problem. As far as I know it has never been done. I would think the documentary should cover this.5) Its been said may times in other comments, but the part where the filmmaker hires a P.I. to find the identities of the secret ratings board members is a waste. It was the most interesting part of the movie and the only thing that kept me watching, so that will give you an idea of how poor the "meat" of the documentary was.Lastly, I want to mention that the numerous 10 star ratings this film has received is a shame. The comments appear to be more of a condemnation of the MPAA rather than a rating of the film itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some valid points, but not many</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was actually a bit of a disappointment given the very high score it had been given by voters on this website. Nonetheless, it makes some valid points and provides some insight into the MPAA film rating system.Unfortunately, it spends far too much time in the rather meaningless task of trying to find out the identities of the members of the ratings board. That reminds me of a con used by professional wrestling years ago: a wrestler would come to town wearing a mask. He would call himself Mr. X or some such and promise to take off his mask if anyone beat him. I remember asking someone what people thought they were going to see when he took it off - would it be some famous person? Of course not! It was some guy no one had ever heard of. Who should care who he is? The same thing with the ratings board members. I assume they keep their identities secret to avoid harassment from people like the two nut-cases in this movie.Mostly, the film takes a rather one-sided view, spins it as if there were no other side, and provides some unhappy film makers with a chance to whine about the unfairness of it all. It implies that the studios should release whatever they create. Otherwise, it's CENSORSHIP.In our society, no one expects the purveyor of a product to present something that may harm its reputation or lose money. A film studio has every right to refuse to release a film it doesn't like. That is in no way censorship. The film maker has the right to find another studio or to release it as an independent film. Of course, they don't get the benefit of the studio's promotion if they do that but, hey, that's life. Some of the critics seem to recognize that and merely want a chance to present their case. Others sound like spoiled children who believe they are entitled to have someone else (a movie studio) provide distribution and promotion of whatever they make. Still others want to be free to make, and have distributed and promoted for them, whatever they want, but they want others to be restricted to their standards.The point is made that in Europe a movie is more likely to get a restrictive rating for violence than for sex, with the implication that the Europeans have it right. Well, they have their point of view. I, personally find the extremely distasteful and currently popular "comedies" that are usually rated PG or PG-13 more offensive than either the violent or the sexy. But, that's just me. I agree with those who say that instead of a simple rating, there should be a more specific description of scenes that are potentially offensive to some (I do not consider myself to be the judge of what others should find offensive). This is available, in some cases at least. Netflix often has the MPAA rating and a link to another MPAA page that describes the violence, sex, language, etc. in the context of the film.At a time when the major studios are not putting out very much of value, this topic is definitely a good one for discussion. Unfortunately, this film does very little of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A self-defeating documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually went into this film with some sympathy for its premise. Yes, the MPAA is an awful system, and it does make some very arbitrary rulings that wink at violence and penalize sex.However, by the end of it, I was kind of glad we do have an MPAA protecting us from some of these people. Especially creepy was John Waters, who looks like the kind of guy you'd find on a Megan's Law website, saying that it's okay to put graphic sex in movies, because your kids are getting it from the internet, anyway. Cringe! Another premise was that the movie industry kowtows to the military. Huh? Excuse me, but since the War on Terror began, I haven't seen a movie YET that portrays the military in a good light, and I've heard about a lot of them that are critical of current policy. The best example they could come up with for a "rah-rah" military movie was Top Gun. That movie is over 20 years old, for crying out loud! It also has little or nothing to do with the MPAA, so I am not sure why they included it.Another tiresome canard was the the Europeans are so much smarter than those puritanical Americans. Right. And when was the last time you rushed out to see a European made film? Why aren't all these Hollywood types moving to France. Darn it, I voted for George W. Bush twice hoping these people would keep their promises and move, and they haven't yet.It seems that the MPAA has a squirm factor, but most of what makes them squirm makes most people squirm. Their apples to oranges comparisons (such as "Girls don't Cry" getting an NC-17 for oral sex, but "Scream" getting a R for a breast implant being torn out) doesn't help their case. I think both should have gotten an NC-17. They think both should have gotten an R.Yes, there are some real problems with the MPAA, and the movie does a good job pointing them out. But they also are so abusive and over the top (such as hiring private investigators to find out who the members are and follow them to their homes, picking through their garbage and such)that you end up with sympathy for the members.They make the point that the MPAA is a product of the Studios, (Studios get notes, while Indies just get the rating) and theatre owners. Well, duh. Of course, these industries are going to protect their own interests, and that is to make money without getting undue grief from the public. They actually (gasp) have clergy on the board. Wow, better that than an organized Church boycott of your studio. It seems that they are blaming an industry for acting like an industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard about this documentary and being a film buff was anxious to see it. What a disappointment. It is downright awful. A documentary is supposed to be balanced. This film does not show the side of the MPAA. During the documentary the private detectives hired to find out who are the MPAA raters, start to speak about how they met and about being lesbians. What does the sexuality of the detectives have to due with the methods of the MPAA? The investigation of the detectives rises to the point of invasion of privacy.Wayne Kramer, the director of "The Cooler" makes a lot of comments about how the MPAA functions, comments in the negative context. He seems to state that the MPAA is too conservative when it comes to sexual content of films and how his film received difficulty in obtaining an other than NC-17 rating because of pubic hair being displayed in the film. One problem with this, "The Cooler" is a terrible movie. It is predictable to the point of being painful. The whole group with whom I saw "The Cooler" left the viewing moaning in sadness at having wasted two hours of our lives. Mr. Kramer would be wiser to spend his time learning how to make a decent movie and not being concerned with the procedures of the MPAA.I found it interesting that most of the filmmakers that appear in the documentary are gay/lesbian. What's with that? Except for Kimberly Peirce, most to the directors, including John Waters, haven't made a decent movie. OK, Waters made "Cry-Baby" but he also made "Cecil B. Demented". 'Nough said. The people who made and appear in this project would have better spent their time going back to film school and learning how to make a quality film rather than throwing stones at the MPAA."The Cooler" and "This Film is Not Yet Rated" time spent watching dribble. Time I will never get back. Don't fall into the same trap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun to Watch, But Misses the Big Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The audience at the Sundance premiere loved This Film is Not Yet Rated. Of course, director Kirby Dick perfectly played the role of iconoclastic documentarian who is fearlessly stickin' it to the man (in this case, the MPAA). And in fact, the movie was plenty of fun.Kirby makes frequent use of controversial footage (mostly sex-related) from films, as well as interviews with directors. But the highlight is the work of a private investigator who is tasked to identify the secret panel of reviewers who assign the ratings. The fact that the PI is a rather dowdy, middle-aged lesbian that is accompanied by her partner's teenage daughter is such a departure from the Sam Spade mythology that you're rooting for her from the beginning. This was a genius move on Dick's part! There is also plenty of footage of former MPAA president Jack Valenti, often pontificating in the silver-tongued (and silver-haired) glory he made famous. I like documentaries, but I'm troubled that audiences are so easily swayed by these typically one-sided arguments designed more to enrage and entertain than to uncover the truth. So in that spirit, let me make a few comments on the MPAA rating system and the movie. Kirby drives home the following points:1. The ratings board seems to have a greater tolerance for violence than for sex. I can see why filmmakers might feel that way, but honestly, how on earth can you compare the two? Is one decapitation equivalent to the fondling of a breast? I'm just not sure how anyone could successfully argue this claim. Frankly, I see an awful lot of explicit sex and graphic violence in movies. 2. The MPAA is harder on Independent movies than from the studios because it's studio-driven organization. This is probably true, but the documentary gives the flimsiest of evidence to support it. Kevin Smith gives an example from how the MPAA dealt with him on two movies, one indie and one studio, but they were five years apart and may have simply reflected different people, policy changes, etc. 3. The MPAA treats homosexual sex more stringently than heterosexual sex. Uh ? yea. And so does network TV, cable, print and the Internet. This is not news. I'm not defending it, but I think it reflects the public's squirm factor. 4. The MPAA reviewers are supposed to be parents of teens or younger, but often their kids were grown. Hmmmm. Who cares? The whole parent thing is a silly PR ploy anyway. These reviewers probably jaywalk as well, and maybe lead with their dessert fork. 5. The fallacy of comparisons. Dick wants a world where a filmmaker can find examples of similar scenes that have been allowed in the past to get their scenes approved. My teenagers have tried to use the same approach to systematically eliminate restrictions. Open that door a crack and the wall comes crashing down. 6. The MPAA doesn't publish its standards, which is unfair to filmmakers. Unfortunately, Kirby never asks why. And there's the rub. The MPAA secrets its standards because they would be highly controversial and the public (as well as Washington) would use it against the industry. Everyone snickers about today's PG'13's being yesterday's R's, but what if it was laid out in black and white? What if the press reported when the MPAA chooses to make a new word acceptable in PG-13's that was previously restricted? This is fuel for those that attempt to censor Hollywood and the result would be exactly the kind of regulation the MPAA has lobbied against for years. The evolution of these standards over time would not suffer scrutiny well. Filmmakers can live in an ideal world, but Jack Valenti knew exactly what he was doing, which was protecting the economic interests of the movie industry. I could go on. Personally, I think the MPAA ratings system is an abomination. At the same time, I think filmmakers ought to rejoice that an organization run by their own industry is allowed to police itself with secret standards and the worst punishment being not a restriction but rather an ill-defined ratings label. The industry should come not to bury Jack Valenti, but to praise him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An evil film made by ill-intentioned, bad people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recommend that everyone watch "This Film Is Not Yet Rated" in order to fully comprehend the malevolence of the leftist film scene. The director Kirby Dick ends up proving the EXACT OPPOSITE of what he intended to prove. He wanted to show that the MPAA is evil: Instead, he showed that he himself is evil. And juvenile. And un-self-aware. He apparently has no clue that stalking is a crime, and that exposing the names and addresses and families of innocent private citizens who have committed no wrong reveals that he wishes harm would come to them.2/3s of the film revolves around the director hiring private detectives to "expose" the names and address of the MPAA employees who watch and rate films as their jobs. Why? To what end? It's never explained. What purpose is served by printing on-screen the names of these people, and showing their private homes, and their pictures, and listing their children? I'll tell you why: The author wants them to come to harm. He himself doesn't have the nerve to "do" anything to them, but he hopes that by violating their privacy, some nutcase out there will take matters in his own hands and threaten/harm/stalk these people.The whole reason the MPAA raters need to remain anonymous is exactly for reasons like this: So creeps won't threaten and bully them for political reasons. Creeps like Kirby Dick want the raters to feel fear, fear that if they don't toe the PC line, they are putting themselves and their families at risk.I found the whole film completely unconscionable, and bordering on the criminal.Which brings me to the larger point: What exactly does the director (and many of the interview subjects) want? They never say overtly, but it quickly becomes clear: They want to remove the rating system entirely. They want NO film ratings of any kind.And why would they want that? Well, there could only be one possible reason. Since the purpose of MPAA ratings is to make sure that young kids don't accidentally walk into and watch a film with pornographic sex, the filmmakers in this movie want to make sure that as many kids as possible view pornography. A couple of the interview subjects say as much.A couple other commenters here have pointed out that no alternative was ever suggested in the film to the current rating system, which they seem to think was an oversight on the part of the director. Not so. No alternative was given because they don't want a different system - - they want no system at all.Also: Much whining goes on in the film about "censorship" at the hands of the MPAA.Excuse me? Censorship?No one is censoring anything. If there was actual censorship, you couldn't make this movie in the first place. You couldn't make X-rated porn in the first place.There is no censorship going on. Filmmakers can make whatever film they want, on any topic. This movie proves as much. Nothing stops any producer or director from making any kind of film with any kind of explicit content. The MPAA doesn't stop them, or stop anyone. All the MPAA does is try to provide an accurate descriptive shorthand label, telling the consumer what to expect in a film. We have labels on our food telling us the vitamins and calorie content it has, and no one complains about that. What's the difference? How is it hurtful to have a one-letter label telling consumers that the movie is targeted for young kids, or for teens, of for adults? It's not hurtful at all -- it's helpful.In fact, it's helpful in a way that the film never discusses or acknowledges. I, for example, tend to avoid any "G"-rated film, because I know it's going to generally be shallow and infantile and aimed at the kid audience. If I see a dramatic film has an "R" or "NC-17" rating, then I seek it out because I know it's going to be more risky and outrageous. In other words, getting a restrictive rating can HELP a film find its correct audience.The director and interview subjects also get all worked up about how difficult it is for indie films with explicit sex to get major theater distribution deals. Is that so surprising? That has nothing to do with censorship, and everything to do with theater-chain owners correctly assessing that they couldn't make much money off an indie film that featured anal sex or whatever.None of this justifies the terrifying and frankly illegal stalking of MPAA employees depicted in this film. The director PURPOSELY wants to put them at risk, as a way to threaten them. And instead of being ashamed of his shenanigans, he's proud of them, and is shown chortling with glee as he paws through their garbage and snaps hidden camera photos of them. Of private citizens who have done nothing illegal or even meriting criticism, other than have a job at the "evil" MPAA, where they sit in a room all day and watch movies, making sure that no erect penises end up in a G-rated film. Is that such an egregious moral crime that we need to put their safety at risk, and that of their families?I give this film 1-star because it shows that the filmmaker was ill-intentioned, and hadn't even thought out a clear thesis of what he was trying to prove, other than to menace those who he perceives wrongly to be his ideological enemies. But even with the 1-star rating, I recommend that everyone watch it, just so you can grasp how nefarious and creepy people like the director Kirby Dick really are. They will use deeply unsettling tactics to bring about the disintegration of a system which they personally don't like, despite it being very useful and popular among average people.</fullReview>

NO ONE IS THREATENED BY FEMALE PLEASURE! They just don't want to see their six year old staring at genitalia. Is that so unreasonable? Sex is a necessary part of life, but do we really have to swim in scene upon scene of it? I mean, using the bathroom is also a necessary part of life, but I'd rather abstain from watching Hilary Swank on the toilet, if you don't mind. Many of the best movies ever made (Citizen Kane, Casablanca, The Godfather, Star Wars, etc.) have little (normally no) sex, and are no worse for the wear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if I could give this film a zero star rating, but I'd certainly like to, if possible. I really hated it! I had assumed that it would present an interesting discussion on a misunderstood issue (the ratings' system) in a fashion somewhat similar to that presented in "Thank You for Not Smoking" or one of Michael Moore's entertaining documentaries. Instead what I got was a very amateurish attempt designed to get viewers to take issue with the ratings' system run by the MPAA. While I think that the premise of this film is interesting, the "presentation" is extremely disjointed and, frankly, offensive in its excessive use of explicit sexual scenes that are way over the top. One or two of the man-on-man-on-woman scenes would have gotten the point across, but it seems that a huge chunk of the movie is focused on these very graphic images and it really makes me wonder if there was any editorial decision-making used in this film at all. I happen to agree that Hollywood has far too much gratuitous violence in its films, and clearly the MPAA has a bias in favor of these types of films. However, the answer, in my opinion, is not to make movies with women having orgasms with jello more accessible to minors (as director John Waters advocated), but to raise the bar on the quality of films, in general. Take a look at movies like "The Pursuit of Happiness" or "An Inconvenient Truth" to see what directors should be striving for -- films that generally enlighten while entertaining their audiences. If I took anything away from this movie, it's that directors, or at least the ones portrayed in this film, are seriously out of touch with what our society needs. Work on making more quality films instead of advocating for broader exposure to junk!</fullReview>
