		<fullReview>There's one thing about Hollywood - you can't stop the hype. I think it was the hype that gave this movie the bad reviews by some IMDB users, as let's face it, it can totally ruin a movie for some people.In "Good Will Hunting", you have to look past the hype and Oscars and see that it really is a gorgeous film written by two very talented young men, and acted out by proficient actors such as Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsgard. Personally, I thought the plot was an excellent idea - maybe someone else could have thought of it, but could they have provided the great script? And as for the profanity - yes, there was a lot, but I don't give a damn! This is real life! People swear! Deal with it!Anyway, what I really enjoyed about "Good Will Hunting" was the psychological aspect - very believable. Here you have this "typical" 21 - year - old, drinking with his friends, getting into fights, etc etc, but you look below the surface and there's a lot more to him. I think this really tells us a lot about the people around us and makes a point about looking below the surface. This aspect of the movie also revealed a lot of sociological issues - yes, it IS believable that there is a genius in a rough suburb of Boston, repressed by his upbringing. (Hey, my mum even says so, and she teaches sociology!)I enjoyed the acting a lot, especially by Robin Williams - I had been too used to seeing him in cutesy films, so this was definitely a refreshing change. I feel he plunged right into the part and relished it, although something told me his accent wasn't quite right! Will's relationships with the people around him are wonderful to watch, especially with Skylar (Minnie Driver) - there was real chemistry between them. I also liked to watch how Will behaved around his buddies; the four guys really seemed as if they had known each other all their lives.Overall, I thought this movie was believable and touching, without your typical ending. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck really have done themselves proud. My advice: Forget the Oscar nominations, the rave reviews, the famous faces, and sit down to watch this movie with a completely impartial attitude. You will see that it really is beautiful.By the way, I very VERY rarely cry at movies. But if there's any scene that will have me in tears, it's the one where Will finally breaks down and starts to cry. That's saying something!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow burner, a fine achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has a brilliant script...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It appears the jury is hung... many people either loved or hated this movie. I can tell you why I loved it. First of all the script. I think it had a real slice of life, and brilliance in it. Sorry, but some people do use 4 letter words to express themselves. And no, it doesn't mean that's because they lack intelligence to use anything else. I can rise to the occasion any time I need w/out profanity. But it is how I think &amp; speak in my day to day life. The language shouldn't even be an issue. If that's all you heard, you weren't listening! The brilliance in it is everywhere. For example, William's character putting Damon's character in place by noting that he sneers at things that he has no real life experience with. I know people like that. Then moments when he (William's character) says gems like, "I'll save you the suspense sport- she isn't perfect &amp; neither are you- the question is whether you are perfect for each other." I'm paraphrasing of course. The question of relationships, and life career decisions- the courage to risk and overcoming whatever your background is, are all a part of real life. This isn't supposed to be about genius or some "white trash" as someone else said (some people might say the kids in this movie aren't trash, just normal hard working, middle class guys) - it's about love, life and courage- courage to ante up &amp; try again, no matter how many times life knocks us around. The acting, direction and script are wonderful. They definitely deserved the Oscar for this. It has soul. It has meaning &amp; I am sad for the people that didn't get it. As the movie "American Beauty" said... LOOK CLOSER.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible, moving movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of things have been said about this fantastic movie, and I only hope to add a few more praises.The fact that it was written by Ben and Matt was a shock to me, I did not expect any strong writing and a solid script, but boy was I wrong. The movie lasts for 2 hours, and every minute of it I couldn't even focus on anything beside the incredible world of Will Hunting.Matt plays Will Hunting, who is a brilliant young man who denies his unreal intellect. Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben. That is until a professor at one of the top colleges finds Will's talent and helps him out of trouble with the law. Robin Williams later comes in as a therapist to Will, he is the only one who can really stand up to Will's intellect and manages to break the layer of distrust that Will has developed over years of solitude, and the two develop a bond beyond friendship.Yes there is a girl, but this is not a romantic movie. There is more to life then what we are taught and what we have to show for it.The writing is witty, brilliant and hilarious at times, both Matt and Robin Williams preform wonderfully from both a comedic and theatrical prospective. Matt's best work since Dogma and Williams best along side Dead Poet's Society.If your looking for a typical Hollywood movie with a Hollywood ending, then do not bother spending two hours on this movie. This movie is ahead of it's time, and lands an easy 10 out of 10.This one is a keeper in my movie library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Whatever blows your hair back" - This movie does it for me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best movie I have seen since the Godfather. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck make a great team...not only as actors, but more impressively as co-writers. Add Robin Williams in perhaps his best role ever (too close to Good Morning Vietnam for me to make the call), and you have a wonderfully entertaining movie.Ben Affleck is convincing as the best friend to a genius, able to effectively play the joker and the friend who would "lay down in traffic for you". Matt Damon's portrayal of that genius realizing that life has something more to offer than batting cages and bars is equally stunning. And Robin Williams certainly leaves nothing to be desired (except maybe a beard trimmer...).The most amazing thing about this movie is the writing. Even if the acting were not terrific, this movie still would have made my top ten list. I was captivated from beginning to end.If you've not seen it, Good Will Hunting is without doubt a "renter", and I think after seeing it, it's one you'll want to own to watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Real Best Picture of 1997</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While everyone took sides with L.A. Confidential (for it's Old Hollywood flair and tight-as-a-girdle plot arc) or Titanic (for it's generally inescapable, juggernaut-like aura) as the Best Picture of 1997, it seems that too many people overlook Good Will Hunting for what it was: a timeless little opus that managed to make South Boston look romantic and happened to make Ben Affleck and Matt Damon some of the most deserving superstars in recent memory.Because before they were anybody, they were just the writers of this tale of a reluctant human being named Will Hunting, a mathematical genius who wore the guise of a hoodlum, and all of the sudden obstacles he had to take on to truly step in to manhood. Among these obstacles were a straight-forward shrink who outright dared Will to bulls*** him (played by Robin Williams, who got his overdue Oscar for it), a brilliant M.I.T. professor who felt it his own personal redemption to put Will's mind to great use somehow (Stellan Skarsg?rd, who never fails to steal nearly every scene he's in), and a girl who doesn't understand why the boy she loves so much cannot love her.It was these obstacles that made Will Hunting such a complex character: while he was a genius at the definite (math), he was a bit of a moron at the indefinite (human relationships). His rough-edged exterior was simply a cry for help, and the process of which the obstacles in his life realized that and attempted *to* help him was nothing short of extraordinarily touching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am totally dumbfounded by some of the reactions to this film. I'm imagining that the people who call this film boring are of the frame of mind, that unless a film has at least three explosions then it's not worth the price of a cinema ticket. Then there are the people calling it unrealistic. Now forgive me but I come from a similar background to the central character Will and I believe myself to be intelligent, but I didn't use my intelligence until very recently. Instead I took to taking drugs and drinking and swearing! Only a few years ago I was working as a cleaner, but now I'm studying programming and media technology at the best technical University in the UK. Now if I can identify with this film's realism (and I live in England) why can't so many others? This film is a veritable jewel. The script is one of the best I've ever seen. The way it mixes thought provoking ideas and witticisms with the kind of colloquial dialogue which we have read in things like ?The Catcher in the Rye'. Now I agree with the sentiment that some people have put across, ?get in touch with your inner Robin Williams'. But thankfully the script or Gus Van Sant or whatever prevented it from going over board. Look at the final scene where they're hugging and saying their farewells. Now this could have overlapped into a typical slushy moment, but no the lines `Doesn't this contravene the Doctor, patient relationship?' `Only if you grab my ass' were uttered so as to diffuse it. Then bear in mind that you never actually see the reunion between Skylar and Will! I could go on forever arguing against people's criticisms. But what's the point if certain viewers can't appreciate the subtly evocative direction of Van Sant, the quick fire script and the superb performances by the cast. It's these same viewers who shall, until the end of their days sit and watch the vacuous outpourings of Hollywood mainstream. Let them watch this ?chewing gum for the mind' and we discerning few will lap up the droplets of quality cinema. I think a quote is in order here directed to all you viewers who deemed this film boring or unrealistic `If ignorance is bliss, there should be more happy people.'</fullReview>

Only the fact that there is so much bad language and for Titanic being released in the same year this would have swept the boards in the Oscars!I hate Robin Williams as a comedian, but i was in tears after watching his timeless performance. I love most of the classic movies but this is definitely the best film i have ever seenMat Damon played a great part, showing the full spectrum of emotions in his role.I've ever gone out and bought the soundtrack to the film, i've watched it half a dozen times and always go right through to the final credits.Pure brilliance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, soul-touching experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Good Will Hunting in February of '98. It blew me away. I happily disregard comments by people who say: "The probability of something like that happening..." This film is bold in that giving Will such a mind colors outside of the lines. It simply aims to tell a story. It is a beautiful story told in a magnificent manner. Robin Williams was superb in his role, his effect on Damon electric. Minnie Driver and Matt Damon's on-screen chemistry was undeniable. More films like this one are needed. And yes, the ending was predictable. That made it perfect. I wouldn't have had it any other way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a screenplay, whose script was written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon and sold for $ 600,000. (They split the proceeds)I love this movie. I have seen it several times, and I still want more at the end (Isn't that what good movies do to you?) The subplots make for mini-movies of their own, especially the interplay between Robin Williams' character and Stellan Skarsgard's character.Damon's real life buddy Affleck plays that same buddy role in GWH, and provides the definition for true friendship.Minnie Driver is compelling, and I just love a couple of scenes when she and Damon are in a novelty store, and another where she is telling a joke in a bar with Damon, Affleck and friends. The love story which develops with Driver is very convincing, and it's "under the surface" portrayal plus input from one of our favorite characters makes for one of the best definitions of intimacy I have ever seen on film.When I see some of the movies in IDB's top 250, I am sad that this movie isn't in there, but that is my opinion. Torn between GWH and Rounders as Damon's best movie, though I think GWD plays to a wider audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Pals Make Good in Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon and Ben Affleck scored quite a success with their interesting and entertaining script. The introduction and exposition sections are enormously engrossing, after which script peaks and rather coasts along the rest of the way. Yet, the casting is so well done, and the acting at such good level, that interest is nicely maintained.What "Hunting" essentially consists of is some two dozen conversational scenes, bridged together with short transitions of physical activity. What is rather remarkable is that one isn't aware of the dramatic limitations comprising the structure. This is a real tribute to the cast, director, and of course, the script. While the basic situation is really quite far-fetched, it is made to seem plausible--again, the mark of good, convincing writing. The story behind getting the script sold and produced on the terms of the writers' preferences is fascinating. Still, one can't really call it luck, for both Damon and Affleck "paid their dues" -- and success did not just fall into their laps. These are two talented young men, with perseverance; and how wonderful for them to have achieved such success while still youthful and full of vitality. "Good Will Hunting" is a good production, with solid craftsmanship in all departments -- thanks to the creativity of Damon and Affleck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Genius In Our Midst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many personal projects of our best players never come out quite right. The vision they have somehow doesn't translate to the screen, or it's not box office subject matter, or maybe the actors aren't gifted with writing or directing talent. That's certainly not the case with Good Will Hunting which was not only the breakthrough film for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but it will probably remain their most personal endeavor. Not too much imagination was required though because these guys set this film in their native Boston the city they grew up in, the city they seem to know every nook and cranny of. They didn't even have to lose the New England accents they would have to in most of their other films.When Matt and Ben wrote Good Will Hunting the fact they were able to interest a top director like Gus Van Sant in the project should have said something before one views a frame of film. Van Sant got an Oscar nominated performance for Matt Damon and a Supporting Actor Oscar for Robin Williams as the psychologist who counsels Damon.Will Hunting is this average lower middle class kid from South Boston who was in the foster care system and suffered a lot of abuse while growing up. He has some low level jobs, he's constantly getting in trouble with the law for minor scrapes, and he's a functioning genius who for kicks solves a highly complex mathematical equation between buffing floors at MIT.Which perks the interest of Stellan Skarsgaard highly touted mathematics professor there. He feels and I agree with him that one of the worst sins in the world is wasting the talent the Deity blesses you with, whatever it is. After a succession of therapists who are unable to cope with Damon's genius, Robin Williams gets his turn at bat.Robin Williams one of the wildest, wackiest, most innovative comics that ever walked the earth, drops all of that to deliver a highly sensitive performance as the psychologist who finally reaches Damon on some level. What Damon does with it is for you to see Good Will Hunting for.Some of that breakthrough is achieved with the help of Minnie Driver, a British student at Harvard who falls hard for the blue collar Will Hunting. Most of it is achieved though in the film's key scene as Ben Affleck tells him that no matter what your IQ is, if you don't use it and move up and on, you're the stupidest guy here. It's one of Affleck's best scenes in his whole career on film.I've known a few Will Huntings in my day, blessed with talent I would like to have had and who threw it away for a combination of reasons. One in particular I knew back in the Eighties was a kid who originally grew up in Virginia in the Blue Ridge Mountain country to some really uneducated hicks. They discovered he was gay and immediately had him committed. Back in the day, they did all kinds of things to him like electroshock therapy and guess what, it all didn't work. But it left him a twisted and bitter person who gravitated to the new gay rights movement because it was something that finally validated him as a human being.He also was blessed with an incredible baritone singing voice, he could have sang opera had that been trained instead of his parents trying to change his orientation. But when I last saw him in the middle Eighties no one had or could reach him. He made a living running a cleaning service for apartments. If he couldn't sing militant songs of protest he wasn't interested, even if he could have reached millions more with his issues had he studied, learned, and developed.Unlike Will Hunting, Jimmy Flowers wasn't reached as far as I know. But Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in writing their Oscar winning original screenplay could have known him. So I'm sure they won't mind if I dedicated this review to Jimmy whether he's alive or no longer with us. I'm sure there are Jimmy Flowers and Will Huntings that we've all known and hopefully we have the wit to recognize the talent whatever it is and the encouraging nature to make people develop that talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I had to go see about a girl"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that you cant help walking away from without being touched in some way. All of the central themes to adult life are explored and exposed by a very good cast. Friendship, love, pain, the past holding back who we could be in the present, acceptance (or not) of our place in society."Good Will Hunting" is the story of Will Hunting played by Matt Damon. He is a young man who is a mathematical genius but has no formal education and who is so traumatised by his past that he will not allow himself to be the man he could with his talents. Will works as a Janitor, but chose the Massachusetts institute of technology (the finest mathematical institution in America as we are told) as the place to work in order to be close to an outlet for his brilliance. Early on in the story, the resident Maths guru Professor Gerry Lambeau sets a problem for his students to solve which should take the whole semester for the average mind. When this problem is solved and written on the faculty blackboard the very next morning, he sets another that took him personally two years to solve. The following day he is conversing with a colleague when he witnesses Will writing down the perfect solution on the blackboard again. The Professor realises he has a genius hiding in his midst.When Will is later involved in a fight, he is eventually given the choice between a short prison term or working with the Professor on a daily basis and also attending psychiatric therapy sessions. Will chooses the latter but uses the therapy sessions as a chance to mock the Psychiatrists assigned to him and show off his knowledge. When no one else will work with him, Professor Lambeau turns to his old room mate at college, Sean MacGuire (played by Robin Williams on Oscar winning form.) who manages to reach the boy emotionally and start to repair the damage that has been done to him.It is widely known that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck co wrote the screen play as a reaction to their slow progress in establishing Hollywood careers. It is a testament to their talent as writers that they came up with so many touching scenes and passages of dialogue. In particular, Williams monologue to Damon when sat on the park bench is sublime. Wills relationship with "Skylar" (played by Minnie Driver) is perfectly believable and as the story unfolds the viewer can see the change in Wills character from the cocky kid, pushing everyone away, to the young man who understands who he could be with the right encouragement.There are very few flaws to be found in this film, largely because the story is so well told and Robin Williams performance is worth the entry price alone. It is a genuinely touching experience which relates to so many people and is easy to empathise with in real life. The characters are richly written and they are all interdependent in the telling of the proceedings. You really care what happens to these people.I could "nick pick" and draw attention to the psychiatrist scenes in Robert Redfords "Ordinary People" (1980) which bear close resemblance to the ones in "Good Will Hunting" but I think Damon and Affleck just took the bar up another notch with their interpretation of the Doctor / Patient working relationship.All in all an uplifting and worthwhile movie going experience which will stay with you long after you leave the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It`s Not Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is about mathematical geniuses that get the critics juices flowing ? A BEAUTIFUL MIND wasn`t up to much in my opinion ( FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserved the Oscar that year ) while GOOD WILL HUNTING had several awards lavished on it undeservedlyFirst off is the script . When I attended film school I was told GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very good example on how not to start a script and the tutor was right . This movie lacks any type of opening hook and for the most part it`s very very slow . If you wrote an unsolicited script like this the script reader would have given up on it by page 15Structure aside the idea of a member of the American underclass being some sort of intellectual god doesn`t really ring true . Ask yourself this : If he`s the cleverst character in the movie how come he`s gone through his short life without anyone noticing his abilities ? Not one single teacher from his childhood noticed his gift ? Highly unlikely as is the fact he`s read so much mind expanding litrature . And if Will`s so clever how come he`s so oblivous of what happens to young good looking boys in American prisons ?But it`s the casting that let much of the film down . You want to get a couple of actors to play rough tough Irish gang members ? Let`s get Matt Damon and Ben Affleck which is like getting Russell Crowe to play a pacifist or Charles Bronson to play a liberal do gooder . I failed to be convinced by the foul mouthed Damon and Affleck as they strutted about smacking people in the chops and couldn`t help thinking that even though they wrote the script the parts should have been awarded to different actors , after all Billy Bob Thornton has written screenplays for films he hasn`t been cast in and the same criteria should have been applied hereThere are some good points to the movie . Robin Williams is excellent as the man who tries to show Will his potential and also very good is Stellan Skarsgard who is quite simply one of the greatest character actors to stepped foot outside of Europe and despite my previous criticism of the script there is quite a moving piece of dialogue at the park as Williams character explains to Will what he has seen in lifeBut I`ve got to repeat that there`s less plus points than negatives to this movie and I`ve got to agree with the people who`ve said GOOD WILL HUNTING is boring and unconvincing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Putting aside the tiresome word-play in the title, the main character seems anything but 'good' ... he just seems like a smug, arrogant little pr*ck! He's almost insufferable as he poses for close-ups under perfect lighting and blows puffs of smoke in the direction of the camera.We know he's clever because he does mathematical formulas on the bathroom mirror in a bar ... yawn.It seems highly unlikely that a college professor would have any influence on a courtroom's judgement. To me it was an unlikely and rather weak plot twist.He is then trotted before an array of therapists whom he tries his best to irritate ... why? If he's so clever why would he harm his chance of being kept out of jail; it makes no sense whatsoever. Just for the sake of having an attitude problem that can be unfurled in the course of the story... does this make it edgy?Then he comes across Robin Williams' character and, gee ... do you think they'll end up as friends who change each others lives in some profound way? Gosh I just don't know.Following is a parade of over-the-top dramatics and character evaluations that really become tiresome as everyone's sob story unfolds.It skips across academic topics like the synopsis of a "for dummies" book: the most basic snippets of knowledge thrown in here and there. "Next week we'll be talking about Freud ...", oh please! Was it the first day of Psyche 101?Why was Affleck's character sitting in some sort of job interview? So random. The chemistry between Damon and Minnie Driver was non-existent. Williams and Driver were good in this, but with such a dismal script ... they did what they could.I don't think this film has aged very well at all, and I'm truly baffled about why this amateurish dramatic for the sake of it production has been so overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So unrealistic that it hurts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is a story about a 20 year old MIT janitor named Will Hunting (played by Matt Damon). The not-so-flashy hobbies of Mr. Hunting include hanging out with his friends, telling jokes, drinking beer and starting fist fights. But you know what? He's also stupefyingly gifted at mathematics. Will seems to know math better than anyone else in the world, including a Field-medal awarded professor with whom he talks in the movie, just because he has heard some MIT lectures and read a couple of books.Sounds realistic? No it doesn't. What the movie loses in it's realism, it aims to gain in it's emotional power. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote this story of the hardships of a mathematical genius the way they did to make a typical moviegoer identify him/herself with the main character. At it's core, Good Will Hunting is a collection of very finely executed drama: romance, violence, fight against authorities. You name it, GWH has it. The level of acting offered by Damon, Affleck, Skarsg?rd and Driver is good. Robin Williams is excellent.The movie contains a reference to Srinivasa Ramanujan, a mathematical prodigy from a poor Indian background, who astonished the world with his unconventional theories in the early 20th century. This real life genius received a big book about advanced trigonometry from his teacher at age 10, came to understand it fully by the age of 13 and dedicated the rest of his life to mathematical research.If Hunting was portrayed as an eccentric like Ramanujan and if his mathematical abilities were an integral part of the character's way of seeing the world, this movie wouldn't probably have had as much viewers as it ended up having, but it could have had some depth and believability.Sadly Hunting's mathematical/logical abilities are only portrayed in scenes in which he draws some diagrams on paper or chalkboard. It's understandable that creating a superbly talented mind entirely from scratch is hard for writers who are not mathematical geniuses. You might ask then, why did Damon &amp; Affleck choose to write a story about a mathematical genius in the first place? Had they chosen any other type of talent, they would very probably have been able to create a more convincing character. My guess is that they did that simply because mathematical abilities are often seen as something mystical and mystical abilities draw in crowd to theaters.I had high hopes for Good Will Hunting. Sadly this movie is embarrassingly childish and sentimental collection of audience luring issues with very little credibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh please. What was the hype with this movie? It was yet more formulaic, contrived, saccharine, vacuous tripe.Many comments seem to refer to how 'moving' it was - a reference to the film's overly effusive pouting. What ever happened to subtlety?And why go for such 'authentic' language in such an unrealistic film which never gains any credibility outside something being shot in a Hollywood studio?And this features so highly on the top 250 list??? Ye gods, watch some films which manage to genuinely convey some emotions a little closer to the world we live in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Bluffing - An Adolescent Smugfest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Hollywood is trying to grasp what an "intelligent person" is like, they fail so miserably, finding it hard putting words in the mouth of the purported "genius".Right, any genius walks around trying to rub in his superiority at every instance. Sure, they hang out in bars and pick fights ? it's not like they are (generalizing wildly) autistic nerds who never have a tan.Plus, if you are a genius you know all about Math and History and Politics and of course you're constantly up to date with current events and a thorough analysis of them. Coz these things, like, all go together n stuff, y'know?Plus, you walk around with a smirk all the time. You are just a smug son of a you-know-what, that's how it is, y'all. And of course you smoke, like someone who never smoked before, but you smoke coz it's like cool n stuff, y'know. And you're different. That is understood.And of course you can fight ? you're a bully. A bully who finds time to study 10.000 books whenever he doesn't lift weights. And whenever he doesn't smoke or drink beer because he follows a strict health regimen.And you date a 30-something college student ? Minnie Driver. Well, I won't even comment Matt Damon. Team America has hit the nail on the head already.This movie is a daydream of a Beavis &amp; Butthead type student (in other words 95% of them): "Yeah, that's what I would be like if I was a genius." But stupid people and stupid authors in this case cannot imagine the lives of geniuses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely dissapointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't understand why people like this film.The basic concept was great, but it could have been SO much better.It fails on many levels:1: The basic story makes no sense. Will Hunting is shown to possess not just intelligence, but extreme awareness of a vast, VAST body of literature. He can quote obscure books in psychology, economics, art, etc etc etc Here's a news flash: this kind of knowledge doesn't come from innate intelligence, it also requires incredible amounts of reading. So when did Will supposedly do all this reading? we see him depicted as a working-class goof-off who spends his time carousing with his friends and getting into fights. Sorry, but that doesn't compute. At all.2: The direction and editing is terrible. All of the key moments go by as if they weren't even important. The end of the movie just leaves you saying, "Huh?....." But my, aren't the lead actors good looking? That, and the superb performance by Robin Williams are all that can be said for this amateur effort. But what do I know....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many fans, so little to show for it. I know, I know, these words are gonna find me in a great minority. A lot of people really liked Good Will Hunting. But seriously please, great film making, not even close, and let's put the blame where it belongs... in the writing.Now, I know they won an oscar for it, and boy did they look good emoting on the screen. But Good Will Hunting is an ABC after school special with lots of cursing in it, and a slightly bigger budget.What this movie does show, is the brilliance of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures. Mr. Weinstein could take manure, feed it to you, and make you believe your eating bon bons. And that's exactly what the studio did with the film. They created such high faluttin buzz around it, that people believed, and wanted to believe it so much --- that they saw brilliance where there was none.Now, I know some people think it's a great movie, I don't think it's a horribly bad movie, I like to compare it to more in the middle of the road movies, and also to some great Made for TV movies (although, not HBO films, HBO films are unusually better than Good Will Hunting would ever be.) It's just a nice, little film, with some good performances, Robin Williams was not good in it, they just gave him the oscar cause the'd been itching to do it for a while. And of course, the Miramax public relations machine secured Ben and Matt their screenwriting oscar... but come one people... there's better movies out there thatn GWH.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not surprised that so many people fell for this one. When I was watching this movie, a couple viewers next to me sobbed whenever you're "supposed" to sob -- or at least feel "touched". Like when Hunting said he didn't love the girl. Like when Robin Williams' character (sorry I forgot his role's name) was telling Hunting repeatedly "It's not your fault" (oh Lord, just thinking of that scene gives me the goosebumps). I couldn't have cared less for what would happen to the characters. Many people sob for Hollywood manufactured characters they can't even relate to (think Titanic; Yuck!)... but it really only made me cringe and want to get out of the theatre. I guess I simply refuse to be psychically and emotionally manipulated by all this.Folks it's not me who's being condescending ... those characters are, and for no good reason because they're unreal. Worse yet, nothing is new or surprising. Even Robin Williams' character is all cliched.I gave it 1 out of 10. It's probably not that bad; it's just quite mediocre... but so many people went to the other extreme and gave it a 10 so I figured a single balancing vote won't hurt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*POSSIBLE EARLY FILM SPOILERS*After watching this movie, I plan to file suit against Damon &amp; Affleck to get my two hours back.The characters are thoroughly unrealistic; never in my life have I met anyone who was anything like these people. Damon is thoroughly unconvincing as either a genius or a blue-collar working stiff, and certainly not as a combination of the two. Affleck is completely script dependent yet again, portraying one of his weakest characters yet. And Williams is at his worst.Please, Robin, stick to comedy and playing psychopaths, that's what you're good at. Not "serious" drama.But the sad thing? It's pretty obvious that neither Damon or Affleck took much college-level math. That first problem Will Hunting solves in the hallway can be done with just graph theory, combinatorics, and a little linear algebra. The first problem was trivial; anyone with some discrete math background should be able to solve it. Please, aspiring screenwriters, don't underestimate your audience. You never know who might be watching.</fullReview>

This is Hollywood at its "Indie" best. Trying to pretend that some of their hot properties can be artistic as well. The only problem is that this film is so painfully average and predictable, that few film festivals would have given it the time of day, had it not been for the writers. The story is an old one, just set in a bit of a different setting. Young tough, down on his luck, born poor, no future, gets opportunity and betters himself. Ahhh, what a "feel good" story. Please! I just love the scene in the bar where Will shows up the cocky Harvard kid on his knowledge of American History. Damon reels off one of the most laughable historical arguments in American History. The information is accurate, but the source is ludicrous. There is no way that his character could make such an argument, even if he had read the authors and understood them. He showed knowledge of the Harvard curriculum that even someone in the Liberal Arts Department would not know. It just strained credibility as this whole movie does. It was an average at best movie that was hyped into a masterpiece. I dismiss the Academy, because I know how the Hollywood Insider game is played. I mean, come on, Kim Bassinger and Mira Sorvino have an Academy! LOL! I mean, Beverly Hills Cop won for best screenplay, even though it had been passed around for five years. In reality, this film is ** out of ****. However, did you know that Matt and Ben wrote it? **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awful, nauseating, egotistical, pretentious, amateurish. With God-Like Intelligence and Wisdom, Will Hunting's character is established as he mops the school floor. Without wringing the mop or placing a warning sign for slippery surface, Will carelessly slops water toward several students. If he was so intelligent, it seems to me that he would be able to mop a floor correctly. This is truly a horrible movie on many levels. How does he know everything? We don't see him reading and amassing his encyclopedic knowledge. It appears that Matt Damon spends more time grooming his cute hair-do than perusing mathematics tomes at the library. Ben Affleck was terrible..he is truly a bad actor. Robin Williams was the only bright spot in this black hole of a movie.

		<shortDescription>An over-rated drama for popular culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's very predictable that a movie like this would soon be placed into that undefined category of "good" recent movies, which includes any film having the smallest bit of sincerity and meaning. The fact that the popular trend is toward the visual and that special effects are replacing plots and subtle nuances tends to lead the average viewer to the opinion that any film that attempts these is a grand effort. This is not true. "Good Will Hunting" does not even have a well-defined plot, but that fits into the movie acceptably: it's an extraordinary man's search for himself through love, psychoanalysis, and philosophy. The premier problem is that the movie overplays it's best card: Matt Damon's(character's) incredible brain. There is a certain point at which the audience should halt its fascination at his mental profencies and sigh in boredom. It's unfortunate that this was not the case for most theaters. Though the meaning of life and gifted individuals are good themes for movies, they are not original, and this "tear-jerker" makes no unique contributions to either idea. In fact, if you want to see real meaning in a popular movie, rent "Rocky", a title which many supposed "film experts" would probably not want to admit conveys deeper human meaning than most "good" movies, like (appropriately) Good Will Hunting. Shame on you, movie fans, for falling in love with such a butchered attempt at profundity.</fullReview>

It only goes to show that no matter how great the accolades or how high the rating you can still end up watching the most appalling drivel, dressed up as some kind of worthwhile exercise in entertainment. Bulls balls, last night I watched "in Bruges" and it was very good, a million miles away from this Oscar winning (substitute prohibited word).OK so now I must get down to a serious criticism of the movie, based on twenty five minutes and twenty seven seconds, after which I couldn't stomach it any more. Where do I start? Hollywood in its purest form is a place (a fantasy) where we are taken and everything is wonderful. But this kind of Hollywood is just a pretend world which is not real and not uplifting either, it neither corresponds to an ideal or a real, it is just pap. It is a depressed fantasy of a reality that never existed. The idea that you have a genius cleaning a college corridor and filling out maths equations on a blackboard, and then having a verbal fist fight with a student at a bar by quoting lots of long words and phrases at him, which will really impress the girl at the bar with the English accent is just so lame, why would anybody think that that was cleaver. Is this film just patronising uneducated but intelligent people or what, I don't know. I give up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not So Good Will Hunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is a story about a genius who for various reasons has not been able to take advantage of this and, when we are introduced to him in the film, is working as a cleaner at a university. This guy's name is Will Hunting and he is played by Matt Damon. He solves a ridiculously difficult maths problem and is found by a maths teacher at the school played by Stellan Skarsg?rd. And it goes from there.I think that if I had watched this movie when it was released, prior to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's careers, I would've been able to enjoy it much more. Since they have both written the script and play leading roles in the film it's hard not to judge it with this in mind. Neither Damon nor Affleck appear to be people who would pick fights, rather they appear to be people who would avoid something like that to a large extent in order to not danger their good looks. They are very much cast against type, but that ties in with the fact that most likely one of the main reasons they wrote this script was to shape roles for themselves to launch their respective careers. I would have no problem with this, if this was a good movie, which unfortunately, it is not. Minnie Driver also is not good looking enough for her part to be believable.Gus Van Sant is one of my favorite directors, although I find his later more "experimental" movies - like Elephant, Paranoid Park and Psycho - much more rewarding as opposed to his earlier work which is more conventional and main stream. The main problem with this film though lies within the script, so I suppose he did what he could with what he was given in this case. For a movie to be entertaining, gripping and interesting, you need a conflict. I fail to find such a thing in this motion picture, and I did look for it the entire running time.It is a mystery as to what you are supposed to feel for the main character in this film. It is hard to feel pity for him since he himself is the main obstacle to getting what he wants, success, money, respect and so on. Many people try to help him but he fights them with all he has got. He has the personality of a spoiled brat (funny enough that in the picture this is the very opposite of what he is supposed to be: A poor bastard who has had to fight his way to survive). It is also hard to identify with him since a very small percentage of the viewers of this film are geniuses who has not had to lift a finger to get where they are.It's easier to understand the problems of this movie if you compare it to a film about a similar subject which actually works. In Rain Man the main character truly is pitiful. His fate is a sad one since he is gifted but his disability has rendered him unable to interact normally with other people. The film is gripping since the viewer feels for the main character and his brother trying so desperately to reach him and find a place for him in this world.In a word you can sum up this film as plastic or fake: It's a pseudo-intellectual movie of the worst sort, it tries to go deep but only scratches the surface. A positive: Robin Williams does a great job with his role, he always seems to do better when he is given a serious part to play. When I saw Matt Damon in this film all I could think of was his involuntary part in Team America: World Police. "MATT DAMON!". Even though he was played by a doll in that film, his part seemed more real than in Good Will Hunting.</fullReview>

Furthermore, the "psychological" side of the story is simple and really contains nothing new or interesting (basically, it's the story of a normal guy who's had some issues in his life, who reads avidly and has a great interest in math, yet somehow does not even know the names of the theorems he makes use of in his "proofs"). Wishful thinking from people with little to no background in science, and ignorant enough to believe that Will's level of knowledge is possible without study.

For me that says it all. Little imagination, laughably hackneyed worn out characters and a plot with more holes in it than a sieve.We are expected to swallow the fact that he knows more about law, history, mathematics and English literature than the 'experts' we are haplessly presented with in these various fields. OK but how on earth does he achieve this from the public library while holding down a full time job and apparently cultivating lasting friendships with the ne'erdowells with whom he associates, relationships, we are also expected to believe led him regularly into trouble with the authorities?Anyone who knows the 'genius fallen by the wayside' scenario in real life knows only too well that there is never a happy ending. There is no sweet little Robin Williamsesque professor just waiting in the background to help him through it all. It is just painfully stupid Hollywood fluff, he even gets the girl.

Let me tell you, the moment when (Robin Williams) was talking about his wife who farted till she waked herself up, the joke of the girl in the caf about old people's love, the damn never-ending lecture about genius guys (which seems copied, as it is, from many books), all of that are little instances for how disgusting and boring this movie is. Actually, this is what lived from it with the poor me. And when it comes to its cast, then let me bleed with hate; (Ben Affleck) is underrated actor, he is, since he isn't cursed appropriately yet! (Minnie Driver) is one of the silliest and ugliest human beings I have ever seen, I can't imagine people stand her, and if there are any, call me out. (Matt Damon) is so cold and unconvincing in mostly all what he does. There is a good story there but totally murdered by adolescent script and provocatively mute direction. Nothing is beautiful in this movie. And while it's supposed to be touchy it totally isn't. Save the scene of (Affleck) talking about missing his friend I didn't enjoy anything. Enough to say that after its ending I blamed myself hardly for setting all through it, and after 10 years I still do.

So, when some dumb kid sees this movie, he's suppost to say to himself, "You know, I'm not as smart as Will. I'm more like his friend. So, I really shouldn't worry about succeeding in life. Like Ben Affleck's character, I should be happy working construction while my smart friend needs to get motivated and succeed." Granted, the movie does not focus on this, but this theme is definitely present, and extractable. By the way, the math that genius Will does is quite simple. Matrices? MacLaurin series? come on.

The plot - if it can be called that - was both pointless and ridiculous. The acting involved getting a bunch of immature people to sit around calling each other names. I can't imagine ever recommending this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams Stole Burt Reynolds Oscar!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This awful movie made a lot of money, but that doesn't mean it was good, as a matter of fact it was excruciating. Yet another over rated movie that was simply painful and boring to watch. This story is so preposterous, poorly acted it makes me crazy. This is an insult to cinema goers,with Robin Williams playing the same character he did in Dead Poets Society, Awakenings and Patch Adams and for that alone it is just plain despicable. No other film was as clichd and pathetic as this was. I cannot remember a film so pointless and laughable as this dreadful movie was. In a year of so many horrible films, this was the worst excuse for a film I can think of. This film was so torturous I cannot put it into words. I detested every second. I am mad that I wasted my life by seeing this idiotic film. That is when you know a movie is bad.And to top it off Robin Williams Stole Burt Reynolds Oscar (Boogie Nights)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting could have been an average movie, but it's nothing more than a ($%#)... bad movie. there is nothing you can relate to, it is full of cliche's ... Mat Damon is an awful actor (may be acceptable in some C-production 'hi-school-reunion-kids-got-drunk-movie'). screenplay... well he had an idea... initially - when he was (they were) around page 2 or 3 of the script... and than he took a $4.95 or so 'Screenplay for dummies'... if he didn't do that - this may be almost average movie. this way it is AWFULL and overrated... Robin Williams... Robin... oh the guy who acts 'dead poet's society' each time he sees the camera? even if it is the camera in the K-Marts.... don't mention it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From reading reviews of this film I could not figure out why anyone would want to see it, so I didn't bother. As fate would have it though I happened to be on a plane when it was shown as the in-flight movie and so I got to check it out.I have to say that my view might be influenced by the awful mangling that films get before being unleashed on the flying public. Firstly, all swearwords are either removed or changed to something different, often with hilarious results. (When I saw Money Train "mother-f*!@er" had been changed to "mother-fouler". I think the original was preferable, don't you?) Secondly, anything that resembles a swearword, such as "oh dear" and "my, my, how distressing", is removed. Thirdly, anything of a sexual nature is removed. Ultra-violence is left in and I believe the airlines have a special arrangement whereby extra scenes of violence can be inserted. Finally the colour is distorted, the sound passed fifteen times through a bucket of slime using 1920's technology and the whole thing is projected onto a screen the size of a postage stamp which is half obscured by a person in a big hat. So you have to bear in mind that these things could jaundice my views.The film, as everyone in the world knows, revolves around a young mathematical genius who works as a janitor until he is discovered by a professor and sent to a shrink. Will Hunting is played by an attractive young man who everyone raves about but whose name escapes me. Robin Williams, almost acting for the first time in his life, is the shrink who shows him tough love. An attractive young woman with an English accent whose name escapes me plays Will's girlfriend. Other characters drift in and out of the film.So this young genius gets discovered, has a few traumas along the way, teaches his prof and his shrink things they had not realised themselves and they all live happily ever after. End of film.About half way through the film I began to get interested when Will Hunting actually started to show some anger and treated his girlfriend with casual cruelty. Unfortunately this only lasted about ten seconds before we went back to everyone being nice and speaking in clichs. If only they'd let rip at this point, what a film it could have been. It could be that the airline cut out thirty minutes of dark and dangerous stuff but I don't think so somehow.Let's have a reality check here shall we? A young man grows up in poverty and is abused by his parents whilst secretly being not only a mathematical genius but also an expert on diverse other academic fields and able to wipe the floor with all comers. His other poor friends all have hearts of gold, club together to buy him a car and feel not the slightest resentment towards him. In a matter of weeks he seduces a conveniently rich young woman, solves the secrets of the universe, gets offered jobs worth zillions of dollars despite lacking formal qualifications and being fashionably anti-establishment, finds a therapist who is not him/herself dysfunctional, heals his inner child and rides off into the sunset in a glow of sickly-sweet ickyness. I don't think so.I didn't like the in-your-face manipulation of this film, directed by a dazzling young person whose name escapes me. I didn't like the clichd and hackneyed script. I didn't like the glib solutions to really tough personal problems. This was just the American Dream in another version. We all have some hidden talent and when we decide to follow our dream we will be rich and happy beyond our wildest imaginings. The fact that we received emotional and physical traumas that would cripple the average person for this lifetime and their next fourteen reincarnations can be overcome. We can heal our lives. Hallelujah! Actually, if I saw this on late night television and I'd had a few beers I'd probably quite enjoy it. But it does not deserve the massive hype and Oscar wins that it has received. No way</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A math genius works as a janitor at MIT, unable to overcome his difficult upbringing. The premise of this film is ludicrous. It really requires suspension of belief to buy that Damon, who never attended college, has become a genius by reading books. The pretentious and manipulative script by Damon and Afleck really reaches: not only can he do complex math problems, but he can hold his own with anyone when discussing politics, philosophy, economics, literature, and history. We are supposed to root for Damon, but he's such an arrogant jerk that one roots for someone to punch him out. Williams is fine as a psychologist, but it's a role he has played a number of times. Driver does well as Damon's needy girlfriend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodish Will Hunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm aware of the significance of this movie in bringing Matt Damon and Ben Affleck to prominence not only as actors but as screenwriters and watched it with a degree of expectation. However the story of Damon's rebellious, tortured working-class genius flowering in the rarefied hot-house atmosphere of Boston's Harvard University didn't quite engage me, despite some good acting.The story is implausible in the extreme, as Damon's gifted character shyly but deliberately puts himself forward to get noticed by answering a difficult mathematical problem on display in the halls of the university and then follows his difficult progress to self- awareness which he ultimately achieves through encountering burn-out been there-done that psychologist Robin Williams and a pretty but feisty Anglophile student, played by Minnie Driver.I was entertained by the movie but felt its mix of low comedy (profanity is frequent, especially when Damon gets down with his gang of fellow low-lifes which includes best mate Chuckie, played by Affleck) with heightened psychological drama didn't always convince. Naturally, Damon gets off to a frosty start with last-resort Willams and even more naturally they open up to each other before the tears really flow in one of the movie's well signposted climaxes further down the line. Ditto the obvious conclusion too when Damon finally lets his heart rule his head.It's well acted although at times it seems pretty stagy, with lots of male-bonding and man- hugs on board. Damon is believable as the gifted misfit but overdoes the angst at times. I didn't quite get Affleck as the goofy sidekick and got the impression he was cast for the part because he wrote it. Williams is good as the broken-down professor but his winsomeness and adoration of his deceased wife grate a bit by the end, Spencer Tracy he's not and while Driver is okay in her part, I didn't really feel the attraction between her and Damon..In the end, while the film engaged me enough, it did seem to me somewhat overrated and didn't quite take me fully on Will's journey to rehabilitation and spiritual redemption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is so good about this film? I hated this film with so many reasons. The hero,Matt Damon is a handsome genius with early life trauma,so he is allowed to do anything and using foul language and fist fighting and all that gives him extra charm. But he seemed like either a complete hypocrite or a artifice-made-to-plot to me. If all he wanted in life was getting drunk and fight why did he choose to work in the university(what a convenient place to be noticed for the sake of story) as a janitor in the first place? Why not burger king? With the vast knowledge and deep insight in politics, economics and psycho-analysis, why wasn't he able to get over with his own problem?And that counselling session, learn-from-each other and klick!problem solved!!! No, it's so schematic and unconvincing as the whole film. I totally agree on the user comment(what an arrogant...) During the film, listening to their ping-pong talk, I thought of Forrest Gump. Despite all the flaws and non-sensical coincidences, I think Forrest Gump is a very moving film. If you ask the differences of the two films, I would say:surrealism vs pseudo-realismrunning(release of freedom,metaphor of advance, hope)vs talking(do you know what you are talking about?)Ideal simpleton and whiny, pretentious genius.Should've watched on big screen, wouldn't have watched on video.</fullReview>

The point of the entire frame was to get Matt Damon and Robin Williams in the same room. They could've saved so much time shortening it. The rest was just transport. Everything about the kids life was uninteresting. The silliest sob story. His relationship with the Harvard girl was a yawn-fest. Bad acting. I'm a liberal, so they were preaching to the choir, but even I found the long liberal speeches a bore. People don't talk like that. There's a rule in fiction... show don't tell. They forgot that rule. How did this film get nominated for nine Oscars, including best picture?!? This is first year English major level of writing. So bad dialogue. Such a weak contrived script. It tries to make some blindingly obvious points about it sucking to be poor. This is not news. Also... everybody was hot and sexy with a smoking hot body. Not believable at all. Just took me right out of it. Both me and my girlfriend sat with dropped jaws wondering how this got so high ratings. The good acting does not save this film. Yes, there's some top notch fine acting here. Both Matt Damon and Robin Williams to stellar performances. Stellan Skarsg?rd, who I know is a good actor, couldn't save his silly role.

		<shortDescription>F***, Will Hunting (the character) isn't that f***ing good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't usually talk like that; I'm just poking fun at the characters in the film. If you find that blurb offensive you'd better skip this movie."Good Will Hunting" (1997) tells the story of a young genius, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who comes from a tough neighborhood in South Boston and works as a janitor at MIT. A Math professor, Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg?rd), posts a difficult problem on the board and is amazed to discover that Will solves it. Will gets in trouble with the law but Lambeau gives succor and enlists the help of psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to get him on the right path. Meanwhile Will is falling for a Harvard girl (Minnie Driver).The plot of a genius janitor is great and I thought I'd like the film more than I did, but a couple of things really bog it down. For one, Will Hunting is not a "good" person, as the title suggests (I'm sure they were being ironic). In fact, he's so smart he's stupid. Doesn't he know that smoking will destroy his body and send him to an early grave? But that's the least of Will's shortcomings. He's arrogant and unnecessarily mean. For instance, Professor Lambeau visits him in jail and Will's first words are, "What the f*** do you want?" Could anyone be that stupid? How about, "Hi, I'm Will. Who are you, Sir?" I get it -- he's from a tough neighborhood and was abused as a kid, but 99% of guys from tough neighborhoods who were abused as kids don't talk unnecessary sheet like Will does in this film. In fact, too much of the cussing rings untrue. Will and his three friends from South Boston (including Ben Affleck) use the f-word practically every other word and it strikes an inauthentic chord. Yes, I get it -- they're trying to act like hooligans from a rough neighborhood -- but they try too hard and it comes off contrived. I should add that I hail from a hooligan-oriented neighborhood where the gang cussed, drank &amp; smoked like sailors, but even we could construe eight words together without throwing in the f-word. I have no problem with realistic cussing in films; in fact, I prefer it. But when it's so over-the-top that it seems artificial it detracts from the drama. Furthermore, Damon doesn't LOOK like a tough guy from the wrong side of the tracks (neither does Ben, but he's a little better). Matt's miscast because he just looks too soft with his baby-face. I think he knew this because he tries too hard to be a tough punk, and it shows. The fact that the main protagonist is thoroughly unlikable takes away from the story. Who cares about some disrespectful punk who doesn't care to better himself, genius or not? As a result, the drama isn't nearly as compelling as it could've been. When Sean (Williams) finally gets Will to break at the end, I wasn't much interested. Still, if you can handle the trying-too-hard-to-appear-tough acting and dialog, "Good Will Hunting" is worth catching if you like dramas. For one, Robin Williams is great in an atypical role as a serious psycho-therapist who is able to handle Will and overcome his (genius) defense mechanisms. Skarsg?rd is also excellent. And please don't take my criticisms the wrong way because there IS some good drama in this film, but it's buried underneath contrived writing and the corresponding performances (mainly Matt and Ben).Incidentally, Minnie and Matt hooked up after this movie, so the romantic sparks are real.The film runs 126 minutes and was shot on location in Massachusetts and Toronto.GRADE: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sophomoric and over-rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Good Will Hunting" was written by and stars Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in 1997. At the time, Matt was 26 and Affleck, 25. Their young ages are reflected in the movie which is "sophomoric" and totally lacking in depth.WARNING: THERE MAY BE SMALL SPOILERSWill Hunting is a twenty year old mathematics genius who works as a janitor at M.I.T. in Boston and has severe psychological problems as a result of abusive adoptive parents. In one scene at the beginning of the movie he almost beats a former high school student colleague to death. At this point I wanted to stop watching the movie. The beating was disgusting.Will solves mathematical problems with the same ease that the average guy solves crossword puzzles but his psychological problems are an obstacle to utilizing his genius. I shall say no more about the plot except that, as expected from a sophomoric project, the ending is predictable and even banal.The movie won a number of awards including the Oscar for Best Screenplay (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) and the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (Robin Williams). In my humble opinion, the awards were a reflection of the appreciation by the movie industry that two inexperienced guys, Damon and Affleck, could pull off a full-length feature film and were not a reflection of any inherent quality in the movie. Robin Williams was much better in "Dead Poets Society" and in "Fischer King" but didn't win any oscar for these performances.Further evidence of the immaturity that so typifies this movie is the fact that the supporting cast were all chosen from family and friends: Skylar, Will Hunting's girl friend, is played by Minnie Driver who he was dating at the time. Furthermore, Hunting's screen-friends are played by Casey Affleck, Ben Affleck's brother, and by a personal friend, Cole Hauser. Neither of these screen-friends add anything to the movie.The production crew of Will Hunting is professional and the final product is slick. If you need to spend a quiet afternoon or evening watching a thoroughly forgettable movie then this is for you.</fullReview>

A mathematical super-genius who chooses to clean toilets is such a nearly impossible, outlandish premise, but we're expected to swallow it hook line and sinker. Am I supposed to relate to the poor misunderstood prodigy with the humble, blue collar heritage? This is just a typical Hollywood Cinderella fantasy relocated to Academia with some heartrending pablum tossed in for the ladies.

This movie might possibly have worked if they didn't go so ridiculously, ludicrously overboard. If they had made Damon's character even a halfway believable "genius", this might have possibly worked.

But, WTF? everybody put the negative comments about her or how ugly she is, and some people even said that she was totally miscasted. IMO, I seriously doubt that she was miscasted. Although I admit she is not the most beautiful woman in the world, she is incredibly beautiful in a very natural way, and I'm sure that the none of the Hollywood actresses could have gave a performance like she did in this film. It's little sad that the most of people only care about actresses' looks.Anyway, the movie was just great as I expected. Every single actor/actress did a great job in the film, and I still can't believe Mat and Ben wrote a whole script of the movie. It seems to me that the best part of this movie might be Minnie Driver's acting, her lovable character was definitely one of the kind, and I might be disappointed if they used a typical Hollywood actress instead of her.Is it worth to watch this movie?

		<fullReview>Will Hunting is a young working-class man from South Boston who works as a janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His favourite pastimes are hanging out with a gang of his friends, getting drunk, getting into fights and breaking the law. He also happens to be a mathematician of genius, whose talents are revealed when he is seen writing out the answer to a problem which has baffled the world's greatest mathematical minds and which Professor Lambeau, a lecturer at the Institute, has written on a blackboard. The Professor becomes Will's mentor, trying to nurture his mathematical talents, and when Will again gets into trouble with the law on assault charges, Lambeau arranges a deal whereby he will qualify for parole provided he agrees to psychiatric treatment. The first two psychiatrists Will is sent to find him too much to handle, but eventually Lambeau refers him to an old friend, Sean Maguire. Maguire is an unhappy man, grieving over the death of his wife. At first he and Will find it difficult to get on with each other, but later discover a rapport. The rest of the film can be seen as the story of the psychological journeys of Will and Sean. (The film's title is presumably a laboured pun on the main character's name and on the meaning 'hunting for goodwill'). Will must decide whether to develop his talents or to remain with his friends in the blue-collar milieu with which he is most familiar; he also needs to overcome his childish, self-destructive impulses and develop a more mature, responsible attitude towards others, particularly his girlfriend Skylar. Sean needs to come to terms with his devastating loss.Robin Williams's touching performance as Sean is nonetheless a very good one, and quite the best thing about this film, although I am not sure that it was really deserving of an Oscar (I preferred Anthony Hopkins in 'Amistad'). On the other hand, I thought that Williams deserved Oscars for 'Good Morning Vietnam' and 'Dead Poets Society' and was passed over on each occasion, so justice has finally been done. I was less impressed, however, by the other leading actors. Stellan Skarsgard was not convincing as Lambeau and Minnie Driver as Skylar even less so. More crucially to the success of the film, Matt Damon never succeeded in bringing Will to life or in bridging the gap between the two sides of his character, brilliant intellectual on the one hand and street thug on the other. To be fair to Damon the actor (as opposed to Damon the scriptwriter), the fault lies less in the way the character is played than in the way the character is written. Will is not just a brilliant mathematician but a brilliant polymath with an encyclopedic knowledge of subjects such as history and law. (He uses the former in a devastating put-down of an arrogant Harvard student in a bar, and the latter in an attempt to defend himself in Court). To judge from his conversations with Sean, he also seems to fancy himself as a psychoanalyst. It is possible that a person with only basic formal education could have acquired such knowledge of diverse subjects, but only through a rigorous programme of study, and Will's life outside of his work seems to revolve around bar-rooms rather than libraries and boozing and brawling rather than auto didactic learning.Besides the central character's lack of credibility, the film's other main weakness is its funereal pace- too much talk and too little in the way of action. The central message- that man cannot live by the intellect alone, but also needs emotional sustenance and a system of moral values- is a worthy one, but I would have liked to have seen it conveyed in a more believable and less long-winded manner. 5/10 (a mark that would have been lower but for Williams).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admire films that shoot high and miss. But it really rankles me when a film pretends to shoot high, avoids doing so because of lack of talent, and lies to us in the process.There's great drama in the mere existence of an idiot savant. These are people who often are intolerable socially, inadequate in common thinking skills, and generally lead a cursed `elephantman' life, except for their celebration as (in this case) mathematicians. Instead, we're given a watered down likeable homeboy who has been abused. Oh and he has a photographic memory which is a separate pathology (the two never coincide). Depth discarded.There's truly deep drama in the mathematical problems good Will would be dealing with. But this would require a Nabokov, and his mastery of metaphor. Instead we get the koolaid version for dummies in some (as it turns out) meaningless scribbles and a bubble diagram. Depth is twice discarded. Believe me, this could be played up big; the power of a christ in some of the insights that are speculated -- the voice and eye of God.There's also common, but good drama in the dedicating of one's life to their gift at great personal sacrifice. We actually have some good films in this regard concerning musicians. Math is better since you don't even get the applause. Here the guy with the insights but lack of language would be codependent martyr with the expert in the formalisms but no vision. But too hard, so pass.I can attest that there are cinematic depths to be mined at NSA, MIT, even Southie in terms of the absolutely unique and strange feel of the places. How could this film have missed those dark assets and end up so totally without atmosphere?This movie got made for one reason only: Robin Williams saw a part for himself. Therefore, the previously described ignorances are filled by an amplified backstory so Williams can find himself after losing his wife. Pretty damned offensive given the possibilities. I predict that someone will do this story (or something like it) well sometime before I die. It's just too rich, and we do have some bright minds available. Its just not these two kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, I am going to go straight ahead and say that in no way do I understand how people manage to like this movie.Absolutely everything in this film is outright terrible: the premise of two grown men going out of their way to help some guy "because he's a genius", the clich boring love interest and friend subplots, young Damon showing his "intellect" by citing old books with a super-serious face, Affleck picking up girls (extra cringy!), Williams remembering his wife's farts (literally), Minnie Driver's story about geriatric blowjobs, Casey Affleck jerking off (not shown explicitly, thankfully), the battered "do what you really like, don't miss your true love" morale... The list could go on forever, or for about two hours, to be exact.The only bright spot is Robin Williams (when he's not remembering his wife's farts, obviously), his performance is solid, his smile heart- warming, his wrists very hairy.What I also don't get is why people have doubts whether Affleck and Damon actually wrote this piece of trash. I mean come on, saying that someone isn't capable of even coming up with something as bad as Will Hunting is probably the worst insult there is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matt Damon sticks to the formula in this cliche ridden drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haven't we seen this one before? Matt Damon must have looked at everything that's won awards in the history of the Academy and included every cliche he could scavenge into his screenplay.1. The angst-ridden genius who resents his gift, because everybody he knows is trying to force him into a better life. A life he doesn't want because he's happy just being an average loser like all his friends.2. The teacher who discovers him, who we are meant to believe genuinely wants to help him, but by the end we find out just wants to live his own lost dreams vicariously through his prodigy.3. The psychiatrist who has troubles of his own, so by the end of the film they unwittingly help each other out.4. Of course a romantic interest has to be thrown in to create the standard conflict. Should he choose a life with his friends, his girl, or a high paying job. Naturally he chooses to abandon everything and run off to a girl he barely knows. I hope I'm not the only one who saw that coming a mile away. Men are always portrayed as saps in these types of films.Robin Williams gives us another one of his trademark two characters. He's always either manic and over-the-top, or quiet and introverted. In this case we get the latter, essentially the same guy we saw in Awakenings. I prefer him in the manic roles, at least then I don't have to suspend my disbelief enough to accept Mork giving psychological advice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm being pretty harsh but this is just not a serious project. This is basically written by a 1st year undergrad, could not be more tacky, predictable, boring and superficial. We've heard those lines before, we've seen those scenes before, the story is far too unbelievable and reaches too much. What is the story even about ? Please the confrontation in the bar with Havard student, the "owe it to me" scene that is incomprehensible, the numbers of slurs in it, the "it's not your fault", do these people even speak English ? All it is, is a genius that happens to be the most brilliant genius yet no explanation is given why, in the entire country, even the world ! No rally it's a chip flick, the sentimentality is throbbing, the dilogue incorrect, the "jokes" cheesy and incomprehensible.In no way, deserving best picture and original script.Matt Damon is a poor actor.</fullReview>

For an actor who was just starting out, I think he might have been trying a little bit too hard, if not way too hard.This is an over-dramatic and boring movie, and Robin Williams didn't help. Robin Williams was such a funny actor (RIP), but his character was dull and boring. I don't think any comedian's character should be this serious. How about a little bit more pizazz? I'm sorry.

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when it came out in the cinema and enjoyed it. Then I saw it again today on TV and was dismayed at much I had apparently been sucked in by the Hollywood hype: two kids write the screenplay, star in it as well, it's an utterly brilliant film and gets an Oscar -- and I fell for it hook, line and sinker. OK, I will let this be a lesson to myself. The way I see it today is that it is a well - executed film, but the story is pure drizzle. Not just non - academic yob turns out to be talented, that would have been a realistic premise and could have made for a likeable movie. But not good enough for Hollywood -- instead it has to be a janitor at the MIT, and of course he is a gazillion times more brilliant than the professor (who is of course a field - medal - aspiring genius in his own right) of the very building he is working in. Hold on, I'm not finished. And this dude is also a genius in other areas, at least enough so to impress the judge with his legal cognizance, and he can quote lengthy passages out of philosophy books and he's into organic chemistry just for kicks, and he is a total fire - fighter - cute hunk as well, and he's good at fisticuffs too, and he wins the heart and hand of this super - intelligent, cute and rich chick who turns out to have a heart of gold and is the only one to accept him for what he really is, but he has got this problem facing his own genius because he would rather continue his squalid life of petty crime and dead - end jobs (hey, don't we all?), but then this brilliant psychiatrist who looks ten times more like Sigmund Freud than the man himself comes to the rescue, and -- totally unexpected -- things tie up to a happy end. HOW ON EARTH COULD I EVER HAVE FALLEN FOR THIS CRAP? Did Hollywood temporarily lobotomize me? Please, someone, shoot me!OK, the bottom line: highly forgettable film. End of bottom line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A rebellious young college janitor (Matt Damon) is secretly a maths genius, but even when it is uncovered, he seems reluctant to use it to better his life.A film that is billed as "highly original" is nothing of the kind. It merely lifts from a wide variety of diverse movies from Saturday Night Fever through Rocky to Love Story. However it owes more to Ordinary People (the film best remembered - or is it forgotten!? - for robbing Raging Bull of the Best Picture Oscar!) than any other.Hard to really believe the central character who seems to have read lots of books and done a lot of studying off-screen (how, why and when are not fully explained). On-screen he seems much more interested in fighting on street corners, shouting at his working class friends (even when they are sat next to him), and getting clever-clever with authority.Good performance from Matt Damon in the central role, but Robin Williams as the psychiatrist who helps him (and who himself ends up helped), is the standout. Here is guy who can say more with a look than most actors can do with a hundreds lines of dialogue. Shame that even the academics seem to swear just as readily and just as often as those lower down the food chain.Mini Driver is quite touching as an English student (rich - but not a bitch!) who catches our hero's eye. While bringing dimension to the movie, you get the feeling that this was included in case the rest of the plot flopped. It wouldn't take too much editing to make this the central theme with the rest being the background. However this was not needed.Too many good moments and too much of an engaging plot for us not be lightly charmed - but I wasn't moved by this movie. Our hero's working class friends are loyal - but that is about all you can say for them. Ben Affleck (in the "best friend" role) shows that haircuts, cheekbones and teeth are still what really counts in tinsel town. The sterile world of (Boston) academia and the juvenile world of the street (as portrayed here) both alienated me. Can there not be middle way for our will-he-won't-he protagonist? The movie seems just as confused on this point as I am and in the end cops out of answering it. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, for all of you out there who love the F word and MF, this movie is for you. For anyone who desires a storyline, this one is quite minimal. Who wants to hear the F word for a whole movie? If cursing as well as a bonus of bad actors is a movie to you, then see it. The ironic thing is that I don't mind cursing in a movie so long it's to prove a point; but in this movie, it was meant to be simply crude and I saw no point in it.The story seemed to open up with a reasonable plot, but went nowhere. I suppose it went downhill the more I saw a preppy type of guy claimed to be a genius, yet making idiotic decisions in life. I'm sorry, but I just can't even imagine Matt Damon as any sort of a genius. (sheesh, even the size of his vocabulary is obviously limited to curse words only)The reason so many people like this movie has to be because of the big name actors. What teenage girl doesn't want to see Matt Damon? Of course, when he's a main actor in a movie, girls go crazy for him as well as Ben Affleck. With such "good looking guys", what girl wouldn't go crazy for it?The bottom line for this movie is that it's horrible and should realistically be rated NC-17 for the language let alone the horrible acting.</fullReview>

The story really does have humanity in it and how some people can use their power or gifts to do the right thing. Instead of just capitalizing on it while stepping over and ruining the lives of others. This film is about living without regrets and having the empathy to show compassion for others. And being able to getting past the trauma, heartache and pain to be able to move forward and find love. Robin Williams really shines in this film and puts on a moving and empathetic performance. Overall, this is a must see film that I would highly recommend. If you have heart or at least have a bit of empathy you will really be drawn into this one.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If asked who Ben Afleck and Matt Damon are most people would probably know that one of them once dated Jennifer Lopez and the other now has a series of successful 'Bourne' action movies. They may also know that both are regular stars or cameos in Kevin Smith movies.What they may not know is that whilst still in their mid-twenties they wrote and produced one of the best 'finding yourself' movies of our generation.Good Will Hunting is the story of Will Hunting (Damon) dredging through life as a standard no-hoper working a labouring day job and janitoring at a top university at nights. Aside from his jobs he regularly lands in trouble and generally burns through life with an attitude, to his best friend (Afleck)'s dismay. What his friend knows is that Will is brilliant, he has the mind of a prodigy.Will could do anything or be anyone he wants but feels most at home without responsibilities, it's the duty of his friends, his girlfriend (Minnie Driver) and a burned out psychologist (played exceptionally by Robin Williams) that have to 'kick him in the ass' so to speak.This film blew me away, and when I discovered later that Matt Damon and Ben Afleck wrote it I garnered an entire new respect for both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very nice psychological drama about a misunderstood genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not the generic type of chic flick you would expect based on other reviews I have read. It's a very nice catching story about a guy who works as a janitor in my favorite city of Boston's MIT. He appears to be a genius in science which is discovered by an intelligent professor. He tries to guide and let Will bloom with the talents he has, along with the assistance of another professor and shrink Sean (Robin Williams), who has some problems of his own. The scenery of the movie in my view is simple and not diverse, but the story of the movie is so strong it is not a problem at all, it will keep you tight to the screen for the duration of the movie.The way Will's relationship with Skylar is waved into the movie is perfect. It's a good recommendation if you like a touching movie, which is very realistic telling you something about young adults in South Boston and the symptom of being misunderstood.Awesome, in one word.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is a movie which you don't need to be a genius to understand, you just have to be awake. It is a continually rewarding movie which offers something new each time you see it. A natural reaction the first time one sees Good Will Hunting is to focus on the story of Will, his mathematical genius and his past experience with people. Then the next time you start to realize that they don't overly stress the genius aspect, but simply use it as a way of him to become "something." Then you get the conflict between Skaarsgard and Williams about which destiny is best for Will, obviously stretching from some long-standing problems between them. And there's infinitely more. Damon and Affleck both cared very much about what they put into their screenplay, and it shows. If you don't care, then no matter how many special effect you can pour into it, it will never be as good as a movie that you pour yourself into. That is the difference between this movie and so many sub-par excuses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting. Coming-of-age story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The skeleton of the movie Good Will Hunting is predictable but the scenes have great dialogue and character development. This is specifically concerning scenes with Sean and Will. The first scene with Will and Sean shows Will with all of the power as he disrespects his new psychotherapist, Sean. Sean quickly resumes power by the next scene they share together, as Sean sits Will down and tells him that he is willing to work with him but only if Will stops hiding behind his knowledge in books and exposes who Will Hunting really is. One of the final scenes between Will and Sean ends with Will crying in Sean's arms, showing Sean as a father figure. So, although this may seem quite predictable, Good Will Hunting still contains scenes between the two main characters, Sean and Will, that are captivating and something viewers are not used to seeing. The first scene Sean and Will share together starts off with them making small talk. Will's motive is to have Sean hate him, so he does not have to see a therapist. So, Will starts to dissect a painting that Sean has in his office that, coincidentally, Sean painted himself. Will says the painting must represent Sean's loneliness and postulates that he and his wife are distant in some way. The second Will disrespects Sean's wife, Sean pushes Will against the wall and chokes him while telling him to never talk about her again. We see character development with Will during this scene, as he lets his mouth go and expects no consequences. The second he receives a consequence ? Sean choking him ? Will does not know what to do or say. We see character development with Sean as well. The viewers now know how important his wife is to him. This scene is also shocking. During a first meeting, viewers wouldn't expect a therapist to choke his patient. The viewer, therefore, knows immediately from this moment that Sean and Will's relationship is far from ordinary.The second scene Sean and Will share together is Sean giving Will a speech about how Will lives his life through books and because of that, he hides behind them. The speech is very compelling because of Williams' acting. He is quite inviting towards Will but at the same time he is teaching him a lesson. Williams expresses this through the tone of his voice ? it is very soft and he hardly raises his voice. During the scene, Will takes in everything that is being said to him. He knows not to cross Sean and that is shown through Will not interrupting Sean the entire time he is talking. This speech is one of the pivotal points of the movie because it is an analysis of the main character, Will. One of the final scenes Sean and Will share together starts with Sean telling Will that it is not his fault that he was beaten as a child. Sean says this as a father figure, which confuses Will because he never had that growing up. Will shrugs Sean off but Sean keeps insisting that it was not his fault. As Sean repeats these lines, Will begins to break down and pushes Sean out of the way. Sean continues and eventually Will gives in and cries in Sean's arms. This is out of the ordinary for a normal therapist-patient relationship. Sean and Will have broken that relationship standard and have entered a friendship level, something both of them need. The screenwriters, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are actors who coincidentally are both in the movie, so their vision for the characters they play are very clear throughout the movie. This is great for Damon's character, Will, because the movie revolves around him. Having the screenwriters participate as actors in the movie very much enhances the scenes and the character development because it is indeed their vision. However, there are many parallels to the lives of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck to the lives of their characters, which one could argue would obviously create good dialogue. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck grew up together and most likely participated in these actual dialogues in reality. Therefore, it would be very easy for them to create and become these characters because, in some aspects, they are these characters. Nonetheless, the scenes with Will and Sean together make the movie worth watching because, as it stands, character development happening before one's eyes is entrancing.</fullReview>

Good Will Hunting is a movie masterpiece. Matt Damon and Ben Afleck are sensational actors and even better writers.

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1997, I finally had my first viewing of Good Will Hunting this week. It's the best film I've seen in ages.Featuring a great cast consisting of the late great Robin Williams, Matt Damon, Stellan Skarsg?rd and the Affleck brothers. Good Will Hunting was a simple film that offered a lot. It had a bit of everything, some very nice relationships amongst characters which was great drama and at times extremely funny. The film flows at a good pace which kept me interested all the way through, the story was intriguing as I really related to the characters well.There were plenty of good laughs throughout the film as well as some truly memorable scenes packed with emotional punch, mostly from the meetings between Sean &amp; Will, the way their relationship developed was full of heart. My favourite scene has to be the "farting wife" scene, absolutely hilarious and made even better when I found out after that it was improvised, Robin was so funny that even the director was laughing, making the camera shake during that particular scene.Overall a truly memorable film that I certainly hope to watch again &amp; again. Highly recommended."If you ever disrespect my wife again I will end you. I will *beep* end you. You got that, chief?" - Such a memorable scene/quote. Brilliant.10/10.</fullReview>

Just part of life. Giving them Oscars as Best Screenplay is criminal. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are fine human beings and good looking guys living great lives. They just can't write to save them, that's all.The barroom debate scene between the snooty student and the self educated Damon is merely the most pretentious and stupid scene EVER to portray itself as having any connection to reality whatsoever. Why didn't it get THAT Oscar?This awful film was a top ten grossing movie in 1997. That's the really scary part. This bad a film does that well. And it's not an action flick, it pretends to be an intellectual flick with an important message! As you read this, if you didn't see the gruesome falseness of the barroom debate scene, just remember that your really dwelling some place far out, but nowhere in the real world. I bet you liked Blair Witch.A very distant second in the removed-from-reality category could be Jason Robarbs in the "senior partners take a shower together scene" in Philadelphia. But that's not really close to this masterwork. One can also think of the Happy Days episode where Fonzie and Richie go to a snooty rich people's party and are treated so badly. Another worthy contender. Several episodes of The White Shadow perhaps? James At Sixteen? I'll wager young Matt and Damon loved those shows!The bar is set. That barroom debate scene may not be the worst thing ever filmed. But it is certainly the most intellectually pretentious and cloyingly stupid scene ever made. No surprise to finding Robin Williams in this film. How did he let them leave him out of this scene? Oversight.</fullReview>

Who explored Human feelings, emotions...beyond just love, anger, lust n sadness..Good Will Hunting is one such svelte work of art.It was not supposed to be about Will Hunting intellect and it is not. It was not supposed to be about telling tale of a great mind and the greatness it accomplished. It was suppose to give u a chance to feel what it feels being 'Will Hunting' and it does that beautifully.In parts, it shows the struggle that on within the calm demeanor. In others, it shows you how greatness become meaningless when its bestowed upon u. At the same time, it shows the mortality of Will Hunting nature. His craving for acknowledgment. It unfolds, one after the other, the layers of complexity that marks his multi-dimension personality...When he with Ben...when he with Robin and the most beautiful one is when he is with Minnie.You have to sit and connect yourself with Will Hunting to really takes his place and live a life that comes along once is century.And as Robin William says in the movie..'But you're a genius Will. No one denies that. No one could possibly understand the depths of you' So go...give urself a chance to try and feel the bliss of being Will Hunting...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining piece of sentimental Hollywood tosh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rags to riches story where a working class boy is a mathematical genius who prefers a working class existence of bar rooms, fights and ball games to an academic life. However when he is discovered by a professor at a trial for public disorder he is released into his care to have tuition and therapy. Sean Maguire is brought in for the therapy while Will and his friend Chuckie go on with their normal lives.This is a quite hyped film (the rise of scriptwriters Damon and Affleck was already along the way before this hit - there's is not quite a rags to riches story for them), however there is much to enjoy here. The story never fully explains how Will came to develop his talent or even how he came to know about it - was he born knowing everything about maths? You feel that Will could have been given a little less arrogance - nobody knows everything. However the story is quite interesting and it's given such a fairytale gloss that details are not important.The script also gives Williams a chance to do yet another tear-jerker role and get an Oscar for his troubles. Affleck and Driver are also good in support but Damon is the lead. His character has layers and he does have plenty of good scenes, but the main problem is that his arrogance is not shown as a negative trait and it tends to make him a little unsympathetic.Overall a good piece of Hollywood fairy tale gloss that does what it has to do - not a classic but it's a nice bit of sentimental tosh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twenty-year old Boston `southie' Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is madly charismatic and absolutely intelligent and understanding, but is, at the same time, a loose cannon; a roughneck-psychopath who lashes out at the nearest target. And while that may be the stark, conflicting, didactic point the film is making, it also serves as its weakest element. So what if he `finds himself' at the end by hugging Professor Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) ? he's still a presumptuous and brazen maniac with severe psychological problems (and a societal mutineer that's half humanitarian, half dipsomaniac). I don't think he especially meets his match in McGuire ? he just gains a friend with a solid foundation that only points part of Will in the right direction. Hunting has a photographic memory (he's like Dustin Hoffman's Rainman character without the autistic disorder, or Little Man Tate), and can solve problems that only frustrate Nobel Prize winning mathmaticians. Eventually, his talent is discovered by Professor Lambeau (Breaking the Waves' Stellan Skarsgard), who saves him from a jail sentence, and he is introduced to McGuire. Now, Robin Williams is one of my all-time favorites, but I didn't like him at all in this film ? he plays the role far too cutesy. I didn't particularly believe his struggle, his stories or his fleeting tough-guy flash. He just seemed over-emotional and gooey, downplaying his high-strung energy. Likewise, he could've been brainier and more quick-witted; more of a match for Hunting (their silent chess-game should have been replaced with a shouting match of facts and figures). On the other hand, Skylar (Minnie Driver), a British student at Harvard, who falls in love with Will and tries to help him, is both absorbing and playful (just as she was in Grosse Point Blank).So I have some objections with the film, but it's still, for the most part, a smart, involving story with good characterization. It's got individual flashes of brilliance within an otherwise predictable story. Apparently, Damon and Affleck wrote the movie years ago, and finally got to see the project made ? good for them! In their defense, the two spin a great underlying theme about the working class, and how straightforward (and thus, romantic) it is to be an unassuming bricklayer. Will's best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck) says it best when he tells Hunting, `You're sitting on a winning lottery ticket -- it would be an insult to us if you're still around here in 20 years.' I just didn't experience the essential resolution I was, perhaps, supposed to feel by the final frame.</fullReview>

Matt Damon's portrayal of that genius realizing that life has something more to offer than batting cages and bars is equally stunning. And Robin Williams certainly leaves nothing to be desired in this inspiring and emotionally film my 166 review</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matt Damon &amp; Robin Williams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Good Will Hunting" tells the story of its titular namesake, a truly brilliant young man still struggling to cope with the demons of a dark past. Will's keen intellect, thirst for knowledge, and a tight- knit group of friends serve as his primary bulwarks against his troubles. Yet even these are unable to fully help Will. Will is unwillingly "discovered" by a senior MIT professor after he (easily) solves a complex algebra equation that proves to be the bane of student and faculty alike. Through this Will meets Sean (played by Robin Williams) a professor at a local community college who soon finds himself being one of the few people being able to meaningfully connect with Will. Along the way Will meets a sophisticated Harvard undergrad named Skyler. The two hit it off and begin a relationship, yet Will struggles to connect with her as his deep fear of abandonment prevent him from getting attached to her, let alone anyone, outside his "group." This fear hides within it a heavy reluctance to embrace his God-given gifts and realize his immense potential, and ultimately better his future. The story, the cast, the performances, the character dynamics, oh where do I begin???!!! I could rave about them all, but for fear of being redundant I will refrain from doing so. Go see this movie. It is such a wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie that Should be Watched by Everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is a movie about Will Hunting, a misunderstood poor boy from South Boston, who has a genius-level IQ and works as a janitor at a university. He solves a near-impossible math problem that takes professionals years to master, and is given the offer to be one of the smartest mathematicians ever, but after getting in a fight with a police officer, he is sent to Dr. Sean Maguire to have therapy sessions. What starts as a reluctant bonding session turns into a budding friendship that changes his world.For one, let me talk about the story behind this film. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon both starred and wrote this movie, (both of them unknown at the time) and ever since then, it's one of the most successful indie films of all time.I think everyone should watch this movie. I say that about a lot of films but this time I mean it. It gives older adults a look at what a teenager/college student's life is like, and it gives younger viewers a look at what to expect, and a guide to surviving it.Not only that, but all the actors and actresses do an amazing job. Most people know Robin Williams as a funny actor, but this is his best and most serious role. He's better as a serious actor then a comedy actor in my opinion. Sort of like how Jim Carrey was good in The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and those are all serious flicks.Seriously, check this film out. Definitely mandatory viewing for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of a kind original story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting takes place in Boston, which is where actor Matt Damon and Ben Affleck grew up together. It's not the Boston most people are familiar with, the Boston Common, the Charles River and the famous attractions. Instead, much of action takes place in the grittiness of Southie, or South Boston, shrouded in lower middle class desperation. Starring into the film, key and title character Will Hunting (Matt Damon) works as a janitor at MIT. He is in trouble with the law, getting into street and bar brawls. One day at work, he solves a complex mathematical problem left on a blackboard. A professor discovers his incredible intellect and rescues him from a jail stint for assault. In return for his probation, he must get counseling. After some funny scenes where he disposes of some psychiatrists by psychoanalyzing them, he finally meets his match in Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), a psychiatrist who grew up in his old neighborhood. McGuire is just as tough as Hunting and is smart enough to see through his defenses.Later into the film, Will Hunting also meets and falls in love with Skylar (Minnie Driver). Gradually McGuire and Skylar begin to lower Hunting's defenses until a crisis of courage is reached. In the process of healing Hunting, McGuire is also healed. McGuire has to reveal much of himself to Hunting in order to get his trust.Written by Damon and Affleck, the screenplay is shown to be very smart, funny and emotionally moving. All of the performances are powerful. Good Will Hunting is almost 20 years old, though it still has a feel that is fresh to first time viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you watch Good Will Hunting, you have to look past the Oscars and other awards it's gotten. Because beneath all that, it's a beautiful movie, with a beautiful script written by two talented young men and acted out by equally talented actors such as Robin Williams, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.One of the most enjoyable parts of the movie was the psychological aspect. We have a typical 21 year old, going out and drinking with his friends, getting in fights etc., but underneath all that there's so much more to him. This movie tells us that we shouldn't look at the surface alone, there is so much more to people.The acting in this movie was incredible, Matt Damon played the role of Will Hunting without fault, he displayed the emotions, the cockiness, he displayed how Will was closed off due to his childhood trauma and he displayed how Will shrouded his weakness with smart talk and intellect. Robin Williams played the therapist Sean Maguire, a man who has seen life unlike the life his fellow academics have, on the battlefield in Vietnam. He recently lost his wife, who he regarded as his soulmate and best friend.Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, who is a brilliant young man who denies his out of this world genius. Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben Affleck. That is until a professor at one of the top colleges finds Will's talent and helps him out of trouble with the law. Robin Williams later comes in as a therapist to Will, he is the only one who can really stand up to Will's intellect and manages to break the layer of distrust that Will has developed over years of solitude, and the two develop a bond beyond friendship. Yes there is a girl in the movie, but there isn't much focus on that aspect.The fact that most of the people keep on talking about the probability of someone being as smart as Will tells us that this is a story, that this isn't real. Even so it relates to almost everyone who has been at Will's age. They have dealt with insecurities, fear of not being accepted, etc.Overall, I think it's a beautiful movie, with a beautiful message and amazing effort from everyone in the cast and crew. Especially from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who co-wrote the script for this movie. It is definitely a must watch.</fullReview>

Actually i didn't put Minnie in my 12 best actresses list but i think i will do it as her English class is unique! She should have won the Oscar because she illuminates a rather transparent part (the serious student girlfriend) with original and personal input ! Robin is good as a humanist shrink but i won't go ahead as i can't really support a movie that supports psychological help : what says Robin can be found in any good philosophical book : life is about experiences, getting to know others and abuse victims aren't culprits. In other way, Affleck says it as good as Robin and without the qualifications: Will has everything to get a life so he must move his ass !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mathematical genius who works as a janitor gets help from a psychologist to get his criminal life in check by being forced to see the truth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you ever wanted to watch a movie that made you think and laugh, Good Will Hunting is a good choice. Will Hunting is played by Matt Damon and is presented as one of those guys who gets into trouble and has a smart mouth. He lives in an anything but luxurious, trashy house and works as a janitor at M.I.T. He hangs out with a guy named Chuckie, played by Ben Affleck, who seems just as rough around the edges as Will, only in track suit form. What kind of movie could this be? It is't until we find out that Will is actually a mathematical genius that we can see a good story starting to form. Professor Lambeau, played by Stellan Skarsgard, discovers what great work Will can accomplish and attempts to help Will by picking his brain and setting him up with therapy to help with his criminal and vulgar ways. Eventually, psychologist Sean Acquire, played by Robin Williams, gets called upon to push Will to his limits and to help him see the truth. The truth that Will's past was not his fault and that he needs to start letting people in his life as well as knowing what he wants in his life as well. Will was a very loyal man. All his life he knew about being abandoned. Will was an orphan and foster homes were anything but a day at the carnival. Though he did push certain people away, he kept the people that mattered the most close by. Will was so loyal, that he would give up a better life for himself to just stay with his friend, Chuckie, until the end of their days. This fact infuriated Chuckie. He knew that Will deserved better and told him this at a construction site they were working at. To quote the movie, Chuckie tells Will, "But you know what the best part of my day is? For about ten seconds, from when I pull up to the curb and when I get to your door, 'cause I think, maybe I'll get up there and I'll knock on the door and you won't be there. No goodbye. No see you later. No nothing. You just left." (Quotes, 2015) Chuckie wants what is best for Will so much, that he would be okay with Will just leaving without a peep. A great scene where Will finally embraces and deals with his internal struggles is when Sean keeps saying, over and over, "it was not your fault." For some reason, this finally gets to Will. It's as if the whole time, he thought he was abandoned or beaten because he did something wrong. Sean allowed him to finally release all of those emotions. It almost seems like after that moment, Will got to start over. He finally went after what he wanted in the end and did what was going to finally make him happy. This movie reminded me of A Beautiful Mind. Of course, this movie also was about a man who was a mathematical genius, but he also had some struggles and truths to deal with. It wasn't until he realized that he needed to handle his mental illness and that he did, in fact, have one, that he found happiness. It took some struggle and seeing the truth eye to eye to get to where he needed to be. One kind of motif I would point out in the movie is when Sean tells Will, "Real loss is only possible when you love something more than you love yourself"(Quotes, 2015). Sean also kept asking will what he wanted in life, but Will never really answered him. Will was so used to losing things, how could he not know what real loss was? When will leaves Sean a note saying that he wasn't going to the new job that he got and was chasing after Skylar, Sean knew that Will finally understood that statement and was going after what he wanted. Sometimes one has to go through a lot of struggle before they can finally figure out what they want in life. It's never fun to figure it out alone though. Will had two people in his life that supported him and wanted the best for him. It took some tough love, but he finally realized they were right and he went for what he wanted in life.</fullReview>

Centering on a brilliant working-class youngster who's forced to come to terms with his creative genius and true feelings, this beautifully realized tale is always engaging and often quite touching. With the right marketing, Miramax could score big with an extremely enjoyable picture whose old-fashioned virtues should play well in big cities as well as in Middle American shopping malls.Fans of Van Sant's earlier, offbeat films may be disappointed by the more conventional attributes of "Good Will Hunting," a "problem" drama dealing with the complex relationship between a rough, extraordinarily gifted kid and his equally troubled and bruised therapist. Thematically, film recalls Robert Redford's "Ordinary People" and especially Jodie Foster's "Little Man Tate," which also revolved around a child genius of the working class.Nonetheless, it's a testament to Van Sant's idiosyncratic talent that he endows the narrative, particularly its first chapters, with the nihilistic humor and deceptively casual style that have marked his best work, "Drugstore Cowboy" and the more eccentric "My Own Private Idaho."Co-written by thesps Damon and Ben Affleck, who have known each other since childhood in Boston, protagonist is Will Hunting (Damon), a 20-year-old lad who works as a janitor at MIT and spends most of his time with his coarse friends at the neighborhood bar. Blessed with a certain genius, Will, who has never attended college, can summon obscure historical references based on his exceptional photographic memory. He can also solve difficult mathematical problems with an ease that makes MIT's richer and more educated students envious of him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie in my English class. It's a movie about a guy named Will, who is very aggressive and tries to play cool in front of his friends.He's also a math genie but doesn't do anything about his talent. Behind his facade there is something a little deeper about his behavior, something about a childhood that was ruined and about an insecure boy. He is about to go to jail, when a teacher saves him, and makes him go to therapy. This movie is all about a guy who has a hard time trusting people and letting them in, also about why people can be so aggressive sometimes and that it all can be a misunderstanding. I thought this movie was pretty good, because I can relate to Will and because the actors were great. Even tho the movie is about 17 years old it still focuses on important things that can happen to anyone. I thought this movie was good. There's a scene in the movie where Will and Skylar has a fight, I think that scene is important because it shows that Will is vulnerable and that he also got feelings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, a very nicely crafted film with equally good performances from Matt Damon &amp; Robin Williams. Good Will Hunting didn't turn out to be as inspiring as I had expected it to be because it's more about walking on the road that will take you to something when you already know your strengths rather than finding yourself completely lost &amp; then taking a journey to find that road. Still, that doesn't take anything away the fact that Good Will Hunting has its own inspiring moments. Matt Damon &amp; Robin Williams are very well supported by the other cast and the cinematography is also pretty finely done too. It captures the lost identity of a troubled youth brilliantly but didn't create the desired impact on an overall scale. Still, without a shadow of a doubt, Good Will Hunting is worth a shot and an inspiration that many lost people might just need.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting -- A MustsSee Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is an emotional roller coaster of a film. A surprisingly well written (and acted) film by two of today's biggest actors: Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Matt Damon plays Will Hunting who is a genius trapped inside the body of a broken orphan, whose emotional damaged past has turned him into a reckless young adult. Will was a believable character with many quick, fluid, long-winded jabs that you would only expect out of the mouth of a well-read genius. His brilliance is discovered by Prof. Gerald Lambeau (Stellen Skarsgard), and leads him to meeting psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) and love interest Skylar (Minnie Driver). Will struggles to find himself, stuck within the disconnect from his past, but finds ways to cope through Sean, Skylar, and best friend Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck).The main theme of this film is being able to watch Will find connection with others and allow himself to trust and love someone else. As he progresses through the movie, we see him meet Skylar and evolve through the relationship. We also see his bond and relationship with Sean, grow and progress into respect, trust, and friendship. Another theme of the movie are the many arrays of sociological and psychological issues with every character. Will is constantly battling with his past and the ability to trust, we also see his aggression built up from all of this. Chuckie also has similar aggression issues that we are able to witness in the bar scenes, most likely these are sociological issues from how and where he grew up. Sean is secretly battling the loneliness after losing his wife and too stubborn to open up about it to someone and move on with his life. We later see that Professer Lambeau is upset that his life and reputation has not progressed as far as he would have liked and he has some pent up feelings about this. Another movie with this similar theme would be the recent, Silver Linings Playbook. The two main characters played by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, are struggling with themselves and their relationships. Yet you come to realize that they are not the only ones with these same inner struggles.The film techniques are well hidden yet are able to bring this movie to life in a very sneaky way. The scenes when Will visits Sean in his office are often allowing us to see the distance between the two's relationship. We only see one character at a time, or we just see the shoulder of Sean while the camera continues to focus on Will. Gradually as the movie progresses the two are both seen on screen together, portraying that Will's trust in Sean is growing.In the beginning of the movie we see a short scene of Will reading in his apartment. The camera slowly pulls back, allowing us to view the emptiness around him. This gives us an early look at how Will is in his life. He is alone and disconnected from others. The use of parallel cutting in the movie allows us to see everything going on at once with the characters. The most prominent of these scenes is at the end where the film cuts between Will leaving a note for Sean, Chuckie stopping to pick Will up from his house, and Sean packing up his things to leave. I think this parallel cutting technique is reminiscent of Will's life and how there are always many things going on in that great mind of his. This movie as a whole is a very realistic and thorough story of a brilliant young man, with a troubling past, who is trying to find himself and allow others to find him. I would highly recommend this film to anyone trying to find one of the best written and acted films of our generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting is about a genius in mathematics who works as a janitor for MIT.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The theme of Good Will Hunting I believe is personal discovery. Good Will Hunting is about a simple janitor named Will working for MIT. However Will is not just another janitor, he is a mathematical genius that solves mathematical equations that have been written on the chalk boards in the classrooms that the other students are unable to solve. When the professor of mathematics sees these solutions done by Will he wants Will to start a job where he is able to use his gift in mathematics. Will however does not want to do this he wants to spend his life as a laborer. Through the course of the movie Will also got arrested for getting in a fight and professor Lambeau (mathematics professor) gets Will released into his custody but only by Will agreeing to see a psychologist. Will ends up going through five psychologists before professor Lambeau is able to find one that Will connects with. Will also starts a relationship with a young lady named Skylar whom he meet in a bar. However when Skylar asks Will to move with her to another state Will threw a temper tantrum and breaks off the relationship, in an attempt to prevent future emotional pain. By the end of the movie after Will breaks down in his final therapy session with Sean. He then decides to go to find Skylar and make that relationship work. By working with Sean the psychologist Will was able to discover who he is and is able to move on from his past and start living the life that will make him happy. By doing this Will is then able to find his place in the world.One motif that was repeated throughout the film that is related to the theme is Will going to see Sean the psychologist over and over aging. While Will is with Sean he is able to slowly discover who he is and where he fits into the world or where his place is with his friends and in his relationship with Skylar. Good will hunting also used internal conflict within Will to portray the theme of this movie. By Will having a bad childhood and allowing this to dictate his life throughout the movie it also showed us how Will's personal conflict made it hard for Will to really discover who he was or where he should be. However in the end Will was able to achieve that personal discovery of himself and move on in the world to a life that would be right for him without all the past conflict.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am blown away right now. Not by the fledgling writers, but Matt Damon. I have watched his action movies and most recently his Behind The Candelabra (2013), but Good Will HUnting will stay one of his best movie for me.Telling a wonderful tale in 120 minutes isn't a child's play and I am glad Damn &amp; Ben Affleck came up with it. Robin Williams has been charming and his humor is engagingly funny. I still think of some of his rhetoric jokes. While the supporting cast is splendid, I am amazed by the music &amp; score.Fine screenplay &amp; cinematography, the best thing about Good Will Hunting is the plot &amp; the story of lives of people, especially when the relation is showcased intricately. A 9.6/10 for this beautiful drama. Because it is not a melodrama.BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

		<fullReview>I love this movie beyond belief. I wish i could have seen this when it came out. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon did an excellent job at writing it and starring in it. A masterpiece. Tale of a prodigy math genius plagued by his past and his inability to connect to anyone close. The conflict with Matt Damon's character really keeps you engaged. I truly had feelings of hope, joy, and sadness. This movie is one of the ones you simply have to watch at least once. I give it a high review because it should maintain its superiority in today's dilute and mediocre film industry. Shining example of what true cinema can bring. Thank you Ben and Matt, Truly touched me in this tale.Ps. excellent movie for a date night ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not as overrated ,and the plot as bad as some people claim. The plot is understandable, and the character is somewhat deep. The serious scenes are acted out pretty well. The end makes sense. All that being said, this movie does not live up to its "Oscar-Winning" hype. The start of the movie , first, kinda doesn't make any sense.If Will Hunting was so smart, how come it took him until now for someone to spot his jewel. It just doesn't make sense. The plot, however decent and understandable, doesn't seem to segue smoothly. For example, there is a scene where the professor and the therapist are arguing. Then, when Will comes in and they kiss and make up. Where in the hell did that come from? Finally, there is the ending, which is the worst part. It leaves us hanging, with no clues whatsoever as to the outcome of his trip to Cali. I am probably making this film out worse than it actually is. The movie itself is worth a good watch. Not the greatest, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>immediate classic that propelled Affleck &amp; Damon to stardom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a difficult film to rate as the fact that Affleck and Damon wrote it and it did so well, and the screenplay is so good is distracting. All the performances are good but it is the relationship between Matt Damon's Will and Robin Williams' Psychologist Sean that is the most compelling and the genius of the piece. Will Hunting is a broken yet incredibly intelligent young man who's not had the breaks in life, finds inspiration and meaning in his sessions with a compulsory therapist.Minnie Driver as the love interest gives one of her best roles but isn't a main character but the catalyst for some of Will's breakthroughs. Affleck as the self-sacrificing best friend plays a typical character for him, and I do wonder how they decided who would play which character given that they chose the best combination; Matt Damon as a boy-next-door genius and brokenness was perfect given that Affleck would have been more striking, pretty-boy privilege, bringing his angry intelligence (see Boiler Room) which wouldn't have been so attracting nor so inducing of empathy. Gus Van Sant's straight almost dull direction - given his spacey trippy and arty direction in other films - is ideal for the story and his choices with the screenplay for the style of the fast-paced dialogue, especially in the Williams/Damon therapy sessions, was superb. Clearly Affleck and Damon have a very clear and insightful knowledge and experience of psychology. However, the rest of the film - which the dialogue/screenplay distracts from - is average, with some special moments, but predictable and a bit Hollywood. It is, however, rightly, an immediate modern classic and Robin Williams and Matt Damon (and Ben Affleck for the writing credit with Damon) rightly were praised to high heaven for their performances. A great film in parts but a good film in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I have to admit that it was an exceptional movie for me. I almost shed a tear. Fortunately, I am not a faggy faggot so I do not cry while watching movies. But seriously- the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. The emotions that were depicted in the movie seem to be extremely real and thanks to great actors (esp. affleck bros, Damon) I could feel them (those emotions) too. I recommend a movie to anyone who wants something more than cheap, entertaining action movie. To sum up, the message is quite exceptional. We all think that, we are omnipotent when we reach a certain age (I do not think that he was 21 by accident. Although, the truth is that we can always learn from other people no matter what their education or background are. Simple message = great acting = 10 Thank You</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie that amazed me from start to finish. The way that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote this amazing story about a "bad boy disturbed" that the inside is a true genius. And that just needs help not only to show it to the world, but for himself, and at the same time helping those around you, but this is a short summary of what this Masterpiece has to give. Matt Damon it is superb, and it grabs his character (which he wrote) so impressive and credible; Robin Williams in one of his best roles, his character is the most beloved and fun (and a little perturbed), the entire cast does a phenomenal job, Stellan Skarsg?rd, Minnie Driver, Ben Affleck, all perfect. The film teaches us that we all have a soul mate, not a romantic, but one that challenges us and transforms us what we are in the future ... (I wish have both). A film very well done, very well written, we laugh, we cry, we learn, we see things in a differently way. And for all who feel alone in their lives, I just say ... "It's not your fault!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A case where Hollywood lucks out and 2 young writers/actors come along and create a masterful script that tricks Robin Williams to do a sequel to Dead Poets Society. Not literally, but the story's formula and function of Robin's DPS character remain the same. Calculus replaces poetry with a hint of matrices to come.Outside of setting and soundtrack mistakes of Gus Van Sant's mid-life crisis and 1970s revelry that makes this film seem a decade older than his classic My Own Private Idaho (1991), the first half is genius. Then, he and Robin Williams turn it into more of a seize the girl, love-will-save-you clich than an outside-the-matrix, seize your genius modern-day intellectual fantasy.Despite the probably unintentional attempts to subvert it and the annoying product placement that had taken over Hollywood, the story is an adult male intellectual/geek fantasy. Even the gals are telling dirty jokes about alternative uses for their mouths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good .. Excellent Will Hunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that draw my attention when I opened this movie on IMDb was this lovely, warm picture of Matt Damon and Robin Williams. By the expression on their faces, it seemed like a movie filled with emotions and after seeing it I realized how right I had been. The plot of the movie is so well organized. That's the first thing that comes to my mind. They devoted enough time for every aspect of Will's character. Nothing was done in haste. First half of the movie is about his intelligence, about him and his Professor trying to improve his skills. And the other half highlights completely different side of him. It shows wide range of emotions that we hadn't known he felt. That even he hadn't known he felt. Throughout the movie, the story is developing slowly but surely and it's full of catchy lines and witty phrases. Another amazing thing about this movie is his excellence, Robin Williams. His portrayal of Sean Maguire is one of the best I've ever seen. And also, character lived up to all my expectations. I had known that Robin is a psychologist before watching the movie, and I find such characters highly entertaining, but this one is, by far, my favourite. So intelligent man, and yet, full of pain because of the loss he had suffered. His love for his wife tugged at my heartstrings and made me cry from time to time. The way he talked about meeting her for the first time is, in my opinion, what love should be. Though annoying he may seem, Prof. Gerald is not all that bad, in my opinion. Even though he completely neglected the emotional part of Will and was more concentrated on enhancing his skills, he had best interest in his heart for Will and I don't see that as a bad thing. He knows that life is hard and thinks that Will should use his smartness he was endowed with as much as he can.In my humble opinion, mixture of these two characters, Sean and Gerald, is the best parent Will could have ever had. The realistic one and sensitive one.I must admit, to my shame, that before this movie I had never seen any movie starring Matt Damon, but he blew me away. His performance was impeccable. And Will .. oh, Will is just so amazing. No super- intelligent character has ever been that adorable. That scene where he degrades that Mr. "know-it-all" from Harvard was both charming and funny. Skylar and him are also adorable and one of the most natural screen couples I have ever seen. And the best thing is that in the end, with all bad things that have happened to him in life and all doubts he had in the movie, he gets a happy ending.Also, the relationship between Will and Sean is so well-written. When they met Will was so arrogant, thinking he knows it all and started insulting Sean and making false presumptions about his life. Even though it offended him, he saw it as a challenge. He saw a kid who desperately needed help and accepted to see him in the future. The scene on the bench, in front of a lake is, the most touching and beautiful scenes ever made. Damon and Affleck are true artists for making this scene. And it was also the turning point for this relationship ? that's where Will realized that there's more to that man that he had previously thought. Not to mention "It's not your fault" part of the movie. The more he repeated that sentence the more I was falling in love with the movie. So powerful and , as I had mentioned, artistic.In a word, the best movie I have ever seen and that's why I'm giving it a ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I loved it so much, I watch it over and over again. This is an excellent film about a man who is an absolute math genius who could do anything as a job, but refuses to because of the demons he has in his mind. I love how good all of the characters are like Will(Matt Damon), Chuck(Ben Affleck), Sean(Robin Williams), and skylah(MInnie Driver). Matt and Ben's best film of their career. It goes through the horrible abuse Will Hunting faced as a child and how he overcomes it. We also find out late in the film that Sean the therapist also dealt with some abuse as a child. My favorite line is when will starts out by saying "he used to just set a belt, a stick, and a wrench on the table and say choose" then Sean says "I would have to go with the belt" then will says "no I used to go with the wrench" Sean says"why" will says "cause f*** him thats why". Will was talking about his foster father because he used to be an orphan.Greatly scripted film and an unbelievable story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boston's Diamond in the Rough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though he's from a blue-collar background in the South End of Boston, Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is an undiscovered genius. Working as a janitor at Harvard University, he solves a complex equation on a blackboard which brings him to the attention of prestigious Math Professor, Prof. Gerald Lambeau (Stellen Skarsgard). When Will's troubled ways land him with a jail sentence, Lambeau reaches out and persuades the judge to release Will on the account that he'd be under Lambeau's supervision and would attend a weekly therapy session. This film, Good Will Hunting, is based on the clich that a zero can become a hero. There's also a bit of romance thrown in with a girl attending Harvard, played by Minne Driver. This film follows plenty of the movie- industry rules, as well as having an easily anticipated conclusion. But although Good Will Hunting may be a prime example of a predictable movie plot, the genuine presence the actors bring to the film, as well as the brilliantly written script, brings forth a new dimension in the story that makes this movie both exceptional and unique.Matt Damon does an astounding job playing a troubled individual who's both frustrated with the world, yet destined to be great. He banters effortlessly with his main crew, which includes three other rough-and-tumble men, in a way that makes it easily believable they've known each other for years. His snarky attitude doesn't appear like an acting role when he's being interrogated by pesky interviewing- therapists. Matt's on screen relationship with his actual therapist (Robin Williams) demonstrates how hard it is to attain trust from someone who's been hurt before. The acting that takes place during a couple of the "sessions" is so believable and moving, my eyes started tearing up. Known for being in lighter movies, Robin Williams not only takes on this serious role of Dr. Sean Maguire, but seems to relish it. His relationship with Professor Lambeau was one that happens on a daily basis in reality. One old friend will inevitably be more successful than the other, and the mixed emotions between them makes for an interesting subplot that adds to the movement of the entire movie. Their fight about Will's future was raw and emotional and touched the soul on many levels. The true secret that makes this entire film more than just another forgettable movie, is the script. The story of Will Hunting is gloriously written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. It is honest, true, flawed, yet entirely and utterly human. The continuous string of swears and f-bombs that grace the dialogue of the rowdy group of men is perfect for beer drinking and friendly mocking between close friends. All of the arguments and fights in the movie have a ring of truth and honesty that every director and screenwriter strives for. The movie in all it's entirety is just a beautiful story of hardwork, building trust, and following what you love. The camera angles, soft focus, and wonderful lighting add to the atmosphere. Throughout the entire film, there was a particular melody that popped up. The music was discordant, yet hopeful and persistent, and matched the theme of the movie. Matt Damon's character Will never thought much of himself or of what he could be, until Prof Lambeau took notice. The ending of the movie was predictable to a tee, but it ended so perfectly I wouldn't have it any other way. Some people can never believe in themselves, until someone believes in them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting '97</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Highlight: Nominated for 9 Oscars and won two Oscars that includes Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (Robin Williams) and Best Screenplay (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) Good Will Hunting proved to be a rise to Stardom for Matt DamonThis is an intelligent film about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a young genius, who because of his disadvantaged and abusive childhood, ends up as a janitor at MIT where he could easily be the head of the Mathematics department. Though the story is a bit far stretched (it is hard to believe a kid this bright wouldn't have been noticed by someone who would have guided him towards higher education), once you put that aside, it is a fascinating character study of a very complex and dynamic young man. Will is discovered after solving a math challenge left on a blackboard by the head of the math department at MIT. This throws his life into turmoil, as the mathematicians want to make him into a prodigy. He also begins seeing a therapist (Robin Williams) who forces him to confront many deep emotions and experiences he had been repressing. The effect this has on him, and his relationship with his friends is powerful and makes for an engrossing tale. The cast is well-assembled with Matt Damon delivering a fine performance which snagged him his only Oscar nomination till date. Minnie Driver, as Will's love interest, also landed out with an Oscar nomination. Robin Williams won his first Oscar for his role after three previous nominations. The rest of the cast is solid, particularly the under-appreciated Stellan Skarsg?rd The story is interesting and quite entertaining .The comedy is done well and placed well throughout the film. I do have a complaint about the film that is the absurd amount of swearing in the film. I agree that sometimes it is necessary, but there is a truly unnecessary amount of language in the film. But please, don't let that discourage you from seeing the film; it is a great film to watch. Overall, "Good Will Hunting", despite the incredibly precious title, is worthwhile a film. Fine performances and a compelling (Oscar-winning) script combine to produce a memorable film that should be fondly remembered for years to come.My Rating - 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterfully develops complex relationships</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script for Good Will Hunting was written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck who both star in the movie. Damon plays the lead role of Will Hunting and Affleck plays his best friend, Chuckie Sullivan. The theme of the film is a focus on ideas, specifically the complexity of human relationships and social problems. It is surprisingly complex considering the age of the two young writers.Will Hunting is a street-wise Boston kid whose childhood memories involve foster homes and abuse. His daily life involves cruising the streets, hanging out in the local bar and looking for fights. He is employed as a custodian at the prestigious M.I.T.The audience is unaware of Will's photographic memory and genius status until he solves a mathematical problem on an M.I.T. hallway chalkboard that even the most respected M.I.T. professor cannot solve. Ultimately there are four people who try to save Will from his destructive life style. Professor Lambeau, played by Stellan Skarsgard, Sean McGuire, played by Robin Williams, Skylar, played by Minnie Driver, and Chuckie Sullivan.Upon realizing that the custodian solved the elusive mathematical equation, Lambeau reaches out to help Hunting. He agrees to intervene on behalf of the youth, promising a judge he will provide guidance and counseling in exchange for keeping Hunting from jail. After exhausting numerous counselors, Lambeau turns to college friend, Sean McGuire, to counsel Hunting. McGuire and Lambeau have their own complicated relationship stemming from their college days which resurfaces with their rekindled acquaintance.McGuire begins to reach Hunting and seems to be making some progress. Hunting begins a relationship with Harvard student, Skylar, who also challenges him to open up and be honest about his past. As these relationships develop, Hunting can no longer hide from the intimacy that up until now he has so craftily dodged. As a result, when Skylar encourages Hunting to come to California with her, he breaks off the relationship.Hunting refuses to make a career decision after multiple interviews with think tanks set up by Professor Lambeau. McGuire pushes Hunting during their next counseling session about what he wants to do with his life. When Hunting reverts to his old methods of dodging questions, McGuire tells him to leave.Having now removed the individuals who were encouraging him to change his destructive pattern, Hunting returns to work with Chuckie on a construction site. At this point Chuckie becomes the fourth person to tell Hunting he had to take advantage of his gift. The outcome is predictable. Hunting returns to McGuire to mend their falling out and then heads off to find Skylar.The camera work in this film was very well done and assists Director, Gus Van Sant, capture the complexity of the characters' relationships. One particular scene worth noting is a scene of McGuire and Hunting on a park bench by a pond. McGuire is opening up to Hunting about the loss of his wife and the love he had for her. This was the first session in which McGuire appears to crack Hunting's hard shell. The camera remained on the face of McGuire as he told his story. The camera does not move to incorporate Will until McGuire is done with his intimate sharing. All attention, including Hunting's, was focused on McGuire during his testimony.A second piece of camera work captured Hunting allowing his protective walls to break down is a scene where he and Skylar are at a street caf. Their relationship has peaked at this point and one can clearly see they have fallen in love. The camera work completely focuses in on their faces, sharing an intimate moment with the audience.This film gave both Williams and Damon the opportunity of a more challenging role. Each exceeded my expectation of their performance. Few films do this well in developing relationships although some might point to the film Beaches as another which successfully focuses on the complexity of relationships. This is a well written film only surpassed by its acting which is sure to please even the most critical movie-goer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Good Will Hunting" is an inspiring if not surprising tale about learning to plan your future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An important thing we all should know is that everyone is different. Sometimes, a person with certain skills and talents comes from the last place we'd think to find them. In the case of the main title character in Gus Van Sant's 1997 drama "Good Will Hunting", Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a gifted mathematician even though he's only a janitor at MIT. Although a mathematics teacher (Stellan Skarsgard) on campus recognizes his impressive skills, Will isn't interested in pursuing a future as a student and would rather hang out with his pals (Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser) instead. That all changes however when he gets into a fight with someone who bullied him as a kid and faces the possibility of going to jail as a result of his actions. When the teacher gets wind of this incident, he offers to bail Will out under two conditions: 1) he studies mathematics under his supervision, and 2) he sees a therapist regularly. Although Will agrees to this deal, he isn't thrilled with the idea of seeing a therapist and doesn't take his first few therapists seriously. But when the teacher is able to hire his former college roommate (Robin Williams) to get through to Will, Will eventually starts to open up about his past and his current relationship with a British student (Minnie Driver) at MIT. Through their therapy sessions, they start to learn more about one another and realize that they both share important things in common. "Good Will Hunting" is an inspiring, if not surprising, tale about learning to plan for the road ahead and figuring out where you want to go in life. It has committed performances from the entire cast, and a solid script by co-stars Matt Damon and Ben Affleck with a handful of enjoyable moments. "Good Will Hunting" is also a well crafted character study about a young man who has potential as proved with his math skills, but doesn't have the direction towards where he wants to go in life. In a way, all the people that Will comes across are all there to help him. Between his girlfriend, his friends, the therapist and the teacher, they all shape him in more ways than one. The first two-thirds of the film are very well done. The chemistry between Damon and Driver as well as the relationships Damon has with everybody all play out naturally. Then comes the last third of the movie which relies too heavily on the formula most other movies follow. The love interest might possibly leave town and the main character experiences some sort of downfall in which everyone in the audience then knows what will happen next and how everything will be resolved in the end. I've always disliked it when a film resorts to a clichd plot device like this since it takes away the natural authenticity the film had before that point. It also feels too safe to the point where even the slightest bit of creativity is discouraged due to an excessive fear of failure on the filmmaker's part. In particular, it doesn't work in the last third of this movie, since they don't give us a good enough reason why these events were forced to happen in the first place. Other than the film's last third and a few brief slow spots, I liked what "Good Will Hunting" had to offer. I thought its message regarding the importance of figuring out your life goals and dreams is a good moral to reinforce to teenagers and young adults. Although there's generous profanity in it, the dialogue and the situations the characters undergo were well thought through by writers/stars Damon and Affleck. Even with its predictability, the story that was being told had a certain originality to it and the characters were fairly engaging enough to make the drama more stimulating. As long as you don't expect too many surprises, with the exception of one or two, there's enough substance in "Good Will Hunting" that makes it worth a viewing.</fullReview>

This films manages to find emotional breakdown or breakthrough if you will, without losing the tough, sarcastic, street talk and mentality. Although there is an important female character, it does not carry the story or is primarily responsible Matt's character's motivation. Instead, this film is more about ALL aspects of life although Will Hunting does make a crucial final decision based around his girlfriend.Great Movie with classic one-liners.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All hail the *intelligent* screenplay! GOOD WILL HUNTING pairs "Bahston" boys Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in their first, and arguably most powerful, bromance to date (excepting maybe their turns as marauding angels in Kevin Smith's DOGMA); written by Damon and Affleck, who deserve every inch of their little gold man (Best Screenplay 1998), a driving story of a disturbed young mathematical genius trying to find his niche in a world that unwittingly ostracizes him for his beautiful mind.Matt Damon is Will Hunting, a brawling teen by day (with his informal gang Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser) and a janitor at a college by night; he is also an autodidactic savant with photographic retention skills and math aptitude to embarrass a rocket scientist. He is "discovered" by physicist Professor Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg?rd) who tries to nudge him on a respectable path by bailing him out of jail on the provision that Hunting will help the Professor solve perplexing mathematics problems and also see a therapist.The math problems are a breeze for Hunting. The therapists are a stickier matter, as they all run screaming from his presence as he pinpoints their insecurities before they can pinpoint his--until he meets Sean Maguire (Robin Williams, unshaven like a bearcub), who brings all his DEAD POET'S philosophic skills to bear on the fast-talking, uncooperative scrapper.Minnie Driver is Skylar, the Harvard student who falls for Hunting, but whom he ends up pushing away neurotically, in an argument-out-of-nowhere scene that is written so well, it doesn't seem like it was written at all, but escalating right before our eyes.When Hunting's neurosis is unlocked by Maguire at the end, the revelation is so simple that we marvel at how easy it is to actually connect with someone, and yet how hard it is to find that connection.The script benefits from being written by two "unknowns" who load it with verve and vitality, realism and dynamism, while still displaying a sound mechanical knowledge of "Hollywood" screenplay construction. Director and pal Kevin Smith aided Affleck and Damon in securing a deal where they had a large amount of control over their story, and director Gus Van Sant would let it play out unobtrusively and intelligently.The Professor and Maguire are at odds on how to handle Hunting--push him into society or let him find it at his own pace; what could have become a clichd pissing contest in a pass Hollywood writer's hands remains a revelatory argument of ethics between two men who are battling their own regrets and just want the best for their surrogate son. If we thought we'd seen the best of Robin Williams in DEAD POET'S SOCIETY or AWAKENINGS (as opposed to his worst in NINE MONTHS or FATHER'S DAY), he embraces this sober psychiatrist's role like the bearcub embracing his face; and it took a couple of novices to put words in his mouth that would melt like butter and ring like the bells of Notre Dame. (He would deservedly walk away with a little gold man of his own for Best Supporting Actor.) The best aspect of the script is that it truly captures the contempt and separation that a virtuoso feels for people who cannot grasp the art or discipline that he finds so awkwardly simple. Hunting describes his aptitude for equations with an insightful analogy: "Beethoven looked at a piano and it just made sense to him; he could just play. I look at a piano, I see a bunch of keys, three pedals and a box of wood--but Beethoven, Mozart, they saw it, they could 'just play.' I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably couldn't hit the ball out of Fenway, and I can't play the piano. But when it came to stuff like that, I could always 'just play'." Hunting is offered jobs dealing with superstring theory, advanced algorithms, heavy duty CIA stuff, which he isn't interested in, at one point raging into a tirade that connects all the political corruption in the world to the personal level, "...America only over there to install a government who would sell them oil at a good price..." Of course, the "troubled character" has to find his redemption and it is done subtly, with every payoff hitting elegantly: Hunting's best friend Chuckie (Affleck) laments Hunting is still hauling bricks with him, and hopes for the day he can arrive to pick up Hunting for work and Hunting is not there, "...and you're just gone, no goodbyes, no nothing"; Maguire tells Hunting of how he met his wife by giving up a classic baseball game, "I told my friends, 'I'm going to see about a girl'." When these moments hit, the performances sell them; they are not forced, and create magnificent screen moments for Williams, Affleck and Damon.We wish Affleck and Damon could once again write something half as good as this masterpiece of cerebral mayhem. Though they've parlayed their grand win into continued success through the years, nothing they've done individually or together yet matches the raw (dare we call it "indie") flavor-blast of GOOD WILL HUNTING. Like Costner, Welles and Lucas, they seem to have peaked at the head of their careers. It's ironic that these two young guys (Affleck and Damon), now renowned for their sex symbol status, shot themselves into the A-List by writing and starring in a dialog-driven mindfest! --Poffy The Cucumber</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazingly Different film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually did enjoy this movie very much although it was a bit slow. I was intrigued by the character, Will Hunting which was well played by Matt Damon. I wanted to find out why he was a troublemaker, why he was scared and every other thing. It was just a good film with a good storyline and an interesting ending.The favourite character choice was a tie between Will Hunting and Sean Maguire played by Matt Damon and Robin Williams respectively. Will Hunting was the main character in the film and the storyline revolved around helping him. It would have been very hard to script Hunting's dialogue as you would have to show him as a very smart man and it was successful as he fired off very detailed negative reasons why he wouldn't do something and it showed who he was and what kind of childhood he had. Hunting was just a man who had a troubled life and didn't know what to do with his enormous talent and needed the guidance of a mature man. This character was one of the most interesting characters that I have watched.I would recommend to mature people who want to watch a unique movie and will be able to understand the whole purpose of this film.This was a creative film that I really enjoyed, It had an all-star cast with Williams, Damon and Affleck and they didn't let me down. The storyline was a unique one and it wasn't exposed to quickly but took it's time which allowed the audience to really let each scene saturate in their mind for a moment longer and it all added to the great film it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well made with some nice musical numbers thrown into the mix. Nothing particularly different in the cinematography but still well put together. On the performance front, Matt Damon did an excellent job as Will Hunting, as did Robin Williams as Sean Maguire. I also thought Stellan Skarsg?rd did a very good job as Prof. Gerald Lambeau, also Ben Affleck as Chuckie Sullivan and Minnie Driver as Skylar. Also worthy of note were Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser as Will's friends Morgan O'Mally and Billy McBride.Although I thought the film was very good and the performances were all excellent I didn't quite get the relationship between Will and Skylar. I didn't feel enough time was spent with them for the relationship to become as strong as it was portrayed. Other than that I was with it one hundred percent; I believed in the characters and I found no problem in following their motivations. There's also some great dialogue that gives this one an edge, I really enjoyed that aspect. Over all, a decent drama with maybe slight problem or two, but still?

		<shortDescription>A compelling drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1997 a small film made the name of two young actors, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck who were so frustrated about their lack of opportunities wrote their own screenplay so they could star in the film, earning them a Oscar win at the same time.Will Hunting (Damon) is genius with a troubled past. He is working as a janitor at M.I.T. when he solves a maths formula that is meant to challenge the best students at the university. Will is also on probation after he hit a cop. Mathematics professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) takes Will under his wing, seeing the potential in him to do whatever he wants and gets his friend Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to counsel the young man. Will also meets Skylar (Minnie Driver), a British Harvard student and starts a relationship with her. But Will is his also his own worst enemy.Screenplay is really strong and you can see why Ben Affleck has become a respected director. It was a dialogue driven film that focuses on a character who is troubled, who has a tremendous give but is bitter towards people who had the wealth and luxury to go to university. He is also a man who does not know how lucky he is that people care about him and does not realise how lucky he is with his intelligence. There is a great cast who give authentic performances, Damon, Skarsgard, Williams (who won an Oscar for this role) and Driver in the main roles. There are not good guys or bad guys, they are shares of grey with all of them and the real antagonist is Will to himself. Skarsgard and Williams' characters have different approaches and views about Will but they both have his best interests at heart. Will starts off as a real jerk and I personally enjoyed it when Williams' character does get to give Will a telling off.Gus Van Sant could have made visually safe film but he was able to inject a style to the film, using hand-held cameras for long shots and panning shots and edited TV footage from a famous Red Sox game whilst Sean tells Will the story about how he met his wife. Van Sant to able to make sure all the different stories involving Will's life all get a fair amount of screenplay and it is easy to follow who is who and what is happening. He is actually better a mainstream director then when he makes indie flicks.There are a few scenes that do not work, particularly when Will sends his friend (Affleck) to be pretend to be him for a job interview which was played for humour but it was just felt out of place.Good Will Hunting is a compelling drama with a story worthy to tell. It is worth checking out and for a dialogue heavy film it still keeps your attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Hunting, a janitor at MIT, has a gift for mathematics but needs help from a psychologist to find direction in his life.I've seen the film back when I was about 10. I really didn't understand much of what was going on, and declared it was boring. Now today I decided to watch the film, forgetting that I was just a little kid, and was fully prepared to absorb myself into mature emotions that I never understood back then... And surprisingly, I was in for an experience, because Good Will Hunting is like a more understanding version of Shawshank Redemption. While that movie can be good in it's own ways, this one contains realism alongside the emotions, which is better already. So the acting, as you can already tell, is going to be brilliant. Robin Williams (if he's not playing in a children's film) gives the film it's best, and does it best. I love Matt Damon as well, and he basically carried the film with Williams. The supporting cast was great as well. Everything else was great too, but instead of praising the film we already know is GOOD, I want to point out my annoyances that brought down the score. The film tends to get a little corny. Now don't get me wrong, the film is well-acted, but some scenes totally trashed this idea. I'm talking about Matt Damon's rants about the law, or Ben Affleck's attempt to act cool. Although they didn't ruin the film, they annoyed me. But avoiding these annoyances, I found the movie brilliant. The story was a moving experience, and if the acting wasn't there, I think the movie would still be good. The soundtrack was also great as well, and it fit the film in a strange way... So without blabbering on about how good the film is, I'm going to rate it an 8/10...Should you should it? If you can get past the slow-burn pacing and the little things that annoy you, you will be pleasantly surprised. The chemistry between Matt Damon and Robin Williams is pure brilliance, and the film carries it's messages throughout brilliantly. The movie is pure brilliance. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I am not quite as enamored with this film as are many, it is very good. I had never watched it somehow until 2012, although I remembered well the rise of Matt Damon because of this film. And, of course, it was written by Ben Affleck and Damon.The plot is simple, Damon plays a brilliant laborer who is forced to see a therapist (ultimately Robin Williams) and study advanced mathematics with a renowned professor (Stellan Skarsg?rd) in order to avoid serving jail time for a bloody brawl and a past record. Williams "gets it" and finally begins to help Damon, although the journey is not an easy one. Meanwhile, love for Damon enters the picture through college student Minnie Driver. One of the most touching scenes, in my view, is when fellow laborer and pal Affleck tells Damon that his greatest hope is that he leaves his present life and becomes a success.Perhaps the very best performance of the film is that of Minnie Driver, who was nominated for best supporting Oscar. Robin Williams was excellent...and controlled here...which did garner him the best supporting actor Oscar.What was most interesting for me was that I had a little difficulty getting into Damon's performance...not because it wasn't good...it was great. But because -- having not seen the movie previously -- I know how I feel about the Matt Damon we have come to know over the past decade or so, and here he plays against type. The sort of bad guy, instead of man we mostly see now as being very responsible. I'm sort of glad I waited to see it after all these years.Strong film. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It appears the jury is hung... many people either loved or hated this movie. I can tell you why I loved it. First of all the script. I think it had a real slice of life, and brilliance in it. Sorry, but some people do use 4 letter words to express themselves. And no, it doesn't mean that's because they lack intelligence to use anything else. I can rise to the occasion any time I need w/out profanity. But it is how I think &amp; speak in my day to day life. The language shouldn't even be an issue. If that's all you heard, you weren't listening! The brilliance in it is everywhere. For example, William's character putting Damon's character in place by noting that he sneers at things that he has no real life experience with. I know people like that. Then moments when he (William's character) says gems like, "I'll save you the suspense sport- she isn't perfect &amp; neither are you- the question is whether you are perfect for each other." I'm paraphrasing of course. The question of relationships, and life career decisions- the courage to risk and overcoming whatever your background is, are all a part of real life. This isn't supposed to be about genius or some "white trash" as someone else said (some people might say the kids in this movie aren't trash, just normal hard working, middle class guys) - it's about love, life and courage- courage to ante up &amp; try again, no matter how many times life knocks us around. The acting, direction and script are wonderful. They definitely deserved the Oscar for this. It has soul. It has meaning &amp; I am sad for the people that didn't get it. As the movie "American Beauty" said... LOOK CLOSER.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant (mostly because we share the same hometown of Portland, Oregon) has always been one of the filmmakers I have paid attention to. I never give him undue bias, because he can definitely be hit or miss. This, however, was and always will be, his biggest hit (in terms of making an ideal film). There are hundreds of quotable lines in here that espouse more philosophy than most filmmakers pack into trilogies. The direction is steady and the acting is great, but what really sets this movie apart is the writing. The writing of Good Will Hunting is so exquisitely realistic and philosophical, that to contemplate your own life during the movie is almost a necessity. There is not a whole lot of emotional manipulation in the movie, it is basically just such a universal story, that to be unemotional would be callous.Similar to the quote in the title, delivered by Robin Williams in his best role, this movie isn't perfect, but no movie is...the question is whether or not it is the perfect movie for you. It doesn't matter if I watch another ten thousand movies, this movie will always be in my top 20.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a powerful psychological drama that highlights personal growth in life and the relationships that we build around ourselves. The film is about a young genius Will Hunting played by Matt Damon who has had no formal education but is being suppressed by his past of abusive foster parents and troubled relationships. He is a janitor at MIT where his brilliance is discovered by Professor Lambeau (). Lambeau offers Will an opportunity in working with him on some of the most difficult mathematical equations instead of incarceration after Will beats a man who bullied him in elementary school. Along with working with Prof. Lambeau, Will is ordered to attend psychiatric treatment. Lambeau recruits an estranged college friend Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) in order to get through to Will emotionally and to help him realize his potential and to act upon it. Also in this film is Minnie Driver who plays as Skylar, a Harvard undergrad who is quickly falling in love with Will. Their relationship hits a rocky road when it is revealed that Will has had a troubling past and is having problems coping that she is moving to California to attend Stanford.The movie focuses on the human psyche and the psychological impact our past has on the relationships that we have at the moment. Wills relationship with Skylar is impacted by his past abuse with foster parents and his rough upbringing in South Boston. After a great first date with her, he doesn't call her because he feels that she is perfect at the moment, but in reality through the help of Sean, he realizes that he is sabotaging the potential relationship because he fears that he is perfect at the moment and doesn't want to ruin his "perfect" image with her. Throughout the film he lies about himself just because he is afraid to let her into his real world. He is afraid that she will see who he was or is and this will affect the way that she thinks about him. Another theme in this film is personal growth. Will, through connections of Professor Lambeau, has many high profile job interviews but shuns them away because he is currently satisfied with doing "honorable" work such as being a janitor and demolition work. Chuckie though sets him straight as the true friend that he is. Chuckie understands and realizes that his own life is South Boston, but for Will he realizes that he could conquer the world and that anything less would be a slap in the face to those that know him and what he is capable of. The movie is very powerful and has realness about it. Every day we are faced with the opportunity to grow personally and to expand our relationships with those we trust and love. Robin Williams who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this film does a brilliant job of portraying a down and out psychiatrist who has cashed out his chips for fear of losing anymore after his wife passes away with cancer. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck did a tremendous job of writing this screenplay and showcased their command for attention when on the big screen at the same time. The acting is incredible and it seems as though the players on set jelled to perfection. The story is intriguing and captivating in keeping your attention. Though there are no twist or turns, the relationships between all of the characters evolve into something beautiful. Overall the film is a joy to watch with powerful scenes about love and life relationships, and having the courage of laying it all on the line knowing that failure is an option.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>somehow it works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is an improbable film about a young man with an unbelievable IQ and gift for mathematics. Set in Boston, Mass, it deals will many issues that I found prevalent in that city when I was growing up 40 years ago. Everyone, rich or poor, wants to be "smaaart" in Boston. No one wants to be a "fucking moron". So, here you have everyone's secret fantasy brought to life, especially if you are a "southie" from the poor part of town. And that fantasy is to be able to outsmart the MIT and Harvard boys. Will Hunting does just that, and the fact that he is a janitor at esteemed MIT only serves to further illustrate the class conflicts that only his prodigious talent can penetrate and overcome. Now I think that many people watching this film did not find Will's character to be believable. But Will is first of all a Boston native and so I believe that the movie is somewhat autobiographical or at least the expression of a fantasy of his. This makes the movie work for me as he is able to be himself with all of its contradictions - angry and foul mouthed but also smart and wanting the world to know it. He embodies well the Boston I remember with all of its class tensions. Intellectuals hold a place of great respect there, but they also can be resented and envied. That resentment is what fuels Will's ambition and gives the movie a sense of believability. Could this happen in real life? - sure, but only if the gift is toned down somewhat. Yeah, but thats Hollywood and you have to expect that his talent would be trumped up a bit.Anyway, so I enjoyed this movie on many levels. In particular I loved Minnie Driver and believe that without her, things could have fallen apart very easily. I don't think her relationship with Will was awkward or forced. Smart girls often fall for less fortunate guys. This was one of the more satisfying relationships in a movie I have seen in quite a while. And Robin Williams puts in a strong performance although if you are from Boston you know he's no southie. He is, though, a little like Popeye the sailor man - still a force to be reckoned with. Did he and Will have to bond over fart humor though? Seems they could have worked on that a bit...But Good Will hunting is overall a well written, thought provoking drama that explores a lot of issues and relationships surrounding class, career ambitions, personal triumph and tragedy. No one escapes unharmed and there are no gods in the end. The fortunate are humbled, and Will can never escape his past. This is Boston. Here we end up with a compromise of sorts where several individuals from completely different backgrounds teach each other a few things about life and grow as a result. Now if you had told me the storyline before I saw the movie, I would have been dubious that it could work. But because you had two up and coming, talented individuals writing and acting from the heart, a sensitive director, some good music and nice city shots, this is a movie I would watch again for sure. Two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When people have a hidden talent, or can do something that very few other people can, they tend to show it off or even brag about it. Not the case in Good Will Hunting. Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, a closet-genius who works as a janitor at the prestigious College MIT. He spends his days mopping hallways, and solving complicated math problems outside on the chalkboard.Will spends most of his time with friends Chuckie (Affleck), Billy (Hauser), and Morgan (Casey Affleck), but once they all get in another fight on a basketball court, Professor Gerald Lambeau (Skarsg?rd) from MIT says that he must look into seeing a therapist and agree to study mathematics at MIT. Will agrees, and after a few failed therapists an aging man named Sean (Williams) is called in to help Will overcome his struggles.On the side note, Will meets a girl named Skylar (Driver) at a bar, and after a while they begin seeing each other. The problem is Will keeps pushing away at her, when really, he should be pulling closer.The script, written by actors Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, is outstanding and certain monologues are so well written and originally acted that they rank up there with some of the dialog scenes from a Kevin Smith film. Ironically, both Affleck and Damon appeared in Dogma two years later reciting the same amazing dialog, only this time, by Kevin Smith.Certain scenes where Sean is telling his life-story to Will are lengthy, but you never see the film lose your attention. Good Will Hunting is a rarity in story and in story-telling. And having two amazing youths write a script so advanced and so powerful just is the icing on the cake.If there's anything the film lacks is its scenes with Affleck and Damon. Both create amazing chemistry on screen, and when brought together show off creative dialog, intense arguments, and shocking realism. The final dialog scene between the boys takes place at a construction site, where both the boys work. Chuckie tells Will that it would be an insult to the other workers here if he was still here in twenty years. Chuckie can't understand why someone like Will wouldn't want to show off his smarts, and I think I kind of sympathize with Will on that note.When someone posses a talent in something they don't always want to show it. I know a number of people who are very good at a different variety of things, but none willing to show off their true potential. For me, I always want to show people what I can do, and am afraid of saying some things because I worry that they will get the wrong idea about me. I always want to show everyone my true abilities, and what makes up someone like me. But in Will's case, he doesn't want to do that for comfort purposes.Good Will Hunting is authentic and rare. It's a film where almost everything is powerful and everything is so well done. The theme of "self-worth" is discussed in frequent films, but here, it is discussed stronger and with more heart than many films. It's a gem, shining stronger in places where others don't even show a glare.Starring: Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, Stellan Skarsg?rd, Cole Hauser, and Casey Affleck. Directed by: Gus Van Sant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting is a emotionally moving movie with a twist to it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the movie "Good Will Hunting", the theme is based on the character Will Hunting. Matt Damon as Will Hunting is the product of children services. He has grown up as a mad and angry child who inflicts his pain onto others from foster home to foster home. As an adult, he continues to allow his anger to control his life. He surrounds himself with local friends Ben Affleck as Chuckie Sullivan, Casey Affleck as Morgan O'Mally, and Cole Hauser as Billy McBride, which gives him the feeling of family and loyalty. Within his journey he has realized that he has a gift in numbers which allows him to decipher equations from the college he is employed at, as a janitor. Gain Will get into another fight and is placed in jail. He sparks the interest from a math professor Gerald Lambeau, which is played by Stellan Skarsgard. Professor Lambeau helps him get out of jail with two stipulations. The stipulations are that Will must go to therapy and work with him doing math. Within this time, he has met a beautiful young lady, Minnie Driver as Skylar, from Harvard a pre-med student that kindles a relationship with him. After many attempt to five other therapist, Robin Williams become his therapist as Sean Maguire. Will sabotages his relationship with Skylar when he realizes it has developed into more, when she tells him she loves him. Within time, Sean breaks down the large walls that Will has built around him, and Will comes to truth about his life, that it is not his fault and that he loves Skylar.The movie takes place in South Boston. The area that resembles poverty, old, run down, and dirty. The colors and lighting are dull and lifeless in the beginning, but as the movie progresses the colors and lighting become more bright and vibrant. Outside become sunnier and brighter. Inside even looks cleaner with more life. You see more reds tones within the movie as it develops. There is even a scene where Will is looking at a picture and he comments about the color and texture of a picture that Sean has painted that sits in the window. The darker scenes are when Will and Skylar are together in her dorm room. The scenes are focused more on their faces and their moods instead of what they are doing.The director Gus Van Sant developed close and distant scenes to pull the audience into the movie and/or to distant them of the surroundings. He had angles from above looking down at the beginning of the movie when we seen Chuckie coming to Will's house, and then when the boys got into a fight. We had distant scenes when he pulled back for us to see the city. Plus, he used close-ups of people's faces to show us their feelings to bring us into the movie and to feel empathy for the actors/actresses. Just as in: Will fighting, you could feel the revenge he felt, Skylar telling Will she loved him as he pushed her away, and the hug that Will and Sean had when he realize he was not the fault of his anger or his life.By Will going to Sean, the therapist, Will finds the cause of his own pain and anger, as the therapist finds insight and passion in himself through working with his patient, like in the movie Equus.The title explains the theme of the movie, The life and times of Will Hunting. Will is a good guy; he just has not realized that he is talented and that he has isolated his feelings from the rest of the world, and that he blames himself. It took the love of a woman and the in-site of a therapist to find his inter-self. This was the first time I had seen this movie, and I truly loved it. I love a movie that can give me multiple emotions and end on a good note.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a math problem: whats (2xB) X (2xA)? Two times beautiful times two times amazing, equals, the hit motion picture, "Good Will Hunting". The film follows around a Harvard janitor that breaks the law most often, but has a mind like a mathematician. Weekly, he visits his match, a psychologist who helps him with his life's steps. The film just really focuses on finding his true destiny. It felt like a true-to-life feature about real people. This movie is really enjoying, and it's one of the more finest movies ever made. Written in a powerful script by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who also starred as characters in the movie, and including other members of the cast including Robin Williams and Minnie Driver, the film takes our lives to the next level, and teaches us to find our true destiny and to know who we really are as people. Matt Damon brings the performance of a lifetime as Will Hunting, but it's he and Robin Williams, as Damon's psychologist, that really stand up for this movie. Director Gus Van Sant has provided a heartwarming movie with a beautiful message, and he improves with no doubt. I really enjoyed for its fine writing, brilliant music score, and great characters. The film was an excellent choice to be known as one of the best movies of all time. "Good Will Hunting", in my review, "an inspirational national treasure of a movie."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Matt Damon was attending Harvard University, he was assigned to write a screenplay. That screenplay was Good Will Hunting.Although it may not be the most original film, but it is the most well-written film I've seen in a long time. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have crafted a script in which there is good in every character, and which it is shown.Damon and Affleck Won an Oscar for their screenplay which was well deserved. Damon and Williams were also nominated for their acting, which was also well deserved. It's a shame Titanic came out the same year or this would've won best picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is just a very great drama from the late 90's I believe if it was not for Titanic, this movie would have swept the Oscars. This movie did deserve to win the screenplay award. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck really wrote a fine script.This is about some hotshot kid who is always getting into trouble. It's up to some psychology professor to change the ways of the kid or else he will be spending time in jail.This is the first serious movie I have seen that featured Robin Williams. He did a very good job and I was impressed. Matt Damon is likable in any movie he's in. Ben Affleck did a decent job as well.There are some powerful scenes that may have people in tears. There is plenty of cursing but it works with the film.Overall, this is a great drama and I will watch it again. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very special. It features very surprising acting, a great script, and much more. Everyone in the cast does an good job, but the two that stand out are Matt Damon and Robin Williams. They are both phenomenal. Matt does a great job in his role as a punk who doesn't know how to escape his punk lifestyle (also doesn't even know if he wants to) despite being a genius. He plays being a genius very well. When he is given the big scientific words to say very quickly he does it like a real genius would. Then there is Robin Williams giving a wonderful performance. With most of the movies you have probably seen him in sucking you'll be surprised by how much of a good job he does here. Then there is the very good script to back this movie up. Ben and Matt will surprise you with how good their writing is. Also if you know Affleck for his work in stuff like "Gigli" trust me when I say that he can be a great writer and actor if he gets it right. Also the camera-work here is excellent. Overall this movie I highly recommend for it's strong story and cast.4 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A troubled math genius (Matt Damon) working as a janitor tries to turn his life around with the help of a kindly psychologist (Robin Williams).Good Will Hunting is a cannily packaged self-help story, written by two young stars desperate to get a leg up, and handled smoothly by director Gus Van Sant, with his own sights on the mainstream. It's commercial schmaltz in indie clothing, but it wears it well. The film financially grossed over twenty-two times it's $10,000,000 budget during it's theatrical run and later earned nine Academy Award nominations, two of which it won.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie a week ago, not expecting too much from it. After viewing this movie I was blown away. I thought the acting was exceptional. Robin Williams made easily the best performance of his career. Being that this movie was basically the start of both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's careers, it was a great start for both of them. If the performance by Matt Damon is not Best Actor material, then I have never seen it.The movie is about a janitor at MIT, named Will Hunting (Damon) who is a mathematical genius. He has solved a couple of equations off of chalkboards that none of the students at MIT could solve. For one reason or another, he would rather go out and drink, although underage, with his buddies (Affleck and company) than do something with his life, other than work as a janitor. As he has been abused all of his life, he seeks guidance in his life from a psychiatrist named Sean Maguire (Best Supporting Actor Williams).This movie is definitely one of my top 20 favorite movies of all time. If you catch it on TV, or have to rent it, do not miss this movie. This is the real Best Picture of 1997. 9/10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is a moving drama which talks about what makes life livable. Although Will grew up in humble circumstances and with no parents he's a very talented young man with a great memory and an enormous ability to solve complex mathematics problem. Because Will's such a genius and had read that many books he thinks to know everything about life. It's Sean ? a psychiatrist ? who shows him that he doesn't. Will starts to understand that there are things in life you can't read or learn but you have to experience. So as love. The movie shows in a great way that there are things we can't explain logically. And that it's worth to fight for the one you love. Even if it means that you have to change your life or give something else up. Especially the end, where Will gives up his old life for a girl is very memorable and moving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kept rewinding the part in the credits where it said that the movie was written by Ben Affleck. And then I kept looking at the DVD box that said that he won an award for it as well. Never really liked him as an actor, but I guess he has some strength in writing.So the film is about a young adult named Will Hunting. We see that he lives alone in a small house because his parents abandoned him, works as a janitor at MIT, and spends most of his nights with his friends at bars. But what we also learn in this movie is that Will Hunting is a genius; he has incredible strengths in the fields of not only mathematics, but in all other subjects as well. And when a professor finds out that it was Will Hunting that solved the two Algebraic graph theory problems that was supposed to be solve by a student, rather than a janitor right outside his hallway, the professor goes out to help Will. Under the professor's supervision, Will must educate himself more with Algebraic graph theory class with the professor and sees a therapist two times each week.The rest is just about him trying to find himself. This movie is great and nobody can doubt it. I mean, the message that the movie brings really entertains me because sometimes we can not judge others for just how they may act everyday. It also shows how there are many individuals out there in the world that may have really high IQs, but do not know how to apply it to daily life. And that is what Will Hunting exactly is.Now I have seen Robin Williams a lot in stand up comedy and he was really funny. And there were some parts in the movie that Robin Williams was funny. But I am telling you, the Juilliard studying really came out in this movie. He was persuasive with the character he was playing and had parts where he had to keep expression that many actors struggle to have. And those actors are not even comedians like Robin Williams. Matt Damon also acted well going from charismatic joking to deep depressing attitudes. However, I really did not care for Affleck or Driver's acting. It was alright. The thing was that once you saw Damon and Williams act, those two were okay.The only problem I had with this movie (and if it were not for this problem, I would be giving this film somewhere in the eight range), was that there was unneeded raunchy dialogue and cursing during the back and forth discussions with Will Hunting and his little entourage. I get it that the movie takes place in South Boston, a ghetto if you may say. But still, really? Cursing to make a movie sound good? I mean, I have seen movies where cursing is used a lot more than this film, but there were scenes in this film where you really wanted them to be poignant and because one of the character said the f-word in an incorrect spot during the dialogue, it ruins it. This goes for Damon, Affleck, Williams, and Driver.But this movie really tied up things great in the end. Everything that may have been confusing all comes down well in the end and you get a piece of reality once you finished this movie. I was going to give this movie a low seven as I watched it, but only when you finish this movie, I will have to give it now a high 7. Usually highly-recommended films would be eight or higher, but I say that this would be a nice movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One might think of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck as one-hit-wonders after watching their one and only writing credit come to life in the magnificent "Good Will Hunting." In the wake of its success, both went on to become quite prominent in Hollywood, but only for their acting abilities, leading some to question if they really wrote it themselves or not. But surely, if someone (whether it be William Goldman or Kevin Smith) served as a ghostwriter, they wouldn't have been able to keep their mouths shut all this time. We are speaking of an Oscar winning movie here, afterall. No, the two men (especially Damon) deserve all the credit in the world and it's a shame that they haven't written another movie since, because "Good Will Hunting" has enough soul to eclipse any big-budget block-buster they may have done after the fact.Meet Will Hunting. Will has had a tough childhood. Because of this, he chooses to stick close to his three buddies, drinking and laughing it up, cleaning up the halls of a prestigious college, ignoring his true calling. His gift, it turns out, is that he's more than just a brilliant mathematician ? he's a bonafide genius! When a professor catches him at the blackboard solving a problem no one else can, he insists on helping him. In an attempt to break through his tough shell and promote his talent, a therapist (Robin Williams) is brought in and the two find out they are more similar than they care to admit, as Will comes face to face with his brutal past in an attempt to better his future. Ben Affleck stars as his best friend Chuckie. Chuckie has perhaps one of the finest moments towards the end of the film, in a speech where he tells Will that leaving town without saying goodbye would be the best repayment he could ever give his friends. This is without a doubt one of the most moving moments of the film, and surely, one of Affleck's finest roles. As close friends, Damon and Affleck have chemistry that glows in the film; in fact, they seem like brothers from birth. Robin Williams plays the catalyst and almost-father-figure in Will's life, and turns in another fine performance in a serious role. Some improvised bits help keep things feeling natural and he brings the charm in full force, so much so that it's become a clich for him. "Good Will Hunting" is that rare kind of inspirational film that may actually inspire some. While Will's story may not be the story of Matt Damon's life, it certainly feels real and hits close to home with anyone who doesn't believe in themselves enough. Directed by Gus Van Sant, it's got little style, instead, focusing tightly on its characters, showing them in their most vulnerable moments. The script, afterall, is the star of the film. What you take away from this film will be its message and its humanity; the fact that it stars Robin Williams in a script written by two Hollywood heroes will only be an afterthought. I tried to find a flaw in it all, and alas, there is none. If anything, the story is a little too predictable -- right up to the telegraphed ending -- but that would be side-stepping the whole purpose of the story. If it takes a little clich and predictability to drive home such a powerful story, than so be it. The true meaning of "Good Will Hunting" is invincible in that respect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting, the story of 4 Irish-Catholic boys in Boston circles around the relationship between them and in particular Will Hunting himself. A boy genius that has a troubled background, Will begins counseling with Sean, portrayed in one of the best performances of a generation by Robin Williams. They discuss many things about Will and his life. What will he do with it? Where will he go? All the while, Will is building a romantic involvement with a young college woman named Skylar. The choice in the end comes down to siding to change the world with his genius or to go to California and chase the woman of his dreams. Throughout these tough decisions Will learns about himself, life, and what is truly important in this word. Sometimes money is to some, sometimes love, sometimes neither. Will has options and has choices and this story uplifts the viewer to appreciate the little things in life and understand the complexity of a boy trying to find himself, like most do at that point in their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's not your fault."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon says, to the Oscar reviews on this movie , that "the voters aren't always right", and he's so correct. This is so far the most soul-clutching movie I've ever seen. It's as simple as that.For people who never understand how emotionally bruised teens end up in various symptoms of depression, go watch this movie. WATCH CLOSELY.Watch and see for yourself, how pain builds over pain, and eventually bricks up a thick, cold, ugly wall that resists sunlight to come in. How he who with such a wall established inside "pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him", and that however much he may in a corner of his heart longs for genuine warmth or intimacy, he's just not able to open up and let them in. And, most importantly, watch for when the WALL is being melted down, how much emotion can explode from and flood out of that person and break you, the watcher, down into wild tears, if you are able to comprehend the amount of pain behind it.Matt Damon did it, with incredible accuracy. Point is when you approach such subject with emotionally bruised characters,even the slightest hint of inauthenticity could easily give you away----for the people who did experience it know exactly how it is. And any mishandling of such emotion, too far-pushed or too slow, will inevitably cause the audiences to resent----for they felt like being misexplored at their most painful spot.But he did so well. He causes you to resonate with your own bruises, face up to your own pain. No patronizing, no preaching, no trivializing. Every scar was revealed in an authentic, respectful, humane and serious kind of way that you end up in gratitude that the creator of this film truly cares----it's not just about a movie, it's about psychological wounds many share in common. It's about human, and humanity.I wonder how Matt Damon did it so well. I'd rather assume that he did, for himself once had a similar experience in life, than that he simply achieved this by outstanding acting skills. The latter would be nearly impossible to do, having known for myself what this type of pain was really like.Affleck and Damon are an unbelievable team, both in acting and writing this movie. Robin Williams sure as hell deserves the Oscar he got for his role here, and the rest of the cast all did a great job. The movie has a very smooth and well-structured storyline. No waste scenes, one step tightly after another, unfolding the character's emotion progresses. When you finally witness Williams's role gets to the soul of Damon's role with a number of "It's not your fault", your icy wall if you have one too, shattered with it.Most soulful movie I've ever seen. For me it's mostly because I suffered similar bruises myself, but note this, you do not need such thing to appreciate it. All you need to be, is a true human being.Go see Good Will Hunting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What do you want to do...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I go on with my ranting, I want to first mention that I write this message with the intention of making known my belief of what this movie is about and what sort of connection it's attempting to make. One who's never seen this movie should feel that this message tells you what the central theme of this movie is, whereas for the ones who've seen it, this should offer nothing more than another point of view.I feel the central idea of this movie is to put forward a person (Will) with an infinite ("bound by nothing") potential and at the same time an inner demon that held him back from the world. And what Sean (Robin Williams) offered him is courage and he taught Will that part of living life is to have this courage to face his inner demons and choose his own path without fear. ***What do you want to do?***One of the major theme in this movie is this very question. By putting will forward and showing that with all of his genius, he's lost when facing with this simple question. What do we want to do? The point of this question is not to get an answer as simple as "I want to be a lawyer or a doctor". I feel the point of this question is the question itself. It asks you to give an answer that ,despite all the genius and all the power of reason and logic, you can not find a definitive answer to. It asks you to understand yourself, to search for something that you can never truly know you've found. It involves devotion,love,risk, loss and disappointment, something Will will never dare to face. When Sean asked Will this question, he wasn't expecting will to answer it with a definitive answer, but Will is thinking of it as a question and he can come up with all the reasonable answers in the world, they would still be wrong, because for will, he's too scared to face his own inner demon and too confused to know what to do with himself. What Sean offered will is the reflection of his own life. He tells will despite all the pain and loss, it's OK, because that doesn't diminish even slightly the greatness of love and life. He showed will that true loss is only when you love something more than you love yourself, and at the same time that's where true happiness emerges. It is through all the conversations and sharing Will slowly realizes that he's not alone, he has the chance to be happy if he has the courage to face down his own demon and to find his own joy (as he chased after his girlfriend at the end of the movie). What We all need is to do is to find a path and have the the courage to follow through. Most of the times we don't know if what we've chosen is the correct path, but as long as we tried, Joy and love will always be there to carpet the road of pain and loss. That is what life is all about.***what is failure, what is success*** In this movie, there is an interesting contrast between the field metal winner and the supposedly lowly psychologist who lives and works in a small apartment. This movie offered a chance for one to think about what is true success? Is it how much money you make? The working environment? Pension? bonus? or is it as the producer of this movie believed, that there's no true success or failure, it's about what we want and to live is to feel. For those who do not know, Field Metal is a huge deal, it's probably more amazing than the Noble price for math people. This is a really interesting question, I just want to throw it out there. to write what I think would make me run out of space.***one interesting scene*** there is a picture of a man rolling a boat inside a storm, that is my favorite scene in the entire history of movies. The use of one painting and a few words from Will entirely described the sadness of the sullen psychologist and it also offers a very unique and interesting portrait of what it means to feel completely lost and helpless. If you've felt like that before in any point in your life, You would appreciate this scene, at least that's my point of view.Overall, This is a story of trust, courage and love. It showed the most fundamental question that someone in my age (early 20s or even late teens) should always bear in mind. and You should never miss a movie as intelligently crafted as the Good Will Hunting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure why I like "Good Will Hunting" so much. The plot is such a simple story of Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a young man with intelligence way beyond his years, yet all he is choosing to do with his life is cleaning the floors at his job and hanging out with his friends. After getting in trouble with the law, college professor Sean Maquire (Robin Williams, in his Oscar-winning role) is the only person willing to counsel him and turn his life around. Maybe I enjoy this film because I relate so well to it, as I am a college student unsure of what to do with my life. The film has rightly been described as a "slow-burner," and I would agree. It was during my second viewing that the film's greatness suddenly hit me, and I really began to like it. It entertains but also brings tears to my eyes. It has the same inspirational value as Robin Williams' earlier film "Dead Poets Society," for which he also should have won an Academy Award. Although I prefer this film, since it focuses more on inspiring a single person rather than an entire group, both movies are excellent. Maybe it's not an entirely perfect film, but watch this one (more than once if necessary) and be prepared to be moved.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is a great movie. Of all the films I have seen Matt Damon in, this is the best one. His character isn't an action hero like in the Bourne Trilogy, nor is a comical thief in the Ocean's series. He plays a youth in south Boston, driven by his fears of abandonment and a lack of trust in people. However, his unique math abilities are discovered by a college professor (Stellan Skarsgard) who gives him an opportunity to change his original lifestyle from a street punk to someone of value and good qualities.He later sees a therapist (Robin Williams) and finds a girlfriend (Minnie Driver), who become the two benefactors that ultimately makes him into something more than he ever thought. Besides Matt Damon's Oscar nominated performance, I found Robin Williams to be fascinating. Rob won an Oscar for his role and it is rightfully deserved. He made me laugh and at times put me close to tears from the talks he has with Damon about life and change.The additional performances by Minnie driver, Stellan Skarsgard, Ben and Casey Affleck are all wonderfully. The script by Ben and Matt is both entertaining and genius. The score by Danny Elfman was also a nice addition to film. But I give this move a 9 out of 10 because there was so much unneeded foul language. I'm used to hearing bad words, particularly in the likes of an Oliver Stone and a Martin Scorsese film, but not for something along the likes of Good Will Hunting. I guess Matt and Ben felt they needed f-bombs and other sexual dialog to make the film more real. The film would still be real without them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the only thing that's beyond normal in "Good Will Hunting" is the fact that Will Hunting is a mathematical genius. The rest is about as real as a film can get while still being interesting. To be two hours about a young man and his issues and to be so good says a lot about the acting and the writing of this film: that it's very, very good."Hunting" stars Matt Damon as the title role, the enigma that is Will Hunting. Damon is so good at capturing the broad spectrum of his character's emotions. Hunting is written to be a psychological head case who thinks he's figured out what life's about and what people are about and Damon really shows you that. It's a role that would seemingly be played by Leonardo Di Caprio, but we all know what he was busy doing in 1997.Hunting is a janitor at MIT and when he starts solving some of the most difficult of math equations, he gets discovered by Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard). Because Hunting is an orphan and spends most of his time around South Boston getting into trouble with his friends, the plot gets moving when the professor agrees to get Hunting out of jail time with the exceptions that he spend time on math with him and that he go to therapy. After therapy with several top shrinks fails, Hunting is taken to Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) and the two form a unique relationship. The film is in general about the psychological and social journey of Hunting as he begins to understand what life's really all about.Just as good as Damon though are Skarsgard and of course Robin Williams, who is in a role that seems perfect for him, or at least he makes it his own very much so in this film. His character is so honest, but also very poignant and funny.It's a simple concept really. You tell the story of a genius who was orphaned and abused as a child and you have a story of untapped potential and of letting go of the past to embrace the future. Damon and Affleck, who are responsible for the film's intelligent screenplay simply tell this in a really complex way, showing it through the relationship between Will and Sean, Sean and Professor Lambeau, and even Will and his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck). There's a very wide spectrum and experience there. Sometimes the dialogue does seem a bit too elitist and literary, but most of the time it's natural and just meaningful. Gus Van Sant adds some touches of his own, but this is mostly about the story and the characters, so he succeeds at his job of letting it be about them."Good Will Hunting" might now blow you out of the water, but it's touching because it's so human and because the characters could be any of us. Will is the extreme (lonely poor orphan math genius), but we all identify with extremes better in some way, and that's what makes this film successful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Hunting is a troubled kid who happens to be a super-genius. The storyline is simple and easy to follow. The acting and character building of Will is excellent. The film looks very natural and I see no use of exaggerated special effects, which is unusual in today's day and age. The writers and directors really put an effort in attempting to tell a story. Unfortunately there are a couple things that bothered me.First problem I have is with the language. I think this movie would still have gotten their message across if they toned down their use of the F-word. I don't have a problem with it being used sparingly and I can understand it fits a character like Will, but when you have a therapist/professor constantly using it, that's really going overboard. Unfortunately, that's the one thing I remember the most about GWH.Second, the movie is boring and fairly predictable. They do develop characters fairly well, but the movie moves along very slowly. And worse, you could see the ending from a mile away. There is little suspense throughout. How Will goes from a stubborn, hopeless kid to one that's willing to change his life around is sort of lame. He stumbles upon two of his mentors bickering, shows remorse, gets a tongue lashing from one of his mentors (Maguire), gives in, and all of a sudden he's a changed man. My rating: 6.5 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS COMMENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSi was surprised when i knew that it was Matt Damon and Ben Afflick who wrote this deep movie especially when discovering that Matt was just 27 and Ben 25 at that time. how were they able to dissect the human psyche in this brilliant, subtle way at such an age? Will Hunting is a psychologically disturbed guy who has been severely abused during his childhood and thus decides to take a defensive, aggressive approach towards every body outside the small circle of his closest friends. Will is a real genius in science yet his sense of loneliness, fear and emotional deprivation doesn't allow him to make use of this heavenly gift. he repels people out fear of going through more sufferings, of discovering that they are not up to his expectations, of being stabbed or deserted by somebody he becomes attached to. Will translates his anger into a series of hostile acts which reflect an unconscious desire of revenge against those who tortured him as a kid.yet things seem to take a different course when professor Gerald Lambeau discovers Will's brilliance and decides to put him on the road of fame and success, an attempt the boy strongly resists because he doesn't have the will, stability, and strength that help him choose the route he wants to follow.through psychological therapy sessions which Gerald arranges for Will, (Sean) the shrink succeeds in uncovering Will's old, untreated wounds giving him the courage to derive his judgments out of real experience noting that "nobody is perfect". Sean gained Will's confidence through open-heart talks away from the traditional patient-doctor relation. i felt some similarity between both characters, i don't know why. may be because both of them suffered in childhood or because Sean was satisfied with doing what he wanted to do, regardless of what others think of him, and tries to help Will reach the same satisfaction. may be Sean is not as famous as Gerald but he is in peace with himself.i liked the part when Will asks Sean "didn't u think of remarrying ?" "My wife is dead," Sean keeps repeating- it is an emphasis of that idea of a "soulmate".i liked Ben Afflick's part as Will's true friend. he urges him to go and pursue his career though they may never meet again. Afflick feels that Will he is a different guy,he has got a talent that should not be wasted in trivialities. in brief,he is a true friend.the acting in this movie was superb Damon, Williams were the most shining stars yet the whole cast was great. two scenes i liked most: firstly,when Sean takes Will to sit by a lake and starts talking to him about the importance of going through experience. secondly. the climax scene when Will bursts into tears in Seans arms, it a moment of catharsis and relief.the movie is a search for one's true self and a quest for man's ability to overcome his past sufferings and look forward for a new tomorrow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unless you wanna talk about you, who you are! Then I'm fascinated... I'm in! But you don't wanna do that do you? You are terrified what you might see...Daemon is a genius, Williams is the man who tries to tell him that. We see a boy become a man, twice actually. The film is about friendship, love, passion, following your dreams. It is soft yes, it is American indeed, but no film have ever done it like that to me. This film is real, the acting is marvelous, I believe in it, I want to believe that Will is alive, that Sean is a shrink, and that Skylar is devastated in love with this weird man/boy who does not know who he is.I love this film, nothing more to say :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than you might think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started watching this movie, almost being certain that it would be one of those stupid pretentious Hollywood craps, talking about things neither the director nor the scenarist know a single thing about. Surprisingly enough, though, it turned out to be a very good thing.Some of the main characters are very real; the boy's gang and the girl are perfect, and the actors play very good, too. Well, actually I've seen same the kind of people, the same kind of feelings, and it was actually astonishing to see them in a movie; not a Kieslowski movie, but a Hollywood's!!!Sure the movie had it own deficiencies, like it was still a bit of a clich from time to time, and the math stuff they were talking about, though not obviously stupid, didn't make sense, which is of course understandable. And yes, the movie has a f*ing bad language. Very natural, just the way it is in real; no more, no less.You know, I'd specially like a book or a movie when there's at least one character there I would like. I liked Will very much! I felt proud of him, when he was talking about the cleaning job being an honourable job, or when he was talking to that guy from NSA. Skylar was also lovely. And Will's "brothers". I think I'd like to be friend with these guys!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not that great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie because I lived my whole life in Boston, not Southie but a different neighborhood. I enjoyed seeing the scenery that I am familiar with. Look, there is no way anyone who is a genius will work as a janitor. There are people who are smart or have potential who are also very lazy. But even the most brilliant people can't read books that fast or memorize everything. Remember the bar scene where he embarrasses that Harvard kid? The guy didn't look or act like a Harvard kid. He looked more like an MIT student, a science geek. Many Ivy Leaguers are liberal and would be friendly to a poor bum. In real life, Harvard students protested so the low-wage workers at their school can get better pay. Then Matt Damon's character knows every quote from a book in a battle of intelligence with the guy. Give me a break! It's possible that he would be smarter in many ways, but not with deep subjects. It's only a movie though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mind-blowingly bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tried to watch this on cable, but I kept getting annoyed and finally disgusted and turned it off. What a piece of tripe this is. I have no idea what the folks who rated it highly were smoking, but it is surely one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.The concept is insultingly bad. A kid working as a janitor solves a highly sophisticated math problem? And not just any old college, no. It has to be M.I.T. Yep, I'm sure that happens every so often. From this brilliant premise the movie goes rapidly downhill. Violence, ubiquitous cursing, infatuation with cigarette smoking, social ineptness - ah, the life of the troubled-yet-brilliant youth. How many movies like this have been made? I found the acting to be smarmy. Cocky and irrelevant, just like the characters, the plot, the writing - the whole movie. It keeps trying to put on the Hollywood-haughty airs and tries to pass itself off as something special. In fact, there's no point at all. You don't care about the kid; he's just either too sharp or too weak, and he can slip between either of them. With all these fake antics you finally just give up even caring the slightest bit. Maybe these actors are talented to some extent, but that is all wasted.It's one I'm glad I didn't waste my money seeing in the theaters. Don't believe the hype. It is one to avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brainless romance of brilliance-by-numbers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The intellectual endeavour that is pure mathematics gets mopped-up, in this film, about as mechanically as the floors our janitor-hero swabs in the College where he works: He idly solves a conundrum left by a professor in order to test the ability of his undergraduate class to their limits.Our hero can't take anything seriously, though, - least of all an ability that should command any number of excellent, albeit not necessarily academic, occupations - because of an abused childhood. He seems an unlikely combination of colossal arrogance and extremely low self-esteem. This does at least lead to a glorious put-down of some dim rich kid who is nerdily annoying a girl. This is easily the best scene in the movie. The pay-off, when he exhibits the trophy of her 'phone number to the bested contender, saying, 'How d'ye like them apples?' sets up a likeable, if difficult, underdog whom we really want to get to understand.Unfortunately, this was the only good scene. The intriguing personality of a lad with enormous ability, but a wayward character born of social deprivation, and his anticipated moral struggle to control his mental endowments, is never developed. To put it another way, his character wasnever properly conceived and identified in the first place, and so can never be shown developing out of the contradictions of his creator's original confusion.Part of the problem is that the film half-wants to be another florid paean to the Romance of Learning, along the lines of 'Dead Poet Society'. The presence of Robin Williams - thinly-disguised under a pair of cartoon-shoulders that could only have come out of Popeye's spinach-tin - keeps reminding us of the inspiring teacher he was in that much more reflective (if imperfect) work. But the teacher in 'GWH' is a bland cipher. We shall see that this hopelessly scuppers the film.In 'GWH' the acquisition of knowledge is presented consistently as being no more than a superior party-trick, the accidental product of a photographic memory. Or even as some virile clash of champions. We see this most absurdly in such scenes as that of the dismissal of the 'great mathematician', after he has been effortlessly bested in the solving of an even bigger and nastier mathematical conundrum, by our young turk: This obviously shattered individual reels off to recover from the mental devastation of being so utterly routed. Presumably he will end his days like some punch-drunk boxer, doing menial tasks, such as mopping the floor, perhaps, - now totally unfitted to draw his inflated salary as a star academic! Or this absurd shoot-out of ten-gallon brains might put us in mind of the baddy in some Wild West circus turn, humbled by the white-hatted radiance of the heroic cypher! There is certainly no inkling, here, of the collegiate pursuit of knowledge. There is no dawning engagement with the wider, grown-up world. There are no shadings. There is no reflection. There is not a particle of reality.This is mere intellectual philistinism and immaturity. As bildungsromane, this film is the equivalent of the 'Rocky' fight stories. The character's development is told purely in all-American terms of adolescent virility - he is, and remains, a 'regular guy' who is true to the common experience of an intended audience of equally immature peers. His actions are authentically animal, at least, while, on the other hand, his thoughts are nothing more than pure automatism, bereft of the intellectual effort that would only pollute the blond beast so beloved of Americans, handicapped as they often seem to be by a profoundly insecure self-image. It is in order to reform, not his thinking - which is completely incidental to this drama - , but his social behaviour, that he is being granted the boon (as here it appears, rather than as the right!) of education. His therapy is political, intended to indoctrinate him into conformity with general social mores. It does nothing to render him a fit candidate for a higher degree.This alarming, if unconscious, exposure of this creepily conformist agenda, that is at the heart of America's bone-headed populism, is perhaps the only factor making this film worth consideration at all. As a source of sociological reflection on our great neighbour, it is quite alarming to observe herein how readily American youth appears to subscribe to its own enfeeblement.What a devil's bargain is offered our Everyman of America: Self-realisation through Education - but only, and expressly, through the Trial of Therapy, that uniquely American tool of totalitarian thought-control. It is as if we are being given a re-make of 'A Clockwork Orange', in which we are unblinkingly asked to applaud the perversion of the unruly but human potential of Alex into the bland, neutered and utterly soulless citizen of a society of the like-mindless. This is what 'GWH' implies, by its deliberate confusion of education with therapy. Where 'Dead Poet' inspires (albeit in a rather 'Reader's Digest' fashion), 'GWH' prescribes. The pervading niceness that comes over our bright bad boy is every bit as creepy as 'Clockwork Orange''s brainwashing scenes - more so, since the picture seems blithely untroubled by this perversion of true, organic character development.Even the more wayward knights of King Arthur's Round Table were expected to actually study discipline, and team-work, and to understand why they should submit to the judgement of their intellectual peers. Even the mad fantasist of Robin Williams' 'Dosser King', in Terry Gilliam's Arthurian subversion of all-American values, demands submission to his testing discipline only in order to restore Jeff Bridges' character, whole, to himself. Nowhere in the juvenile film at issue is the getting of wisdom represented as what it must be, even for the brightest students: 1% inspiration, and 99% perspiration. But the American way - the Hollywood way, at least, - to self-realisation is to overdose on emotionalism, as apparently only pure sensation can lead Americans to the true goal of all human fulfillment. Mathematics is not even a witty McGuffin in such a childish formula. And the sprinkling of other cultural references provides no more than high-toned decoration - an impatient short-hand for the engagement with serious and difficult cultural issues, which are entirely absent from the pretentious, adolescent, Ed Wood-scale of artistic self-delusion on display.Hence the spreading soft-focus of the film, after the first few establishing scenes, and the increasing redundancy of a plot that was never honestly posited on intellectual endeavour at all.So: Just another Hollywood fairy-tale, without any of that haunted, grown-up sense of darkness that makes a film like Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' such a powerful fable of the human soul.A superficial, brainless teen romance of brilliance-by-numbers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stepping on soapbox...Clearly a lot of people think that the use of the F-word in this film was borderline criminal, unrealistic and offensive. I'd just like to set the record straight.1) Having grown up and worked in the Boston suburbs, I've found that the film accurately portrayed the way young men talk with each other, swearing and all. Anyone who doesn't believe this simply hasn't been to Southie or Revere or Lynn or any of the other working class towns in Eastern Mass. You may not like it, but it IS realistic.2) What's to be offended at? They're not swearing AT you. They're not even swearing at each other. They use the words not to offend, but as part of their group palare. It's part of the culture that binds them. They're not even real words as they convey no meaning. They're more like interjections.If you're offended by the use of words, I ask you to examine what exactly you're afraid of.Stepping off soapbox...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How and Why? Well, that's the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for you. Apparently they just thought it was more "original". In my opinion, not at all. There have been several films that have tackled the genre of a kid with a bad childhood turning into a good human. Although As Good As It Gets is similar to this (bad human turning good), the "originality" of the script is far superior. In the end, Good Will Hunting is just an okay film. It's something everyone's seen. Sure, it has a lot of good one-liners, but how good are one-liners if the rest of the film can't keep up with the funny parts in the script? Well, the people were satisfied so I guess that's all that matters. Anyways, my opinion is that Good Will Hunting is just an okay film with not even consistently good performances (with the exception of Robin Williams).Won two Oscars for Best Original Screenplay (1997) and Best Supporting Actor (Robin Williams).**1/2 /5</fullReview>

Nothing was believable in this movie: the love, the pain, the character, or the premise. Ben Affleck's character was the only redeeming quality in the movie.

		<shortDescription>still a great film ..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is interesting to watch "Good Will Hunting" again, nearly three years after its release. It remains as fresh on second or third or subsequent viewings as on its first.What stands out is not the plot, which is straightforward and really only a device to provide a backdrop to explore the central characters, but brilliance of Affleck and Damon's dialogue.The combination of wit, naturalness and directness combine to engage the viewer.Even more amazing is that the film is driven by a series of dialogue sequences and each sequence builds on it predecessor pushing the plot forward.Rarely has a film been so dialogue driven and yet not been "talky". This is due entirely to Matt and Ben's extraordinary way with dialogue and Gus Van Sant's simple and very effective direction which places no barriers between the characters and the viewer.I am sure that this, not the plotting, is what impressed the Oscar voters."Good Will Hunting" remains one of the finest American films of the decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile Film (** Spoilers **)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The statement, "Better in execution than design," appropriately encapsulates "Good Will Hunting." Despite an apparent brilliance and creativity in discrete scenes and sequences, examined generally and on a macro level, the film's plot and directional structure lack severely. However, the characterizations, dialogue, and overall mise-en-scene project a unique tendency similarly absent in both mathematics films (recall "Stand and Deliver" as a blas manifestation of mathematical concepts to an audience) and "Boy Wonder" pictures (movies with a genius-laden protagonist; most are, much like mathematics films, merely adequate and not passionate about the qualities of their main characters).The most effective parts of "Good Will Hunting" show the conflict between two sets of parallel individuals: Will and Chuckie, and Professors Lambeau and Maguire. The intense and latent rivalry between the two academics describes a potential future for the two twenty-year-olds. Maguire consistently, at least on a superficial basis, searches for the default respect the MIT mathematician receives. Will, although reticent and clearly an outcast, seeks a similar form of respect, although not for his academic qualities, but for his social abilities. Throughout "Good Will Hunting," both pairs of spotlighted characters, after a series of enlightening "adventures," become comfortable with themselves. Despite this banal-sounding narrative flow, the execution is mostly interesting and often unpredictable. Similar to "Jackie Brown," "Clerks," and "Pulp Fiction," lines in "Good Will Hunting" sound realistic, albeit on a near-poetic and superlative level. Anecdotal portions of the dialogue are given a relaxed temporal frame with which to develop. (A standout instance is Skylar's last-wish tale.) Although the strong propensity toward vulgarities and obscenities is evident, it almost is rendered justifiable; lines are well constructed to "ease the fit" of the negative language that in many other films is overtly unnecessary and inappropriate. The lyrical music, which relies on short minor-key short melodies rather than grand designations (a John Williams or James Horner variant), is appropriate for the film and functions effectively as a "personal score" for Will Hunting. Danny Elfman, who composed "Bettlejuice," "Men in Black," and "Batman," has rarely shown restraint in his music. The reticent notes support the characterizations rather than defining them (as his other works have often accomplished).Other than the mostly mediocre diagesis, the film's largest fault is the treatment of its logic in its supposed-main topic: mathematics. Ignoring the errors in the content (a Fourier series, the professor claimed, was to be the first problem on the hallway chalkboard. Instead, simple undergraduate Linear Algebra appears. Of course, this lapse is not noticed by most of the audience, and it does not alter the piece in any respect), more serious errors surface: If Will was another Ramajidan, as Lambeau claims, why was he not given any queries on anything more than an undergraduate level? How about assigning Hunting unsolved problems, like the Goldbach Conjecture or the Reimann Hypothesis? Certainly such mathematical questions should be enough to challenge a truly gifted mathematician.</fullReview>

Truly written from the heart, GHW is one of the best movies ever written and unquestionably the best date/romance movie ever! The entire cast is phenomenal, there is nothing negative to be said about this movie. Movies like this are few and far between (this and L.A. Confidential were my picks for 1998' Best Pic.....too bad Titanic was in the same year)This is a movie that shows you don't need top-name stars and a million special effects to make a great movie that also packs an emotional wallop. Yeah, the ending is a little weak, but the rest of the movie makes up for it. If you haven't seen this movie yet, go out and rent it, I guarantee you will love it. Oh, by the way, Matt Damon's performance was also 10 times better than Jack Nicholson's....'cmon, anyone can play someone with OCD but not everyone can play someone from Southie and is a genius. But Matt Damon really is from Southie and he and Ben Affleck really are geniuses.....GWH proves it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Good Will Hunting" was not a bad movie at all, but I don't believe it deserved the accolades that it got. While I found that the acting was quite good, I didn't think the story was terribly engaging.Bottom line -- Matt Damon's character did not gain my sympathy, as he did with most people who have seen this film. Essentially, we are dealing with a very smart kid who is also an obnoxious, unkind person. I don't care if you have a bad job or come from a broken home. In my book, those are not excuses to be a jerk. I personally know people who have had much tougher lives than Will Hunting, and they still treat their fellow man with the utmost warmth and kindness. So with the main character not winning me over, I found I really had nowhere to go with this film, since it is almost entirely focused on Damon's character and his struggles. I didn't feel myself rooting for him, which was a huge impediment to me getting anything out of this movie.Again, "Good Will Hunting" is hardly a bad movie. I am certainly not saying that. However, I don't understand why people consider it to be so great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I try to read other user comments before adding my two-cents worth. If others have said what I would say...why waste your time and mine? I have a very small video library. You see, to be in my video library, the film has to be SO good it will stand repeated viewing. This film is IN my video library. The script is very nearly perfect. The message is true, and honestly told. The acting...PARTICULARLY Matt Damon, Minnie Driver and, of course, Robin Williams...is superb. Let me admit, I am a Robin Williams fan...almost against my own nature. He irritates me at times, and frustrates me other times..and I'll be the first to say he's turned in some horrifically over-done performances. Then, you see him in something like "Awakenings"...and you see him in something like THIS movie..and you realize that Williams has the potential of being one of the BEST! Damon turns in a wonderful performance. Indeed, if it were not for the strength of his performance, Williams would probably still overwhelm the film. As it is, there is a "checks and balances" thing that happens between them that is simply a joy to behold. Minnie Driver, whom I adored when she was X pounds heavier in "Circle of Friends," startled me. I hadn't seen her since she lost all the weight. Minnie is one of those faces that...let's be honest...can't be called "fashion model beautiful" ...yet she is (to me) a kind of real-world sexy. And her acting can be marvelous, and IS, in this film. Her heartbreak is so real in one scene, I almost can't stand to watch that scene. I have to leave the room and fiddle with a soft-drink or something. I want soo badly to sweep her in my arms and comfort her...now THAT's acting! Ben Affleck is a perfect foil to Damon's character...and this very believable story (to me) is wound out in a compelling manner that literally leaves me drained at the end. This is simply a movie with lots of pluses and almost no flaws. Given the story, its length is right...there are a few scenes that could have been tightened in my opinion (mainly between the math professor and Williams character)...but this is ensemble acting par excellence. Please try to give this one an honest look. IT might ALSO end up on your video shelf!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is the film that was unlucky to have been made in the same year as Titanic. Sadly while Titanic left with 13, it left Good Will Hunting with only 2, and unfairly so. For while no one denies that Titanic was impressive enough, Good Will Hunting should have left with the credit it deserved. This combination of Gus Van Sant's direction and the divine writing of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck was one of the best films that I have ever seen. You are greeted with Will Hunting, a sadly disturbed guy who has the most amazing mind, yet can not make himself take advantage of this gift because he is afraid of the consequences. The film looks stunning, with excellent use of camera angles, while the relationships between the various characters develop with so much sincerity that you can really empathise with them. The stars of the piece are not Damon and Affleck however, but Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsgard, as the shrink who is able to get into the head of brilliant young Hunting and the genius maths professor who discovers Hunting and then spends the rest of the film wishing that he hadn't. The casting of Robin Williams in the serious role of Sean Maguire is excellent; after all Williams often performs his best work when allowed to take off the comic mask that he is so well known for. There is little I can find to criticise this movie with, sometimes the music fails to live up to what it could, but that is just nit-picking! When I saw this, I had already seen Titanic and after, I went to see Titanic again. It was then that I realised that the main element of the film that was any good was the actual sinking of the ship, and that the other two and a half hours were merely there to keep you going to build you up to the ship sinking. If you are looking for a movie to show the development of a relationship between two people, watch Good Will Hunting. Good Will Hunting gives you the hope that things can work out in the end. Also if you have the option, I urge you to listen to the audio commentary that you can get on the DVD, and see how things developed during the making of this utterly superb film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is a brilliant movie! The screenplay by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck was incredible! Matt Damon and Robin Williams both delivered amazing performances! I loved the movie; it is one of my favorites! You will stayed glued to the screen! Good Will Hunting is basically about a genius who was raised in Boston living the life of a "slacker". After getting into to trouble with the law, he agrees to meet with a mathematician and a therapist every week, instead of going to jail. The relationship he builds with Sean, the therapist (Robin Williams) was very moving and unforgettable. You must see this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting in this movie was amazing. Damon and Williams together especially were great. I had two major problems with this movie though. The character Skylar was not truly needed in the story. Meaning Will did not really need to have a love intrest to make the story better. I also was very turned off by the amount of cursing. That amount was not needed at all. Overall an excellent movie, for newcomers</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good film. You can clearly see that it is an inspired piece of work. It doesn't look like it in the beginning but it mostly holds your attention. The acting (esp. R. Williams and M. Damon) is strong. The script is witty and it avoids all the stereotypes. What I certainly enjoyed in it, was the picture of the city of Boston: the university but also the outskirts of town. The city plays an important part in this film. It surprises me that 2 protagonists wrote the script of this film. I hope they'll follow this path. So, we'll enjoy more quality American main-stream films. The film makes you think about what it means to grow up in a certain social class and how you watch your intellectual capacities. It is an optimistic film which makes you smile (and cry maybe). And it isn't difficult to swallow. But at the same time, you don't get an easy message. As I said, this film isn't stereotypical. And, although it has an "happy ending", you never think this is just your next corny American Hollywood film. A surprisingly good film !!Dries Van Dongen, Belgium</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a year of the ultimate high budget film, Titanic, Good Will Hunting was at the very least a breath of fresh air. With it's budget a miniscule fraction of the Oscar winning best picture, Gus Van Sant and the writers, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, produced a picture with much more substance and emotion than any other movie that year. Critics have questioned the reality of this film. Is it so hard to believe that there is a kid genius from the slums of South Boston? As far as I'm concerned, the critics must be appalled at the idea that someone without a Harvard education could be so successful and so intelligent. Get over this fact, and get over this part of the movie. In all likelihood, the fact that he is a genius isn't the most important element in the film.This film is about one's life education and about one's growth as a person. As it turned out, this film was extremely entertaining, especially with the thick Boston accents, which in my opinion, only made the movie all the more believable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading some of the previous comments made by viewers on this site, I get the impression some people believe a group of 21 year old guys who go to bars and drink and fight is not realistic. I would suggest they try spending a night in bar and come back to reality. Even beyond realism, this is just a flat-out great movie.Robin Williams, normally not the best actor in the world, does an outstanding job with this role. He was at the same time funny and insightful and deserved the Academy Award. Damon was convincing as a "lazy genius" and this was definitely his best role so far. The script was excellent, and Van Sant got every bit of emotion possible out of his cast. It is so rare to see a dramatic movie like this that combines humor and drama so effectively. Even if, like me, you are not interested in run-of-the-mill drama-tearjerker type movies, I highly recommend this one, because it is fantastic. The only dim spot in the movie is Minnie Driver's character. I've never really liked her, and I found her character to be more than slighlty annoying. Despite this one flaw, Good Will Hunting is one of the top movies of '97, and other than L.A. Confidential, maybe THE top movie if the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Sweepingly Smart' Good Will Hunting: rated R, 2 hours and 5 minutesMatt Damon is the troubled boy-genius, Will Hunting. Will was an orphan and abused child who hasn't the slightest idea what to do with his incredible mind. He is janitor at one of the most prestigious school's in the nation, MIT, and anonymously solves an incomprehensibly difficult math problem.While Will is put into jail for the beating of a group of teens, he is discovered at his work as the man who could explain the formula that no MIT student could fathom. The professor (Stellan Skarsgard) bails out Will under the condition that Will seek professional therapy, and promise to meet everyday to study mathematical equations. By the end of the movie, Will is molded into a decent human being, no longer lost in life; this is all owed to the ideal therapist, Robin Williams. Sean helps Will cope with reality in the present day, as well as the hardships he has faced in the past. With his wife dead, Sean finds himself able to relate to the similar problems of Will. Sean turns out to be more of a valuable friend than therapist.Will finds that he doesn't understand himself, let alone others. It is only until he openly expresses his feelings that Will is able to find his place in life.Good Will Hunting is a combination between drama and comedy. It is realistic in displaying the problems Will faces, but somewhat cheesy in proving Will's intelligence. Robin Williams brings out the sentimental side of Will, with some parts of this also appearing corny. Though Will can certainly be a tearjerker at times, the movie blends in many comical scenes, allowing the audience a little fun.The greatest part of Good Will Hunting is its sincere acting by Matt Damon, Robin Williams, and actual college friend of Damon, Ben Affleck, who plays Will's best friend in the movie. They all seem to play their roles beautifully and effectively, which is what makes the movie so good.With its superb acting and memorable lines, Good Will Hunting, directed by Gus Van Sant, also starring Minnie Driver, is worthy of an A-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astounding, it is the realism that moves us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting was one of the most moving movies I've ever seen, dealing with themes of hope, potential and abuse it gave such a real-life portrait that almost everything in the film was something you could easily relate to and felt very familiar. The choice of locations and backdrops were very appropriately atmospheric, as the film was shot in pubs, bars and coffee bars. The film was original and worked on a deeper level throughout, it was able to drop all the usual clichd characters and scenarios that populate so many of the mass bulk of formulaic films that account for the vast majority of Hollywood's output. This never strayed far from scenarios real ,and a storyline that could be related to, I first believed and then upon realisation wanted to believe that it was a true story, because the degree of observational accuracy on real-life and the familiar feel of real-life that is believable and credible ,the film had been quite remarkable. It is ironic that many people are not convinced that Matt Damon's character could be a genius and yet could have come from such circumstances of abuse and now be living such a 9-5 philistine lifestyle of laying bricks and nights on the town, as the film manages to persuade us that it is more than just the usual triumph over adversity case. It is a film about abuse ,and in it we are shown that the loss in normal family values and the resulting towing of society's line that that would probably normally cause ,brings up strongly other aspects of a person's character, and this might explain the heightened creativity or ability as depicted by Will Hunting. The story is very psychologically real and is refreshingly not so simplistic as most other popular films. It is so re-assuring to know that the films of this type can be made and can be profitable and that it doesn't always have to be the lowest common denominator that we so feared having a monopoly on the majority of films. He is a maths genius but he doesn't know it, he naively just gets on with it, just like Mozart with the box of wood known as a piano. But when he is discovered by a maths professor ,he must be brought out of himself, and his cocky, confident front that hides a deeply insecure individual whose fundamentals have been rocked by abuse. After being exposed to and brushing off a number of conservative and conformist psychologists he is brought under the wing of a very philosophical psychologist who he has some common ground with. Some of their procrastinations and profundities are alone worth the two hours. For a deeper, more philosophical film that will make you truly think and feel in this realistic view of human nature, there is Good Will Hunting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Falling flat is what this movie does, ever since the pretentious beginning: the attempt to capitalize on a presumed genius from the slums falls short of the target simply because while saying f*** every two words is true to life for more people than we want to know, a universal 'genius' as the one portrayed by Damon is nowhere to be seen, or conceived. The kind of 'knowledge' displayed by Damon is mostly fruit of dumb and trite photographic memory, and does not have the least to do with 'intelligence': as for the mathematical part it's pure fantasy, because Ramanujan may well have lived and impressed 100 years ago (mind me, he still impresses now), but would have a much harder time if he lived today. Speaking as a mathematician, it is shocking to see how carefully the movie tries to depict low life, and how easily it falls into the most stereotypical misconceptions about 'higher learning'. Overindulgence in realistic reproduction of a southie's foul language and scars, flanked by stale and flat portrayal of the MIT mathematics department may say it all: the script authors obviously share more with f*** than with f(x).</fullReview>

It's almost even a coming of age sort of film. The whole friendship between Matt and Ben really paid off. You could tell in the movie that they were friends even off screen. Great acting by both of them and not to forget Robin Williams who does his best acting job yet. Even Will and Chuckie's friends were good actors. Ben's brother Casey did a great job and that other guy, I don't know his name, but he was in "Dazed and Confused", did a great job also.

		<fullReview>GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very good movie. The writing, credited to Mssrs. Afleck and Damon, is among the best I can remember in a recent American film. Mr Afleck appears to have benefited from the script of CHASING AMY or vice-versa. Robin Williams' role as the burned out shrink ties everything together to make this a memorable story. I wish he would do more of this type of material and less clowning.However, the credible story, realistic characters, and excellent script beautifully played by the cast are restrained by a glossy presentation. Anyone familiar with the coastal Northeast (story takes place in Boston) knows overcast skies, wind, rain. The relentless sunshine bathes the story in a California like light but with gritty old Boston as the backdrop. Doesn't work.Nitpicking? Probably, but this film is very close to being as good as movies get and every little misstep becomes magnified as a result.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I hear everyone talking about this great movie by two young up and coming actors looking for work and how awesome this movie is. And so, I go and I see Good Will Hunting. Now I know why Matt Damon was struggling to find work. I bought the screenplay and read it before I ever saw the movie and the screenplay itself is great. I've read it many times since and each time, I still love it. However, for some reason, the executives at Miramax failed to see that letting Damon and also Minnie Driver have roles in this movie would be a mistake. Affleck is a good actor, although his part sucks in this movie but Damon went and wrote a whole story about his character and then failed to deliver. There were a few positives. The friendship between Affleck and Damon does spill over into the movie and it does leave an impression. Robin Williams is great. I mean, the man can do anything. Comedy, drama, anything. But the rest of the cast is pretty much mediocre except for Ben Affleck who also was good in Chasing Amy. In all, this movie was OK but nowhere near as good as the hype made it out to be. The screenplay is definitely worth buying but the acting in the movie itself pretty much sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Characterization, needs a little more.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps many people have placed too much emphasis on this movie. I am not saying this in a derogatory way. The characterization in this movie is brilliant. Matt Damon and Robin Williams give outstanding performances, although they do become a little predictable by the time that the movie is over. Perhaps this movie is just that: a characterization. The plot allows us to look at a man that is intelligent; far more intelligent than the average MIT student (as supposedly proved in the theorem-solving part of the movie). Like an action movie star, the main character allows us to look at someone that is unlike us. This goes for the character that Williams plays. We look at a psychologist with a type of awe: perhaps they see an insight into the human psyche that no one can (supposedly). The problem is that: the movie is full of characterization. Even though there are a few people that Damon plays running around the streets, we look into his life, and are forced to like him. Going out on a limb, I am saying that this movie is like a Steinbeck book: the characterization is superb, but the other elements are lacking. Don't let this movie escape you though, it is worth seeing the characterization alone. By the time the movie is over, you will feel that you know the people intimately. That is the reason that I give this movie a 6.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie not expecting it to live up to hype. I had not heard one person say a bad word about this film and they were absolutely right. Damon's character is complex and involving, sometimes even quite humorous. The on screen chemistry between him and Affleck is a joy to watch, Affleck being far less intelligent than Damon's character yet having more common sense and seeing that Will Hunting was just wasting himself is an interesting angle.In my opinion, Robin Williams is one of the most under-rated serious drama actors, though gaining plaudits for his comedy work this is as good as his excellent role in 'Dead Poet's Society' and the dialogue between him and Damon is spectacular. It kept me interested throughout the film and brought sympathy to an arrogant character. The only element to keep this film from perfection was that Will Hunting's attitude change was perhaps too sudden, other than that a fine movie that I'd recommend to anyone who likes a good storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Titanic who???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I absolutely loved it. I was fascinated by every single aspect of it. Sure, the plot wasn't the most realistic, but who cares? Movies are entertainment, and that's all. The profanity was not that excessive if you spend any time at all with many lower to middle-class people around the age of the characters. In fact, it was downright realistic. As for the acting, it was wonderful watching Damon portray this character who has to struggle with what he thinks he wants, what he is told he should want, and what he finally realizes he really wants. No, I don't think it was the best performance of the year, but it was definitely one of the top five and worthy of a Best Actor nomination. The chemistry between him and Minnie Driver was electric, particularly during their first date and again in the scene in her apartment before he leaves. Robin Williams, in my opinion, delivers his best performance. Sure, it's the typical Williams-drama character from Dead Poets Society and the like, but this character was better with the mental games and interactions with Will. The best part of this movie was watching the relationship develop between Will and Sean. This wasn't an epic movie, nothing too profound, but it was a small movie about love, relationships, and finding yourself, and in this capacity I think it was wonderful. 9.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starting slow but interesting, I found the story utterly absorbing and emotionally moving (which is, unfortunately, quite rare with me). For me it was one of those movies that you check your watch and pray it's not over yet -- it's not a story you watch to bring you from Point A to Point B -- it's the going that's good. It's a well-written, well-acted story with deep characters that you care about.Even the least-developed main relationship, Will and Skylar's, was profound. The torment that Will brought her in the end merely reflects his own, and you can feel that.I'd love to see a sequal (Better Will Hunting?) to see what they do with Will/Skylar. If it were true to life, it'd have her telling him to shove-off, but that'd make for a pretty short movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the most disappointing films in a long time. After all the hype and people going on about this film I finally watched it and left the theatre convinced those other people were talking about another film. The script was extremely clichd, characters so unreal and situations out of a bad after school special. I enjoyed Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's other roles (notably Chasing Amy &amp; Rainmaker) but this was terrible. There were simply too many unanswered questions and ridiculous events. Next time Hollywood wants to feed us this crap, they should take into account that we are all not so moronic to eat it up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came in to this movie not expecting much, but what I got was a powerful movie that taught me that talent should never be wasted. Will Hunting is a man gifted with phenomenal intelligence. He lives alone in Boston and spends his days hanging out with his friends, drinking beer, and beating up old bullies. He supports himself with part time jobs like janitor work. When a college professor discovers that Will Hunting is a genius like no other, he decides to exploit him by offering him top rate jobs that would give him access to great prestige. Will Hunting's therapist, played outstandingly by Robin Williams, want's Will to do what he wants and not be forced to go out into the world and change his entire lifestyle. The movie follows Will Hunting as he matures from a scared defensive kid, to a man able to discover what path to take in his life. Great movie. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent performances from most of the cast, realistic dialogue, solid direction(From Gus Van Sant who has worked on "My Own Private Idaho" and "Drugstore Cowboy"), and some powerful moments make this 1997 Oscar winner(for Screenplay) watchable. The screenplay, for my mind was the problem. It's a good debut, but it's too familiar(eg. "Educating Rita" and the novel "Maestro" By Peter Goldsworthy"). It's your typical teacher-student film. My brother would like it to be known that I was wrong about the ending, but I wasn't totally wrong, Damon and Ben Affleck are rock solid, and Robin Williams richly deserved his Oscar for another nicely subdued performance(it's a pity he's always playing doctor types). Stellan Skarsgaard and particularly Minnie Driver(sporting her real english accent, which sounds more superficial than her irish or american) are irritating, however. Driver gets a huge laugh though in one scene. Ben and his brother Casey Affleck also have funny moments, as does Matt Damon(a bit egotistical to put himself in the lead, though). Nice, but we've seen it all before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is not about twist endings, drawn-out action scenes, or even a sappy romance. It has been knocked for being too predictable and trying to hard to pull the heart strings of its audience. . .Both are true.Still, the main reason this may be one of the best movies of the 90's is the deep, moving characters that Gus Van Sant has created. The characters YOU know.Each and every character is someone I know or can relate too. The genius who isn't living up to his potential. The man who has based everything he is on the woman he loved. The people who see the magic in someone, and can't stand to let it go to waste. Even the professor's assistant, the wonder kid whose been knocked of the top rung by a new wonder kid, I can relate to.Let it be known that the movie is going to turn out *exactly* the way you want it to. And let it be known that you'll probably have a tear in your eye before the credits roll. . .I wouldn't have it any other way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that truly has something to talk about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before i saw "Good Will Hunting' in the cinema i was hearing about a new talent called Matt Damon who starred and wrote one of the best pictures of 1997. But it was until i saw it that i aggred with all this comments. Good Will Hunting has one of the most original screenplays of the last decade and it's not surprising the fact that its fans are mostly young people. It deals with a very serious matter and manages to examine its every aspect. It's a fresh and original movie, the kind of those we want to see more in the cinemas. Matt Damon is of course the core and the soul of this picture. He co-wrote the screenplay with Ben Affleck and managed to persuade the 'big-bosses" to make it a great movie. Demon is excellent in the lead and truly deserved the Oscar as his portrayal of Will was utterly realistic.Robin Williams is equally impressive in the role of the doctor and proves that he can be better in drama than in comedy. But the true revelation of the picture is the great Minnie Driver. She too gives a realistic and heart-warming performance that allows her to be regarded as the most talented actresses today.(Her performances in "Grosse Point Blank" and especially in "The Circle of Friends" also prove that) Good Will Hunting is along with "The Wings of the Dove" undoubtedly the best picture of 1997.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To those who say that removing the language wouldn't have made it any less real:bullsh....wait, sorry. Seriously, though, the language in this movie is as close to 100% accurate as any movie I've seen in a while. I'll admit that I grew up in a white-collar household, but I have had many friends over the years from blue-collar backgrounds. Both groups swear a lot. I mean a LOT. Young people, when among themselves and with people who won't be offended, tend to relax their speech. Now, is this perhaps an indictment of those young people? Depends on who you ask. But don't attack a film for a fairly realistic account of dialogue between South Boston twenty-somethings. The fault I would find on the dialogue is the snappiness of delivery, but that's the movies. Cleaning up rough dialogue just wouldn't ring as true in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When first watching "GWH" at a theater in Chicago I walked out of it after an hour. The dialogue was so hard to understand being used to subtitles in Sweden. I couldn't hear or understand half of what was said on the screen and since this is a dialogue driven movie it simply made the whole experience unbearable. Arriving back to Sweden I thought I'd give it another chance (with subtitles this time mind you) and surprisingly I loved it. The premise might be stereotype and cliche, but tell me what movie that isn't. It's HOW the story is told that ultimately counts. "Good Will Hunting" is basically a "coming of age" movie, but with such well written dialogue and characters that one truly believes in them. The pace is very slow and that fact does the movie good actually. We're not watching a John Hughes movie here.I can't really understand why so many people who have submitted their opinions on "GWH" finds the language so foul and ugly. There isn't more "F***" than in any other drama, action or war movie.The foul language isn't in the movie for show, it's there to flesh out the characters. The fact is that people often use the F-word a lot in real life. Why not in movies then?All and all, Good Will Hunting manages to be both dramatic and funny with some lovable characters and great performances from Skarsg?rd, Williams, Damon , Drive and Affleck. This is a movie that could be mention in the same sentence as "Dead Poet's Society" and not only because Robin Williams is in it.</fullReview>

Overall the language used is in keeping with the location and the setting in both the upper (Harvard) and lower (South Boston) parts of the city.I am really amazed about the number of complaints about the use of colourful language, this sort of dialogue is necessary to portray Will and friends realistically, to leave it out would be like taking the soldiers out of Saving Private Ryan or the food out of Babette's Feast.Let's not be too hard on the writers for using a well used plot line, in the end everything is derivative and the story does offer an excellent portrayal of the way success is measured, the loneliness experienced by the intellectually gifted and how knowledge does not necessarily guarantee wisdom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is an enjoyable look at life through the eyes of two screenwriters who seem upset at the lack of recognition for the talent they feel they have. It follows the three act high concept paradigm ( or formula ) to the letter. Act.1 Introduce the Character Act.2 Put the Character through a test Act.3 Watch the character redeem himself. The film is a metaphor for the lives of Affleck and Damon. Two kids that feel they are talented actors / filmmakers who haven't been recognised, dream about 'what if we could prove ourselves to be more talented than those with better credentials.' If we could beat the MIT maths professor without having to study. The irony is that they did prove it, they won an Oscar. This film is basically Top Gun set in academia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just don't see why this movie was such a popular hit, not to mention an Oscar contender for best picture. Granted, the story was original and deserving of some credit, but not exactly the claimed "shot in the arm of originality" the industry needed. It is a joy to watch, filled with many humorous moments. The explicit swearing doesn't take away from the movie; rather, it adds to regional aura the audience is meant to feel from South Bostonites. That joke that Skylar tells about the old couple is the funniest I've heard in a long time. One of the movie's funniest jokes was also the "How about them apples?" line, so it's not as if the movie was one total raunch fest. However, the story was a tad predictable. The way the story jolts us is what is the foundation of its popularity. The characters also are an utter pleasure, but I think Ben Affleck's character Chucky was unnecessary and kind of stupid. It's a shame too, because Ben Affleck is a truly gifted actor -- he showed his true talent in Chasing Amy. Matt Damon was okay, but hardly a Best Actor contender. I think the real underrated talent was Minnie Driver. Her character was intriguing, and made believable by a winning performance. The fact that she lost to a talent-less Kim Basinger at the Academy Awards boggles the mind. Overall, not bad. I'll probably watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a film buff coming from a conservative background, I find myself struggling to evaluate honestly films containing strong language, particularly when it appears in such abundance as in this film. But, bearing in mind that such language is endemic to the principal characters in the film, I found myself thoroughly entranced by Will's character development throughout the film. The script and attendant dialogue carry the viewer along logically, both with respect to Will but also the Robin Williams character. The development of these two fully-realized characters as their interactions cross provides real insight into the complexities of human nature. The supporting roles of the maths professor and the Minnie Driver characters only add to the painful but honest reality of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I found this movie to be a refreshing change from movies we see nowadays. Before seeing it I thought the basic premise was nothing new but Robin Williams might make it an interesting movie. I was delightedly surprised. Matt Damon pulled off a magnificent performance in a not-so-new character type. I found the plot to be a wonderful vehicle for the outstanding dialogue that made the movie so rewatchable for me. The screenplay absolutely deserved the Oscar. Robin Williams had easily one of the best performances of his career (at least as powerful as Dead Poet's Society if not more so). He poured a lot of emotion into a character just as complicated as Damon's. The connection between Williams' character and Damon's was powerful. Minnie Driver delivered a wonderful performance as Damon's love interest. Stellan Skaarsgard, though I don't recall another movie he has been, also played a complicated role as sort of a mental mentor to Damon. But my hat is off to Ben Affleck. This was the first movie I saw him in and his presence on screen was amazing. He is responsible for possibly my favorite scene in the movie, the scene where he tells Will Hunting that he doesn't "owe it to himself, you owe it to me." I believe he took the role as best friend to a new level. He also has a wonderful scene where he has to basically just stand there and let us know what is going on in his mind. I hope to see him around a lot in the future. This movie is wonderfully cast and brought me back again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Damon carries this thing all the way, which is good because after all he plays the title character. I watched "The Rainmaker" just before watching "Good Will Hunting" and I was blown away by the contrast of Damon's characters and the versatility of his acting. First of all his southern drawl and Boston accent are wonderfully authentic. This is important to the viewer who has to believe in the character. Robin Williams would have been more believable if he'd have stuck with his own accent rather than attempting to muddle through one of the worst "Baastan" accents I've heard. It's distracting listening to him go in and out of it. This is the only downer in an otherwise brilliant performance; his best serious role since "Awakenings," which was a far better performance. Far too little attention has been paid to Stellan Skarsgard's performance. He is wonderful in his role as the domineering math professor attempting to take Will under his wing. Skarsgard's dialogue with both Williams and Damon creates some of the more memorable scenes in the movie. Other great performances include Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Casey Affleck. I'd like to include Cole Hauser as Bill in this list, but he barely has three lines in the whole movie. Over all this film is entertaining, funny, and original. It's refreshing.</fullReview>

Matt Damon and Minnie Driver are not especially convincing, and I did not see much chemistry between the two. I hope Matt Damon's performance in Rounders is better.

I have no idea how people can put it down saying it's dumb, no way, the storyline was unique to most others, and it had a bit comedy, loads of drama and cleverness. Robin Williams was so great and deserved that Oscar. I though Minnie Driver was very good also, and I have seen most of her films and she is now one of my favourite actresses. I thought Stellan Skarskgard was very cool, and flowed with his character. I don't care what anyone says, but this is a masterpiece and it should have won.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GWH, is one of the films of the 90's, thats responsible for what you could call 'new dialogue movies', I think. the movie is one of the best I've seen in that 'new' genre. Dialogue is real, natural and powerful. The other great thing about the movie is the camerawork, nice, clean, nothing fancy, the way every movie should be, but only so few movies can afford to be. Its the first movie I rated 10, not because its perfect, but mainly because its as close to perfect as any movie will get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting isn't a formula movie. It's plot has been used before, but it's wholly original. It's a wonderful character study about friendship, potential, love, and most importantly, low self-esteem. Most don't think about the low self esteem part, because Will was a cocky kid. But low self esteem was the whole reason he wouldn't capitalize on his gift. Will is a high school dropout who works as a janitor at MIT. Gerald Lambeau put a problem on the board in the hall, and Will solved it. Before the Lambeau can talk to Will, he gets arrested for punching a cop. Will gets released into Lambeau's custody under the condition that he sees a therapist. He scares off a few (in some very funny scenes), and finally sees one who is much the same as Will. Through each other, they both learn to get on with their life, and put the past behind them. The performances are some of the best of the year and even of the decade. Robin Williams does his career thus-best in this movie. He plays a father figure to Will, even though the script only once hints to this. He had some of the same past as Will, and he is not only a father-figure to Will, but a best friend, and even a brother. He had grown up in the same neighborhood as Will. He had been abused like Will. So, they related to each other on a different level than Will could with anyone else, and on a higher level than Will wanted to relate to anyone else. He spoke the same language as Will did, that was the reason Will would listen. Minnie Driver received an Oscar nomination for her work in this movie. I thought she did career-topping work too. She had a very sketchy role, but did sorcery with it. She was excellent. She had opened her heart to Will, only to have it crushed. And then, after that, she still loved him. She didn't have the biggest role by any means, but she had an extremely important role. Matt Damon through the movie. He gives the best performance in the movie, hands down. His character is desperate, yet afraid of answers to questions that he can't find in books. The role is so complex, that you forget that he had to act in this part. He had to play a dashing lover to Skylar, a genius, a good friend, and a scared kid, and put these together and come up with a convincing character. And Damon does that without trouble. He had us all crying like babies in a certain particular scene. You here people say, "Oh but Leonardo DiCaprio deserved to win the Oscar or at least get nominated." To me there was no comparison at all. Matt Damon was clearly better than Leonardo DiCaprio. I thought that Matt Damon was even superior to Al Pacino who deserved a nomination for Donnie Brasco, and everyone knows I love Al Pacino.Ben Affleck has a small but important part in the movie. I personally think that he deserved an Oscar nomination for this too. He gave a great, near perfect performance. You don't have to have someone acting like they don't have enough since to come in out of the rain to give a good performance, and the whole cast shows it here. Stellan Skarsgard has an important role as the mathematician who "discovers" Will. It must have been heartbreaking for his character, Lambeau to know what true genius is, and appreciate true genius, but fall short of it himself. It must have been heartbreaking to watch an abused, high school dropout, cocky, 20 year old kid do math in a second that he was completely in the dark about. And it must have been most heartbreaking to watch Will almost throw it all away.The script of this movie was such a surprise. It was written by two actors, not screenwriters, who wanted to find their big break. Instead of waiting until the perfect part came, they wrote themselves the perfect part. The result was the best screenplay of the year. I wouldn't hesitate to put it within the 5 best of the decade. Jean Yves-Escoffier does a great job as the Director of Photography. He shoots it in a low key, dark, close-up style that works effectively. It captures the dark, moodiness of Boston. Danny Elfman does great work on the score. He got nominated for an Oscar, but this being his first "normal" movie, and plus being against Titanic, didn't help. It's a shame, I wouldn't hesitate to say that no movie was more enhanced by a score last year than Good Will Hunting. Gus Van Sant deserves credit for directing it. I've heard it compared to Dead Poets Society by saying, "I didn't even shed a tear at Good Will Hunting, but there wasn't a dry eye in the theater when I saw Dead Poets Society." Now that's a silly statement. That doesn't say anything about the quality of the movie. The difference is the directors. Peter Wier, who directed Dead Poets Society, is a sentimentalist, and Van Sant isn't. As one very good reviewer put it, "Gus Van Sant refrains from beating the audience over the head during the emotional scenes." That's exactly right. Peter Wier doesn't. In my book, Good Will Hunting is one of the 10 best movies of all time. It's one of the modern classics in my book. And if there's any justice, it will be in everyone else's book too. 9 Oscar Nominations: (Picture, Director, Actor (Damon), Supporting Actor (Williams), Supporting Actress (Driver), Screenplay, Editing, Song, Score )GRADE: A+ ****The best movie of the year.(NOTE: I would highly recommend this film to everyone, but beware - this film is quite liberal in its use of the most notorious four-letter word known to Hollywood. If you still don't know what I mean, think of Joe Pesci. If you *still* don't know what I mean, you're innocence is amazing, and this film would probably knock you for a loop. )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I'm against the grain on this one, but I truly hated this movie to the point where I almost walked out. I had absolutely no sympathy for the Matt Damon character. He's not mentally ill, rather he's a spoiled brat who needs a slap on the face. He treats everyone badly through his own self centeredness--the point is we are supposed to believe he has changed at the end. Not to give the ending away, but he's as self centered as ever as the movie closes, and that is what I found so annoying about the story. Indeed, everything in this movie was annoying from the downbeat girlfriend to the mawkish Robin Williams, who spouts some of the most embarrassing dialogue I've ever heard. Yes, I cried all five times I saw Titanic, but this left me totally cold!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by Gus Van Sant, Good Will Hunting is the story of a mathematical genius named Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon. The film takes place in the campus at MIT, where Hunting works as a janitor. One day after his class is over, mathematics Professor Lambeau writes a problem on the board that took several MIT professors two years to figure out, and challenges his students to solve it. When Hunting sees the problem, he solves it by himself in a matter of minutes. The movie then unravels the genius in him, but also portrays his many weaknesses and his rough childhood. One of my favorite aspects of this film is Hunting's relationship with the psychologist Sean, played by Robin Williams. Sean is persuaded by Lambeau to council and give advice to a metaphorically speaking "lost" Hunting, after Hunting gets sent away from five other counselors. Sean asks Hunting some thought provoking questions that lead him to pursue the dreams of his heart. Their relationship is like one of doctor and patient, as Hunting describes toward the end of the film. Sean tolerates him even after horrible disagreements and arguments they had with each other, and he never loses hope in him. Sean is one of the few people that actually understands Hunting, and why he does what he does. Unlike Lambeau, who often sees Hunting as an object of great power to be handled with force and control, Sean puts himself in Hunting's shoes and relates to him. For that reason, Hunting reciprocates this friendship and learns to trust Sean's judgement. A major portion of Hunting's actions at the end happen because of the advice that Sean had given him. Another great aspect of this film is the dialogue. The dialogue between few characters in this movie flows very naturally and really moves the story along. Whether it's between Hunting and his three closest friends, between Professor Lambeau and Sean, or between Sean and Hunting, the dialogue is incredibly real. A major theme in this movie is finding oneself, and finding what one really wants to do with his/her life. Talent and natural ability is one thing, but how will you use it? Will you just let it go to waste and stay comfortably in the status quo? Or will you go out and seek the adventures that your heart desires? Hunting has trouble identifying what his passions are, or what he wants to do with his life. When asked by Sean, Hunting cannot give a single straight answer. As far as I'm concerned, this film doesn't have any flaws, though some parts of the film may not be entertaining for everyone, and the beginning starts off quite slow. Other than that, I think people who enjoy watching classic films will love Good Will Hunting.After nearly twenty years since its release, Good Will Hunting remains one of the most powerful films ever made. This movie has a lot of heart, wit, and fun in it, though it revolves around a much more serious theme. This film is one of the few that can break your heart yet leave you smiling. Good Will Hunting is one of my favorite films of all time, and is definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good movie with a very good cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating-8/10Good Will Hunting is a movie that gets so many people talking, it is loved by many and the performances too. I felt as I watched just why do so many love it, I didn't think it was perfection but there is no doubt this is an interesting piece of cinema with it's smart plot and emotionally charged characters. I did feel it was very good and although only just about, it still manages to really let you enjoy it.The first thing to say about this is Robin Williams who is at his very best here. He just feels so excellent as his role as Sean Maguire who as you will see councils Will Hunting and he adds an extra element to this movie Robin does. All the cast are fairly strong here, Matt Damon as Will is good and really shows us what he has got for his future film career. Cast such as Ben Affleck aren't really shown as much as the two I mentioned but him among his brother Casey Affleck, Minnie Driver and Stellan Skarsgard form a good little cast for this type of film. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon of course write the movie and they do a great job, not only capturing everyday life situations well, but adding in Will Hunting to those scenes to make it feel smart and funny. I did however feel it was slightly contrived, mostly in the way they want to get a certain emotion out of you, sometimes you can laugh and sometimes you can be sad, even times when they want you to think "Oh wow he's smart that Will Hunting". I will also add that the script though is really showcasing the talent these two guys have, and I do feel like these guys really are an example to look up to when aspiring screenwriters come up.Gus Van Sant directs it well and his job is made easier by the fine script brought to him. He manages to delicately direct it without making the film feel done before or too much like a typical piece of cinema. Van Sant also could be said to contribute to Williams performance and you can see Gus really worked well with the cast to make them bring the most out of the script. Another delicate thing is the score, now when you making a film about a genius from Boston, Danny Elfman doesn't always spring to mind but he manages to beautifully score it and the music is really one thing I remember the most about watching the movie.One good thing about the movie is that it is smart, not only in movie terms but in terms of the script and the actors who all seem to remember there lines so well, it almost feels like they all know mathematics like we see in the film. I think all the credit goes to Affleck and Damon who if I'm not mistaken, are not mathematic geniuses but do the screenplay in such a way that it feels like a professor has written parts of the film.Overall it is the ending that is the real pay off, of course I'm not going to ruin it for you but lets just say it makes you feel emotion and really draws you close to the characters we see so much of in this movie. Overall this is totally worth a watch, not only for people thinking "It's Oscar nominated, it must be good", but also people who just want an interesting film, not for those who want action or true thrills but it is definitely one for the thinkers and maybe even the unidentified genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are just an average movie fan, then you probably know Matt Damon mainly (if not entirely) from his portrayal of Jason Bourne in the original Bourne trilogy. Do not expect to see him drown to many people in sinks in this movie, but expect to be blown away by his performance none-the-less.Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a janitor in one of the most prestigious colleges in the world. A math professor of a high level course challenges his students to complete a very difficult equation, which he later admits took him ages to complete. The professor writes the problem on a chalk board in the hallway, and when everyone is gone, Will Hunting completes the equation without an issue whatsoever.The professors of the college are mesmerized and can not figure out who this secret genius is. Finally they track down Hunting and try to convince him that he needs to be using his vast intellect for research and teaching. They tell him how much money he could be making. What they soon learn is that not every wise man wants a life full of riches and Nobel prizes on his mantle. Some men just want to enjoy the simple life.Hunting has a mysterious past that is causing him to shut people out before they get too close to him, but one man may prove to be smart enough to breakthrough the difficult past of this genius young man. Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), your average-everyday psychiatrist, may be more similar to Hunting than either of them initially realize.This is one of the first drama films that kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish without a single murder or explosion thrown in the mix. Scene to scene suspense, this movie will have you wanting to delve into Hunting's past just as much as Maguire.If you are looking for brilliant acting, and a powerful message about the greed of the American dream: look no further than Good Will Hunting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm imagining that the people who call this film boring are of the frame of mind, that unless a film has at least three explosions then it's not worth the price of a cinema ticket. Then there are the people calling it unrealistic. Now forgive me but I come from a similar background to the central character Will and I believe myself to be intelligent, but I didn't use my intelligence until very recently. Instead I took to taking drugs and drinking and swearing! Only a few years ago I was working as a cleaner, but now I'm studying programming and media technology at the best technical University in the UK. Now if I can identify with this film's realism (and I live in England) why can't so many others? This film is a veritable jewel. The script is one of the best I've ever seen. The way it mixes thought provoking ideas and witticisms with the kind of colloquial dialogue which we have read in things like 'The Catcher in the Rye'. Now I agree with the sentiment that some people have put across, 'get in touch with your inner Robin Williams'. But thankfully the script or Gus Van Sant or whatever prevented it from going over board. Look at the final scene where they're hugging and saying their farewells. Now this could have overlapped into a typical slushy moment, but no the lines 'Doesn't this contravene the Doctor, patient relationship?' 'Only if you grab my ass' were uttered so as to diffuse it. Then bear in mind that you never actually see the reunion between Skylar and Will! I could go on forever arguing against people's criticisms. But what's the point if certain viewers can't appreciate the subtly evocative direction of Van Sant, the quick fire script and the superb performances by the cast. It's these same viewers who shall, until the end of their days sit and watch the vacuous outpourings of Hollywood mainstream. Let them watch this 'chewing gum for the mind' and we discerning few will lap up the droplets of quality cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sensational movie !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about this movie.. It is simple sensational. For a good understanding about the essence of this movie, it needs to be analyzed with an open heart, it is need to be done in a sentimental way not in a robotic one. The importance of the message within this movie, we can find in our life, the need of someone near us represent's not just a simple need of affiliation to a certain group but a need for a protective "shield" that has the meant to protect us from all of our problems and to push us from the heavy part of our life. This movie has managed to perfectly expose the feelings that one person, in this case Will Hunting, has gained from the negative part that has marked his life. We can observe the fact that,life,even if we believe that in the first moments it has to be gentile, to show us the most beautiful thing,love,but life can be harsh with some of us even from the beginning of it and it throws us in a totally different world characterized by ignorance,poverty,fear,violence,etc. The affirmation of Will has another important role in the key of perception and the message is very clear- Just with the opening of our souls,with true friendship and love we can outrun the most difficult obstacles that has been attributed to us. The true friendship helps us to go further in life, it pushes you, it awakens you from the endless nightmare that life has taken you.In the end i would like to appreciate the fabulous work of Robin Williams that was sensational in speech,action,gestures he is truly an ace that was played in this great movie!.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie with great actors, yet an even greater message.Matt Damon's performance in the movie was excellent, loved his character, Will Hunting was a very unusual guy, gifted with a great mind and memory, but dangerously reckless.The message this movie had is still relevant to this day. Anyone can easily screw up their life by simply not knowing what they really want. Usually, you have to make the decision of what you are going to be, early in your life, you are 16 - 20 years old, many people fail to find their way and end up disappointed and unhappy for the rest of their lives. That was the case with Will as well, he didn't really care about his insane math skills and hanged out with complete idiots.Some people need to have someone show them the way, because on many occasions there are very talented people, who are just wasting time on useless studies/things that they don't need or it is just too easy for them.Not to say, you should do whatever someone else tells you to do, but in Will's case he needed some sort of guidance.</fullReview>

MIT Prof. Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg?rd) always puts a challenging problem outside his class for his students. Will is on parole, given a janitorial job and solves the problem. Lambeau is surprised that nobody claims the solution and puts another problem up. He catches the janitor doing the solution and helps him in his trial for hitting a cop. Will is a mess. He's an orphan who suffered as a foster child. He meets Skylar (Minnie Driver) but can't quite open up to her until he starts seeing Dr. Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Maguire is Lambeau's last resort. They were college roommates and he is suffering from the lost of his wife.These are great characters. The first meeting between Will and Dr. Maguire is electric. It is a couple of powerful performances. Will gets a twinkle in his eye when he finds Maguire's weak spot. Gus Van Sant does a good job mostly getting the great performances. Will has four relationships in this movie. Each one is fascinating and each one is given great material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best and Most Therapeutic Movies Ever Made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1997 was a very difficult year for movies. There was Titanic (that took almost every award), Good Will Hunting, LA Confidential, Boogie Nights, Air Force One, Cop Land, Austin Powers and loads of others. Good Will Hunting was one of the movies that year that continues to mesmerize and inspire everybody that sees it. Sad thing is, the movie was nominated for many awards, but won every little against Titanic. Titanic won almost every award because it had more things to offer. Titanic had the song, score, sets, acting, originality, suspense, among others that were either at par with, or better than other movies of that year. Good Will Hunting was not a great piece of "film." There was no (or very little) elements of camera tricks, deep focus, symbolism etc. All it had was a great story and a great script, those were all it needed. Good Will Hunting had the best script of the year and one of the best scripts ever. If a movie has witty dialogue, as this does, it deserves a pat on the back. If a movie contains dialogue that sears the heart and drives your emotions, it deserves a major award. Will Hunting (Damon) is a janitor at MIT that solves extremely complicated equations in an instant that most professors take years to prove. After Will gets in trouble with law for the umpteenth time, one of the professors interested in him (Skarsgaard) sets him up with a psychology professor at a community college (Williams) to council him. As a child, Will was abused and abandoned by his parents, so he pushes away anything that gets close to him because he is afraid of being hurt again. Will is lost and scared and it is up to Sean Maguire, who understands him completely to make Will realize how precious his gift is. Both Will and Sean's lives will be changed forever. Good Will Hunting is a movie about searching the human soul for who you are. The therapy scenes, actually almost the whole movie is enough to completely take a toll on the viewer and inspire them and give hope. The acting is top notch by all, especially by Damon and Williams. I think this is Williams' best movie, not because he won the Oscar for it, but because it was one of the few serious roles he did the can change people's lives. We have Gus Van Sant, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Robin Williams and the rest of the cast to thank for this life-changing movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly, a film that deserves the praise it's received.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a fan of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck for several years, and Robil Williams has been number one, as far as I'm concerned in everything he's done. This film from the beginning gripped my full attention. It's as if the three stars referenced above really weren't actors in the film. It was real life. No one would be noticed if they tried to redo this film. Life today is very hard, and scenes as depicted here are probably common. Every one in a while it's a good thing to try to convey to the public that we're all alike and from time to time show a glimpse of the extraordinary in their lives, but can't seem to get their message out. Here, Matt Damon, is an example of someone like this. He's fortunate to receive the help he needs. It's not easy, as the film shows, but Robil Williams is the one (that everyone of us needs) who finally breaks thru to truly help someone who is Good, Will Hunting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superbly written and acted film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GOOD WILL HUNTING, even though there really aren't any narrative surprises, is filled with wonderful dialogue and bolstered by strong performances. The story is about Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who is a bit of a hard case when it comes to his personal life, but is also a mathematical genius. Together with the help of an MIT professor (Stellan Skarsgard) and a psychologist (Robin Williams) he comes to understand his true potential. The best parts of the film are the many dialogue scenes, some emotionally deep and others biting, that add so much depth to the characters. This was a passion project for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and it shows. The dialogue felt natural and true to life, which adds to the authenticity of the overall experience. Though everyone (including Ben Affleck) turns in an excellent performance, Matt Damon and Robin Williams are especially good. Matt Damon is the hard-headed young adult who is afraid to let people in, and Robin Williams is a professor with experience and insight that he uses to get to Will. Even though the narrative structure wasn't the tightest, there was something to enjoy about every scene, and all of them added something to the overall picture. I should also mention that Minnie Driver does a great job as Will's girlfriend, and Casey Affleck has a few of the best lines. As far as other aspects go I enjoyed the score, which was never intrusive or told the audience how to feel. There was also a rather eclectic soundtrack which fit the moods of various scenes perfectly. Overall, it was a superbly written film with equally good performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Simple Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel ashamed for putting this film off for so long. I had intended to watch it for a while, but kept making excuses. My reasoning for this was that the description of this film and it's somewhat simple plot line put me off, even though the film did have the likes of Robin Williams and Matt Damon in it. Yes, the film follows a simple plot line and proceeds exactly how you'd expect it to, but there's a beauty to it; a simple beauty. It tackles psychology and the nature and feelings of the youth. And it does it perfectly.The writing of 'Good Will Hunting' was nigh perfect. I wasn't expecting something so thought provoking and intelligent from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's first screenplay. Again, it's simply done but has a unique beauty behind it. You can connect with the title character, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), and understand how he's feeling throughout it from his discussions with his psychiatrist, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Damon and Affleck outdid themselves here.Gus Van Sant directs the masterpiece. This is the first of his works I have came across. The directing fits the film perfectly. It's nothing big or exciting, just simple. Without the directing, the film simply would not feel the way it does. It adds to calm, slow nature of 'Good Will Hunting' and everything feels at perfect pace with the writing. The emotion is hit spot on as well, with obvious help from the actors.I'd be lying if I said that I even noticed the music used in the film, which is a shame because I love Danny Elfman's other works. Everything was so focused on the raw emotion and I was so taken in by the characters. I cannot comment on the composition, but I will be able to eventually because I will definitely be watching this film again in the future. It's certainly a new one of my favourites.The acting is astoundingly good. I had never seen Robin Williams out of his usual romantic comedy role before now, so this was a surprising and refreshing change. He plays the role of the aged psychiatrist perfectly. Matt Damon and Minnie Driver created amazing chemistry as their respective characters and Damon shines in his role throughout, getting every scene spot on. Stellan Skarsg?rd and Ben Affleck got their roles spot on as well, as the rather egotistic professor who cares for his students and the loyal and loving best friend respectively.Overall this was a simple masterpiece, which I did not expect in the slightest. It wasn't clich, as it was entirely unique in its own way, but it also had the simple plot line that you'd expect. 'Good Will Hunting' is a film I will certainly be watching again for its delightful and simple nature. If you haven't already seen this genius piece of work, I suggest that you make some time for it as soon as you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant's Good Will Hunting is one of the most inspirational movies that were ever made, the movie tells the story of a janitor at MIT who has a gift in math but needs direction in life after one too many run-ins with the law. The movie stars Matt Damon as that character named Will Hunting. Also the movie has a great supporting cast such as a young Ben Affleck,Robin Williams, Stellan Skarsgard,and Minnie Driver who gives a decent performance. Director Gus Van Sant has crafted of what I think is the best movie of 1997 because this is a true acting movie, the movie compares to inspirational films such as Million Dollar Baby, Rocky, The Blind Side, Rain Man, The Pursuit of Happiness, Remember the Titans,To Kill a Mockingbird, Lawrence of Arabia, Braveheart, etc..I personally would recommend this movie even though there is a few bad scenes but this is a movie that will stay with you for a very very long time.A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Healthy Cynicism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie makes a strong statement for individuality and stepping outside of the system. The brilliance of Damon's character (Will Hunting), lies not in his mathematical genius, but in his ability to assess social structures, schemes and systems. His cynicism is an effective shield against those who would use his talents for their own personal gain. Robin Williams' character is very believable as a therapist, because while he does not necessarily support Hunting becoming part of the corporate (or government) money machine, he does express the value in using one's abilities to one's utmost.the movie could have benefited from an exploration of Hunting's past (where he came from and what made him what he is), as well as some time spent in understanding what his inner thoughts and feelings are. Maybe the scene with Ben Affleck acting as Hunting's agent could have been scrapped, to fit in more character development for Hunting. Again, this movie makes an important statement about how the amoral, cookie-cutter world of business has affected us all and therefore, why some revile and avoid it.This is a warning to the society we have built: Integrate those who are dis-affected, and create a world of greater humanity or we will all suffer the loss of ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Not So Beautiful Mind Surrounds An Impressive Innate Intellect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Hunting's Mind has been Damaged with that Cringe Inducing Clich Known as an Orphan who Suffered Severe Physical and Mental Abuse from Foster Parents. This is at the Cracked Center of His Character with an Innate Intelligence that is Off the Scale. It is that Battered Baggage that He Carries that Suffocates a not so Innate Ability to See Himself for what He is. A Genius with a Gift that can Benefit Mankind.A Professor Discovers Will's Genius and makes it His Duty and Assignment to Bring Him out of the Closet Attempting Psychoanalysis. It can be Frustrating Watching Matt Damon's Character Pooh-Pooh Advances of Concern with Belligerence and Condescension. But Robin Williams as the Last in a Long Line of Uppity Shrinks that Failed is more Earthy and Will Hunting Bonds with the Bearded One and the Demons Inhabiting His Psyche are there to be Exorcised.The Movie is Charming and Co-Writer and Co-Star Ben Affleck is Here as a Childhood Chum. In this Film Affleck Shows Signs of being a Better Writer than Actor but that is a Discussion for a more Lengthy Exercise. He is Adequate but it is not much of a Stretch since He is Basically Playing Himself. The Professor Part is Intensely Played by Stellan Starsgard and Minnie Driver is the Love Interest.Gus Van Zant's Direction is Surprisingly Unintrusive and He Delivers a Nice Calm Atmosphere to Surround the Volatile Story that has Many Confrontational Scenes, Physical, Intellectual, and Emotional. Overall, the Movie may be Overrated a bit and not Everything Works to Perfection (this is no Masterpiece), but it is a Highly Engaging, Energetic Exercise that Convinced Critics, the Academy, and the General Public that this was Indeed Something Special. It is.Note...Casey Affleck is on board with another "need subtitles" embarrassment as not one line of his dialog is decipherable and this may be his most mumbling "performance" ever and almost ruins every scene. Definitely the low-light of the Movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you know that suicide is one of the three top causes for deaths ?In America specifically , teens and adults too ( 20s and 30s ) then it falls below the third place starting from 40 . Unfortunately , for the whole humanity , we bust ourselves working to find a cure for all pains , and find something to lower deaths' rate of Cancer , heart diseases and AIDS , .. etc but we don't even try to give a shot at one of the most important cause of death , suicide , a person's psychology and inside . As a student in Med school , interested in Psychiatry in specific , I try all the time to look for movies with the portray of psychiatrists and I get shocked at what Hollywood gives . It almost always shows the therapist/psychiatrist as a totally useless person with some books around . A psychiatrist can save someone . Although I feel the movie is lacking some elements , it's good and deep . I don't know why in specific , but I there are other movies with psychological experiences which are better than this . I recommend it for the ones who would like to see a good drama and some psychological aspects of the human mind . I wouldn't recommend it , however , for someone who's a little more advanced , either as a psychiatrist/therapist or even as moviegoer who's seen deeper ones . Robin Williams was phenomenal . Still , many elements were missing if one wanted to tangle such a thought . I give it a 7 because of its originality back in 1997 and because of the relatively few fascinating scenes as the one at the lake . I would also recommend " Lars And The Real Girl " ( mostly ) , " Crash " ," August: Osage County " and " Silver Linings Playbook " for anyone who agrees with me . They are similar but a lot deeper and will give you wonderful insights into how the human psyche works :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting The Oscar winning American drama Goodwill Hunting was released on December 5, 1997, written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and directed by Gus Van Sant with a modest budget of 10 million dollars. The film was an instant success making $225,933,435 at the box office (imdb.com). The success of the movie did not come from fancy effects, or intense action scenes; however it is the script that captures the audience, which makes us, fall in love with the characters as well as the movie as a whole. The aspect of the movie that stood out the most to me was the excellent story line, which was beautifully executed by the phenomenal acting and powerful performances of the main characters, Affleck, Damon and along with the support of Robin Williams, who made this movie such a success. The script written by Damon and Affleck, won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, which did not surprise me. Damon began writing Good Will Hunting in his fifth year at Harvard in a playwriting class. As a result, what was supposed to be a one act play had turn into the movie that turned these struggling actors into instant A list celebrities. (Nanos) It is very unique that the writers are able to star in their own movie, which in my opinion helped them portray the story exactly the way they wanted it. They were both a double-threat, being both the actors and script writers. Damon and Affleck were childhood friends who grew up together as aspiring actors. Both from Cambridge, Massachusetts, they were able to at authentically portray their characters as well as the city of Boston. They were extremely familiar with the setting, they were trying to depict to the audience, being from Boston, which made this film so popular among Boston residents as well as people from across the country. (Nanos) Many of the local residents were cast as extras one noted, "the clothing was right, the way they acted, the accents, the cars they drove."(Good Will Hunting:Released) Everything was absolutely perfect. In addition, the two were real life best friends, making the on screen chemistry between that much better. As a result, Damon and Affleck were the ideal pair to star in this movie. Robin Williams also won an Oscar for the movie for best supporting role. In creating the latter character, the screenplay offers Robin Williams the rare serious role that takes full advantage of his talents (New york times). Williams' character Sean; helps develop Will, who is the most dynamic character in this story. Without the role of Williams, and the relationship between the two, we would not see Will grow and ultimately change into the new man he becomes at the end of the movie. The back and forth arguing between Will and Sean made them so entertaining, "this film is bright and knowing enough to bring fresh energy to the jousting between Will and Sean McGuire, the fellow underachiever who proves to be the only therapist who can handle him"(new york times) A life long friendship was soon formed between the two who challenging each other every step of the way. "The film strains slightly in creating a set of neatly parallel friendships and by finding too many echoes of Will's problems in Sean's own past. But what it does beautifully is to develop a doctor-patient sparring that becomes affecting and important to both parties"(new york times) They both wanted each other to do more which their lives, which resulted in how the movie was ended. Sean was able to "put his cards back on the table" with the help of Will, and because of Sean's advice to "Do what's in your heart and you'll be fine"(Good Will Hunting, 1997) The passion and genuine care Sean has for Will was obvious, resulting in a connection from the audience, making them want the same things for Will as Sean did. The love story aspect of the film makes it a feel good movie, which makes the audience realize what is important in life. Even though some critics claim that the plot is predictable, the movie is ended in an ironic way that surprised me (new york times). Based on the Will I knew at the beginning, I would've never expected him to go after Skylar like he did. His transformation made me realize how love can be so important and almost the only thing someone needs in life to be happy. Based on Sean's touching speech about the love he had with his wife, "you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. Known someone could level you with her eyes. Feeling like! God put an angel on earth just for you?who could rescue you from the depths of hell. And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel and to have that love for her to be there forever"(Good Will Hunting, 1997). At the end of the film Will was finally able to realize that he found this love with Skylar. He drives all the way across the country to be with her, which represents how love is greater than anything else. I would definitely recommend this movie. It is a touching, sentimental film, portraying life's common hardships that people deal with on a daily bases that allows the audience to connect with it. Good Will Hunting (Van Sant, 1997) opened my eyes to the meaning of love as well as what is important in life, leaving me completely satisfied after watching the movie. The feel good American drama, which unfolds as a love story, is definitely a classic that leaves me feeling the same emotions every time I watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredible and important piece of film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who have given a poor rating, let me share to you my reasons for dismissing these reviews.To the critics who discredit the plausibility and refer to this masterpiece as a 'hype' movie, it is absurd. The concept of the unfulfilled young man making use of his life is about as classic protagonist story that can be thrown into any movie, but what this one did was take it to the next level by making a brilliantly creative character of a repeat-offender boy genius. However, this concept is merely a tool to enable the character and relationship development that occurs throughout the play (and gives lease to great characterization from Damon), therefore criticizing this plot point is criticizing possibly the least important aspect of the film. And as for a Hollywood hype film? Hey we're still discussing its quality nearly 20 years later.</fullReview>

Matt is extremely intelligent and had suffered through his childhood and does not let anyone understand him until he meets Sean and then he realizes what he really want to do and finds a direction in life.The title for this movie 'good will hunting' is really apt and wonderful.I really love this film and this movie really deserves being watched more than once.so without any doubts in mind you can watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A cultural phenomenon"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well what can I see about this picture; other than it is actually stunning and deeply inspiring. Not stunning in the superficial sense, but a picture that really questions ones current situation and meaning in this world. I recently watched this movie and was concerned that I wasn't going to enjoy the move because of preconceived notions I had about the movie, knowing that it is widely and critically claimed ? both for its acting and resonating message. I was wrong and this movie totally blew me away.Will Hunting (played by Matt Damon in his Oscar-nominated role) is an extremely bright Maths genius at one of the world's most prestigious universities ? no, not as a student ? as one of its janitors and whose situation is not and its most ideal in life. Plagued by deep personal problems, Hunting is forced to confide in therapy to aid his plight by the highly acclaimed Professor of Psychology Sean Maguire (portrayed by Robin Williams in his Academy Award-winning performance for this picture). Although initially apprehensive about confiding in a profession Hunting fails to appreciate ? big earners ? the two's friendship blossoms into the very message this picture is trying to encourage ? follow your dreams but never forget who your friends are. The film's writing is also of genius ? striking a comedic and dramatic balance in what is meant to be a deeply touching picture. Those in the supporting roles of the movie (Affleck, Driver and Williams) were also positive highlights in demonstrating how varied our lives can be in terms of who we are acquainted with. We all know someone like Will Hunting ? a bright guy whose direction in life is way of course, someone like Chuckie whose persistent irritancies aims to encourage us to fulfill our life to the fullest and of course Driver's character ? a crush that decides to move away forever. Damon and Affleck penned this magnificent piece of art won, to date, their only Academy Award ? for Best Original Screenplay ? is a thoroughly decide accolade that will stand the test of time to be forgotten. Words cannot bespeak the brilliance of this movie, currently ranked as one of my favorites of all time. The true success with this movie is how relatable the plot is to our lives and how Hunting's story of pain and happiness can help us to aspire to be more than just money-grabbing robots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My seek solace movie of all time. This is great and it has been working for me for over 10 years now.I saw it first time in college and in last 10 years numerous number of times and it gave me an inspiration always. Now what kind of an inspiration, this differs each time. Now, I am angry with myself and upset because one of my scripts was rejected by my director (rather he said politely, let's make this one later) . So I had to get back to this spirit lifting film and again it made me rise from the pitfall and made me stand erect. This is a kinda of film that is rare, it's about friendship one can say, it's about knowing oneself someone else may say, but it's great anyway you look at it.The simplest question "What do you want to do?" is the toughest one to answer. At times, we need someone to help us along with that question.Here Will is helped by Sean. The movie works for it's writing and acting by all. Moreover, the way it is directed, makes it completely authentic and believable Will Hunting (Matt Damon) does not exist in many, there are a few and yet he can be related to, we all have talents but we need direction.We need someone to say. Son, go do it and that's what precisely Sean (Robin Williams) does with Will. Written by to brains, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, this is for sure a great script by those then youngsters but I need it needed direction and that's what Gus Van Sant did to this. Look at the scene at the end where the car just goes away and keeps going away, tells us that this movie is something else from the commercial rot. This has got great dialog to match it up with and well, the cinematography is commendable. Well, acting by Robin Williams is worth a mention, because he did take the whole role to a new level. Just take that "Fart Scene" where he confesses his wife used Fart is something that can make anyone into splits with a subdued amount of tears because there is tragedy involved.Also, I can relate Sean to my good brother "Vinay Anna" whom I have met over a year and made a great bond with. He is a man, who used to tell me "Just do, what you want to do, we will for sure back you up" His words, made me pursue what I believe in, and I am still doing it. I have no crib whatsoever with any technical department be it art direction, production design, music, editing or even costumes. They are simply great as they are very apt for this movie. All the 5 thumbs up for this 5/5 movie. Will get back to this many a time, just hoping, I will neither be angry or down going forward when I watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A youthful, but unhinged genius Will Hunting (Matt Damon) works as a janitor at the MIT, where he conspicuously solves higher level mathematical conundrum handed out to students by Fields Medal-winning combinatorialist Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg?rd). Shocked by the ingenuity of the troubled orphan Lambeau ventures to have him enrol as his student. The South Boston bred man-child however prefers to spend time and money on booze by the gallons with his friends Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), Billy McBride (Cole Hauser) and Morgan O'Mally (Casey Affleck). Following a aggressive assault by Hunting on a man who bullied him as a child, Will agrees to attend therapeutic sessions and become Lambeau's protg. After several therapist resign from taking on the troublesome genius, Lambeau finally asks his former roommate Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to take on the formidable task. Despite a soul-breaking first encounter, Maguire decides on the challenge, despite the necessity of overcoming Hunting's intellectually layered self-defence mechanisms...Back in the days "Good Will Hunting" offered a novelty perspective, one heavily layered in witty dialogue, well versed psychoanalysis and somehow avoiding pointless on-screen blabbering. A brain-child of youthful Affeck and Damon came a brilliant piece of drama, strongly carried on the shoulders of the central theme of the therapeutic sessions. Probably Gus van Sant's most mainstream effort is arguably also his most honest and best. Unskewed by pretence the story sells as a traditionally structured drama, but with such an intensely successful script, which makes it an undying classic. Although several scenes do seem rough, especially those centred around Skarsg?rd and the wasting away of Will's talent, almost misguided in intent and somewhat hollow, nowhere close to as forceful as the key sessions between Maguire and Hunting. Exposition is pretty low key and apart from lone scenes like Hunting's love interest, Skylar (Minnie Driver) flying away to California shuns away from artistic endeavours, keeping a simple and focused outlook on the key issues at hand - the question of fulfilment as defined by intellectual achievements as opposed to that of bliss happiness caused by human interaction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a 2 hr movie which i wish was a little longer. For me it can be divided into two tracks, the main protagonist's Will Hunting (Matt Damon) track and Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) track. If I had to rate the Robin Williams part I would give it 11/10, it was perfect, his Back-story , dialogs with Will Hunting,looks, acting...the best i have seen in a Hollywood drama. I could feel his love ,pain &amp; anguish and his desperation to give Will Hunting's life a meaningful direction.Will Hunting track is where I have a few complaints, his back-story is not that well established. Also his love story which is crucial for the closure of the movie is not convincing , possibly this flaws are because of time constraints, but then again it has more screen time than the Robin Williams track (not sure if there is a longer directors cut out there).Another reason is Robin Williams part is just so great, everything else had to look paler.Still this a must watch , go see it , I gotta see about a girl !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now it is very rare that I give a film 10/10 because I believe that no film can be 'perfect' - but for the first time I believe I have found a genuine 10.Featuring two of my favourite actors, Matt Damon and Robin Williams, I was already optimistic about the film and the acting did not disappoint. Everything the actors did and said was so suitable to their characters and it was clear that they had an overwhelming understanding of the characters they were playing.The plot was thoughtful but in no way slow. It contained that balance that all great films need of comedy, romance, drama, friendship and raw emotion. This balance was so well distributed that it meant one could cry (as I did) at an emotional scene but could then be comforted by a later scene with some comedy.The film is one of absolute brilliance, which teaches an important lesson about life. It will go down as a classic in my books. I've seen a lot of films - and I mean a lot - but this will forever hold a place in my 5 all time favourite films.A must see for anyone and everyone.</fullReview>

Matt Damon also did an incredible job in this movie, he played such a jerk of a person, but later on you were able to understand more of why he was such a jerk. I have seen this movie 5 times and I love it the same every time I watch it!!!! The is a great movie and worth the watch only if you are not offended by such bad language.

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is manipulative and spends a good half the film playing your emotions like a piano, but it is so effective that even while you know full well what it is trying to do you can't help but allow yourself to get involved.Will Hunting is a young tearaway floating aimlessly through life as his youth evaporates, yet unwilling to start making the grown up decisions. He spends most days with his three buddies hanging out, swearing, trash-talking, fighting and drinking, and his own personal time is spent janitoring and reading? His friends are more the "whadda you lookin' at?" type, and it is during the fighting part of his day that Will inadvertently takes a swing at a local cop.Will does his janitorin' at a local college in Boston where a professor named Lambeaux (Stellen Skarsgaard) has posed a mathematical equation as a special challenge to his large group of students, he proposed that anyone who could solve this unbelievably complex problem would get a special prize and acknowledgment.Will came across the equation on a whiteboard when cleaning after hours and? Shortly after Lambeaux realises the complex equation has been solved ? and with no-one coming forward to claim credit for the feat ? Lambeaux sets another, more complicated puzzle. He proclaims that while he doubts anyone will solve this one should they do so it will prove the first was no fluke.Will has a quick squiz and promptly puts the answer up on the board to something that took teams of mathematicians months to solve working in unison.But Will doesn't want any attention or acclaim, when confronted about his acts he runs off to a night on the town with his friends once more. Will's buddies are simple hard working guys who also play hard, they tease each other unmercifully and seem resigned that this is how their lives will pan out forever. Meanwhile will gives a verbal beatdown to a pretentious egghead in the pub and simultaneously manages to pick up Skyla (Minnie Driver).Unfortunately thanks to punching the policeman Will is also thrown in prison to await sentencing for his assault. After Lambeaux manages to track him down he witnesses Will defending himself, citing obscure cases and verdicts as precedents and running verbal rings around the more experienced prosecutor.Yep. Still smart.But the judge ain't havin' it this time? and Will is sentenced to a stretch in the pen.To fast forward a little Lambeaux manages to pull some strings and has Will released from prison on two conditions, the first that he spend some time with the maths team to see just how deep Will's intelligence and abilities go, the second that Will seek professional psychiatric help for his personal issues and anger management.Will agrees, but probably more because he wants to get a shot at Skyla.Will enjoys the maths side of the equation (get it?), but is far more reluctant to let someone into his head, he cuts a swathe through various shrinks, sidestepping real questions and disarming them with his superior intellect.Enter Shaun (Robin Williams) a long time friend of Lambeaux and basically the last chance at success. The initial meetings and chats are perfunctory exercises, at best silent at worst rocky and heated, but both Shaun and Will gradually realise that there is more to the other than meets the eye. Shaun feels that Will is incredibly gifted but a little na?ve and unsure of how to use his talents, but Will thinks that Shaun too is "slumming it" a little and taking the easy way out.As the tenuous relationship grows more trusting and each comes to rely more on the other decisions must be made.Lambeaux feels that Will is a once in a generation mind that could rival Einstein, he wants to "discover" him and unveil him to the world, Shaun only wants Will to think for himself and not merely recite what he knows from reading books and hearing others. More than anything though Will's buddies all know that he could be so much more than a janitor or construction worker, and while they bust their guts trying to get by they desperately want Will to use his natural talents to do something for himself.And all the while Skyla and her big head remain in Will's thoughts? It astounds me that Damon and Affleck came up with all this in their teens ? it is well paced, intelligent and always interesting. Near the end of the film the plot threatens briefly to get a little bit ahead of itself but the loose ends are all neatly pulled together for the conclusion, which while not being incredibly satisfying served to wrap things up nicely.Robin Williams is thankfully low key and realistic as Shaun, Matt Damon proved that he could act even then, and Skarsgaard has the unenviable role of being the bad guy, but he manages to show full justification for his desires.Good Will Hunting has become a bit of a punchline through the years, the "How do you like them apples" bit has been parodied, as has the success of the film in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (in a hilarious way too), but you can't ignore the impact that the film has when you watch it.Final Rating ? 8.5 / 10. I remembered it more as a relic of the 90s, an anomaly that was inexplicably successful, rewatching it the other night showed me that it was worthy of the acclaim and the box office, like Will himself this is pretty exceptional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe how black and white the reviews on here are for this film. People either seem to think it perfect, or terrible. I have neither of these views - it was however a very good film. Not in my top 10, but certainly in the top 100.It IS moving, it HAS got some beautiful and believable dialogue and it is very well acted by virtually all concerned. My favourite part being Robin William's dressing down of will: "And I'd ask you about war, you'd probably throw Shakespeare at me, right, 'once more unto the breach dear friends.' But you've never been near one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap, watch him gasp his last breath looking to you for help. I'd ask you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet..." etc. Well written! However, the main flaw in my opinion is Matt's character. He is simply too well rounded a genius, it's unbelievable and a little arrogant of the two writers. He has real emotional flaws and that's all dandy, but personally I think he should have been out-quoted by the guy in the Harvard bar and still got the girl anyway for sticking up for his friend. I think he could have shown even more vulnerability by being really knocked by not being the best at everything. Oh well, a missed opportunity.Put it this way I don't know many geniuses who haven't got a blind spot in current affairs or history or social skills or SOMETHING. Saying that, the way he holds himself back with his self destructive behaviour is classic and very well portrayed.It's a film I will definitely watch many times and I suggest you do too. This film is boring only in the same way the night sky is boring... it depends how deep you are willing to look and how much you are willing to think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly I wan't very optimistic about this movie ( mostly because of Ben Afleck ), but it stars Robin Williams, so I decided to give it a shot. As a result, I've watched one of my favorite Robin Williams movies all the time!It's just ingenious! And inspirational. Shows us the difference between our dreams and other people's expectations and how often we could forget the dreams because of the expectations. It shows us that to be genius doesn't mean to be a senseless machine for doing the right thing. To be a genius, it is to be a human who can do things other people wish they could do.Robin Williams and Matt Damon at their best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film of character a film that got everything right. It was the story of a super mouse. Someone smarter&#xfeff; than everyone else, but from that he had a curse. That curse was that he couldn't forget the problems of his life. The shrink the girlfriend the friends and everyone else made him realize how great he truly is.This movie is truly a film of immense character. This is a film where&#xfeff; you see the good nature of humans that appears of the outside yet the genius and seriousness in the inside.This is one of those films that you&#xfeff; watch because nothing better is on and it turns out to be one of your favorite movies! Robin&#xfeff; Williams, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck &amp; Minnie Driver are outstanding in it.The writing is witty, brilliant and hilarious at times, both Matt and Robin Williams preform wonderfully from both a comedic and theatrical prospective. Matt's best work since Dogma and Williams best along side Dead Poet's Society.Once you&#xfeff; watch it for the first time, you will appreciate that such great inspirational movies still exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting is a dream movie for all!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this movie possibly 30 times. Whenever it is on cable I will sit and watch and even finish the lines for some of the characters. I know I am probably bias because of the career path I have chosen (that being a therapist), but this is one of the best movies ever put out in all aspects. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon make their screen writing debut as well as play the lead roles. Damon is so believable as "Will Hunting" that you can't help to feel as though you know him. Another star of this film is Robin Williams who plays "Sean McGuire" the battle scarred therapist that is willing to do anything to help Will find his way through life.In this film, Will Hunting is a genius who has been dealt the worse hand ever, and he tries to forget his past, when a professor at MIT decides to help him and give him a fighting chance. Ben Affleck who plays Will's best friend "Chuckie" who is just like family to Will and wants nothing more than to see him succeed. The movie is shot on location in South Boston and you are able to see all the grit and grime of this area as well as the "better side of town" when Will meets a girl from Harvard. The girl he meets "Skylar" played by Minnie Driver becomes a climactic character in the story. The soundtrack is amazing with one of the best being the 70's hit "Afternoon Delight". It sets the mood in all scenes and is able to show you all different perspectives.I would recommend this movie to anyone. It does have some adult situations but I had no problem watching this with my teenage daughter. It is a film that makes you really think about what is important and to live out your dreams. I know I will watch it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance, Good Will Hunting in its title alone does not lure anyone into grabbing this DVD off the Blockbuster shelf. But once rented, the pleasure was all mine. Filled with the humor of Ben Affleck, intensity of Robin Williams and mystery of Matt Damon the nine out of ten stars basically rolls right off my tongue. Picture the drama of a tear filled chick-flick combined with the raw brash fight scenes of a Bruce Willis action thriller all while kicking back with microwave popcorn and can of coke?priceless, minus the popcorn and coke! This movie is Affleck and Damon's break out moment. The movie, set in the gritty streets of South Boston, finds its irony in Matt Damon's character, Will Hunting, an unusual 21 year- old math prodigy holding a job as a janitor at the prestigious MIT. Although a bit far-fetched, the cast is perfection in leaving one to wonder why no one dreams to be a janitor. Why can't that be fulfilling enough?Moving on to junior mints, everyone will relate to the simple story line. Ben Affleck's chain smoking, beer drinking character Chuckie, tries to persuade Will toward a better life. Of course, don't we all have a friend like that? Will has a way off the streets that have hurt him, but loyalty is hard to leave. When Will's abusive past continues to haunt his future, enters Sean (Robin Williams) as his new therapist. From here on in the battle is waged whether Will's life of work and bar brawls with friends is the happy ending of his story. Ah, a breath of fresh air and a far cry from our open era of self-induced reality stardom and athletic phenoms, finding success only in the money they spend. It brings to life what makes any of us tick. What keeps us from staying safely where we are and what pushes us to dream?Renting now is a no brainer since these names today would fill theater seats on star power alone?do take into account no one had heard of Affleck or Damon when it hit the big screen. Robin Williams surprises straying from his in your face stand-up comedy to play a therapist who maybe hasn't quite reached his potential. And expect him to have to take a long hard look at his own life. Insert dramatic music and play in slow motion-not that sappy.My infatuation with the movie stops short as I take one star from my count due to the made for Hollywood ending. The film is inspirational, witty and smart?until the ending. I understand that the grand finale sells tickets and the audience appreciates certain outcomes but no need to dumb down what is central to the story as reality begs for loose ends or bad choices or death or something. No one's life is neat and tidy and Will Hunting along with the rest of the cast could conceivably be in rehab for a very long time. I was not ready to say The End and think happily ever after. Good Will Hunting?surprisingly not about hunting at all. I hesitate to push people to see a film held in such high regards, but it carries itself with a simple charm that allows a deep story to be told. The acting is top notch with the characters believable. Fix the ending and we can run down the beach with Bo Derek in the pursuit of that perfect 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slight glibness is easily forgotten in what is often a moving film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here again is a film to which an extraordinary number of IMDb reviewers react with either jubilant enthusiasm as though it heralded the Second Coming or utter disdain as though all involved should be lined up against the nearest wall and shot. And neither reaction says anything at all useful about the film (or any other these others which elicit the same kind of response) but merely indicates yet again that a sense of proportion seems to elude a frightening number of people. Perhaps I am being too much of the buttoned-up Brit, but such extremes do nothing but gradually and surely devalue the credibility of contributors. In this reviewer's humble opinion Good Will Hunting has one or two forgivable flaws, but is overall an entertaining success. I suppose almost everyone here will know that back story of how two childhood friends and aspiring actors, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, were so fed up with getting nothing but bit gigs that they decided to write their own screenplay. In fact, their determination was such that once their agent had finally managed to find a buyer, they turned him down when they realised they would not have the degree of control over the production they wanted. And judging by what was finally made, they were right to hold out as they did. It would be easier to list what I regard as the few flaws first as they are minor and can be easily overlooked in what is otherwise an entertaining and often moving story. Damon is the tearaway from South Boston who is ? this we have to accept as no proof is given ? a mathematical genius with a photographic memory but who as an orphan who was regularly beaten by his stepfather finds it impossible to let go and allow someone to get close, in short who has a lamentably low self-esteem. Affleck is one of three childhood buddies with whom Damon likes nothing better than hanging out, getting drunk and getting into trouble with the police. Then there is Stellan Skarsgard as an MIT mathematics professor who discovers Damon's gift and tries to help him, in the process enlisting a college friend, Robin Williams's counsellor who can relate to Damon in that he has never been able to come to terms with the death from cancer of his wife several years earlier. The story is, in fact, quite simple: Williams does, in fact, finally manage to break through Damon's shell and Damon comes good. My slight gripe is that is is all a little glib, a little easy, a little like a textbook. In the real world the Damon character might be expected to be far more of a loner and far less sociable than he is portrayed. And Williams's success in getting through to Damon seems to encounter no setbacks ? well, one ever so slight one ? before Damon is 'healed' and takes off to claim the love of a good woman who also tried to help him. Given how entertaining the film is and, as I say, even quite moving, my gripes are perhaps a little harsh, for there is a great deal which is outstanding. Even though Damon and Affleck wrote the script, this is in no way a vanity project and it feel more like an ensemble production than anything else. Damon makes his character likable and sympathetic, and you root for him to come good (as, this being Hollywood, you always know he will). Williams shows once again that beneath the manic clown is a rather good actor (he was especially good with Al Pacino in the remake of Insomnia), and he, too, convinces as the psychologist (I think) who gains as much from his encounter with Damon as Damon does. Good Will Hunting is more than credible and the subsequent success of Damon and Affleck (and Casey Affleck, Ben's brother who plays another of the gang) shows this was no flash in the pan. From me it gets a seven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-made rather than a well-filled head ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among the cinematic characters that I immediately identified with, there is  Good Will Hunting , though I'm not fortunate enough to be gifted with the same intelligence ... BUT I know how it feels not to exploit one's own talents for his personal life and constantly try to find excuses for that.The story is probably one of the most inspiring and best written scripts from the last two decades, and to think that Matt Damon is the co-writer, with his childhood friend, Ben Affleck ? they both played best buddies in the film- makes it even more realistic and inspiring. In fact, there is something that always works in the stories where the screenwriter and the lead actor are the same, take "Citizen Kane", "The Great Dictator", "Rocky", "Sling Blade" or the vast majority of Woody Allen's films, the character is written and played by the same actor, he's his own mind, and own body, there is an authentic feeling as if the man doesn't even play. The script is personal, and the film is only an excuse to transcend something personal into a biggest project that would create a wider appeal. And I would never say enough how "Good Will Hunting" appealed to me.The story, is about a kid, a tough kid, an extremely intelligent tough kid who grew in South Boston and lived the kind of childhood that could have been laughably clich had the movie been handled by a bad director or editor. But the revelations of his past go so smoothly that Will Hunting, despite his good intentions, appears more like an arrogant prick than a victim, and THIS is interesting. To depict him as a victim would have considerably changed the value of his gift, it would have been the solution of his problems while in fact, it works like a double-edged sword. Will has an extraordinary power of abstraction, or memorization, of understanding that he can solve the toughest Maths problems, can speak of History, Geography, Politics, Economics, Philosophy, like you'd speak about the one thing that passionate you the most, and he probably knows better than you even in that field. Basically, Will makes you feel dumb, or useless, or unable to use your own knowledge. Even the professor Gerald Lambeau, who'll try to find a future for Will, ends up like a Salieri recognizing his worthless value compared to Will, the Mozart of Mathematics.But the key of the story is to understand the reasons of Will's behavior, which obviously would lead him to a dead-end. When you think about it, his intelligence saved him from jail, which allowed him to know his girlfriend. Speaking of her, let's get back to the scene where they meet. The scene is probably one of the most memorable cinematic "ownage" where Will avenges his best friend who was victim of a literally intellectual bullying by an arrogant Harvard prick. Will puts him in his place with the idea that it doesn't takes studies to be intelligent, it takes enough curiosity to learn more than what we're intended to and then try to put that knowledge into perspective. An excellent lesson about how to use our intelligence. But then something ambiguous happens, when Will meets his therapist, Sean Maguire, Robin Williams in a quite perfect performance. Will acts with him exactly the same way the Harvard boy did, using his knowledge to try to push him down. But instead of being upset, Sean feels the potential of Will and a nice retort for the next meeting. "Do you think I would understand how it feels to be an orphan because I read Oliver twist?" Will knows, but his knowledge is theoretical, there's the tragic feeling of emptiness governing his life. Life is about guts, heart, emotions, and Sean, animated by a growing fatherly love, will try to open Will's heart, so he can give his life a meaning as Sean obviously found something in Will, to get out from his self-pitied widow condition, a man lost in his memories with no better future.Will Hunting is not a bad guy, as implies the title's adjective. But he fears rejection, and hangs out with the same group which work like an indirect carapace. He's certainly not incapable of being friendly, in love or having fun, but as soon as things go serious, he becomes defensive. The movie provides a fascinating character study in the real sense of the world, we are put in the shoes of a psychiatrist and try to understand Sean's motives, and why Will is such a hard nut to crack. It's an intelligent movie about intelligence, and that respects our intelligence, and more than that, the intelligence of the film is carried by an excellent script that brings so many moments of verbal delights. Will's speeches are priceless; it's like reciting a whole book, with coherence and inspiration. And the films question our visions of intelligence : for Lambeau, it's Excellence, for Maguire, it's Happiness. The inspiring message of the film, is that Will Hunting can reconcile between both. Inspiring is indeed a word that rhymes with "Good Will Hunting". And I think Minnie Driver deserves a mention as the one who drove the heart element of the film, as Skylar ?why did they had to name her like that anyway-, who had such a genuine feeling, I thought her romance and break-up created another authentic dimension in Will's multi-layered personality."Good Will Hunting" is an exploration into the complexities of human relationships, and on a self-reflexive approach, the conclusion of the film is like a mathematical problem finally solved, but human relationships is not an exact science you know, so maybe, I say maybe, happiness is a little more important than excellence ? as the French author, Michel de Montaigne, said once : "a well-made rather than a well-filled head."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wasn't a very common name to Hollywood in the 90s. They only came in 'average' films that nobody cared about. Fortunately, they won respect from everyone after this film came out...Getting to my 'review', this film is literally brilliant, dashingly shot, brilliant acted, warmly directed, and profoundly written. Damon and Affleck truly mesmerized me in the film. The acting was great; Damon, Affleck, Williams, Driver, and Sk?rsgard were all perfect.The script was true and understandable, because of the literal and profound combinations of powerfulness. The 'young' men deserved their Academy Award for their script...As for the Academy Awards (themselves) for a disappointment. Titanic didn't deserve what it got, (especially Best Picture). All the films were simply ruled out, with this one only winning TWO! Williams and Damon/Affleck went home with grins, but the WHOLE cast should have...Other than that, this film is outstanding in every way and shouldn't be missed by older teens and adults alike. The strong message in the end was out-rightly plausible and touching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deserved the Oscar for their wonderful screenplay, especially when you consider how young they were when they wrote it. They created a simple story that wonderfully illustrates how wounded a soul can get. I love how they show how people are introduced into a life that gives them an opportunity for help. Robin Williams does a wonderful job and thoroughly deserved his Oscar. The scene where he gets Matt Damon's character to breakthrough and come face to face with what the root of his problem is is wonderful, and I cry every time I see it. I also love the scene where Matt Damon's character's instincts are shown when he quietly watches when his friend, Ben Affleck's character, tries to pick up Minnie Driver's character. Matt Damon's character quickly realizes that his friend has walked into territory where he is out of his league, and I love when he jumps in and shows his loyalty to his friend and completely embarrasses the arrogant guy from Harvard. In any event, a great film and very well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Hunting (Matt Damon) has a gift in mathematics; however, he has had struggles growing up as an orphan. He struggles to find a purpose in his life. Hanging around with his friends Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), Morgan O'Malley (Casey Affleck), and Billy McBride (Cole Hauser) and going to clubs after work are the norm for Will and his pals. Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsguard) works at the local university where Will is employed as a custodian. Professor Lambeau gets a sense of Will's gift when a question he has posted on a board outside of his classroom mysteriously becomes solved by someone outside of his class. Will, is in fact the one that has been providing the solutions. After a run-in with the law, Professor Lambeau, wants to give Will a chance to use his skills. Professor Lambeau, being a mathematician himself, takes on the responsibility of Will and posts bail for him. The only conditions for Will are to assist Professor Lambeau in the math area and Will must meet with a psychiatrist on a weekly basis. The psychiatrist, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), takes on the task of counseling Will when no other counselors could seem to accomplish the task.Will meets with Sean Maguire and demonstrates his intelligence by testing the doctor of his thinking. Matt Damon displays excellent acting skills, along with Robin Williams when they meet in their sessions. Their sessions evolve into a great friendship of trust and love. Will was abused by his foster father and relates to Dr. Maguire as he was also abused by his father.Professor Lambeau's main goal with Will is to find him employment where he may use his amazing mathematic skills. He wants Will to have what he could not have because his mathematic skills are not so amazing. Will makes fun of the Professor's attempts throughout the movie in setting up various employment opportunities. The Professor and Dr. Maguire have words because Dr. Maguire feels that Professor Lambeau is trying to decide Will's life for him.Will also meets a girl, Skylar (Minnie Driver), who he falls in love with, but given his past he has a hard time remaining in the relationship because he is afraid to be committed to someone.This movie is very well written and directed. It has humor, love, and friendship all combined into one. The music is fitting and the scene angles vary from subjective to objective. There is closeness exhibited in the scene where Dr. Maguire and Will meet for the first time. The scene is very intense. There is also use of a high-angle shot during the intimate scene with Will and his girlfriend, Skylar. A viewer must watch the film to see if Will finds his purpose in life?will he go after the girl? Will he pursue the employment that Professor Lambaugh sets up for him? Or will he continue his everyday usual events of hanging out with his pals?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional and humorous real life picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A university professor seeks to help a mathematical genius who has had problems with the law and on his release, Will Hunting (Damon) must agree to see a psychologist.Opening with a colourful slow moving montage of a long haired Matt Damon scribbling maths equations on his mirror, we are instantly engaged into a strong psychological drama that will make you laugh, cry and be enticed into a world of intelligence.This splendid picture, almost 13 years old now, has lost none of its relevance in real world story telling. Written by Damon and Ben Affleck, the two dive deep into the world of a man with personal problems whilst being mathematically gifted, much to his disappointment. The two friends picked up an Oscar for their best original screenplay and over the course of 1997 it seems this was the most refreshing and hit the drama harder than most. Had it not been for a bravado OCD suffering portrayal by Jack Nicholson then Damon would surely have been a certain for the best actor.Robin Williams managed to scoop best actor in a supporting role and his power of intelligence to read people in his role is staggering. His ability to conform to the form and thoughts of a psychologist is a brilliant execution of using his job and his own personal experience to associate with the troublesome Will. Certain improvisations such as the little secrets about his wife and the story about the baseball game are all little revelations, all sweet real life stories that we as viewers are able to associate with and because of these inclusions we can sit and enjoy the high power of the drama but chill and laugh along in some of the light hearted sequences.This film's ability to conform to the comedy and drama genre is excellent whilst throwing in the odd romance ideology and scientific lexis. Minnie Driver adds a subtle intelligence to the film with her protagonist's enthusiasm but also youthful vulnerability in the face of her feelings. And again these performances by all members are so real and identifiable you feel enticed right into their personal stories and believe me this is no exaggeration. Whilst the film revolves around complex concepts such as mathematical equations, the power of labour and conditional love this can be viewed by any person and be appreciated on any level as there are great comedy sequences, the "How do you like them apples?!" to the dramatic "Its not your fault".Gus Van Sant is able to further establish his authority through basic real worldly settings, such as the sequence on the bench by the pond and the rough neighbourhood which is very good at establishing character development.My words will do this film an injustice because it is so breathtakingly forward in its approach to real world issues such as youthful violence and naivety and taking life for granted but should you watch it, you will not have your time wasted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant's finest work as a filmmaker lies in 'Good Will Hunting', an outstanding film! Written brilliantly by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, here comes a film that will rank amongst 'The Best' in years to come. Without a doubt, 1997's best film! 'Titanic' was 2nd that year, yes it was! 'Good Will Hunting' tells the story of a janitor at MIT, who is a genius at maths, all he has to do is find a right direction &amp; attitude, which he later achieves after a therapist makes him realize the true meaning of LIFE and Emotions. Now that's a Masterstoke! Some films entertain, some films enlighten, 'Good Will Hunting' caters to the latter. An Outstanding Film in all respects.Van Sant's direction is Incredible, what a freaking filmmaker! Damon and Affleck's writing is stunning, a script that has 'Magic' written all over it. Jean Yves Escoffer's Cinematography is top-notch. Pietro Scalia's Editing is perfect. Music by Danny Elfman suits the mood of the film wonderfully.Coming to the acting department, Robin Williams steals the show with a controlled &amp; powerful performance. He deserved each and every bit of the Oscar he got! Matt Damon is fantastic, playing the role of Will Hunting with mature understanding. This is his best work as an actor yet.

		<shortDescription>An amazing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is definitely one of the best I've seen. There's really nothing to dislike about it.The characters are all well-acted and interesting. Robin Williams and Minnie Driver take the crown in the well-acted department though. Especially Driver is simply fantastic in her portrayal of Skylar. From the lovable joke-teller to the empathy-inducing grief-stricken girl, it's a career-defining performance.The story itself has many layers and subplots, and delve deeply into inter-character relationships. The interaction between Will and his buddies and Skylar and McGuire, the interaction between McGuire and Lambeau... there's a lot more depth than in most movies. Combined with the excellent acting, it really makes this one one to remember and savor.The whole thing makes you think about your own life and your own choices, both past and future ones. And that on its own is enough to make it a good movie, but it's still so much more. As said in the beginning, definitely one of my all-time favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is one of the movies which has inspired me deeply. In some way or the other way this movie depicts the life of people who because of their repression defense mechanism are not able to achieve what they ought to achieve if they haven't repressed their abilities and i was instantly able to attach myself with the character of will hunting as i have myself repressed my abilities so as to run away from people's eyes. But after watching this movie i am deeply enthralled and also motivated to fight inner demons of fear in me and to emerge as a person i am and which i am ought to be .Thanks for Ben Affleck and Matt Damon to bring such a script which is so touching and a path finder for people who are making their abilities go redundant just because of some stupid psychological problem</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>typical mainstream film product</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason this movie got made, I suppose, is that Robin Williams found a role he liked and wanted to do. A few notes : (1). The type of "genius" that is portrayed here does not, to my knowledge, exist. Mathematics and the humanities emanate from two different areas in the brain, both of which are NEVER simultaneously developed to the extent indicated here. On top of that Will Hunting has what is apparently a photographic memory. AND he's very good-looking, *AND* he's a tough. Wow. This is really yet another dumbed-down Superhero movie in disguise.(2). Psychiatry is a highly complex and arcane field, as intellectually formidable as anyone could want. You can neither embrace it nor reject it wholesale. The pompous, self-deluded disdain shown by uneducated people for "shrinks" is here also shown by Will, thereby negating his supposed intellectual worthiness. Also, psychoanalytic theory ceased being at the forefront of psychotherapy decades ago. People who are still bashing Freud should really do a bit of reading.This falls into the category of 99% of films that are designed for passive viewing, and not to challenge or stimulate the viewer in any real sense. It all adds up to a big nothing ; just a bunch of oversweetened moments that will work for people who have no real mental life. The "math" here is little more than a set-prop with no real depth or detail (Disclaimer : I am an engineer). Will Hunting and his coterie of "friends" are really total dumbasses. The "girlfriend" is skin-crawlingly obnoxious, but then again men are desperate fools, so I guess he COULD endure her.The two kids who wrote this movie have never actually read a difficult book. Its a film made BY the uneducated, FOR the uneducated. If you liked this, you are a pseudo-intellectual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching HUNTING again 13 years later, I still find it a terrific effort, especially since it was written by the then-very young Damon and Affleck. A janitor (Damon) at MIT is a math whiz with serious emotional problems. A once-prominent shrink (Williams) with problems of his own is brought in to deal with the kid. Meanwhile, romance is blossoming between the janitor and a high-spirited Harvard pre-med student (Driver). The janitor's pals, a bunch of blue collar types led by Affleck, are uneasy with what's happening but always stand by this shy Einsteinian genius. Not a single false note is struck in this intense adult drama, which was well deserving its R rating for salty language and refusing to pull any punches. It was easy to see Damon would be going places, although I am not sure I could have predicted he would become become a 21st century action star. And of course his writing partner and buddy Affleck went on to greater glory in PHANTOMS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Muscular genius Matt Damon (as Will Hunting) works as a janitor at Boston's M.I.T. (the Massachusetts Institute of Technology); but, he's smarter than the professors teaching there, like Stellan Skarsgard (as Gerald Lambeau). When nobody's looking, Mr. Damon solves complex mathematic problems on Mr. Skarsgard's chalkboard. At night, he goes out carousing with Ben Affleck (as Chuckie Sullivan), a likewise handsome drinking buddy. Mr. Affleck wants best friend Damon to use his head for more than a hat-rack.Abused as a orphan, Damon likes to take his pals out to beat guys up, as a chaser. Eventually, this socio-emotional behavior lands Damon in jail. Professor Skarsgard, who has discovered Damon's a fellow intellect, sets him up on probation, with psychologist Robin Williams (as Sean Maguire). Mr. Williams asks Damon if he has a "soul mate". Damon is dating pre-med Minnie Driver (as Skylar), but has trouble committing. Can Ms. Driver, Affleck, Skarsgard, and Williams save Damon from a lifetime of janitorial eloquence? A bit snobbish, but with good reason.******** Good Will Hunting (12/2/97) Gus Van Sant ~ Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Robin Williams, Minnie Driver</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing i knew about this movie before i saw it was that it had a lot of swear words in it. I don't really care to see movies I Don't know much about but I decided to give this one a try none the less.To sum it up in a few words, I was Blown away.From the acting to The Oscar winning screenplay this movie will touch you in a truly unique way. The movie starts of with Will Hunting (Matt Damon) going through is ordinary day to day life, which is filled with hanging round with his buddies, his part time job as a janitor and brutally beating up jerks. Although is high intelligence is apparent and shown through all this you can't help but wonder whats really wrong with this troubled genius. So after the Math professor of the collage catches him solving some the impossible sums he set for his class, he decides to bail him out from prison (kicking a cop in the crouch will get you there pretty quickly no matter how smart you are). So Will is bailed only under certain conditions which are that he must attained a weekly math class with the professor and meet a psychiatrist twice a week. Although the math classes are working out well, Will is convinced the does not need a psychiatrist and makes sure that all best possible options turn tale and head out the door. Thus the professor his forced to go to his former collage room-mate for help. This is where me meet Robin Williams in his Oscar winning role of a troubled psychiatric with his own troubled past.This is where the movie lingers on and has we try do go deeper into Will thoughts we find more and more about the other people in his life whom he seems to have a profound effect on. Something people will notice is how Will's problems in his life are not so much different than ours and with Gus Van Sant's brilliantly simply direction it is shown with more heart than you can handle. As Will goes through problems with his love life, his past and what his future hold for him, we realize his life his a potential that all our lives should be. Apart from this each character is superbly distinguished as each play a different role in Will's life which is one of the many fine touches of the screenplay. This movie is almost all dialogue and the dialogue is pretty heavy most times thus not making it appealing to everyone's taste (which movie really is) but I highly recommend it as it one of the few movies that by the end of it you'll either smile or cry because you will look back at your life in truly different way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Title Really Sums it Up (In a Dreadful Way)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm one of the few people not crazy about this movie. I always have this problem with older, iconic movies. It feels like I've seen this type of thing better before, but I'm never sure if that is because this movie started it. In the case of Good Will Hunting, it's kind of old, but not old enough to create the old clichs.This is the story of a young, genius janitor, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who has issues. Growing up in south Boston is hard and all that, and Will was given a gift he didn't ask for, and a life that he's unnecessarily proud of. His little reality is shaken when he meets a psychologist (Robin Williams) who matches his life, and a woman (Minnie Driver) who matches his wit. And you get the dreadfully punny title, Good Will Hunting.Maybe it's the pun that gets me off to a horrible start. The screenplay doesn't make me feel much better. It is filled with clichs. It seemed like every little life lesson was spelled out for you, as if you couldn't be trusted to distill it from the movie yourself. Every little thing Robin Williams says feels like a ridiculous monologue by an amateur. Which really is what this is. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote the screenplay, their first. I really have no idea why it won best screenplay at the Oscars.The acting is very good, however. Ben Affleck isn't always convincing, but he's got that whole look and atmosphere of a hometown boy. Minnie Driver is spectacular. She really captures the emotional turmoil her character is put through. Gus Van Sant directed this film, and despite the simplistic dialogue that is put forward as the most important part of the movie, he rescues it. The silent parts are often the best, like when the boys ride back from Harvard, and soft Elliot Smith music plays. That was the first transcendental moment, and a few more follow, elevating the movie to a place it really wouldn't be otherwise. Although I had problems with the Elliot Smith-dominated sound track. Every time something was supposed to be touching, they played Elliot Smith. It was tiring and monotonous, and by the end, I could basically start singing the music before it came on.It's not a bad movie, it's just rather corny, rather predictable, rather run-of-the-mill. I suppose that the story is a bit different, and showed people something they had not seen and considered. Matt Damon's character is a bit of an enigma, a genius who shies from his gifts, and the reason why he makes sense. It's a great character study. But his "salvation" from his self-designed fate, is commercial and forced, and makes too many decisions and judgments to be really great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Performance By Damon, But The Movie As A Whole Was A Bit Of A Drag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon was great. There's no doubt about that. His performance as Will Hunting - a genius who just doesn't fit into society and ends up as a janitor at MIT instead of a student - was fabulous, and made the movie worth watching. Unfortunately I personally didn't think there was much else fabulous about this. The story was modestly interesting, and the viewer certainly does want to know what eventually happens to Will. The ending was, strangely, both appropriately and unfortunately ambiguous, as Will leaves behind an opportunity to "make it" in order to pursue love. I say "appropriately" because the lack of resolution seemed to fit with the rest of his life, and "unfortunately" because it left me with no clear knowledge of what happened to him. The movie also raises valid questions about what it means to "fit in." Will didn't, because he wasn't doing what everyone thought he should do with his life, but - on the other hand - maybe that was just Will. Do we have to fit into a preconceived notion of what we should be doing? Fair question.So, there was a lot of good stuff in the actual story. Now, I know this is a minority opinion, but I wasn't take with the rest of the cast: Steven Skarsgard as the professor who discovers Will and tries to mold him, Ben Affleck as Will's best friend from South Boston (who co-wrote the movie with Damon), Minnie Driver as Skylar - Will's burgeoning love interest, and Robin Wiliams as the counsellor who helps Will confront some of his past demons. None of them were bad, but they also didn't really grab hold of me. Frankly, I also found the movie dragged dreadfully at times and at a little over two hours was a bit too long as a result. Damon's standout performance helps this get a 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just 'good'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Good Will Hunting", written by co-stars Matt Damon &amp; Ben Affleck, tells the story of a troubled young genius (Matt Damon) who avoids jail time by agreeing to work with an MIT professor (Stellan Skarsg?rd) who sees unbounded potential in him. However, he must also meet regularly with a psychiatrist (Robin Williams) which is a situation that he greets with much resistance.The cast is well-assembled with Matt Damon delivering a fine performance which snagged him his only Oscar nomination to date. Minnie Driver, as Will's love interest, also landed an Oscar nomination. Robin Williams won his first Oscar for his role here after three previous nominations. The rest of the cast is solid, particularly the under-appreciated Stellan Skarsg?rd.Gus Van Sant's direction is well-handled, which is illustrated by the Oscar nomination that he received. Danny Elfman's Oscar-nominated score is also good, though it doesn't rely on his usual idiosyncrasies. Also worth mentioning is the soundtrack which includes some notable selections, including a handful of Elliott Smith songs, like the Oscar nominee "Miss Misery".Overall, "Good Will Hunting", despite the incredibly precious title, is a worthwhile film. Fine performances and a compelling (Oscar-winning) script combine to produce a memorable film that should be fondly remembered for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gay's view on a beautiful boy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually Good Will Hunting is one of my so-called favorite movies, about it I have too much to say, which makes me speechless every time I wanna say something about it. I love it so much and have seen it for more than 10 times. Recently I found something really interesting in this movie, which is, apart from those main ideas, also remarkable.We know Gus Van Sant is a gay and enjoyed filming gays in his early days, after which more and more people got to know and like him and he made quite a few great films not about gays. But apparently from those "straight" movies we can still see his preference. In Good Will Hunting, we see, from Sant's eyes, Matt as a pretty beautiful boy, eyes reflected by the mirror when writing on it carefully; sitting in the bus alone and looking outside the window thinking about his life; reading big books every night before sleeping in his small room; talking with Sean by the river looking at him while he's talking, shocked speechless... These all seem to me to be a gay director's view on a beautiful boy, not another boy's view, not a man's view, not a girl's view either. But don't get me wrong, it's never evil; on the contrary, it's beautiful.</fullReview>

To tell you the truth, if Matt Damon came up to me right now and told me he wanted to have sex with me, I don't know if I would be able to turn him down. And how about that Ben Affleck! I bet he wanted the title role and him and Matt were arguing over it but Mr Van Sant said no on account of he's nowhere near as hot at Matt. Oh well, enough of my babbling.

You would expect it to be more of a comedy non dramatic type of movie, but this is actually a really good dramatic movie. Also starring is the well known Robin Williams alongside Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. This really was a decent movie with an extremely well known cast. The story really sets the pace for the movie and director Gus Van Sant did a great job as he has done previously in his movies.

		<fullReview>Too much stilted dialogue and formulated diatribes, that you just can't accept as being spur of the moment conversation, totally deflate this film. The cast don't quite manage to say what you're pleading them to, then they come out with garbled nonsense.The cast have delivered some great performances, especially Robin Williams, who had little to work with. Matt Damon is also strong, as the math genius struggling to break free from the ghost of his childhood. Minnie Driver is a true natural as the English student who desperately wants to win his heart. Such a shame the poorly written characters gave these talented thesps nothing to bite into. Each player too often behaves inexplicably, thus Gus Van Sant (or whoever was directing - it is rumoured screenwriters Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had more control over proceedings than the credited director) was unable to endear us to these people.The script's noble intentions fall flat as "Good Will Hunting" turns up nothing in its search. With the exception of one or two funny scenes, the humour misses the mark too.With this pic nominated for best film, along with three other rather under par selections - "As Good as it Gets", "The Full Monty" and "L.A. Confidential", "Titanic" should clean sweep this year's Oscars.Sunday, March 14, 1998 - Knox District Centre</fullReview>

In a semi-serious way of keeping track of Erdos' impact on the field, authors are assigned "Erdos Numbers" indicating how "close" they were to Erdos. Erdos' immediate co-authors are assigned Erdos Number 1. _Their_ co-authors (numbering over 6000!) are assigned Erdos Number 2, and so on.It turns out that Matt Damon collaborated with Dan Kleitman (Erdos Number 2) while Kleitman served as technical adviser to "Good Will Hunting".

		<shortDescription>I'm pumped! Let the healing begin!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A math genius, Will, grows up in the back streets of Boston. Will has never sought any formal education and frequently gets in trouble with the law. He gets a job as a janitor at Harvard University. Between sweeping floors and cleaning toilets, he finds the time to solve extremely complicated math equations. A professor at Harvard attempts to take him under his wing and to save him from his latest prison sentence. The professor guarantees the court that Will will seek psychotherapy. After a number of therapists refuse to work with him, the professor asks an old friend to counsel Will. Enter Sean, Robin Williams, a man who also grew up in the back streets of Boston. Sean is able to relate to the troubled Will, and thus the healing begins? I adored this film when it first opened. It had a fresh, funny, emotionally-charged script. The script was written by two young writers, who had lots of potential to become the most celebrated writers in Hollywood. Instead of sticking to the writing, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon chose the easier path. They became "action" movie stars on the back of Good Will Hunting and left their writing behind. I always thought that this was a shame, that they didn't stick with writing screenplays. Because of this, I think the film lost some of its initial impact. Don't get me wrong. It is still a notable work. When most audiences watch it, they find themselves cheering Will on, as he "cuts" elitist college students down to size. The most hardened and cynical viewers will find it hard not to shed a tear, as Will confronts his past. But what really makes this film masterful is that we are not just told that Will is a Genius. He proves it in every scene. Whether you are listening to his piquant repartee with other characters or his philosophy on life, you are struck by the intelligence of his remarks. The dialogue throughout the film is exceptional. It is earthy and natural (to stay true to the background of Will's character), but it is also adept and sometimes quite, profound.In the ten years since Good Will hunting was released, Affleck and Damon have written only two other screenplays. In fact, they dropped off the writing "radar" to such a degree that rumours began to surface that William Goldman wrote the script. Goldman vehemently denies this. So it appears, for now, that Good Will Hunting may be a one-hit wonder. But I still have hope that when Affleck and Damon's action movie days are behind them, they will collaborate on one last script. And if it is half as good as Good Will Hunting, it will be a smart script with Oscar-winning potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated film that may be rendered 'classic' by the passage of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has taken me several years and many viewings of this film to finally be able to give it the review that I think it deserves, from my point of view. And the very fact this has been a laboured decision has probably been a good thing. Very few of my favourite films have been ones that I can sit down and review right away. They're usually so profound I have to experience them at different points in my life and at every turn, be amazed and vindicated by them.Good Will Hunting is no different.I want to start with my favourite aspect of the picture: the script. The script is by my definition completely sublime. It moves seamlessly from group dialogue, to one-on-one revelatory back and forth dialogue, to some of the all time best monologues I've ever heard. The monologue, so long associated with the diatribe of a supervillian in action films, is given new meaning here. The script manages to touch upon the many facets of human existence and reaction without sounding contrived or clichd. If Damon and Affleck never write another script, never mind. This is one that defies all expectation. There is strong, believable character development throughout. At the moment I empathise with Will; young, ambitious, cocky and uncertain. I expect as I grow older, I will tend to empathise more with Shaun; experienced, intellectual and with an enduring 'down but not out' attitude.This magnificent script is backed up by career defining performances. Matt Damon does a great job of the intelligent yet lost genius Will Hunting. We see that behind a defensive facade there is a fragile, talented individual making tentative steps into a potentially difficult adulthood. Ben Affleck is so good here as Will's best friend that I find it hard to believe he hasn't done anything as poignant since. As a blue-collar man with a simple philosophy (and one of the best monologues in the film, no less) he really defines and exceeds his archetype. Minnie Driver also performs wonderfully in an underrated role as Skylar - as with Affleck she is on such form that I can't believe she has not yet matched this performance. The real star turn here is of course Robin Williams, on startling form as a grieving psychologist. It's hard to describe how pivotal his role without giving away plot points. It suffices to say, it's an excellent study into character dimension.With the script and performances discussed, it must also be said that the cinematography matches the intent of both perfectly. There is a nice mix of both shallow and deep focus shots, interesting and not overstated use of colour when contrasting both in and outdoor scenes and many other pleasing touches a more astute eye than mine will be able to identify. The film is also underpinned by a moving never obtrusive soundtrack; I was delighted to hear Elliott Smith featuring no less than three times.To summarise without drifting into unending hyperbole, yes this film require some suspension of disbelief. If you are particularly gifted in the field that Will is purported to be a genius in, you may have a hard time. Even I identified some of the problems he faces as simplistic. I believe this course of action is taken to prevent alienation of the audience - a complex discussion of the intricacies of advanced mathematics would stiffen the pace and be besides the point. The film is about the journey of the protagonist; how a precarious genius might perceive the world around him or her in such a different way as to make social interaction difficult. It paints such a great picture that I feel that here is an underrated film that should be rendered 'classic' by the passage of time.Here's hoping! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't that deep- quite entertaining though, as I usually like movies about an exceptionally talented character, featuring some mindgames, or situations where the character makes use of his "powers". Yet the sentimental issues the script was struggling to make Will's character more complex with, were just too artificial. I mean you have this boy, great at everything, and then he's voluntarily living his life like a loser, so that he can stay faithful to his friends? And at the end -he goes after his girlfriend, wow, like that's something really deep. In fact, I don't usually make much of a philosophy about movies; in this case there are some interesting ideas, like the one that no matter how much knowledge you acquire, that can't equal true experience, but 1. they're not really new or original, just OK and 2. they are generally connected to Will as a genius, an ultimately unrealistic situation. So as I said, it's cool to watch, but not that thoughtful as it probably aims to be. One last thing- a little goof which made me feel really awkward about the seriousness of the movie makers. I stopped the tape to see the problem written on the board in the hallway- and it took me about 10-15 seconds to solve it. It was hilarious- the problem was to write a simple 3*3 matrix and do some of the most basic, basic operations with it. Not even a problem, an easy exercise- for a 10 year old. And the second problem- I didn't even have to stop the tape there, I mean come on- a problem on which the whole crew of the professor worked for 2 years-2 years!!!- how on earth could be possibly solved with a couple of drawings?? and not a single mathematical symbol?? A couple of simple graphs, that was all. This was so embarrassing it made me seriously reconsider my appreciation of the movie. Not that it is significant- but how hard can it be to get a real mathematical problem-not the the prime-number-formula but Anything which cannot be solved within seconds, and barely Looks like a problem. Not to mention that after this episode any praise of Will's talents was kind of feeling stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film that provokes viewers to watch again and again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Good Will Hunting" is a terrific film that ticks all the boxes of what a great film should possess; great dialogue, original story, fantastic acting and also conveys true inspiration.Possible Spoilers The story is based around Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a janitor at one of the most prestigious schools in the world for mathematics, but with one catch - he is a genius. We follow Will through obstacles such as learning to trust and overcoming his fears of abandonment, with Ben Affleck playing Chuck, his best friend, as well as Casey Affleck, Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsg?rd delivering great performances, you will want to watch this film again and again. With great lines such as "Well I got her number, how do ya like them apples?" and "I gotta see about a girl", at the films conclusion the viewer will be left with a feeling of inspiration and accomplishment. This film deservedly won two Oscars and deserves all of the hype it has received. Go and see it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Inspirational Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is about inspiration. Its about the "good" before "will hunting" which says every man is good, and he has got his history, and its all about bringing that "good" from a human being. Its about the connection between teacher and student, doctor and patient, father and son. 10/10.This story is kinda mystery, the more it unfolds the more it leaves for you to see and imagine. I liked the way it started, u know kids fighting and drinking and wooing girls blah blah, but it takes u for a ride when Robin Williams, which I felt was the best puller of the movie, comes into picture. Not surprising that he appears first while listing the cast, even though he appears among the lasts actually in the movie.Its about relationships. Its about friendship between Will and Chuckie. Its about love between Skylar and Will. Gerald and Sean are old friends, though they fight over silly principles and beliefs. Its about those fights. Will had no future before he met a mentor like Sean. Its about that bond. When Sean says "Good Luck, Son!", it means the depth of that teacher-student relationship.Everyone of the cast has done their jobs beautifully. Matt as Will is like a true brat, but smart, genius at the same time. Ben is wonderful. Wish everyone has a friend like him. Skylar is a smart girl, at the same time longing for love. She is beautiful too. Gerald the professor is really good in all of his work. Of course reminds me of college days. But the person who steals the show is Sean, played by Robin Williams. I liked him so much that I read a lot about him, probably I would check out his other movies too.All this tells u is "We have got answers for every damn question in others life, but what is more important is to get answers for those questions, when Its My Life!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basic drama writing at its very best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Hunting is a troubled young man who spends his free time hanging around bars and cleaning the floors of a university. However, Will isn't a typical youngster as he has unbelievable mathematic abilities and an outstanding photographic memory. Will soon gets into trouble but a professor who's seen what he's capable of makes a proposition which includes Will to see a psychiatrist. A psychiatrist after another refuses to see Will anymore as he's so uncooperative. Will eventually meets his match, a psychiatrist Sean McGuire, who finally makes Will to open up his mind and think about what he wants to do with his life."Good Will Hunting" is a feel good movie. Though it is kind of a basic drama, it is still drama at its best. This is really what the drama -genre should be, as the film doesn't really go into other genres at all, it follows the pattern of a great drama, but it somehow manages to be surprisingly good. The story's interesting, though it isn't that unique after all, but it captures your attention right from the start. It's just something that's easy for your eyes and it's a real pleasure to watch. You don't feel stressed at any part of the film, every scene matters and there isn't anything unnecessary anywhere. Screenplay's written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and it is indeed very well written and you can really see where they were heading at with it. It hasn't really got any amazing twists and turns, it's just brilliant on its own. I'd like to see Damon and Affleck collaborate some more in the future, as this is what a true drama is really, and after all, about.The film also includes great role performances, so that may be one of the reasons why it's also so surprisingly good. Matt Damon is great as Will Hunting, the main character. Stellan Skarsg?rd is perfect for the role of the professor Gerald Lambeau and his role performance is solid. Ben Affleck also does his job flawlessly, and I really think he is in fact a good actor but people just don't seem to get it because of what movies he's been in in the past. He doesn't get the chance of a perfect role for him, but hopefully that will also change in the near future. Just stop slaying the guy and let's see how far can he really go. Minnie Driver fits for the role of Skylar, the girlfriend of Will Hunting, and she has an incredible chemistry with Damon. All of the scenes where they are with each other are really strong and powerful, you can really see or sense these sincere emotions between them. Those scenes really speak for themselves and what is true drama acting at its best, as there happens the unquestionable and respected tearing away the actor from the character itself, which makes it seem like there is no acting involved at all. That's just how real it feels and looks like.Despite that, that is not the best thing the film has to offer, as there is one actor above everyone else and that is Robin Williams, who's in the supporting role of the psychiatrist Sean McGuire. Williams is pure excellence, he's just absolute perfection and without a doubt the best thing you see in the entire film. McGuire is also a man with a troubled past, so the characters of Sean McGuire and Will Hunting find something in common, which firstly leads to an odd friendship, but then transforms itself into a true beauty where the word "friendship" gets a whole new meaning. The dialog between Williams and Damon is fantastic, being sometimes hilarious yet being smart and clever all of the time. Robin Williams even won an Academy Award from this devotion to the character, IE the best actor in the supporting role, which is a more than a deserved win. Overall I must say that the film shines with magnificent actors in the right roles, so the casting did pretty much a flawless job.Although "Good Will Hunting" is also, as mentioned, hilarious at some points it's also very dramatic, so it slightly mixes up drama with comedy, although maintaining the main perspective in the drama -genre. It's definitely worth a watch after all. Movies like these with this kind of a special flow, which means you don't want it to end but you want it move along as well as it is just so entertaining all the time, don't come out too often. You just can't wait what will happen next. Directing is done by Gus Van Sant, who I think hasn't really done anything that amazing before or after "Good Will Hunting". Yes, the directing is great, but you can't really direct a bad movie if the screenplay's this good. Damon and Affleck even won an Academy Award from it, so question is why not write something together in the near future? The Academy Award really speaks for itself, ensuring the fact that writing together again would be a good idea. It would probably be worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cant stop to wonder why it is that so many people like to relate a movie (meaning = entertainment) to real life. people, that is not what movies are for, those things are called Documentaries and the 8 o clock news. Movies are for entertainment, and so is Good Will hunting.It is meant to make you feel something, and fortunately for us, everybody feels different after seeing this movie, great! but to go as far as saying: its putting janitors in a bad daylight, and they didn't wrote the script, its not historically correct, etc, etc, and then giving this movie a 1 score, is saying more about you then this movie in itself.If you did not like this movie, because you have a different taste, or just did not liked the story, great, please do rate this movie low(er), but you cannot hide the feeling you got from this movie, be it goosebumps, anger, sleep or whatever. that is at least something. I have seen a lot of movies where I did not felt anything afterwards, now that means the movie was bad! Skylar and Will play great together. I can totally feel the fun the had in the beginning of their relationship. The tight friendship with his friends is totally heartwarming, and Robbin Williams really felt like a good, soft man to me.I smiled, swallowed, cried, laughed and busted my gut on this movie. sure, the story could be better, but the feeling i got from it not.I know the jokes inside out in this movie, and still, when I watch this movie, I laugh.. that alone is worth a 10 to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Again, like "Midnight Run" this movie is dented with bad language. Yes, maybe people like these guys do use the F word every time they exhale, but then again, I think it's a stereotype. I mean, where's the lobby for foster-kids-on-their-own? I resent the stereotype that poor "Southie" kids are vile, that they can't speak without that word. It's far overdone.I like the story. I do like the fun concept of an underdog gone good. I like someone who can out-brain the brains; but I agree that Matt Damon does not have the persona to pull it off. Ben Affleck would have been a better choice. I think Damon was chosen as the main star because he is less handsome and charismatic than Affleck. They wanted to get Damon in the door of public awareness first.Oh well. It's a fun movie if you can tune out the words. Robin Williams has perfect timing in his interactions with Will. The baseball scene is wonderful. All in all, a good film; too bad the language hurt it.</fullReview>

A must see for any fan of classics or modern excellence. The cast was superb, and I particularly enjoyed the interaction between Will Hunting and his friends. Very true to form, and full of real dialogue and overall interaction (that makes you feel you are a fly on the wall). Minnie Driver was a "knock out" and her acting was perfect for the role and mood of the film. Finally, Robin Williams added stability and a real sense of humility to the film to ground it fully in the pit of your heart and stomach. What else can I say? A film you can watch over and over again - repeat the lines, and still go back for more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Script, Brilliant, the wonder-boys, Ben and Matt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was just starting to write stories, scripts, in my spare time. I wanted to get the form down, so for me, just writing was an exercise in itself. I was putting together a rather simple, down and out story nothing special. Writing in early 97'. I had heard a story on how Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had put this script together and had 'shopped' it all over Hollywood and were both kind of ready to sell it, even for a 'piece of chicken' (Jokingly they said in an interview) but they were sort of at their wits'-end when....- it finally happened.Then, look what happened...2 Oscars, 16 other awards and 34 nominations on top of that! Why? Two reasons I can find. First off, they did not give up, or give in to the temptation to finally quit. The other, and this is just a 'shot in the dark' but, the movie was victorious. No, arguments can truly take solid ground against the film, other than yes, they had an affinity for the 'F'-word. These 'Southies' were really playing the 'streeters' of Boston to steely perfection. They were who they set out to be in their writing. I was amazed, this story touched deeply. they showed the struggle and the belief in and they all sort of had a love for their 'Brilliant' janitor friend, knowing that he is destined for more than they were going to encounter in life. And they still stood up for him and with him on everything from street fights to getting him in the end to embrace what he needed to do and follow and not fear the great task ahead of him. The biggest thing for me in this story is the element of distrust, that came from Matt's Character. He was abused by his dad and through that impact that started the massive down-slide (avalanche) of destructive behavior and thoughts of uselessness in himself. He was almost brought to a place that he might not return, as he didn't feel that he could love or give anything to Skyler, because he was scared of love itself. What should have been there at his childhood home (love) was abandoned to an evil overlord that was nothing more than a 'liability' to his life and personal growth. His biological father became a 'bully' worse than any kid at school on the playground. They even brought back some classic seventies tunes that I had forgotten for years, I enjoyed the way that they, placed the music in the different sequences, it was just right. To boot, Matt's character needs to keep the !! Skylar loved him, and he would eventually learn to love other than what he had known before, new and more openly. When the movie ended I was no less than blown away. As a matter of fact I got scared. I was so intimidated, that I stopped writing. Than I heard about the Oscar wins. Robin's first I think it was. And the other wins and nominations and I thought, after a while later, if I quit, I may miss having something to offer to my friends and family, maybe even this country. So I looked at their example and remembered what I took away from the movie and put it back together again for myself. This one is an inspiration all around. This was a winner through and through! It may have been crass and vulgar and just slightly violent, but that just identified the plot of the story as it got going.They deserved every award that they received. This goes beyond just movie for me, it's not as some have been merely entertainment, but it strikes me like life does sometimes, even when God wants to get through to us. We just need to listen and then do the 'right' thing. But we have to follow through for anything good to happened. I recommend this Gus Van Sant, directed and gifted film highly.

		<fullReview>This is the perfect example of the old saying "never judge a book by its cover". I've never been a Ben Affleck fan but I've always had a soft spot for Matt Damon but i wouldn't give Gus Van Sant the time of day, so i was hesitant in hiring this.Good Will Hunting is a fantastic film. Its beautifully written (by Matt and Ben), the performances are amazing to say the least (Matt Damon and Robin Williams both give the performances of their career) and, dare i say it, Gus Van Sants direction is worth the price of the admission ticket alone.Good Will Hunting s a film about a young Boston boy Will Hunting (no surprises there). Will is a genius. He has a photographic memory and he can solve mathematical problems the prize wining mathematicians can not. But Wills very hot headed. Aside from being a genius he also enjoys brawling and getting drunk every night (but who doesn't?). When he faces possible jail time hes sent to see a psychiatrist (Compellingly brilliant Robin Williams) as the tag line says, his match.This film is so smart in the way its written its almost hard to comprehend that Matt Damon and Ben Afleck actually wrote it (i have faith in Damon but Aflecks contribution is a whole other story). This film deserves all its hype and praise. Willaims deserves his rightful kudos and Damon and Affleck deserve their Oscars. But their involvement in the writing of this film will go down as one of the greatest conspiracy theories ever like JFK's assassination and Kurt Cobains "murder"."right now we feel like the Mellie Vanilli of screen writing" - Ben Affleck</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding drama, with great depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Good Will Hunting' will always remain one of my favorite movies. It has an engaging storyline, great acting, and enormous emotional depth. It's hard to believe Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were young college students when they conceived of this complex story.The story is about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a troubled young man who is working as a night janitor at Harvard University. He also happens to be a one-of-a-kind math genius, and catches the attention of award-winning math professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) as he begins solving difficult math problems left on the blackboard.Will, however, has no interest in pursuing a prestigious career in mathematics. He only reluctantly agrees to hold private lessons with the professor, being the only way to get out of jail after a spate of violence lands him there. Part of his parole deal, however, is to meet with a therapist twice a week. After getting a couple of shrinks to give up on him, Will finally lands with psychology teacher Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) who has a similar background as Wills', hailing from the same tough neighborhood in south Boston.As Sean tries to get through to Will emotionally, the professor tries to train Will's mind in advanced mathematics. All the while, Will, who has had trouble maintaining a loving relationships due to his troubled past, begins to get seriously involved with a girl named Skylar (Minnie Driver). Meanwhile, the professor and the psychiatrist, who've had a rivalry of sorts back in their day, begin to quibble over what's best for Will's future.Filled with great profound dialogs and intense emotional scenes, it's an immense emotional experience. It obviously has very 'heavy' subject-matter, and thus not an easy light watch, but it is very rewarding and entertains throughout.It's also a great buy because you will need repeated viewings to appreciate all its subtleties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone raved about 'Good Will Hunting' when it came out. At the time all I could do was roll my eyes and say, "Cmon. A movie written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Yuck!". I finally got around to seeing it about a week ago, and I have to tell you I was pleasantly surprised. 'Good Will Hunting' isn't a great Oscar-worthy movie most critics pointed it out to be, but just a very good film with some good acting performances. Matt Damon in his finest acting performance yet plays Will. Will is considered a hoodlum by some and hangs out with his buddies led by Chuckie (Ben Affleck in a so-so performance, which is very good for him). They screw around, get drunk and beat people up -- they are real 'nothings' to society. But, Will has a secret -- he's a genius. He works as a janitor at Harvard University and one day solves a "said-to-be" impossible math problem put up by the brilliant Math professor (played by Stellan Skarsgaard in a strong performance). Will then becomes the math professor's new hero and is destined for greatness, but will Will abandon his friends to better his own life? Robin Williams steals the show in an electrifying performance as Will's psychiatrist and Minnie Driver provides good acting as Will's British Harvard girlfriend. Gus Van Sant's directing is fair and the writing is pretty solid for the most part (but nothing Academy Award worthy). The bottom line is that 'Good Will Hunting' is a very good film where the good points more then out-weigh the bad points, but it's nothing spectacular. I recommend it. Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent tale of human bonding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting, a twenty year old delinquent working a dead end job as a university janitor. But Will has an extraordinary gift, he is a genius, able to rework mathematic theories and equations at the drop of a hat. With no family, he spends most of his time hanging with his best friend Chucky (Ben Affleck) and others, wasting his talents in order to get drunk and cause problems.His talents are picked up however by a university professor who takes Will on as a protg in order to keep him out of prison, but Will must also seek help from a psychiatrist. After numerous failed attempts Will is put on Sean, a shirnk with his own deep problems, mourning the loss of his beloved wife.Will falls for Skylar, a beautiful girl studying Maths. But things don't go smoothly in their relationship as she finds out about Will's past and how scared he is of getting close to people. Will has a journey to make, one that will take him through his past and re-invent him with the help of his friends and his shrink.The film deserves all the praise it got. The screenplay by Damon and Affleck is simply nothing short of stunning, with more than believable characters and situations. The dialogue is snappy, warming, harsh and fun all at the same time.Robin William's excels as Damon's shrink, taking the role by both hands and really bringing out his character that is fun, down to earth and also suffering from his own trauma. Because of this he and Will feed off one another, each learning something new about their own personality.Gus Van Sant's directing is as practical as it needs to be. No funky camera shots, no gimmicks, just straight into the action, telling the story, and that what makes a film truly great.If your type of film has to involve gun fights and loose women then steer clear, but if you are looking for a heart warming story that will touch you and perhaps make you look at your own life, then look no further, because Good Will Hunting is simply nothing short of genius.</fullReview>

But it was the stilted dialog and the superficial plot that undermined the whole idea. It took what seemed like forever for anything to happen.Worst of all was Robin Williams as the psychiatrist who finally turns Will Hunting's head around. His agent must have told him that this was a role in which he could overact to his heart's content. And the love story amounted to little more than boy loses girl, boy gets girl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My brother bought Good Will Hunting on Sunday night at Best Buy and I finally saw it last night on the big screen. All I can tell you of this fine movie was that the script was made excellently by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. They wrote the movie in a great and neat way that is extremely original. The performances and acting was terrific. Matt Damon performed his temper tantrum, genius character in a very pleasant performance that I enjoyed watching. But the best of them all, had to be academy award winner, Robin Williams. He put up the best performance I have ever seen, even over his Mrs. Doubtfire character. He definitely stole the show as an emotional and smart psychiatrist. Good job, Williams. There was a lot of funny scenes also and the movie kind of reminded me of A Beautiful Mind. There both almost very similar in ways. The negatives that I have to give for the film was that it was pretty slow at times and needed to boost up. On some of the scenes they needed more energy on it. Just got kind of boring and some of the scenes held some flaws. Overall, a pleasing Damon and Williams film that I would like to watch again soon. Great Script and Acting by lead Performances!! I recommend the film.Hedeen's Outlook: 8.5/10 ***+ B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to believe that in a single year so many outstanding and unforgettable films hit the box office, but 1997 was indeed such a year. In any other this film would have walked away with Oscars for ''Best Director'' and ''Best Picture'', but suffice it say I'm grateful that the team of B. Affleck &amp; M. Damon won for their outstanding screenplay. Damon's ''Best Actor'' nod was also well deserved and the two partners worked in tandem to play up Damon while playing down an equally strong B. Affleck (the latter shows his outstanding potential in ''Armageddon''). Most difficult this must have been, for otherwise the characters of Robin Williams and Minnie Farmer, both of whom got Oscar nods and the former who finally took home a statue, would have been lost in the shuffle. This film and its story were pure talent from start to finish, totally original and a refreshing change. Underdog over spoiled yuppie -- that's my kind of film -- and one's got to be happy for Williams who finally bagged an Oscar. Top rating (5 stars of 5) !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoy watching this film, and it is one of the very few films that I think I could get to the end of it and actually stand to go straight back to the beginning and watch it all over again.Whether it is intentional or not, this film runs far deeper than it appears to. The fact that Will (Matt Damon) is a brilliant mathematician and incredibly intelligent is not what is important, and for me it is not the drive of the film. Too many people pick at the plot holes concerning Will's "gifts" and it spoils their interpretations of the film. Will's genius is simply an intriguing aspect that provides foundations for what I think is more complexity. What this film does is embrace the fact that there is nothing more important in life than other people. Will represents a safe path, a life that so many of us choose to live because we feel comfortable. Sean (Robin Williams) and Professor Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) represent two paths out of safety and into something that is ultimately more worthwhile. Sean encourages a life encompassed by love, intimacy and experience, while Lambeau represents a life immersed entirely in intellectual achievement and the social high ground. One of these paths is, while incredibly gratifying, essentially empty, whereas the other is entirely fulfilling. This film helps us understand that we can't learn everything about life from books. Life is about the precious little experiences that are personal to us, that really matter, that touch our hearts or make us think. It is about experiencing the little imperfections in people that make them beautiful only to you. And throughout life, it is important that we follow our hearts and do what we truly want to do, and not what society expects of us.Ultimately, like so many films, Good Will Hunting is about love. But it conveys the emotion in ways that are more subtle, and beyond the boundaries of oozy sentimentality that few films bother to cross.How do I like them apples? I like them a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Feel Good film with the best script!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched it after a four year absence and thought very highly of it. I wasn't to keen at first a while back but I have matured and understood what the film was trying to get across and thought it was very clever the way they did it. Without the acting in this then their would be no Good Will Hunting and I wouldn't be reviewing this film now and the same goes for the script. This is one of Ben Affleck's good films and the same has to be said for Matt Damon but I am yet to see a bad Affleck/Damon film, then again I am the only person who hasn't seen Gigli but I will blame J.Lo for that. But the script alone is a masterpiece of writing from both of them. It has the making to make you feel bad and feel good all at the same time without breaking a sweat which brings me on to telling you another reason why I admire this so much. It doesn't stop for a second. Even though there is no big plot to follow and any suspense there is always something happening in each scene of the film which is just terrific for a film of this type. If I was to compare another film made recently to Good Will Hunting then it would be Lost in Translation. Both films have characters who are lost and are afraid and the mood of the film is very bleak if a little up lifting at times. Good Will Hunting just isn't a great drama though, it's also a great comedy as there are many funny scenes where you giggle a lot with anything from Casey Affleck trying to act hard in front of his friends or Robin Williams making funny remarks about everything that surrounds him. I did feel very emotional towards the end but also uplifted and felt good about myself. I was expecting someone to die in this as it is your typical ending for a story like this one. Though much to my delight Affleck and Damon kept there cool very well and bowed out with a more sombre end with one of the best lines in film for the last Decade said by Robin Williams when he reads the note that will left for him.Affleck and Damon have more potential than you would think and I look forward to their next pairing as I heard they were getting together to write another script after a number of box office flops. At least if they do we are pretty sure to get something special, so hurry up the both of you before people really turn against you and don't see you for the talent duo that you are.</fullReview>

Robin Williams gives one of those occasional performances that make you weep for all the wasted time spent on the likes of Flubber, while the other leads match him. For my money, it's the emotional journey of the older men that provides the best value, although Minnie Driver shines in what is easily her best ever role (well, maybe Tarzan).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing writing talents and a hard act to follow. WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is rare to find a sincerity in young writers, as most tend to focus on the anger of their generation and complaints about what could have been and how they want to make it better. One significant exception to this rule is in Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's skillful writing in GOOD WILL HUNTING, for which they won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 1997In one key sequence of GOOD WILL HUNTING, Robin Williams delivers this lengthy, but essential speech to Matt Damon's character, a juvenile delinquent who is intellectually gifted, but is prone to punch-ups with people he feels like hitting because he wants to. He regales him with the fact that no books can be a substitute for human or worldwide experience and he cannot gain any insight into Damon's character unless he opens up. If there was an Oscar for 'Best Speech', Williams would have got it in addition to the Supporting Actor nod he got that same year. GOOD WILL HUNTING is a movie that is the flipside of DEAD POETS SOCIETY, in that it focuses on the relationship between Damon and Williams, who is a psychologist and teacher haunted by the death of his wife and who himself is not able to express his feelings at time and can only focus on the needs and despair of others. Whilst POETS focused on inspiring the students, GOOD WILL HUNTING reminds us all that sometimes we are powerless in our nature to prevent sadness and despair.Ben Affleck plays Damon's friend, who works on a building site and recognizes that Will will have to leave the community he feels safe in to develop his skill and talent that has remained underground. Minnie Driver provides good support as Skylar, Will's (all too brief) girlfriend.Enlightening performances and downplayed drama help make this movie all the more effective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here I have explained the underlying ideas behind the movie (SPOILERS).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, like many others, has one or two characteristics that are quite questionable, but at the same time understandable. One of which is the possible impression that Hollywood intended to sell themselves to the general audience by taking the idea of a genius who does the unbelievable act of being cool... "Oh my, look at that! He's just as smart as Steve Urkel (another fictional genius) but he is like, so cool." If that was your take on the movie why should it be? This is where you went wrong, you compared Will Hunting to some stereotypical view of the genius. Does Will Hunting set a good example? Definitely not! He is a gigantic loser, but the message behind the movie is simple: "No matter who you are or how intelligent, we always need to look to our fellow human beings (i.e. each other) for wisdom and guidance." The movie is incredibly accurate in demonstrating how it is very possible for a genius of any caliber to lack wisdom. The movie is also heart-warming and easily delivers bundles of "goodness". Look at the way the movie concludes itself... with Robin Williams reading Will's letter saying,"Dear Shawn,If the professor calls about that job,tell him sorry,I had to go see about a girl,Will."Shawn looks up again, "Son of a bitch... he stole my line..."Scene changes to an empty highway with a beat-up old car driving on and on, inside steers Will, one of the greatest geniuses the world has ever seen, and although he has not quite gotten anywhere great in life, all the helping hands and friendships paid off, and there he is on his way to something better...The genius is the closest any human being can get to determining actions and decisions almost always without flaw, this movie united the genius with the unfortunate human beings you might see on the sidewalk when you take a stroll downtown.You can see how during the middle, before the climax of Will losing his ability to keep things inside, that one by one he loses those people who are his world and yet one by one, he shrugs off any care he has for each loss. First, Skylar, then, the Professor, then Chuckie (not really loses) who tells him basically, "I don't really want you to be around..." this comes as a shock to Will, since he always though that if he loses someone new in his life, like Skylar, he can always fall back on his best friend...and then finally Shawn, who gives Will the idea that he had enough of his 'shit' because Will spoke to Shawn with very little respect after everyone else who was important dropped from his life as if like flies. "Look at me Shawn, what the hell is the point? I lost everyone important to me, all of our sessions were a waste anyway, I might as well show you that I'm nobody you should be trying to help, so I'll test you to..."I think my explanation in the "A Beautiful Mind" forum would help you understand what makes one genius behave a certain way, and another almost the complete opposite. I mean Will Hunting is on the opposite end of the personality pole to John Nash (a non-fictional genius) and Steve Urkel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Importance of Not Being Too Earnest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is just a movie, folks, not a case study. As interested as I am in literary, historical, and sociological elements of dramatic films, I am put off by psychoanalysis or tortured deconstruction.What I liked about this one was Robin Williams' underplaying his role and Matt Damon's totally cold and rigid self-characterization -- apart from the conclusion, that is. There is a good sense of Boston as well.The premise of the story is questionable as to any sense of consistent authenticity. Antisocial behavior need not be a concomitant of genius, as other recent films about gifted but more or less detached characters seem to take for granted (as does this one). Neither are saccharine catharses inevitable. And the usually fine actor Stellan Skarsgard as the American professor with a French name and a Swedish accent seems miscast. Ben Affleck plays Ben Affleck with a passion, not unusual in a sense but hardly commendable in terms of his overblown popular persona. One wonders indeed how he figures in real life as putative co-author of this fairly decent screenplay.In short, there are some good moments and good lines -- and that is really what counts, even when the finished whole is less interesting or convincing than the finite parts. Worth seeing. 7 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What do geniuses say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good story, excellent acting - especially by Matt Damon, really outdistancing all the others - and an awakener of many thoughts. Just one thing: what do geniuses say, really?A script writer might need to be one, too, to get it right. This film leans heavily on learning, instead of wisdom, on wits instead of brilliance, on truisms instead of innovative perspectives. The actors do a great job in hiding this flaw, but there it is.The nature of the genius has been explored since the romanticism of the early 19th century - I'm not sure the idea of such blessed humans was even around, before that. Maybe such people exist, and maybe not. In most cases, they have very specialized talents. Some have perfect memory, others excel at math. That does in no way make them better equipped for rhetoric or social skills. Thus, a genius can be a real idiot, outside that special field of competence.Let's say that two brilliant persons sit down and have a very enlightened conversation with each other. What do they say? How much do they have to say? And will we, the audience, at all understand? Afore such uncertainties, succumbing to a love story finale seems to be the safe way out. But that's no stroke of genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Possible spoilers here, though there really isn't much to spoil). What can you say about a film about a janitor with some serious emotional hangups who just happens to be the smartest guy on the planet. All I can say is that it's lucky for him he has a psychiatrist who apparently only has one patient("Good" Will Hunting, get it?). "Good" Will Huting is also doubly luck that his psychiatrist with one patient is able to solve all of his problems by saying "It's not your fault"(say it repeatedly as one time only won't do the trick). This film was made for one reason only. As a launching pad for the wondertwins Matt and Ben, or Damon and Affleck if you prefer. Let us not forget that Matt and Ben not only starred in this piece but they wrote it as well. They also took home the oscar for their writing efforts. They proved to be so adept at their writing skills that they have written ten films since then(sarcasm anyone?) Robin Williams' beard gives a wonderful performance and Robin Williams' does okay himself as the doctor with one patient who helps Will overcome his problems. Just don't forget that Robert Forster and Burt Reynolds were passed up for their wonderful work in "Jackie Brown" and "Boogie Nights" so that Robin Williams' could get his "long overdue" oscar. All is not lost because the success of this film gave director Gus Van Sant the clout to desecrate Hitchcock's "Psycho".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what makes a good movie? is it the headline actors: the big stars? or is it the actors you've never seen before? the actors that you'd like to see more of. that is what Good Will Hunting is chock full of. a bunch of reletively unknown actors. Casey Affleck- to this day he is known and referred to as Ben Affleck's brother. or to my friends he is "the brother on the phone you know the one with the book in American Pie"... in Good Will Hunting, however i see his talent. he is so funny in this movie (not to mention HOTT... lol) as you watch the movie you can see the chemistry he shares with the other guys with Matt and Ben (watch the "double burger" scene for their sibling quarrels...) and Cole Hauser- he is not in the movie as much, just sitting there being quiet buying the beer. but he says one of the funniest lines in the movie (You're legally allowed to drink so we thought the best thing for you was a car)i didn't watch this movie because of hype. i didn't purchase it because Matt Damon is completely HOTT (and for the record i do think that...) i love this movie because it is all about human interaction. without chemistry, it would've been the worst movie ever. but there was a chemistry there that you can feel.if you have yet to watch this movie, i encourage you to rent it at Blockbuster or borrow it from a friend. GWH is worth your $2.99 and 2 1/2 hours. there are no sinking boats or asteroids. and nobody gets killed. this is just raw emotion, a few friends, the f- word 96 times and some beer. you don't have to agree with me, i am not a professional and (in case you want to know) i am a teeny-bopper and legally cannot even watch this movie. but see for yourself the movie that made me cry before i saw it. and the best performance you will ever be able to see by an ensamble cast of reletively unknown actors and Robin Williams. thank you all. have a great day!

		<fullReview>I saw Good Will Hunting a few months back and I found it to be brilliant.I underestimated Matt Damon but I loved this movie it was one of his best (excluding the talented mr ripley).Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting,a man in his young twenties who is rebellious and is always landing himself arrested. Will finds he has a talent for maths but is not willing to use it to his own abilities.After being arrested,a tutor from the university where he works as a janitor makes a deal with him that he can be released but has to see a shrink once a week.After visiting many shrinks he finally meet Robin Williams character who is the only one who can help Will.The two of them form a friendship and he eventually helps him through his troubles and the conclusions that are left to be drawn.Good Will Hunting is one of the greatest dramas ever made,it is about as good as it gets.It is very moving and very touching and Matt Damon does an excellent job. I would say if you loved dramas then this is the greatest. I rate 5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good quality, intelligent drama - isn't that enough?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't really understand some of the adverse comment on this film; it may not be the best ever, but it's way above average. Basically, GWH is a classic (old-fashioned, if you like) character-driven drama, based on an improbable (and therefore interesting) but by no means impossible plot. It is to be welcomed as one of a seeming minority of Hollywood films, not centred on crime or violence, and/or loaded with SFX. But neither is it a smooth-edged fairytale. Director Gus Van Sant, working to a screenplay by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, has opted for a realistic context, especially when it comes to Will's roughneck pals. One result of this is the bad language, which apparently offends some viewers. (For the later, superficially similar, Finding Forrester, set in the Bronx, Van Sant seemed to take a more cautious route.)Damon is excellent as the closet mathematical genius, Will Hunting, who prefers his delinquent lifestyle and the comradeship of his blue-collar buddies to possible academic acclaim. Once again, Robin Williams demonstrates that when cast in a grown-up role he can ditch most of his annoying mannerisms; his portrayal of Sean Maguire, a psychologist able to help others, but unable to help himself get over the death of his wife, is convincing and moving. Affleck as Will's best buddie, and Minnie Driver as Will's rich student girlfriend, have important supporting roles. Each character demonstrates a stage in what seems the main theme of the film - seeking, finding, and keeping hold of, yourself. One weak spot is that the movie doesn't bring out clearly enough the conflict between Will's "discoverer" Prof Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) and Maguire. Lambeau wants Will to gain fame and fortune for the benefit of science (and his own kudos); Maguire is more interested in Will making his own choice, whatever that is. Those who think the film has a neat, happy ending should consider how Lambeau and Maguire will each view Will's action.  </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching this when it first came out on video. My uncle said he wasn't sure if I should watch it due to the excessive amount of bad language. But my Mom told him it was alright (my fav. movie is Pulp Fiction, I think I cand handle this). So I watched it and loved it. A couple months later Blockbuster had it on sale for two dollars, so I bought it. I watched it again and loved it even more than the first time. So it seems everytime I watch it I love it more than the last time. For one, the acting. Matt Dillon and Ben Affleck were very good and seemed very comfortable with the roles they were in. Robin Williams deserved his Oscar, it is always nice to see him doing something heartfelt, showing that he is a true actor, not just a clown. Minnie Driver was very good also. All of the roles seemed well written. The writing of the film is perfection. It allows us tp feel sorry for someone who could seem very unforgiving for all the pain he brings people. Also, it allows us to see both sides of the story. I sympathized with Will, I think if he didn't want to "Explain things to people my whole life" then that is what he wants and should be aloud to do what he wants. I also understood where the professor was coming from, he just didn't want to see Will throw his life away. It is a very good film and I recomend it to all. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once in awhile a movie comes along that truly is special. What makes a movie special? Is it the "special" effects? Not usually. For me, I want a movie with exceptional acting, a good story, a tight screenplay, and creative directing. But, above all else I want good old fashioned wonderfully written dialogue between believable characters that I can relate to and learn from. This is what I think separates descent movies from the really special ones. This is what enables me to really submerge myself into the story. Everyone has certain movies that they can watch over and over and never get tired of. Good Will Hunting is one of those movies that I find to get better each time I watch it.This movie is filled with fabulous stimulating dialogue between interesting, yet real-to-life characters. Matt Damon gives one of my favorite performances on film to date. He portrays Will Hunting, a genius whose tough on the outside but scared on the inside personality will keep him from finding true happiness or realizing his full potential until he is able to escape his past and learn how to trust again. Robin Williams also gives an outstanding performance as the shrink who tries to help him do that, and learns a little bit about life himself. If you just took the scenes between these two characters to make this movie it would have still been excellent. But this movie has so much more to offer. There is the relationship with Skylar, played by Minnie Driver who has everything Will has ever looked for in a girl. There are his buddies who he has grown up with his whole life, including his best friend Chuckie, played by Ben Affleck. There is Professor Lambeau, played by Stellan Skarsgard, who is one of the smartest mathematicians in the world, and yet his knowledge and ability does not even compare to young Will Hunting.All of this adds up to one of the most entertaining and thought provoking movies out there. There are life lessons to be learned and cinematic brilliance to be enjoyed with this one. One of the best ever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well acted and written film. However, it follows in a long tradition in Western culture of romanticizing white-trash. The recipe is usually the same. Take a working class loser, make him very handsome, brave, charming, and extremely intelligent, then contrast him against well educated people who are shown to be sexually frustrated, neurotic, and otherwise unhappy, and you create a white-trash hero. "Good Will Hunting" plays this game very effectively. By the end of the film it has you believing the classic lie that education is unnecessary and all that matters in life is that you get the girl. Still, a good film at what it tries to do. However, one should watch an episode of Jerry Springer after seeing this film to remember what uneducated white-trash are really like.</fullReview>

Even though there were some slow parts, I recommend this for anyone, and once again, GOOD WILL HUNTING deserved the Oscar for Best Picture even more than did Titanic. Go see this, NOW! Its a 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Often, when a Robin Williams character is the most palatable feature of a film, the film may be avoided and the filmgoer's admission may be saved and the filmgoer may enjoy $7.00 worth of candy and cake (There are exceptions - "Dead Poets'" is one, of course). Good Will Hunting doubtlessly sold lots of issues of Teen People magazine - but it also kept a lot of good filmgoers from enjoying a lot of good candy and cake.-That's what I think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting story line about a young man with violent tendancies that is a genius at solving mathematical proofs and anything else he cares to lend a hand at. The genius (Will Hunting) is played by Matt Damon, who is a newcomer to me and I must say he has a strong screen presence - his acting was first class. Robin Williams plays the psychiatrist that tries to get to the bottom of Will's problems. Will is so intelligent that in the discussions with the psychiatrist it is more often the psychiatrist's life that is put in question. Although I enjoyed the film, it was slow at times and the ending, although emotional, was a little understated. Fine acting makes this film worth watching but be warned there are a lot of 4-letter words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with the last reviewer; the F word was used in about every other sentence. I ended up muting 3/4 of the movie so I wouldn't have to hear all that foul language. Which is too bad because this movie had real promise, then fell flat. I was disappointed when I saw the movie; it was nowhere near as good as I'd hoped. Robin Williams, though, was phenomenal and stole the movie away from Damon and Affleck. I was happy that he won the Supporting Actor Oscar. He was the only bright spot of this overrated movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching and great drama written and played by two young and talented young stars!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Hunting is a rebellious and resentful adolescent, who likes to always be in his friends' company, drinking beer, beating Harvard's boys and knowing girls. What makes Hunting different from the other youths of his age, besides the money and his behavior's problems,is that the boy is owner of a brilliant intelligence, what makes him capable to solve difficult and challenging mathematical problems, to decorate parts of books and many other things.He reads Marx, Pope, Kant and many other famous authors. Will doesn't know how to guide his capability in a productive way, but after a mathematics teacher discovers the boy's potential, he decides to take him to Sean McGuire( Robin Willians, who wrongly robbed Burt Reynolds' statue in the Oscar night), a hard, intelligent but sensitive psychologist, who has just lost his wife. The two end up building a true friendship, based on trust, and Will will have to evaluate his life and choose among continuing to go on with his simple life or to open himself for the brilliant future that waits for him... Matt Damon, a young actor, wrote this excellent drama's plot,together with his friend Ben Affleck. In the hands of director Gus Van Sant, "Good Will Hunting" stayed faithful to the original ideas of the young stars, and it consecrated them as two great promises,due to their latent talent and charisma. Robin Willians gives a contained and thrilling interpretation ,building with effectiveness a psychologist full of sorrow who, slowly, rediscovers the pleasure that life offers for those who want to get it. Actress Minnie Driver is excellent, portraying the girl who falls in love with Will and tries to make the boy surrender to the love! Gus Van Sant tried to avoid the exaggerations that marked his previous films, and he conducted with professionalism and talent a great film that teaches us something:for more difficult than life sometimes is is, if we count with values such as friendship, love, trust and pardon, is still possible to ennoble the world. Reaching the adolescent and adult public, "Good Will Hunting" is a thankful surprise!!watch the film, you will like it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In general, this movie is very good. Boston (and Cambridge) are faithfully rendered; this movie brings across the feel of these places very well. The acting was pretty good, and the dialogue was great. I only have one complaint about this movie, and it's a big one: this movie is very predictable. I don't think there was a single plot point that didn't telegraph itself a good half hour ahead of time. The plot has as many twists and turns as the highway between Fort Worth and Dallas. But if you don't mind predictability, you'll probably like this movie a lot.Kudos on a minor point. Being a kind of amateur linguist, and a native of Boston's northern suburbs, I've often noticed how badly movies and television shows misrepresent the distinctive Boston accent. Well, this movie got it right for the most part. My compliments to the dialect coach. (Robert Easton didn't have anything to do with this, did he?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is overrated, predictable and manipulative. There is some quirkiness in the dialogue and Matt Damon does a great job (giving credit to where credit is due), but I can't believe how some audiences and critics view this movie as "revolutionary." First off, the relationship between Damon and Robin Williams echoes, right up to the "it's not your fault" climax, Timothy Hutton and Judd Hirsch in Ordinary People. The people in Will Hunting's life who attempt to get through to him--Ben Affleck, Williams, Minnie Driver, etc--was also liberally borrowed from Robert Redford's classic. As for Williams, the fact he won an Oscar for what is basically a replay of his "Dead Poet's Society" role is baffling to me. I'd like to think that Oscar rewarded him for his overlooked dramatic performances in World According to Garp, Moscow on the Hudson, Awakenings and The Fisher King--his performances in all of those films blew his "GWH" Oscar-winning performance away. Much of this movie is paint-by-numbers (especially the climax). There were some deeper aspects to Will's life that Damon conveyed with his fine acting, yet they were never explored. Bottom line: If the movie had not been described as being "brilliant" and "groundbreaking," my expectations would have been lower. Put this with "Rain Man"and "Terms of Endearment" as one of the most overrated films of the last 20 years. Give me overlooked, unpredictable character dramas like "Dominick and Eugene" and "Birdy" over this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Good Will Hunting" is not one of those conventional Hollywood dramas that are filled with sentimental moments, melodramatic situations and stereotypical characters. It is a film that focuses on realistic characters, their complex lives and the things life has to give them, whether they want them or not. Something every human being can relate too. "Good Will Hunting" is a genuinely good film, that has qualities I consider a rarity these days in movies. This may sound over the top, but this movie will most likely be one of the most memorable dramas of the 90`s. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck`s honest and invigorating script transfers almost perfectly onto the big screen, with the help of director Gus Van Sant. "Good Will Hunting" is about a young, cocky but deeply troubled young man named Will Hunting. He lives in South Boston with his street bum friends, but there`s something that separates him from the rest; He`s a genius. After an MIT professor accidentally discovers his gift, Will`s life starts to change, more dramatically than he thinks. Two strangers almost simultaneously then enter Will`s life; Sean Maguire, a widowed psychologist who tries to help Will, played greatly by Robin Williams. And Skylar (played equally as good by Minnie Driver), a vibrant Harvard student who quickly falls in love with Will. Will`s relationship with both them and his blue-collar friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck), all seem to deeply affect him, making it more difficult for Will to realise what he truly needs. The ending of the film sort of leaves you hanging, but you will no doubt me moved. "Good Will Hunting" is pretty down-to-earth film, but it is enriched with an indescribable power that is probably generated by all the exceptional performances, the script and Gus Van Sant`s unparalleled direction. A satisfying, powerful and thought-provoking movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GWH is just a good story. It's not necessarily believable, but I applaud the philosophy behind it: It burns the people of academia and their "well educated and good" intentions.The bar sequence where Will eventually meets his love interest is one of the best movie sequences I've ever seen. He easily reduces a Harvard student to an embarrassed school boy by citing the exact sources of the student's knowledge, telling him what he'd be reading the next year, then topping it off by offering to "take it outside."As for the rest of the movie, it continuously shows a math professor pushing Will to use his natural talent to become something he's simply not interested in. After all, he's still young, and he has a lot to learn and a lot of his past life to sort out in his mind.Sean (Robin Williams) sees through all of this and helps Will out. The emotional element of this movie hinges heavily on this relationship and is very captivating. Likeable characters and a good story make this a 10 for sure. (watch out for the tears!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, I feel I am in the awkward and depressing position of having to criticize this movie - despite rating it an 8. The reason is because so many people rated it a 9 or 10.I just couldn't root for anyone in this movie - except for Robin Williams. As I am not a huge Williams fan, that left me somewhat empty. None of the characters were particularly likeable.Also, the premise was undermined by the fact that NO ONE on this planet can solve world class mathematical problems without training. No matter who you are, you have to know what the symbols mean in order to understand the problem and interpret it and express the answer - right?Some of the scenes were very good - enough to recommend the movie, but this is a classic movie that I think of as "well done". However, if I never hear of it again or see any part of it again, I won't have missed a thing - and neither will you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very surprised at the variety and depth of the characters in the GWH script. (This is after all a Hollywood movie.) Several of them (Robin Williams, Minnie Driver and Affleck and his friends) could have been the center of their own movies.Also it is rare when a brat pack type of film does a good job handling adult issues, as was done with William's and Skarsgard's characters coming to terms with what is success, commitment as well as pride and jealousy.The therapist client relationship which can be so off base to be a joke as in the "Prince of Tides" had a semblance of reality to it. The intense issue of child abuse was dealt with very briefly but in a fairly honest way.In a sense the story about the Matt Damon character being very bright was not that interesting to me. What I responded to were these characters trying to reach out and connect. This is overall a very polished package by the film makers, including fine acting - making GWH a positive experience.</fullReview>

These moments in the film is what makes it great. These are the moments that allow the audience to glimpse what goes on in these character's minds. Although there's no dialogue when Chuckie goes to Will's house near the end of the film, everyone knows what is going through his mind.

		<shortDescription>...Good Will Hunting is a diamond in the rough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a shoe-string budget, with a less than well-known cast, Good Will Hunting once again proves you don't have to spend a lot of money in Hollywood to produce a first rate movie with a first rate ensemble cast. Matt Damon (Will Hunting) and Ben Afleck are buddies who wrote the Oscar winning screenplay together. Damon also garnered a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar nomination. Minnie Driver (As Will's girlfriend Skylar) and Robin Williams (as Will's counselor Sean Maguire) were also nominated as Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor respectively. Both are superb in their supporting roles.The plot concerns an MIT school janitor (Damon) from South Boston ("Southie") who has a special gift when it comes to numbers. Rather than apply that skill, Will prefers hanging out with his childhood friends drinking, getting into fights and carousing with women. When Will completes a mathematics equation posted for the "real" students at MIT, a math professor becomes curious and tracks down Will. Seeing his potential, he takes Will under his wing. As a condition of his freedom (Will's arrested for assault), Will must undergo therapy. After running through "shrinks" like women run through nylons, the professor seeks out his old college roommate (Sean), also a hard case and when Will and Sean finally begin to trust each other, things change for Will in his thoughts about his future and in his relationship with Driver.Well-written, with a down to earth, realistic look at New England life, Good Will Hunting is a diamond in the rough. With some of the best lines (had me laughing out loud) and well-crafted dialogue, this film soars above most of the movie fare. With a running time of 2:05, this film never drags and leaves you wanting more. For an uplifting, intelligent, thought-provoking and, most importantly, entertaining film, put Good Will Hunting at the top of your must see list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>prodigious but hidden mathematical genius hides his talent protecting the pain of not being loved, the result of his past experiences as an institutionalized child. This interpretation of Matt Damon is very well characterized, showing a determined teenager Will not expand their potential.The chronology of events leads to meet their friends, the teacher who tries to channel their talents and then a psychiatrist, played by Robin Williams, who deservedly won the Oscar earned throughout his career and especially for this noble and outstanding performance. It would not be surprising that "it was not your fault," one of the final scenes, will be remembered as an icon theme, as the "return" of Stallone in "Exterminator".Interpretations of Ben Affleck as friend Will, notes that in the real world, you do not require prodigious abilities to recognize that a friend is not using its full potential. The character of Will also include the values &#x200b;&#x200b;of friendship and loyalty, by selecting the value of having friends and being accompanied by people who support you.Minnie Driver's performance focuses viewers to the love relationship, the university (the Academy), the establishment of couples, making this film a subject of reflection on human relationships, the value of trust and self-worth on decisions in life.All this makes this movie in "Excellent", recommended for anyone who enjoys topics of reflection, self-esteem, friendship, personal growth and human behavior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting It is a touching story about a wayward boy and his healing. Though a love story at heart, it does not make for the basic premise.Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is an undiscovered mathematical genius. He is well read, lost young man working as a janitor in MIT, where he is discovered by a professor. Through the guidance of his psychiatrist (Robin Williams) he finds his calling, falls in love and begins his journey for a better life. Matt Damon as Will Hunting has done full justification to his character. You feel every moment with him. His insecurities and vulnerability is touching while at the same time his mask of sarcasm is arrogant. Robin William sails through his character as a psychiatrist. He is not a mentor but becomes a father figure to Will. His personal trauma and healing is beautifully handled. The dynamics between Robin and Matt make for some of the most memorable moments of the movie. Ben Affleck and Stellan Skarsgard have also shined in their small respective roles. There are some moments in the movie which stay with you even after. Gus Van Sant(director) has done a very good job. Moments like wills final break down or his confrontation with Skylar are powerfully packed yet subtle. The film is brilliant with a first class performance by everyone. There are no dull moments. The chemistry between the characters is plausible and realistic. The writing is witty yet deep. The movie does not evade the tougher questions yet manages to not bring down the mood. Overall, this movie is a definite keeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My All Time Favourite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about this film? It features one of the greatest screenplays of the last 20 years, written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, full of thought-provoking dialogue and some beautiful monologues, (My personal favourite is from Ben Affleck at the construction site about 3/4 of the way through the film). All the actors are great. Matt Damon perfectly embodies the role that he plays, an immature, cocky yet gifted boy in a world which he believes will wait for and build around him. Robin Williams plays an empathetic, yet gloomy psychologist who has never fully gotten over the death of his wife. Even Ben Affleck-haters will acknowledge Affleck's good work here, as Will Hunting's seemingly bonehead friend, who, as the film goes on, is revealed to be caring, empathetic man. Minnie Driver, Casey Affleck and Stellan Skarsgard round out the cast, all of whom give good performances. The plot is something many of us can relate to: An overconfident, intelligent man who cannot be bothered to realise his full potential. The insecurities of Will Hunting are fleshed out in great detail by the script, Damon's performance and Gus Van Sant's use of close ups for a lot of the major scenes, showing Hunting's emotions in detail. However, in some of the crowd scenes, such as in classrooms, Van Sant lacks a little imagination, resorting to the same camera pan sequence over and over again. Nevertheless, he is a more than capable director who delivers for the most part here. Danny Elfman's use of music adds to the heartwarming factor of the film. The film won two Oscars, Robin Williams winning Best Supporting Actor as well as Damon and Affleck winning Best Original Screenplay. In addition to this, Damon, Van Sant, Driver, Elfman and editor Pietro Scalia, earned nominations for their efforts. The film was also nominated for best original song and best picture. I would recommend this film to anyone, however, parents should be careful with letting their children watch this, as it contains a lot of coarse language as well as frequent sexual references. A superb work of modern drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting Is Both Emotionally Rich And Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is a film directed by Gus Van Sant that stars Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Stellan Skarsg?rd.The story of the movie follows a 20-year-old South Boston laborer Will Hunting, a genius who is forced to see a therapist and study advanced mathematics with a renowned professor in order to avoid jail time.The story and screenplay were written by both by Affleck and Damon,who won the Oscar Best Original Screenplay for the film.The story was set in Boston and Cambridge, about rebellious 20-year-old MIT janitor Will Hunting,who is gifted with a photographic memory that hangs out with his South Boston bar buddies, his best friend Chuckie and his affluent British girlfriend Skylar.After MIT professor Lambeau stumps students with a challenging math formula on a hallway blackboard, Will anonymously leaves the correct solution, prompting Lambeau to track the elusive young genius. As Will's problems with the police escalate, Lambeau offers an out, but with two conditions namely: visits to a therapist and weekly math sessions. Will agrees to the latter but refuses to cooperate with a succession of therapists. Lambeau then contacts his former classmate, therapist Sean McGuire, an instructor at Bunker Hill Community College. Both are equally stubborn, but Will is finally forced to deal with both his past and his future.This is one of the best films in the 1990's that is both sincere and heartwarming especially when it presents the moving story of brilliant but troubled youth like Will Hunting.Also,the viewer gets to realize that beneath his arrogance and crass behavior, you'll find a lot of hurt and many defense mechanisms raised against a non-compassionate and manipulative society.Overall,it allows us to understand about Will Hunting's humanity rather than his gifts.The film was acted and directed extremely well.Damon and Williams were superb in their performance as Will Hunting and the psychiatrist respectively.Aside from that,the movie also gives the viewer a positive and inspirational experience especially if we get to understand what is beneath the character's persona.Overall,this is one excellent film that is emotionally rich and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On any given day, I probably would have spent my evening reading, or playing video games, or watching TV. Today, however, I decided to log onto Netflix and see what was available to "Watch Instantly." I looked under the "Recommended for You" section and saw the title of a film I had only ever heard of. I had never bothered to ask anyone what it was about; my parents had told me a while ago that it was a great movie, but naturally I hadn't listened (after all, it was rated R). I couldn't even make out the actors on the tiny image of the DVD box. All I recognized was the title: Good Will Hunting. I was done with my homework, I didn't have anything constructive to do, and I was bored, so I clicked on the link that read, "Play Movie". I'm glad I did.This film, written by two former Harvard students and great friends, is by far one of the most incredible films I have ever seen. From the opening kaleidoscopic views of physics equations to the final shot of a junky car heading west on the highway, I was intrigued, to say the least. To anyone who hasn't seen it, you don't realize the sheer beauty of these simple camera shots. To anyone who has, you know exactly what I mean. The story follows Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a janitor working at MIT who is far smarter than the mathematics professors teaching there. It is later revealed that he had a tough childhood, is an orphan, and never had a chance to go to a school like MIT, but by proving an incredibly difficult theorem he shows Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg?rd) that he has an amazing gift for mathematics. One thing leads to another, and the only way Will can stay out of jail for assault charges is if he gets therapy from Professor Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), a teacher at a community college. Through this therapy, Will comes to realize that he has too much potential to throw away his life living in South Boston. This story runs parallel to Will's love life with Skylar (Minnie Driver), a student at Harvard University. This relationship could have ended up as a pointless plot addition to make the movie longer, but it actually becomes pretty vital to the plot of the movie and completely changes Will's life. The combination of a love story and the story of a genius who finally realizes his full potential makes a brilliant film.This film's story is amazing, but a great film doesn't only have a good story. A great film has a great story, great acting, great scenery, great music, and great symbolism. Good Will Hunting has all of these aspects, and more. The fact that this movie was written by two amateur filmmakers only emphasizes their movie-making skill, and the fact that they can actually act is what fuses the incredible plot to the rest of the movie. If anyone else had been cast as the lead roles of Will Hunting and Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), the movie probably wouldn't have captured all the aspects that make up this great film. It is a very good thing Matt Damon and Ben Affleck adopted these roles, but the inclusion of Robin Williams in this film takes it up a level. Williams' ability to perfectly transition from jokes to concern to even violence is a blatant sign that he is a great actor, and without him this film could not have succeeded. Aside from the obvious acting and plot aspects of the movie, Good Will Hunting is also stunningly symbolic. Whether Damon and Affleck meant to add so many symbols to the film or not, they did so seamlessly. I won't add any plot spoilers, but let me tell you: if you can recognize the true meaning in films, you will devour this movie.I am grateful to Netflix, to say the least. I don't know what their policy is on making movies available to watch online, but I do know that this policy is definitely a good one. On any given day, I wouldn't have watched the brilliant film that is Good Will Hunting. I'm glad today wasn't any given day. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a lonely feeling to finally watch such a popular and critically-acclaimed movie like Good Will Hunting, and be wondering what all the fuss was about. Sure it's been a few years since it was released, but movies this highly praised usually stand up to the test of time.So I didn't think it was amazing...but it was good. It's the kind of underdog story that pulls at the heartstrings, and I imagine that a large portion of its popularity comes from that fact. Matt Damon is just a great actor in every movie he ever does, Minnie Driver was aces, and Robin Williams made the rare decision to showcase the portion of his talent that doesn't make me want to slap him.Good Will Hunting is a solid movie, and it's really a shame that it has taken me so long to see it. Solid, but not spectacular. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>According to legendary film-writer William Goldman (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Princess Bride), it was he who changed Affleck and Damon's treatment from something altogether more conventional into the Oscar-winning screenplay filmed by Gus Van Sant. Whoever is responsible, we should simply be glad the film was made, as it's a very well realised, emotionally satisfying, mostly original drama; from the moving performances, especially from Robin Williams and Minnie Driver, to Van Sant's camera, forever searching for the soul of the scene, this is clearly confident, intelligent film-making.For all its truths, the film is fantastical: under Danny Elfman's twinkling, otherworldly score, there isn't a single shot of Will (Damon) actually reading one of the books he knows by heart. Indeed, we're never quite clear where Will finds the time to feed his dizzying intellect between working, fighting and drinking. Less forgivable is that Driver's Skylar is rather unfairly banished from the third act, reducing a bright character to a dull device to provide a neat ending.For my money, in terms of Van Sant's 'crowd-pleasing' output, Good Will Hunting doesn't quite scale the heights of the more acerbic To Die For, or the more politically substantial Milk. But thought-provoking and very nicely played nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes watching a movie with no idea of it whatsoever and hence having no particular expectations from it can be so generously rewarding. That was the case with my viewing of this "South Boston Drama" as I'd like to call it.My honest advice to anyone wanting to watch this movie is just close the web page you're viewing right now and get a copy of the movie and watch it. Instead of breaking my head in figuring out the best way to describe what the movie (which is now in my all-time favorite movie list)is about, I will tell you what it's not. It's not a pretentious movie that tells the story of some shallow people. It's not a movie which though has a great story but goes nowhere. It's not a drama which will make you cry every other scene. It's an honest movie which has got an amazing script that is portrayed beautifully by equally amazing actors. In fact there is a sense of honesty in every character you see in the movie, the lines they speak and even their attitude throughout... and that is the charm of it. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's screenplay is way too good which got them a deserving Oscar. Robin William gives a spellbinding performance and is the one to watch out for.In all sincerity if you could just connect to this movie the way I did, maybe you and I are not so different after all. Pure honest movie-making rarely gets better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start with the profanity: it is SO true to Boston, particularly South Boston (known as "Southie"). (Southie is a particularly idiosyncratic neighborhood, as you can see from the way its inhabitants are portrayed.) The accents (even Robin Williams') rang true to this ex-Bostonian, and the dialogue was spot on. The script was perfect. And the performances were uniformly top-notch: Robin Williams was so believable as the educated psychiatrist who still hadn't left behind his Southie roots. He's never been better, before or since, which is a credit to Gus Van Sant.I've been to MIT and Harvard, I've been to Southie, and I've lived in Boston. They are exactly as shown in the movie, warts and all. Hate on the movie if you will (and for the life of me, I cannot understand why), but you cannot attack its authenticity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is fantastic! A story written by Matt Damon and Ben Afleck which is a little mastermind that leaves you with a large smile at the end, after the emotional roller-coaster throughout. Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a mathematical genius and has potential that only one wishes to have, however there is real personal issues that has affected Will, stopping his own potential to be full-filled because of his life experiences growing up as a child. In more specific terms Will is like a terrified child who stays at home on his couch, so he doesn't have to go into the real world and feel the kind of hurt that has affected him before in life. Will hangs around with so called "no brainers" and his best friend Chuckie (Played by Ben Afleck) who is the type that really would lie in the middle of the road for Will we gradually begin to admire this genuine loyal friendship that in the middle class world seems to be rare for some people. Great sub-plot with therapist Sean Maguire (played by Robin Williams) which is like cat and mouse with each meetings they have. Will has always called the shots and kept in control of what he wants people to no and understand about him, but Sean is finally his match, and with great dialogue this kept me locked and fascinated throughout the film as i generally wanted to no more about Will and understand him! There is love in Will's life called Skylar (played by Minne Driver) and Skylar has everything charisma, looks, intelligence and a very sweet/caring side. Will struggles throughout being able to allow himself to love Skylar and become vulnerable for a women once in his life. Good Will hunting is a film that educates and provokes human ignorance for roughly 2 hours and definitely changes people perceptions of judging people who they truly don't understand!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting weaves many themes: love, friendship, loyalty, rivalry, class, relationships and intelligence. Considering that this film was also written by Matt Damon &amp; Ben Affleck makes it even more remarkable. What started as a collection of scenes became this modern fable for generation X. Folks might be put off by the language, but it is what makes the film real. Having been in Boston, I have seen the differences between Southies and the upper crust, and Matt &amp; Ben, who I believe are from Boston, really bring this class issue to light. You also see unconditional love &amp; loyalty in the friendship of Matt &amp; Ben (which parallels the Stellan Skarsgard/Robin Williams friendship), and later, in the relationship of therapist Robin Williams with Matt. Matt's lack of vulnerability is his shield in relationships until he meets the premed student as played by Minnie Driver. With her, his walls come down, but he is still wary of exposing his vulnerability and has a fear of commitment. And it is the therapist (Robin Williams) who finally breaks through, teaching Matt about revealing himself. There are many poignant moments in this film; and given the fact that Ben Affleck has been slammed many times for his acting, he gives a sublime, endearing facet to his character's friendship with Matt in his performance. Minnie Driver projects a warmth and intelligence that Matt's character is attracted to. She is an open book, unafraid of falling in love with Will Hunting, and sad when she cannot feel the reciprocation from him. But the real scene stealer is Robin Williams, whose therapist character is similar to Will; southie boy who is wicked smart. The scenes of Matt and Robin are like a well choreographed dance, and I believe that this is some of Robin's best dramatic work since Peter Weir's Dead Poet's Society. Having watched this movie many times, I keep finding new subtleties in all the acting performances. Definitely a must see film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Good Will Hunting" ranks high on my list of all-time favorite films. Everything about the movie is top-notch, everything. The acting is brilliant. The actors do a splendid job of eliciting an emotional response from the viewer. Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver and Robin Williams all shine in their roles, and are an absolute joy to watch.The writing is wonderful. Writers Matt Damon and Ben Affleck put together a magnificent character-driven story about a young man (Damon) with a great intellect and immeasurable potential who must first battle his inner demons with the help of a court ordered psychiatrist (Williams) in order to realize his future.The direction is spot-on. Gus Van Sant does a phenomenal job in visualizing the script and bringing it to life. The cinematography is impressive; it really captures the "feel" of Boston.The soundtrack is terrific and is contextually appropriate to the film. Elliott Smith's gentle melodies add an exquisite ambiance to the scenes in which they are featured. Other particularly memorable musical moments include the use of "Baker Street" by Gerry Raferty and "Afternoon Delight" sung humorously by Matt Damon during the movie, and again during the end credits by the original artists, the Starland Vocal Band.I strongly recommend this movie, and without hesitation I advise anyone who has not seen it to pick it up immediately. To those who have seen it before, watch it again! I give it 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another film where the pitch is the first thing that leaps to mind: 'yes, the script's by two unknown, er, teenagers but it's great - it's about a maths prodigy who works as a cleaner...'Well, Good Will Hunting is these things and considerably more. It's best described as a rite-of-passage drama in which the tough competitive spirit of a group of friends from Boston carries one of them to love and vocation almost despite himself. For all that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck won an Oscar for their screenplay, Matt Damon's performance as Will Hunting is also very good indeed, raw, romantic and unintimidated by on-form Robin Williams. Minnie Driver is a believable romantic foil and Gus van Sant really manages the look of the film well: the empty, after-hours college building that Will inhabits is just like the empty, dry interior that he's trying to fill. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie not in the IMDb Top 250- one of the best ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've seen the movie Paycheck, you would not assume that Ben Affleck has brilliant writing talent in him. He apparently does and, along with childhood pal Matt Damon, in Good Will Hunting, he has penned a nearly perfect script. Good Will Hunting will make you laugh and make you cry. It will make you angry and sad and happy and excited all at once. It makes you root for its protagonist one moment and then hate him for being so stubborn the next. In short, it is one of the most powerful screenplays ever written.Besides the writing, it is also perfectly acted. Ben Affleck is fantastic as Will Hunting's best friend and deserved an Oscar nomination simply for the scene in which he tells Will that he wishes Will would one day simply not be at his house. While Affleck is great in a relatively small role, however, it is Damon and Robin Williams who steal the show as the titular character and his psychologist, respectively. Damon's Will Hunting is just about the smartest man in the world, a man who can solve the most difficult calculus problem in his head and can read a book in a matter of minutes. Despite his genius, he is deeply emotionally troubled, due to his upbringing on the rough streets of Boston. Williams won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his brilliant portrayal of the only man who was able to get under Will's skin.The movie, as stated above, makes you feel a wide span of emotions. Will is such a complex character that we cannot ever fully understand what makes him tick. Sometimes, we feel like he is growing emotionally, and sometimes we just can't grasp why he is being so stubborn and immature. The movie flows beautifully from one scene to the next and only seems to get better as it progresses. Also, it stands up wonderfully upon multiple viewings.Good Will Hunting was nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1997 but only came away with two wins, Robin Williams for Best Supporting Actor and Damon and Affleck for Best Original Screenplay. I have seen all five films nominated for Best Picture that year, and this film is far and away the best of them. Titanic is a very good movie and certainly groundbreaking in terms of visual effects, but it comes nowhere close to making the emotional impact that this film makes. Also, Matt Damon was absolutely robbed of an Oscar for Best Actor by Jack Nicholson (As Good as it Gets).Simply put, Good Will Hunting is one of the best films of the 1990's and one of my personal favorites of all time. I have handed out only 20 ratings of perfect 10's on IMDb out of over 600 films that I've rated. Good Will Hunting earned this coveted rating by combining a phenomenal screenplay with superb direction and impeccable acting. This film is truly one not to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie celebrates the unsung hero but beyond that, it challenges us to cast aside stereotypes and see the good in everyone. In that sense it is somewhat counter-cultural but it also follows the Frank Capra tradition of exalting the forgotten people in our own midst.The main plot is about a young man named Will Hunting who works as a janitor at MIT but under this blue collar facade, there exists a genius. The sub-plot involving two academic rivals ? Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsgard ? is about the struggle between two strong personalities to decide what is best way to help Will.Will suffers from a background of being shuffled from one foster home to another and this leads to behavior that regularly lands him in trouble. He is discovered by a professor, Gerald Lambeau, played by Skarsgard, who himself has been honored for outstanding academic achievement. Lambeau seeks out his long-time rival, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to be the youth's therapist ? a court-mandated requirement to get Will out of a possible prison sentence and to get him on track to achieve the tremendous success Lambeau feels he is capable of.The rivalry between the two professors takes on tremendous significance for Will's future. Lambeau sees potential waiting to be unleashed and Maguire sees the wounded human soul, who needs to be rescued before he releases him into the world.Will finds love in a young university woman named Skylar, played by Minnie Driver, who clearly sees the broken man with a big heart, who is a latent genius. Skylar is a natural with Will and his friends, despite the fact that they exist in different worlds. When Skylar decides to pursue her dreams in California, she asks Will to go with her. She loves him deeply but because of a deep-seated fear he might be hurt or betrayed, Will cannot bear to leave the world he knows with the friends he trusts. His friends are Chuck Sullivan, played by Ben Affleck, Morgan O'Mally, his real-life brother Casey Affleck and Billy McBride, played by Cole Hauser.Will's fate is more or less decided at a critical moment in the movie with his therapist and is reinforced by his girlfriend Skylar and his friend Chuckie ? both believe in him and care deeply for him. This movie is the result of collaboration between Damon and Affleck. They wrote and produced the movie, drawing on their Boston roots to show the hardscrabble existence of the blue-collar Irish in South Boston (Southie) with poverty and street fighting. The movie is directed by Gus Van Sant, who directed the movie Elephant. The foul language is somewhat jarring but serves to make the movie an accurate portrayal.This movie shows the gap between the blue-collar workers and the university people in the same city but in that setting two strong-willed men try to help a young man from the wrong side of town.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your "gift" is the people who love you.I have never been good at mathematics and I can't comment on the mathematical genius of Will Hunting,but one thing is sure and that is it is not what this film is about. What is the use of solving all those complex mathematical questions if we don't know the least about ourselves.To me this is a film which challenges our intelligence our knowledge and makes it a means to a higher,more profound understanding of ourselves and of the world and that is Wisdom.Which one is more complex the mathematical theory written on the chalkboard or Will Hunting messed up and helpless and indifferent towards his gift?Instead of being called "The Talented"(for we will know what pure talent may sometimes lead to,like in "The Talented Mr.Riply") or "Gifted" Will Hunting it's called "Good" Will Hunting,for what he's even unconsciously driven into is not just science which he quite well is aware of how can be manipulated by the politicians to serve their interests,but a kind of insight,a knowledge which can serve to something good.It is a film that puts happiness and self knowledge as a necessary component for any achievement in life,a self knowledge necessary not just for Will but for the Professor and the Psychiatrist as well.It is a film which like a surgeon opens the heart of its characters and points out their vulnerabilities,their tremendous need for loving and being loved.Maybe most of our achievements are masks by which we want to conceal our wounds,and maybe we should cherish our wounds for they have enriched our lives with art and science and...,but we should never hide behind them for we may loose a great deal by that, the human affection.Will's mathematical ability brings about meetings with people of which the most significant is his encounter with therapist Sean Maguire.An encounter of which benefit both,Will finally finds a father figure to trust and let go of his insecurities,and Sean by reaching out to help Will comes out of his self-cage. There are things which their value is beyond their price and those are Will's friends,Ben's dissatisfaction with Will's lack of ambition and the car they give him for his birthday,those are his real assets and which lead him to his path to find love and happiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to know right from wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie only recently, years after it was first released.For me this was a movie about a psychologist trying to help a genius young man who was about to make the most important decisions in his life, but didn't have the ability or the tools to recognize this and make the right choices. He was lacking the guiding principles in his life.Robin Williams, the psychologist, argued that only being a genius is not enough to make a person successful and happy, and he gave Unabomber as an example, who was a mathematical genius.The psychologist helped Matt (with a bit of forcing) to get rid of all the layers of pretentiousness, arrogance, and the masks he wear and finally touch where it hurts deep inside. Matt had to feel his hurt, realize the absence of his guiding principles, or whatever you want to call "not even knowing what he wants out of life", before he can start the healing process.When we make choices in life, our decisions are partially influenced by what we have learned while growing up. We learn the right from wrong mainly from our parents. In the absence of parents, teachers, relatives, the community or the religion provide us the guidance we need. Having been an orphan, and not having had a stable foster family, Matt didn't have a solid upbringing. The psychologist was concerned that, this genius, if not guided correctly, may become a loser, or may become a danger to himself and to the society.It was a great movie, recommend it everybody but especially to parents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Hunting is part of the elite of the intellectual class: a true genius. He's one of those people who can go from step A to step C without even having to bother with step B. Unfortunately for Will, he's also just a janitor. Not having had the privilege of the right education, he struggles to get by in life, even with his intellectual potential. Growing up as an orphan and raised in the lower class neighborhood, he has a lot of issues which cause him to have a violent and rebellious nature. The story of 'Good Will Hunting' begins when Will is discovered by a prestigious Math Professor at the Harvard University. He promises to work with Will if he in turn goes to see a psychiatrist every week to help him with his problems. We see how everyone deals with the changes in Will's life and how this affects Will himself. Will he be a blatant success? Or will his rebellious nature and his internal struggle keep him from reaching his potential?This is pretty much the main storyline. What makes GWH so good is that there are also a lot of smaller plot lines that are almost as interesting to follow. They are well written and never feel like filler (they do in a lot of other movies). What everyone probably knows is that this film was written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck themselves. I always found it odd that two people who are (I assume) unexperienced writers can come up with such a wonderful, fresh and well constructed script. When there are so many full-time writers out there who are not able to produce a decent script. Anyway, Matt and Ben got the Oscar for the script and they deserved it too. It's one of my favorite scripts of the nineties and that was a great decade for movies.Now enough about the script. How about the performances, you say. Well, they are great. Robin Williams gives (maybe) his best performance ever and Matt Damon is also very memorable. I still think his performances in The Talented Mr. Ripley was better, but this is a close second. Minnie Driver was also good, as she usually is. Ben Affleck and the rest of the cast deliver a decent performances. He has failed to impress me even a single time I'm afraid.Besides the acting and the script, there were several other things that stood out for me. The music for instance. No big theatrical things but sober and modest. It fitted very well with the overall tone of the film.As for it's ranking on IMDb. Why is it not in the top 250? It should be. I hope it will soon take his righteous position back.9.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A South Boston whiz kid elects to clean the halls of learning rather than enter them, slumming his way through life as a janitor at MIT. But his natural ability to unravel complex equations attracts the attention of a professor who won't let him quit, a beautiful Harvard student who wants to save him, a sympathetic buddy who wants him to escape South Boston, and a counselor who encourages him. A soundly acclaimed, homegrown effort from lifelong Boston buddies Damon and Affleck, which granted them the Academy Award for "Best Screenplay".Matt Damon delivers a great performance and proves himself a charismatic and compelling actor in this movie. Robin Williams also delivers an honest portrayal that adds greatly to the film's character interplay. Overall, the acting was excellent.This is a kind of spiritual sequel to "Dead Poets Society", where young people lead the way for older ones and rebel against the repressive system which fails to understand them. It features Robin Williams in a similarly extended supporting role. Those who enjoyed the former film will definitely like this one also.Van Sant has done a terrific job of keeping what is essentially a series of psychotherapy sessions (both inside an office and out) moving along as a cinematic narrative.With two Academy Awards (Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Screenplay) and seven more Oscar nominations, "Good Will Hunting" was the best of '97 along with "L.A. Confidential" and "Boogie Nights". 8/10</fullReview>

The acting is fantastic from every actor involved, I know Ben Affleck gets lots of stick but he's great also, but special praise goes to Matt Damon who portrays the troubled young man to perfection and Robin Williams, who shows what a great actor he can be in the right role, who is the grown up version of Matt Damon who never fully utilized his potential. These are ably supported by the likes of Minnie Driver and Stellen Skarsgard who also put in great supporting roles.As i said earlier the one thing that stays with you after watching it is the power of the film, this is from the performances and from the story itself.

The film was written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and in my opinion, is superior to Titanic. The film itself is one great scene after another, expertly written and acted in such a way that it reminds me of the Godfather films. The way Sean ( brilliantly acted by Robin Williams) was the only one able to break Will's ( an equally brilliant Matt Damon) tough exterior, really drives the film. The scene in the park where Sean tells Will he knows nothing about life, and that " when i look at you, i don't see a strong, confident young man, i see a cocky, scared s***less kid." Great moments like these come one after another and reaches an emotional climax with the " it's not your fault" scene. Minnie Driver's performance as Skylar nearly stole the show. I fell in love with her quirky charm, making it all the more dramatic when there relationship reaches a head with another great moment in the film. This is film any film lover should see. It's a testament to what can be done when two people come with a great story, memorable characters, and a desire to create an incredible film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting is still as good as it was 10 years ago...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few months ago I rented Good Will Hunting from a rental store right next door to me. I must say I know it came out almost 10 years ago, it is still amazing. The story was brilliant, the cast amazing, Robin Williams, who won an academy award for this, Matt Damon, who got nominated for this, Ben Affleck, and Minnie Driver, also getting nominated for this. I feel that this movie got robbed big time at the academy awards, but it did have the bad luck of coming out in the same year as titanic, l.a. confidential, and as good as it gets. I just bought this today over at best buy and it was still amazing as the first time i saw it. Loaded with a lot of comic relief. Definalty worth a rental and worth a buy as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GOOD WILL HUNTING ****1/2 The Weinstein and crew's bit of cinematic excellence boasts heartfelt drama, fresh humor, and interesting controversial issues from within. Working at the MIT as a janitor, Will Hunting (Matt Damon) becomes renown for his outstanding genius in mathematics. As the professors at the prestigious school in which he works try to force him to pursue his finesse, his personal problems hold him back. A troubled psychologist (Robin Williams) is the only man who can have him open his hurts so he can move forward in life. At least three major story lines occupy this picture, and Gus Van Sant keeps a firm handle on each.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film generating polemic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the movie for the first time a few weeks ago. Curious about other people's opinion, I took a look on film's comments. Some people gave this film a very low rating. It's obvious why. If those people know the life from watching movies and TV shows, this movie means nothing. But if you go out there, living between real people on a daily basis, you realise the qualities of this film. Comparing it with another Hollywood movie, this film is crap. Comparing it with the real life, it is unbelievable true and exciting. If we analyse the qualities of a film by the amount of truth brought in from our day-by-day life, of course, if we really want to see life and not only ourselves every single moment, we realise how mach frustration can be hidden in an individual.For those underrating the movie: you might very well be surrounded by trees, without knowing you're actually in a forest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of 1997's Best Films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon proves himself as one of the best actors in Hollywood. What's more, he co-wrote the script with Ben Affleck. This film is probably the best that one will ever see Affleck in-he's highly over-rated. Nonetheless, a strong story, good acting, and excellent direction from Gus Van Sant make `Good Will Hunting' one of the best films of 1997. I have to give credit to Robin Williams for his powerful performance as Will's mentor, Sean. Danny Elfman provides a poignant score, as well. ***1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this film I liked it, but I didn't realize how good it was. After a few more viewings I came to understand how great this film truly is. The story is very interesting and quite entertaining. The cast is excellent and the acting is very good. The comedy is very well done and well placed throughout the film. The only complaint I have about the film is the absurd amount of swearing in the film. I agree that sometimes it is necessary, but there is a truly unnecessary amount of language in the film. But please, don't let that discourage you from seeing the film, it is a very good film.As I said above, the cast is excellent. Matt Damon pulls off one of his best performances so far in his career. Robin Williams does a fantastic job in this film and definitely deserved his Oscar! Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser, and Stellan Skarsgard were all excellent supporting cast members!I would definitely recommend this film, as long as you can deal with the swearing. If you do end up seeing the film, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot has been said about Good Will Hunting. Everything from movie of the year, to a yawner. I would put it somewhere in the middle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, a young man from Boston who is brilliant, but also a troublemaker. He has a gift, something that he could use to get out of the down-trodden life he lives, but he's afraid, of his gift, and of leaving what he knows. But when as part of his probation for assaulting a police officer, he is released into the care of an M.I.T. professor, he has to face his fears face on. This is done with his psychologist, played by Robin Williams. For me, the movie came alive when Williams showed up. Up until that point, it was well done, but basic. Williams has the ability in his movies to either totally take control of a scene, or to sit back and play off the other actors (I can't wait for Insomnia.) I know he's generally seen as a comedic actor, but he's one of the few that can also pull of a serious role (again, I can't wait for Insomnia.) After he meets Will, he sort of meets his match. After losing his wife to cancer, he went into his own shell, staying with what he knew, what was safe. But while he teaches Will to meet his fears head on, Will also teaches him a few things.Once again, the plot is somewhat predictable. When Williams' character says early on that he skipped Game 6 of the World Series because he had to see about a woman, you knew that line would come back later on, and it did. The thing that makes this movie worthwhile, was the performance of Williams. I know everyone is talking about Matt Damon being the next big thing, and the script he and friend and co-star Ben Affleck wrote, is strong. But the person that carries the film, in my mind, is Robin Williams. And having Minnie Driver in the movie doesn't hurt (my bias for beautiful women comes through again). So even though you can guess what's going to happen next, the dialogue between the characters (and they all do a good job of holding on the Boston accent the entire film), and the superior acting carry the movie a long way. Not a yawner, not movie of the year, but fun to watch. </fullReview>

This is supposed to be a GREAT MOVIE??! Get a grip people!Van Sant what happened to you??

		<fullReview>It didn't have bombs. It didn't have comets. And it didn't have a gigantic, sinking boat. Bottom line? Didn't need it. In this inspiring, fantasy-wrought screenplay brought to life, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon prove that a down-to-earth, low-budget film can capture magnificence without all the special effects and larger than life cinematography. With Gus Van Sant, the envisioner of the movie, and the unsurprisingly superb Danny Elfman behind the musical wheel, Good Will Hunting deserved the Oscar for Best Picture. Titanic was predictable and true; Good Will Hunting offered a new story to the genre of fantasy screenplays, and it was evident in its winning Best Original Screenplay. As deserving as this was, the Academy fell far short of a consolation prize when it denied it Best Picture. See this movie and follow along with Will on his magical "hunt" for a future and security.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspirational and enjoyable style, but too much of the film is recycled. **1/2 (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GOOD WILL HUNTING / (1997) **1/2 (out of four)The tremendous, puzzling critical and public praise "Good Will Hunting" received utterly astounds me. What has America come to in order to get such great satisfaction out of a movie like this, jumping back and forth between presumptive concepts and a shameless plot; Gus Van Sant directs a script by Matt Damon and Ben Afflect, who think they are much better than they are. The two screenwriters actually took home the Oscar in 1997 for their work. But why? The movie certainly has an inspiring style, and if you do not try to hard you might find yourself having a good time watching it. But with more thought this script could have actually been worthy of the Awards it caught.The movie takes place at a Boston University where we meet an egotistical and youthful janitor named Will Hunting (Matt Damon). Nobody would ever guess beneath his tough and cocky attitude, urges to get nowhere in life, series of problems with the law, and rebellious actions that he is the smartest individual in Boston, if not the planet Earth. It feels so customary, the most unexpected person in the university is the smartest. Most of us will not find ourselves surprised when we learn this character has a deeply troubled past.Will Hunting beats the crap out of a police officer and finds himself with a demanding prison sentence. This is where the movie puts a new spin on an old clich: instead of a father pushing a rebellious offspring to live the life he wants him to live, here we have a college professor and a young janitor going at the notion. The professor (Stellan Skarsgard) realizes this young man has an extremely complex ability to solve mathematical problems and offers Will an alternative to jail time. He gets the reluctant juvenile a kind psychiatrist named Sean (Robin Williams). The filmmakers use this character to inject a bunch of other irritating dramatic contrivances in the story, dealing with previous child abuse, professional competitiveness, alcoholism, social class conflicts, jealousy, remorse, and guilt, but Damon and Affleck use these as predictable and formulaic tools to grab our emotions. They come off as amateurish and intractable.Will is emerged in self-discovery when his relationship with Sean stabilizes. He also meets a nice, charming young girl (Minnie Driver), who provides the plot with some romantic tensions. Her character's presence is needed so we can actually witness the impact of his counseling. But Will's moral awakenings are hammered in our heads. It's like the filmmakers did not think we could figure things out on our own so they felt the need to spell things out. This is absurd; most audiences can perfectly see the intentions and emotional turmoil Will is going through. This movie insults our intelligence.The plot and theme of this movie hinge too much upon the idea that it is difficult for an intelligent person to move from low-class to a honorable member of society. This is why the contrivances are so obvious. Even after some of the thoughtless writing, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck make the amazingly egotistical choice of starring in the film themselves. Both are talented actors, and Affleck does no harm here; his character does not make much of an impact. It is Matt Damon who is one of the biggest examples of miscasting in recent movie history. Damon does not look like a tenement citizen regardless of how hard he tries. His performance is riddled with indolent character traits, like smoking and the frequent use of profanity.Damon's character is also spectacularly aggravating. He originates no sympathy because Will is such a selfish idiot. Why should we root for him to succeed if he does not want success himself? Granted the character has a traumatic past and troubled emotions, but none of those things are executed in a convincing method, therefore it is up to Damon to fill the character with inspiration and livability, but I hated, hated, hated Will. I wanted Robin Williams to put a fist in his mouth. Is this what the filmmakers wanted, for us to despise the main character?Damon makes the performances by Stellan Skarsgard and Robin Williams standout. Robin Williams inhabits the only sensible character here; I felt so good when he kicked Will out of his office. No wonder he won best supporting actor at the Academy Awards, he is terrific. The performance captures his character's emotional and comical perspectives. Sean is also supplied with an absorbing circle of being, depth and dimension. Damon's character also perspires of such material, but Will seems to be altered for the script's needs. One scene he is ambitious and defends his friends, other times he is arrogant and cocky, yet sometimes gentle and charismatic. Minnie Driver is also charming, but her character also feels somewhat controlled. She is a plot puppet, but at least she portrays the character with personality and zest.Most of the movie has an enlightening and pleasant style, and if you are not too critical this movie does achieve its own goals. With so many problems with its plot, characters, and borrowed material, it's startling that "Good Will Hunting" feels uncluttered, organized, and so entertaining and human at times. But even the good substances contribute to a plate that may be a just bit too full for prosperity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie should tell anything you need to know about a talented mr. Matt Damon. I'm sad to say I'm really not an expert on his films but I have to take a wild guess this is his best so far. Script is so intelligent and mature it's hard to believe Damon and Ben Affleck, couple of pretty young lads wrote it. No wonder it won the Academy Award, it's such an enormous proof of their skills.Story is more than just very nicely written stuff because it deals brilliantly with extremely sensitive matters.Damon plays the leading role of Will Hunting, an orphan who's matematically a real genius but who lacks real emotions. Robin Williams doesn't fail either. His role is very logical and understandable after "Dead poets society". I noticed this movie actually sticks in mind because I've watched it recently and after couple of days I'm still recalling many of it's lines and impressive scenes. Big future classic, I'm sure.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very intelligent film about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a young genius, who because of his disadvantaged and abusive childhood, ends up as a janitor at MIT when he could easily be the head of the Mathematics department. Though the story is a bit far fetched (it is hard to believe a kid this bright wouldn't have been noticed by someone who would have guided him towards higher education), once you put that aside, it is a fascinating character study of a very complex and dynamic young man. Will is discovered after solving a math challenge left on a blackboard by the head of the math department at MIT. This throws his life into turmoil, as the mathematicians want to make him into a prodigy. He also begins seeing a therapist (Robin Williams) who forces him to confront many deep emotions and experiences he had been repressing. The effect this has on him, and his relationship with his friends is powerful and makes for an engrossing tale. The screenplay was written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon for which they won an academy award (the film was nominated for nine). Both were considered promising young actors before this film, but this tied a rocket pack to their backs and lit the fuse. Damon was outstanding in the lead. He had a very complex character to play and his emotional range was phenomenal. Not only was he quick witted, charming and vibrant, but he also had to be hot headed, arrogant, confused and despondent. He was able to switch emotions with ease and was always intense and believable. Robin Williams also gave one of his better performances and received a best supporting Oscar.It is hard not to like this film. Most of the challenges that Will faced were inside him, and watching him struggle to overcome the limitations from his past was very uplifting. I rated this film a 9/10. We need more scripts like this. Perhaps if we are lucky, Damon and Affleck will take time from their successful acting careers and collaborate again. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a real problem with the sentimentality of this movie. It drips with string-tugging melodrama and amateurish characterizations. The only movies that can get away with such tortured pop psychology were all made by Alfred Hitchcock.I liked Minnie Driver and Ben Affleck, accent or no (it's hard to tell), and Robin Williams was OK. Matt Damon's character is so depressingly obvious that it's difficult to sit through his journey to self-awareness, and the epiphany scene is just embarrassing.But I can't say enough about Gus Van Sant and his deceptively transparent direction. Somehow he makes the flat script come alive with just a few touches. Notice how he uses the stationary and panning shots - and how he frames each image to make it vital. This is especially true for the scenes with Driver. I'm not a Van Sant fan, but I think he really lifted this movie up by its wet corners and tried his best to give it life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hunting is a believable character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not think this movie was great, but I did like it. However, I do not feel the characters in this movie are unrealistic, as some have complained. I felt the character of Will Hunting, who seems to be the most maligned, was very real. Maybe the problem is that people have gotten so used to seeing characters who are one-dimensional and non-contradictory, even though this is not what people are like in real life. Will Hunting is a mathematical genius, but this in no way means that he should behave intelligently in all domains of his life. Hence, it is not unrealistic for him to behave stupidly when it comes to women. Nor is it unrealistic for him to work as a janitor. In my experience, people often do things that could not be predicted from their intelligence or abilities alone. I myself have done things that I intellectually knew were stupid or detrimental; I'm sure most people have, and a mathematical genius should be no exception. The character of Hunting struck me very much as a guy who has a problem with sabotaging his own happiness and success, maybe out of fear of greater failure should he put himself on the line. His amazing abilities do not necessitate that he have a good job and a university degree, because it is not just intelligence that determines these things. In school, perhaps he skipped all his classes and never did his assignments, and thus got poor grades. That being the case, he would not have been accepted to a prestigious university, and in fact no one might have noticed his affinity for math. It is also possible he simply didn't apply to university, even though he might have been accepted, either to stay with his friends or to prevent academic failure. I think one of the points of this movie is that being gifted does not by itself make you happy and successful. Being gifted does not make you immune to psychological problems, or make you behave in an intelligent manner in all situations. If his character had been written this way- well, first off, there wouldn't be a movie. Secondly, that would have made his character completely unbelievable. I do concede that the likelihood of a genius being a janitor is not that great, but it is not impossible, and I'm sure it happens. There are historical figures that we now recognise as great, even though in their time they were ignored or ridiculed for their beliefs. There are also nutty geniuses, who cut off their ears and what not. In light of such things and of my own personal experiences, I don't see any reason why Hunting can't be as screwed up as the rest of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am torn between giving this movie a 9 or a 10. I will not go into how good this movie is, because it has already been said many times. But it is not quite a "10", because of a couple things. Firstly, Minnie Driver's character seemed really unnecessary. Why do they have to insert a romance into every movie? It really ruins the plausibility of the movie - all of the other characters don't suddenly find their "true loves", why does the main character always have to? It really didn't even have much of anything to do with the story.Also, the idea that you have to go to Harvard or even college to get a good job is highly overrated. If this kid is such a genius, there are many jobs he could just walk into (and probably be happier doing). There is a middle ground between being a janitor and a 6 figure salary.Otherwise it is definitely a must-see flick, almost a 10.</fullReview>

It is a slow-burner, but I think this was purposefully done and it added to the film's poignancy and psychological aspect.Good Will Hunting is a beautifully filmed movie with striking scenery, and it is directed wonderfully by Van Sant. The music is never obtrusive but never too low-key either, while the story is interesting and compelling and the script intelligently written.The acting is one of the film's best assets, as well as its compellingly real characters. Robin Williams is superb in one of his best "drama" roles, while Ben Affleck has never been better and Matt Damon gives another fine performance to match his performance in The Talented Mr Ripley. Minnie Driver is also quite touching and believable.All in all, an incredible movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising screenwriting debut but an overrated movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good piece of screenwriting by young cast members Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but one that I don't think will stand the test of time. Matt Damon's (Will) performance as the troubled working-class genius in need of guidance is excellent. However, I think that this was too much of a feelgood movie and an endorsement of counselling, for it to be a truly great film. I found Minnie Driver's (Skylar) expressionless English accent thoroughly irritating and it destroyed, for me, the possibility of the romance between Will and Skylar being interesting.The performances of Robin Williams (Sean Maguire) and Stellan Skarsgard (Professor Lambeau) are good. The patient-therapist relationship between Damon and Williams is played well by both actors. The films flaw is that it lacks real depth of characterisation. There is a good story in this movie, but it lapses into classical Hollywood slushiness with all ends tied neatly together. Some characters, such as the pseudo-intellectual student who Will runs rings around while chatting up Skylar and a friend, are pretty one dimensional as he is someone we can easily mock and despise, just like the lapdog (what's his name?) who follows Lambeau around.There are few profundities in this film and I find the idea that therapy is what is needed to help a troubled young prodigy out of his predicament rather spurious. We are also shown how Will's initial hostility to therapy as part of his probation is surrendered. While one would not wish Will to remain an angry young man with no direction, I find the belief that therapy can necessarily mediate the relationship between an individual and society too hard to swallow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pretty good film. Several things at the end were utterly predictable. Robin Williams is so much better when he goes low-key, like here. I was very impressed with Minnie Driver's performance, something I haven't seen much mention of. (Although I haven't read all five gazillion comments) She really nailed it here. Damon and Affleck were OK. The script was good, but I don't think it was any better than "As Good as it Gets" also nominated that year. (I haven't seen the other two nominees) One thing I liked was that the actors at least attempted the Boston accent. I suppose to a Yankee, it would seem uneven, but at least they tried. I hate films set in Boston, or New York, or Georgia, where everybody sounds like they're from L.A. Grade: B</fullReview>

Matt &amp; Ben were well deserving of their Oscar for the script , as was Robin for his supporting award. This movie should have gotten more Oscars than it did. Watching Will and how hard his life has been was a real eye opener for me, I realized how much he and I had in common. Matt Damon playing this role allowed me to view my own life and allow me to forgive some people. So, thank you Matt for your inspirational role. Minnie Driver was brilliant as well in her role, she was way better than Kim Basinger , and she should have gotten the Oscar. Bravo to everyone involved in this film!

		<fullReview>Hello you all! I am Daniel Galvalizi. I think this movie is one of the best things that could happen in the movie business in the '90's. Good Will Hunting has a wonderful plot, and was written very well by the admirables B. Affleck and M. Damon. With this script, they showed to the world, that the young people really can make good and creative works. They also show us how's the real will of living, and how a guy can get over his past and be a good man. Of course, Gus van Sant made an excellent work. And the performance of Robin Williams, Matt Damon and Minnie Driver is wonderful. They act very well, and made us feel the movie with love, pain, happiness and tears. Finally, i believe this movie is great, beautiful and all the humanity must watch it. Good Will Hunting is a masterpiece, and does entertainment, though is slow and we got to follow it. The film has the will of hunt audience with a good product, and surely does it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BEST MOVIE........I LOVED IT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do I have to say about Good Will Hunting?? That I absolutely loved it! I find no flaws in this film! I was disappointed it didn't get best picture instead of Titanic! First of all, the script......it blew me away. The emotions that each character displayed was perfect....not one scene was boring or stupid, or unnecessary. Matt Damon was pretty much perfect (I loved him in the scene where him and Minnie Driver get into the huge argument), and my heart went out to Robin Williams unforgettable character (remember the park scene? It doesn't get much better than that!). Ben Affleck was also a bright point, his performance was great (I actually thought he deserved a nomination as well for his acting, but what can ya do?) And though people thought Minnie Driver was overrated, I loved her character and she fully deserved her nomination. The only minor problem was there was a little too much swearing, but it kind of suited the film. This is now at the top of my list of favourite movies. This movie is one of those ones you can watch over and over and it will never fail to amaze you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was quite a bit better then I thought it would be. Sure, it is very over rated, like most films of this type are, but still yet, I enjoyed sitting back and watching it for a couple of hours to pass some time.The film is about a janitor by the name of Will Hunting, who works at a big college. He is an absolute genius, but he has one problem... He has very bad anger problems. So he is sent to a shrink, who wants to help him use his gift and get his life running on the right track.Gus Van Sant did a very good job on this film. I am starting to like him a lot more as a director now that I am seeing more of his films. Matt Damon tries a little bit too hard to talk like a thug, but he pulls it off alright. Robin Williams gives an excellent performance, as always, as the shrink. A pretty good film, that all drama/comedy fans will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sat down watching this movie, thinking hey this isn't gonna be a very good movie. Well guess what I was wrong, I was struck by Robin Williams Oscar winning performance (which he deserved), Matt Damon was also very good in the lead role as Will Hunting. Ben Affleck was also very good as his friend, so what I'm saying is that this cast who played in this movie were very talented, and deserved all they got. The movie itself is very very and I mean very POWERFUL. It strikes you like a 2x4 coming out of nowhere. So I suggest whoever has not seen this movie, well you're missing something. Go rent or buy this movie. You will find the performance of the actors are great, and the movie itself will touch you and movie you like never before. And oh yeah all the rumors about the cussing is true, but after a while you don't hear them anymore. The humor is in it, the drama is in it, and the goodness is in this film, which everyone of all ages should see. Take the time now, and go see this film! I give it a 10. Rated R for strong language and sexual dialogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manipulative and Heartwarming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS. I can see why this project was greenlighted. It's got everything a Hallmark feature should have -- plus profanity. A love story between a brilliant lower-class boy and a young girl at Harvard. (In the original "Love Story" it was more or less the other way around.) A tortured boy barely out of his teens who is a miscreant and unable to expose himself to others and who is not "in touch with his feelings." (I've always wondered how you get in touch with your feelings.) Well, it's worked dozens of times before -- "Blood Brothers," "David and Lisa," inter alia. In this instance he's wary of others because he was abused as a child; cf., any of two or three dozen Lifetime Movies for Women. A very human but somewhat remote academic mentor, and a warm, humanistic, unpretentious bearded shrink, as in "Ordinary People." A score that tells us when we're supposed to laugh and when we're supposed to tear up. Good, evocative location shooting in Boston. Is Will Hunting going to be able to overcome his fear of commitment, leave Beantown, and find himself emotionally and intellectually? (How do you find yourself?) We viewers want him so badly to choose the right path, which we can discern amidst the murky and myriad possibilities even if he can't, that we feel like we're watching someone trying to shove a boulder and we find ourselves sitting in our seats and humping along with him. Does he make the right choice? Does a bear hibernate in the winter?Well, I'm sorry. I kind of enjoyed the first half hour or so, when Will Hunting's genius is being finally and painfully uncovered. It was kind of confusing though, in a technical sense. Mathematics is one of those creative talents that appears at an early age, rather like genius in music. It tends to peter out in early adulthood. (If you haven't made it as a professional mathematician by the time you're twenty-five you're considered over the hill in academia.) In other words, mathematical genius has a life course of its own, almost, but not quite, independent of what is generally recognized as "intelligence." But Matt Damon, as Will Hunting, not only has this isolated talent, but something that resembles a photographic memory as well. He's remembered practically everything he's ever read, which is practically everything ever written, from law to organic chem, although we never see him reading a book. If a kid in my working-class neighborhood ever was caught reading Nietzsche, he'd be twitted to death. Well, eidetic imagery (or photographic memory) really does exist. You can hold up an ordinary comb in front of a kid who "has" it, for a few seconds, then put the comb out of sight and the kid will be able to tell you the number of teeth in the comb, because the image in his mind is so clear that he can count them. But, like musical or mathematical genius, it shows up early, in young kids, then tends to fade. And again, it's independent of ordinary intelligence. For one individual, especially at the age of twenty-one, to have both singular geniuses at the same time, is so unlikely as to constitute an irritation for someone watching the flick. I mean, it's like drawing two straight flushes, one after the other. And then too, it makes me squirm when I watch a scene in which a shrink brings up the abuse his client suffered in childhood and then tells him over and over (and over), "It's not your fault," until the client breaks into a cascade of fulsome sobs and the two of them hug one another like Esalen grads. Who ever claimed it was the client's fault in the first place? Why in God's name should the client blame himself for the brutality instead of the foster fathers who are the guilty parties here? (Hint: the script calls for it.) And there are shouted arguments between the academic mentor -- played in a most engaging way by Skarsgard -- and the humanistic shrink -- done devilishly by Robin Williams -- that seem to take place only because they add texture to the picture. Neither the mathematician or the shrink show the slightest evidence of being the shouting type. There's also a shouted argument between Will and his girl friend that isn't called for either, although a simple disagreement would have been plausible. I guess what I'm saying is that this is a commercial product. It could have come out of a course in screen writing taken through Phoenix University. Introduce interesting characters with idiosyncratic traits, pull the audience in, then tug at the plot and the heartstrings. Have a scene in which an emotionally distant person finally breaks down and cries. In the last half of the movie, when the interest may be dying down, pump it up with fights between people we like. This isn't meant as cynicism or a blanket condemnation of the talent involved in the production. Matt Damon is particularly good as a bragging roughnecked Southie. Contrast this performance with what he does in "The Talented Mister Ripley." When he and Williams have a quiet confrontation on a park bench, Damon gives the scene entirely to the shrink. Robin Williams does a fine imitation of Oliver Sacks. (Why does he choose so many other poor vehicles?) Van Sandt handles the direction competently, but see "Drugstore Cowboys" for a more personal Weltanschauung, in some ways just the opposite of the one presented here. It isn't nearly as heartwarming as "Good Will Hunting," thank Bog.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matt Damon and Ben Affleck give very good performances in this film but the thing that baffles me and I can never seem to understand is why they won an Oscar for this screenplay. Not that the screenplay wasn't good, it was. But why did THEY win? As far as I gather all Damon and Affleck wrote was the first draft of the screenplay. But their version was some sort of horrible action film about a math genius on the lam from a crooked government trying to exploit his talents, involving high-speed car chases and buildings exploding etc. It wasn't until William Goldman, an experienced screenwriter was hired, that the film became this "inner-growth and maturity" story that eventually got released. Goldman wrote the bulk of the screenplay alone and didn't even get credit as a script-consultant. As far as the credits of the film are concerned, he wasn't even there. Of course Damon and Affleck came up with the main-character and some of the stuff in the script themselves, but they did not write the script that was actually filmed. And it really makes sense. How could two such inexperienced writers produce a first screenplay of such quality and go from rags to riches literally overnight? Sounds exciting doesn't it? Just the kind of story Hollywood likes to tell. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck give even better performances in real life than in the film itself. For those who are in doubt, check out their writing filmography and see how many films they have written since GWH.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And since I am considered quite a movie freak that does say something.I must say I came to this film with rather low expectations, mostly due to Robin Willimas who I generally find an over-actor and quite often flat out annoying. In this film however, he does a great job, no silly faces, no voices, just sober, yet very strong acting. A perfect sparring partner for the awesome Matt Damon. The same can be said about Matts buddy Ben Affleck, another very strong performer in this film.This film is at moments so very moving that it brings tears to your eyes, yet very funny at the same time. I obviously rate it 10 out of 10 and rest assured that it will remain in my collection for a very long time.

		<fullReview>How many handsome mathematical geniuses working as janitors and whose ambition in life is to get drunk and get into as many fistfights as possible have you ever met in your life? The main problem with Good Will Hunting is that the main character is as believable as Godzilla or Forrest Gump: it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to swallow Will Hunting's behaviour and motivations. At least Forrest Gump was a nice guy: Will Hunting's attitude, which is supposed to be the product of an abusive upbringing and therefore "not his fault", gets on your nerves after a while. Sure, it's satisfying seeing poor Will defy the establishment figures (judges, psychiatrists and snob rich college students) and getting away with it. For a while. Too bad this get boring after a while, with the viewer always ahead of the story until the predictable finale. But as long as you don't think too long about the implausibilities of the movie's setup, the story is convincingly acted and reasonably well-told, though director Gus Van Sant doesn't show any of the offbeat touches that marked his earlier efforts (the closer he gets here is a weird slow-motion courtyard fight).Robin Williams is fine as always, and more restrained than usual; the rest of the cast is adequate, though I would have loved to see more of Stellan Skaarsgard's math professor, easily the most interesting character.</fullReview>

Gus Van Sant also did a good job adding feeling and color where dialogue was absent. Hell, even the score chosen was appropriate for the scenes they portrayed. Williams did a tremendous outshine everyone job acting, and even Afleck and Damen were far from shabby. And as much as we all like to hate Driver, she too was ok I guess.

		<fullReview>I had originally reviewed this movie a year after I saw it, and in my review, I gave it restrained praise. 'Does it have it's flaws. Yes. It does go on a bit too long, and Minnie Driver's character borders on caricature'. After rewatching, I have to take those two comments back. It didn't seem too long during the second viewing, and Minnie Driver's character had real depth, something I had missed on my original viewing.  However, one thing that I have to comment on is the script. It felt much better the second time around. Damon and Affleck have a natural ability to create dialogue that flows, almost like lyrics to a song. None of it seems forced, and it becomes quite moving in several scenes. The scenes between Williams and Damon are so well written, and are acted very precisely, they become quite powerful. The music also works quite well, something else that I overlooked in my first viewing. I'm glad I watched it again, and it's status had certainly risen in my mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deserve every word of praise they got for this movie, IMO. Instead of complaining that there weren't enough meaty roles around for them they got to work writing their own, and beautifully written it is too. There is some debate about whether veteran screenwriter William Goldman had a hand in the finished product, but nobody slags off Tobe Hooper because Steven Spielberg supposedly directed the lion's share of "Poltergeist", do they? Anyway, I reckon if Goldman WAS involved, it was only to polish up a few minor details. The bulk of the screenplay has the air of being written partly from experience. I think the criticism the lads received may just have been jealousy from the Hollywood establishment at having the temerity to nab their first Oscars so young. In all areas, not just the script, "GWH" stands out as being a quality product.The guys deserve great credit for tackling a serious issue with their first screenplay and not merely filling the script with a lot of scatological humour (Though there is some of that here too, it just doesn't seem out of place) All of the characters are well rounded and sympathetic in some way, and you never feel they are there simply out of formula or to further the plot. The development of the story grows organically through the characters. Even Skylar, the love interest (played beautifully by Minnie Driver, as too are the rest of the performances great) is an interesting character in her own right and someone we want to follow through the story. The only measurable difference between her role and that of Matt Damon's is that he has more screen time, but this is understandable, given that he is the title character.In reply to those who say that the repeated profanity use highlights a lack of writing skills, I disagree. Often I DO think that repeated swearing is unnecessary to a story and unimaginative; not that it offends me, it doesn't. I do think that film-makers look at the success of a guy like Quentin Tarantino, who writes great dialogue and also uses a lot of profanity, and think that the former is because of the latter. It isn't. Here, the profanity seems natural. Look at the monologues given to Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) I think they are superbly written, and they contain very little profanity. Same goes for Stellan Skarsgard's dialogue.There are 3 scenes that stand out as being superbly written for me (not necessarily in chronological order)* Will's monologue about why he doesn't want to work for NASA* The scene with Skylar when he tells her of his abuse* Sean Maguire pouring scorn on Will's supposed 'life experience'(paraphrase) "Someone that could level you with their eyes,Wakin up every mornin' feelin' like God put anangel on earth just for you..."On a sombre note, I can relate to the above quote because it mirrors what I feel about a 'special someone', who I unfortunately can't be with. Still, personal identification aside, these are all wonderfully written.Gus Van Sant also does an under-appreciated job with the direction. It seems like he realised that he had a good script on his hands and he didn't want to ruin it with any needless showboating. Even though there are no visual acrobatics, I would bet that almost every scene came off better than Matt and Ben envisioned when they were writing it.Deserves to be seen at least once by everyone. Those in the mood for a personal project with big name stars that resonates in all the right places, this one's for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say I really found this film very over-rated. First of all the story isn't even remotly credible. How can a street kid without any education solve mathematical puzzles that even professors at Harvard University can't work out ??? Albert Einstein is mentioned several times in the movie as a parallel to Will Hunting, but don't forget that Eintein said, that to become a genius, you need 2% inspiration and 98% transpiration. What makes it even worse is that Will not only masters mathematics but history, literature, chemistry etc. as well. To me, Will is much too much of a Superman, and I couldn't identify with him in ny way. I really believe that you have to strive hard to obtain knowledge and education, and the genius myth that lies behind this film I find totally ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom. I look here on IMDB, even though it is not high on the list, it is in the top 250. I was a little surpised. Even though, yes. I am very impressed with Robin and Matt's acting abilities, they still didn't save the movie. I'm not sure what I really didn't like about the movie. Maybe it's because I dispise math. Maybe I'm not too much for dreary talking for 2 hours. Even though I loved "American Beauty", but that was it. I just want my 2 hours back. It was a big waste of my time. If I'm missing something in this movie, please E-mail me. I am curious why this is on the top 250. And don't say "Because it was a good movie".2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is a very solid and quiet film. I just finished watching it for the second time on DVD and was more impressed by the screenplay than I was the first time. I thought the first time I saw the film it was only Van Sant's direction that held it all together. The movie is just well written and well directed. I think the casting was good, although I don't think Ben Affleck does a very god job in this film. Robin Williams deserved his Oscar, although a big part of me still thinks it belonged to Robert Forster for Jackie Brown. Matt Damon is very good in the lead role. I particularly like the scene toward the end when Matt and Robin's character's open up. The emotion is overwhelming and that is some great acting. The rest of the cast is good too, and Gus Van Sant's direction is powerful. Great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matt Damon and Ben Affleck shine in a film full of shining moments. There seemed to be very little wrong with this film, and it is a shame the Oscar committee decided to pass on this film as the best of 1997. Not only were Will and Chuckie endearing characters, every one else in the film conveyed a smooth and natural performance. Even Minnie Driver proved she could fit in her role as Skylar. This film also introduced me to Stellan Skaarsgard, who I think is a very underated actor. A great follow-up of `To Die For' from director Gus Van Zant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it about this movie that people like so much? It is just a two-hour cliche, and a stiflingly boring one at that. It is essentially just a badly done and more obnoxious version of Little Man Tate or Searching for Bobby Fischer. However, the thoroughly average Matt Damon takes the part of the astounding misunderstood genius to a new level. Why? Because, get this: he's... older! Wow! What a twist! That makes it totally different!The only bright spot of this movie is Robin Williams who was cast in the sadly stagnant role of the person who just wants to help our little genius, just as Jodie Foster did in Little Man Tate, or Laurence Fishburne in Searching for Bobby Fischer. Then, we have Stellan Skarsgard in the role that Dianne Wiest and Ben Kinglsey played in the aforementioned films: the academic who is vilified for their attempts to help the genius realize his squandered potential.The only difference that this movie has from the other two I've mentioned is that the misunderstood genius is more independent and gives the establishment a lot of grief. Yeah, Will! Damn the man! Steal an idea! Take Little Man Tate, make him 10 years older and pretend it's a whole new movie!Number 28 in the top 250? What is the world coming to?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Movie, Great Plot, Great Actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off, I would highly recommend this to any viewers 16 and older who are mature enough to understand the beauty of the film. This Oscar award winning film so full of emotion you feel as if you are right in the story feeling what Will feels. When Will proves the equation on the board, the momentum begins to pick up. Soon after proving he is a genius, he shows that he is also a brute, and a lover. He can take on hooligans as well as keep a girlfriend. The movie shows how Will and Mr Lambeau begin to connect through their mathematical triumph, but the professors spot in the boys heart quickly fades as he meets a therapist he cannot best. Robin Williams plays Sean Maguire, a run down psychologist working at a community college. He teaches Will many lessons through the pain of his wife's death. He explains how his brain does not allow him to comprehend true emotional responses in situation, he knows them, but does not feel them. The movie is really all about the transformation of this Albert Einstein boy played by Matt Damon from a bum to a functioning member of society. The actors play their roles perfectly and are made for these roles. This movie allows us to see parts of ourselves reflected in Will, and almost brings you to tears when Will breaks down. Flawless movie except for all the cursing to make it R seemed very unnecessary and out of context, otherwise beautiful execution.</fullReview>

Ben Affleck and Matt Damon definitely earned their Academy Award for their screenplay. Ben Affleck's acting seems sub-par at times, but he has a fantastic speech in the middle of the movie. Robin Williams and Matt Damon's chemistry is a wonder to behold. This movie will send you soaring one moment, then sad and depressed the next moment.

		<fullReview>At first the story centers around Will Hunting (Matt Damon) who is a brilliant young man and his struggles in life. Then we are introduced to a wonderful cast whom are only the best, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, and Stellan Skarsg?rd. What you will enjoy the most it'll be the humor, the well-written dialogs, the passion, and even the emotions come off the screen. Only showing what would happen in reality, allowing us to see how others feel and go on in life, while still having some awkward moments and mature language (only us adults understand). As always genius Robin Williams demonstrates that you don't need to be over-dramatic, but have a piece of both fun and seriousness.In conclusion, well ? If you really think that your life is worthless then renew yourself in this movie. It is very inspiring ? Life is too short to throw it all away. Definitely recommended to everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a powerful film. I always say that a great film, book, TV show, etc should have me reacting throughout: laughing when the characters laugh, feeling the need to cry when they cry, feeling loss when they experience loss, and so on. So by my definition, Good Will Hunting is a great film. It's so real and moving, but in such a wonderful way that isn't depressing or unbearably dark like so many films that deal with similar concepts.I am just so impressed with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's writing skills, and at such a young age. Their ability to handle some of the serious subject matter that comes up in this movie is incredible, as is the creation of such well developed characters that interact in a beautifully natural way. You can feel the chemistry radiate from the screen, especially with the relationships between Matt Damon's character and his best friend (Ben Affleck), love interest (Minnie Driver), and "therapist" (the late Robin Williams). Fantastic dialogue, fantastic story, fantastic characters, and even some fantastic scenery and visuals. For all of these reasons, as well as many more detailed reasons which I am just a bit too tired to dive into right now, this movie has made my "Everyone Needs To Watch At Least Once" list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting (1997): Dir: Gus Van Sant / Cast: Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Minnie Driver, Stellan Scarsgard, Ben Affleck: Compelling drama about someone on the wrong side of the track. Will Hunting is a janitor at the institution of technology and he has a photographic memory. He is discovered solving mathematics problems that students fail to solve. His boozing and fighting land him in jail until he is bailed out by a professor who wishes to use his talent. He is set up with numerous therapists whom he makes fools out of until he is met with one who refuses to turn away. Good screenplay only falters with repetition but it is a superb achievement by Gus Van Sant. He previously made such intriguing films as Drugstore Cowboy and To Die For. Matt Damon is excellent as Hunting whose attitude buries nasty scars that predictably arise from his past. Robin Williams counters repetition by delivering one of his best performances as the psychiatrist who utters those powerful lines, "It's not your fault." Minnie Driver is Hunting's girlfriend who is a student but also cares enough to endure his pain until she cannot anymore. Stellan Scarsgard as the professor introduces the plot and receives hard facts. Ben Affleck plays Damon's friend on the wrong side of the track who will advice Will Hunting to travel the right road. It is a great film about coming to terms with yourself and your past. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A timeless classic, surely brilliant and one of the first movies I have ever watched where I wanted to be the main character. Will's impeccable ability to calculate with his amazing mathematical abilities is the ticket he's sitting on and not cashing in. Will not being in his slightest interest of math is so comparable with how realistic people are today. Will's perceptions from his friends, and shrink have him going where his heart desires all along. The true test of his might is truly what he wants, there was a relative feeling in him that we all feel of being in a familiar setting, but not knowing where to go, what to do. This is a movie to grow up to, find new understanding and can put an impressionable guilt in someones mind. The soundtrack from Elliot Smith is the icing on the cake and translates so transparently on the day to day life that Will Hunting lives. Good Will Hunting, a must watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting is about a hotheaded genius and his struggle to reach his potential.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant's classic movie, Good Will Hunting, portrays the multi-faceted dynamic of the human soul. Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, is a lowly janitor at MIT. However, his abilities far surpass his position. While cleaning the the math rooms after class hours, Will stops to solve a difficult problem that a professor had posted on his white board. Within minutes the problem is solved and staff and students alike are baffled. Once his genius is realized, the professor aims to mentor and facilitate him in order for Will to reach his full potential. The problem, however, is that Will has created walls that are nearly impossible to break down. These walls prevent him from fully connecting with those in his life, something we see through the actor's guiltless and nonchalant toying with the emotions and authority of others. After getting in a fist fight over an old feud, he is required to see a therapist once a week to stay out of jail. &nbsp;His therapist Sean Maguire, played by Robin Williams, allows us to see Will's complexity of character. During their sessions, Will's jabs and banter only furthers Sean's desire to break down his barriers. It is Will's physical and verbal defenses to Maguire's gentle probing that show how deeply his problems run. As their sessions progress, the doctor-patient relationship quickly turns into a strong and mutual friendship, and we can see the characters grow and develop through their interactions. Throughout the movie, Damon perfectly plays the wounded genius who has been knocked down one too many times, covering up his hurt with sarcasm and quickly delivered wit. Damon's delivery and mannerisms progress the character... His air of mental superiority and disdain for following authority can easily be seen. The flippant way in which Damon treats others and their emotions helps to bring to light his own character flaws. Similar to Damon, Williams does a wonderful job at showing his character's broken heart and carefully controlled despair. He is haunted by his past, and that is apparent through his acting. In moments where a touchy subject is brought to light, Williams lashes out both physically and verbally. This aggression is contrasted greatly by his usually calm and caring demeanor. Williams makes this switch seamlessly, making his character's pain believable. The script fosters the relationship of the two men, showcasing the benefits that each receives from it. In viewing Good Will Hunting, it is obvious that the scriptwriters know a great deal about the human complexity, brought greatly into play in a scene when Maguire attempts to convince Will that what happened in the past was not his fault. Each character seems to struggle with their sense of self, and we see a general fear of stepping out of the comfort zone. While these issues are covered in the script, the delivery is fast paced and keeps us interested and thoroughly entertained throughout. There are many one-liners sprinkled into heavy conversations to add comic relief, as well as helping the script stay true to the characters themselves. In a world filled with clich movies that all seem much the same, Good Will Hunting stands out from the masses. It showcases incredible acting and a dynamic script that forces us to reflect upon our own lives. Watching this movie makes one introspectively assess one's own character flaws, much like Will, and inspires one to do something about them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring and uplifting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this film about three or four times now, including twice this year and it has grown on me since I first watched it. If there is one word I could use to describe this film, it is inspiring. Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, a janitor who works at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is a self taught genius who has no formal education. He also doesn't know what to do with his ability. Enter Dr Sean Maguire (Robin Williams in his career best role), a therapist that helps Will try to make the most of his abilities. The chemistry between Damon and Williams is electric and plays a big part in making this movie magnificent. Very effective portrayal of a therapist-patient relationship. Besides the two leads, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver and Stellan Skargard provide great support. Besides their acting, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deserve just as much credit for their Oscar winning screenplay as the story is uplifting. This film was a bit stiff not to win Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actor-Matt Damon but did get it right with Robin Williams winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in a truly touching performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A journey to acceptance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Damon as Will Hunting is a troubled young man with an incredible gift for mathematics. As he makes his way from boyhood to manhood he continues to struggle with the issue of his parents' abandonment and his foster-family's abuse. This tale chronicles his journey to accepting himself, his gifts and love from others.Along on the journey with Will Hunting are his three best friends Chuckie Sullivan played by Ben Affleck, Morgan O'Mally played by Casey Affleck and Billy McBride played by Cole Hauser. Will refer to these three as his brothers. After meeting his love interest Skylar, played by Minnie Driver, Will mentions twelve such brothers.Will's violent childhood helped him develop a tendency for violence hence his frequent jail stays. When Professor Gerald Lambeau, played by Stellan Skargard, discovers Will's genius, he brokers a deal with Will and the judicial court to council and develop Will's talent and keep him out of trouble. As part of the deal, Will must agree to see a counselor once a week. After many failed attempts, Gerald settled on Sean Maguire, played by Robin Williams. These characters are expertly played. They feel like real people.Will's journey begins in a very small town in Boston, Massachusetts. His world his small, his impact upon it is big. The prevailing theme of Good Will Hunting is acceptance. Will is very much not accepted by the very people that are supposed to nurture and protect him. Will is rejected by his parents, his abusive foster parents and court system.Running not so silently yet parallel to the theme of acceptance is the struggles of everyone in Will's life. Counselor Sean Maguire is struggling to put the pieces of his life back together since his wife died of cancer two years ago. Sean's first meeting with Will in his office lays bare the wounds he is struggling with healing. Will notices a painting that Sean created hanging on the wall and suggest that his choice of color reveals that he is just shy of cutting off his ear like the tragic painter Vincent Van Gogh. Will continues to dig at Sean and suggests that his wife left him. This reference to Sean's wife touched a nerve and elicited a violent reaction towards Will. This scene is an excellent example of using the close-up to create drama and tension. Clearly the acceptance of and struggle with the death of his wife of 16 years is not under control for Sean. Will suggestion of abandonment by Sean's wife is akin to the abandonment he felt as a child along with Sean's violence are two things that Will is familiar with. They are a familiar comfort to him.Professor Lambeau's desire to cultivate in Will that potential for greatness he sees leaves him struggling with the past. Professor Lambeau was discovered 20 years ago by the think-tank at M.I.T. Yet in that time he has failed to distinguish himself among the greats. Determined to do more for Will, he pushes Will to strive for more. The professor wants Will to immerse himself in the academic life at M.I.T, collaborate with other professors to solve complex problems that have eluded them for years and to pursue employment with the most prestigious firms in the world. Will pushed back and rejects Professor Lambeau's efforts as he is not ready to accept his gifts or the fact that someone else could really care enough about him to see him succeed in life. Will's sabotage of his opportunities are so profound that Professor Lambeau's confesses that he wished he had never met Will. The idea that Will would actually squander his genius and throw away is future sickens Professor Lambeau. It leads him to question his own career at M.I.T. This forced rejection by Professor Lambeau is what Will has come to expect in his life. So much so, if he is not rejected, he will cause rejection. This is a familiar comfort to him.The main thematic idea of acceptance and the subordinate theme of struggle is also prevalent in the film Chocolate. The main character Vianne Rocher wants to be accepted by the people of a small town in France.Like the setting for Good Will Hunting, Chocolat is set in a very small town where Vianne has a very big impact. She too has an unusual talent for making decadent chocolate treat and wants other to share in her passion for the art. However, Vianne struggles against the moral code of tranquility and abstinence from all things pleasurable of the people. Vianne's need for acceptance is also running counter to her constant need to roam. The life of a free soul, instilled into her by her mother's free spirit, pits her against herself, the townspeople and her talent as a chocolatier. As Vianne's overtures to bring indulgent pleasure to the townspeople are rejected, she prepares to leave that town and roam even more. This rejection and need to run is a familiar comfort to Vianne.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After recently seeing one if matt damons best performances in the Martian it made me really want to see this film. The premise of this film sees this incredibly smart janitor at MIT who goes to therapist to try and fulfill his potential. This was one of matt Damon's first lead performances and he is brilliant in this film. He was a great character that you want to root for even though he clearly has his issues. He was an incredibly interesting character that is one of Damon's best. The best performance in this film is that of the late robin Williams. He was such a great character as you see him and Damon interact in these sessions and it is some of the best chemistry I have ever seen in a film with some very memorable lines. Ben affleck really works as Damon's best friend and I really liked their chemistry in this film. Winona Ryder is great as Damon's girlfriend and their relationship really worked in this film. Stellan skarssgard is the professor trying to get the best out of Damon and I thought he was a very interesting character in this film that provided an opposite to Williams. The story was really good especially with Damon and all the relationships he encounters in the film especially Williams. It is fascinating seeing the mentality of will as he goes through this journey in the film. The script is great with some truly funny dialogue and some great drama. The style of the dismal setting works for this film. However, the only problem with this film is that of the pacing of the film as it can drag a little bit. Overall though this is a fantastic film that deserves all its praise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant brings a dramatic, emotional filled, inspiring, movie to theaters. We see familiar actors that we have seen in a lot of great movies. Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting, a janitor at M.I.T who has gift for mathematics but has a big record for crimes he as done. After many run-ins with the law there is only one person who can help him: a psychology professor ( Robin Williams) who may be able to turn his life around. This film was very emotional to me. It has a great plot and great script and many turning points throughout the movie. Van Sant used actors that were good to his taste and had many years of experience with acting and were great with their roles: Matt Damon's character was very dramatic and emotional throughout the movie and the hardships he faces. Robin Williams played his role really good that I felt it was just perfect as he explains to Will that deep down in him there is good inside while Ben Affleck and Minnie Drive were great too- both played good in their roles and probably liked Van Sant's way of directing. During a number of scenes it was sort of hard to follow what was happening but as I kept watching I understood how connected the characters were together and the strong chemistry they had. Overall the film is very creative, emotional, and dramatic and worth watching numerous times. This movie shows how deep down this is good in every person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The winner of Project Greenlight, "Good Will Hunting" to me deserved to win every award that there was giving in 1997. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck did an amazing job depicting the want to be good enough to move on with "will" a metaphor established for the main character "Will" as he journeys from his innermost want to a real goal in society. The story journeys with Will as he battles his own demons for a chance to express himself in smarts. The movie explores the differences in classes in society in Boston but really stood as a metaphor not just for that difference in society, but of gender, status and affiliation as well. Themes that came up were "boys will be boys", "I am the King of my own mansion", "where there's 'will', there's a way" and "dreams, they do come true".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams best performance thanks to an incredibly solid script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I'd ask you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet. But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. Known someone that could level you with her eyes, feeling like God put an angel on earth just for you."The scene where Robin Williams' Sean Maguire sits on a park bench with Matt Damon's Will Hunting to have their little shrink session about life, love, and identity is perhaps my favorite cinematic moment ever. More than a conversation, it is a monologue that Robin Williams delivers with incredible passion and it gives me goosebumps every time I watch this scene. It's the reason why he won an Academy Award for best supporting actor and why the film works as well as it does. This is just one fantastic moment, but I can think of many more scenes that left me completely in love with the movie. Like the scene where Sean Maguire and Stellan Skarsgard's Prof. Lambeau have their long awaited discussion about ego and missed opportunities ("You think I'm a failure. I know who I am, and I'm proud of what I do. I was a conscientious choice, I didn't ef up! And you and your cronies think I'm some sort of pity case. You and your kiss-ass chorus following you around going, "The Fields Medal! The Fields Medal!" Why are you still so efin' afraid of failure?"), the scene where Sean narrates Game 6 of the World Series to Will, which he passed on for the opportunity to meet his future wife (I just slid my ticket across the table, and I said, "Sorry, guys; I gotta see about a girl."), and of course the final scene between Will And Sean which I don't want to spoil. There are just so many great moments in this film thanks to the strong performances and the amazing screenplay from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck which is one of my favorites. Even the scenes between Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and between Damon and Minnie Driver are incredible and I still have to leave them out of my top five favorite scenes in this movie because there are just so many. And I even left out Will's amazing monologue about why he shouldn't work for the N.S.A. It's simply one of the best written movies ever and it has Robin Williams best performance (that is saying a lot considering how much I loved his work in Dead Poet's Society, Good Morning Vietnam, and The Fisher King). "You're not perfect, sport, and let me save you the suspense: this girl you've met, she's not perfect either. But the question is whether or not you're perfect for each other." I don't know if Good Will Hunting is a perfect film, but I know it is perfect for me and for that reason it will always be included as one of my all time favorite films up there with The Sixth Sense and The Dark Knight. I have plenty of other favorites which I sometimes include in my top ten, but those three are always at the very top of my list, and I don't even worry about having to discuss it with anyone else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful vehicle for every actor involved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is a wonderfully paced, highly engaging drama that focuses on each character with painful emotional authenticity. I mean, literally, painful. The human struggles facing Matt Damon and Robin Williams' characters are so universal and beautifully realized. Every man must face one of their points of view, at some point. The hurt that Robin portrays is touching, sad and moving. You never see his wife. He just reminisces of her and it couldn't have felt more real. The subtleties in Robin's performance in this film are breathtaking as he laughs, cries and has his patience pushed over the edge.I really cannot imagine a better filmmaker to direct this picture than Gus van Sant. The way in which he portrays the troubled gifted young man, Will Hunting, cannot only be seen in this film, but in Elephant, as well. His ability to direct young talent is seen in the handling of Matt Damon as a new actor; the fearlessness with which he tackled demanding emotional close-ups and expressive subtlety is remarkable. The plot setup is traditional, yet flawless, with a slow reveal of more dense emotional conflicts in an eventual, memorable series of climactic peaks involving Will's closest acquaintances.Structurally, I do not think Good Will Hunting breaks any new ground. That is fine. If you are expecting a new type of storytelling or narrative formula, don't.Any lack of narrative experimentation is completely overshadowed by the powerful performances provided by every single cast member, except for Ben Affleck. Nothing personal, I actually like him, but, in this film, he is still clearly a new actor with potential to be achieved. He undoubtedly holds the reigns on one of the single most emotionally charged moments of the film, but, just doesn't shine in my opinion. Affleck is perfectly likable and I would say he was well cast - I don't think his chops were quite on Damon's level yet, though, which only became obvious in the latter half of the film.The tension of everyone's intellect crashing together is a real treat. Typically, this kind of heightened drama is based on violence or stunts, but, the way Good Will Hunting carries its highly taut narrative is through the intellectual conflicts amongst some very smart characters, not through empty spectacle. It was nice to see the love interest as a highly educated equal to the male lead and not a damsel-in-distress. She challenges Will emotionally and intellectually, something he is not used to in his even closest of relationships. You can understand everyone's point of view whether you disagree with them or not.Damon, Williams, and Skarsgard's roles are highly charged and particularly well executed. They all deserve major recognition for their acting talent in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of emotion presented in a realistic way, though with a slightly weaker story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this movie is slightly lacking in its storyline, this is overshadowed by its realism (or realisticness, whichever you prefer). I think people expect it to be a good story with people doing rather extraordinary things in context of an ordinary life. You could argue that the people in this movie are intellectually exceptional and that it is almost impossible for them to do anything ordinary, making my point from above incorrect. However, I think that Will's actions at the end prove that he leads an ordinary life. His conflict is one that everybody faces in one way or another at some point. He has the ability to work in an important job and be rich and famous for his mathematical abilities. However, he feels like following that path isn't worth his time as he states very clearly in his run-on about why he shouldn't join the NSA. My feeling is that he thinks he won't be good at a job like that because his heart won't be in it. At my high-school it seems like there are lots of higher achieving students who all say they either want to study law or medicine or something like that. While those are important and high-paying fields, I doubt that all of them are interested in that. This does not apply to everyone in that position of course, but it holds true for Will, as we see Lambeau try to push him and make him pursue things that Will doesn't want to.This is where Sean steps up in a key role, because he understands exactly what Will is going through. As an associate and equal of Lambeau, he knows that not everyone with the potential for greatness is designed for greatness. Unlike Lambeau, he doesn't pressure Will into doing anything. Instead, he cross examines all of Will's mindsets to give him a better understanding of life. Sean's relation of how he met his wife sort of sums up the points he tires to show Will: that nobody understands you, so they should not be the ones to determine your future and should respect the choices you make. Of course, there are some problems with this theory, but if balanced with reason and temperance it is a pretty good philosophy. I might be completely wrong about that, but that's the main thing I got out of this movie. With the loosely structured story, the characters and their relationships push the plot along. This mostly involves Will growing closer to Skylar and Sean as he becomes more distant from Chuckie and his other friends. Once he realizes that he is in danger of losing his old life, he lashes out at Lambeau and does the same to Skylar when he sees that he will probably lose her. So in short, the plot is driven by emotion.This emotion and the events that it causes are balanced very well by the realisticness of the characters. They all have very believable flaws and strengths that conform with the rest of their personalities. Their decisions are mixed with human nature and the individual natures of the characters. The language included, while perhaps excessive in cinematic terms, does not feel over the top since the curses are used in contexts that real-life and unscripted people use them in.The acting is about as good as it gets, but the script has room for criticism. The cinematography and other technical execution flows naturally, but has no outstanding features. Essentially, it's executed well enough that you shouldn't notice one way or the other.I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys an emotional story, though not in a romantic or traumatic sense. There is comedy sprinkled throughout, but it should not be viewed in search of continuous laughs. Don't be deceived into thinking that it's a comedy because Robin Williams is in a main role. If you absolutely hate movies that have messages in them, be warned that this is one of those movies, but it kind of lets you take what you want from it in terms of a message. It's okay to watch with people that are prone to making comments throughout, as long as that doesn't distract you too much, but don't watch it at a party or anything. But, if you like a solid film, there's a good chance you'll enjoy the movie. Overall Rating: 8.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story has a genius. Two fabulous actors lead the show. Though they are a different sort of genius from the rest, they stand out. One genius (Matt) who is a janitor at a prestigious university shows his identity by solving a fabulous math equation. He is discovered as the new Ramanujan of our time. Though this tale so unlikely to happen stands firmly. The other genius is Of (Robin) who comes in contact with this cocky kid by mistake then for a favor for an old friend. The two really have all of it together. Fight, stare, compete and eventually share. The greatness of this movie is in the bonding of two souls. Then freeing and soaring away into their destinies. Magical flick with deep messages. Perfect watch for humor and inner growth. Almost all the characters have a strong stand, save for the heroin. Their are some immortal scenes in this movie. Don't miss the magic of life. Truly beautiful. Moving and a tale of love.</fullReview>

Anyways if you haven't watched this movie then i recommend it to anyone who loves moving movies. 10 out of 10 easy. I personally love Matt Damon as an actor and he truly gives one of the best performances of his career. And if u love movies then I would like to recommend another movie, A Beautiful Mind.

		<shortDescription>The Best Thing Kevin Smith Ever Touched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a janitor at M.I.T., has a gift for mathematics, but needs help from a psychologist (Robin Williams) to find direction in his life. What do we have here? An early acting job for Casey Affleck, produced by Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier (the best thing they have ever touched), with a score from Danny Elfman. That score is something else, because it is not one that Elfman is usually associated with, being much more subtle than his typical work.Is this Matt Damon's best role? Most likely. Robin Williams' best role? Quite possibly. Ben Affleck's best role? Maybe even that. This film just sort of brought the best out of everyone involved, and is entertaining to boot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't stress enough how much this film means to me. Since my youth, I was always quite taken with Boston ?&nbsp;Cambridge in particular. As a portrait of the academic culture's conflict with the working class culture, it can't be stressed enough that though there is something of a fairy tale quality to this, it captures the grit-teeth of the Boston working class quite convincingly. The story of the evolving relationship between Will (Damon) and Dr. Sean Maguire (Williams) is fraught with difficulty, but offers an honest reflection of the sobering power of friendship in the face of self-defeat brought on by child abuse. I think always in particular of this moment where Maguire speaks to Will and gives him the advice ? that it's not his fault. We must remember this, through all our own traumas and abuses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional movie about accomplishing goals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is set in Boston, I would take a guess and say the late 90's. A lot of filming was made at Bunker Hill Community College, but also at one or two pubs, a park(not the one where you park your car) and a local diner. It takes place at approximately the course of six months, judging how the movie proceeded. Will, a janitor at M.I.T, is a man of personality. Although he is a man of secrets, one in particular crosses your mind. He loves to read. This is rather weird because of the fact that his "crew", or friends, are rather dull-witted to be honest. Because his love of reading, he has developed a habit of being well-read on all subjects. One day, Prof.Gerald Lambeau posts a math quiz on the public board in the hallways. After some time when nobody still hasn't solved it, Will decides to try, and scores right away. Prof.Gerald later discovers this, and goes of on a search for the one who solved it, thus Will wants to remain anonymous. When the Professor later finds out that Will is the one who solved it, he tries to negotiate with the Judge to keep Will out of jail, Will having recently gotten in a fight. In the deal however, Will must once a week meet a psychologist for his anger management. And of course as in any movie, Will also meets a girl, Skylar, that will turn out to be a turn for Will's life...A scene I remember in particular is when the first or maybe the second meeting when Will brings up Sean the psychologists deceased wife, whom Will does not know about, and presume that she is no more in his life because of she left him or was cheating. This outrages Sean because his wife and himself had a really close bond and they truly loved each other. Just as Will was to finish his sentence, Sean grabs Will's neck and says; "If you ever disrespect my wife again, I will end you". After this they split apart, but I believe that this awoke something in Will, some sort of empathy for Sean, because Will is a foster child who had a crooked childhood and maybe feels like he's missing something too...I would say that this movie is about following your dreams, not being afraid at trying something new, taking the big step and be brave enough to fulfill it. The theme is mainly drama, but maybe a little bit of a romantic theme as well.I actually liked this movie, I can't really though put my finger on it. It's a very deep movie with a lot of emotions. If i would rate it, I would give it a 9/10 because i believe that all movies need a bit of comedy, which this one lacked. Everything else was excellent.I remember the first or maybe the second meeting when Will brings up Sean the psychologists deceased wife, whom Will does not know about, and presume that she is no more in his life because of she left him or was cheating. This outrages Sean because his wife and himself had a really close bond and they truly loved each other.

		<shortDescription>don't be afraid to live and love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I like about this movie is that it's very kind. It makes you believe in good people and good things.Will was a very gifted boy with a difficult childhood, who trusted nobody but his 3 best friends. They were his family, he would never leave them. Neither for a good and well-paid job, nor for the girl he loved.He didn't believe in this traditional values, like making a career or starting a family. He knew too well that people betray and can turn their back on you when you least expect. He had his life and wasn't gonna change anything.But then he was noticed by Prof. Lambeau who for some reason decided to help this very smart but rebellious boy. With his help Will met Dr. Maguire who not only was able to win Will's trust but also managed to encourage him to change something and try new things.Some people can never believe in themselves, until someone believes in themI like their conversation in the park, where Sean Maguire said that Will knew nothing about life. All his knowledge was too theoretical, borrowed from books, not from his life experience. He was afraid to open his heart to new people or new things. Eventually he found some peace as well as also Dr. Maguire who had been hiding from real life since the death of his wife.I liked Skylar, how open she was when she was talking about her feelings to Will, how honest and understanding she sounded. But still, I believe that the only reason why Will dared to change his life, was because his best friend Chuckie told him to do that. He kinda gave him permission. You should really care about someone to let the person go for his own good.I love the film, I love the performance. I never got the feeling it was some acting, they all were so real and genuine. Interesting plot, great acting, happy ending. It totally deserves THE 2 Oscars it got.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked the movie because it was so true. Everything wasn't perfect like in a fairy tale, people had problems with love, friendship and other things in life just like it is in the real world. It contained interesting characters and the actors were great. The plot was very interesting and fun. For being the first movie Matt Damon and Ben Affleck ever wrote it was mind-blowing. I sure would never be able to pull of something that good as a first time writer.In my interpretation of this movie its message is that your childhood means more to your future than you think and even if you grow up to be in a certain way, it is never to late to change. That is an important lesson in life. The best scene in the move according to me was the one when Will meets Skylar for the very first time, in the Harvard bar. I think it is very funny when Will arrived and rescued Chuckie from a conversation in which he had not a clue what he was talking about. At the same time, he impressed Skylar and made her interested in go out with him. The theme of this movie is a mix of human relationships, love, fear, social problems and friendship.If you haven't seen it yet i would certainly recommend you to do it. I give it 10 out of 10 points</fullReview>

Affleck and Damon have written an amazing story that compares to no other and really tugs at your heartstrings without, in any way, being soppy, gushy, or unrealistic. Yes, there is a lot of profanity, but that is real life! People swear! If you look past the four-letter-words, you'll be able to see all this movie has to offer.The acting is also incredible. Robin Williams was stunning in his performance as Sean. I had never seen him do a serious role before I saw this film, and he blew me away with his talent. Matt Damon also shines.The movie is completely compelling and absolutely beautiful. And, I don't often cry during movies, but the scene where Will breaks down crying in Will's arms really gets me. Honestly, it's my favorite scene I've ever seen in any movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then I like to step away from reviewing a new theatrical or Blu-ray release and talk about movies that have already been out for some time now.I,as I'm sure the rest of the world,am still deeply hurt to hear about the tragic death of Robin Williams.So I wanna share my opinions on one of his most celebrated movies and movie roles in Good Will Hunting. William Hunting is a young,South Boston raised punk who works as a janitor at M.I.T.Ironically,despite being "just a janitor",Will can solve math equations that baffle even the school's top professors.After anonymously solving a nearly impossible math problem posted in the school halls,he gets the attention of one of the school math professors. With the teachings of Prof. Lamdeau,played by Skarsgard,and regular therapy visits with a community college psychology professor,Will gets the opportunity to really show just what his young brain is capable of while also finding a person he can open up and connect to in, Dr. Sean Macguire played flawlessly by the late,Robin Williams. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck both won Oscars for their screenplay of this movie back when it released and believe me when I say that this movie's script is one of the best in film in my opinion.I know that's a stretch but every character conversation,no matter what the mood of the scene,is filled with interesting and important dialog.I literally won't watch this movie with out subtitles just because I don't wanna risk missing an important piece of info or some character development.There are scenes in this movie that can bring me tears with either sadness or hilarity,this is definitely a layered movie.All this makes the story that much more believable and that of course makes for extremely likable and developed characters.Seriously even minor characters have their moments throughout. With these great characters,you definitely get great performances.Matt Damon is as good as I've ever seen him,he has these one takes where he goes on and on spewing out all this mind numbing but intriguing dialog.Ben Affleck is in this one,however he really plays the secondary character here.That doesn't mean he doesn't get a few good scenes here and there,I actually liked his character as well.Minnie Driver and Stellan Skarsgard both give really good supporting performances as well.As for Mr.Williams,I really don't have to say anything.What more need be said by now,you know? His performance in this movie puts you through so many different emotions as does his character and it works SO effectively,he's perfect! The music by Danny Elfman is subtle but really kicks when it has to and the cinematography is also actually very good after I rewatched this on Blu-ray.Gus Van Sant may not be a houshold name but he really has this way of making the movie seem almost like a documentary sometimes,he brings realism to his films and a lot of welcomed depth to his characters. With this review I'd like to say one last goodbye to my childhood hero,Robin Williams and praise his performance as well as this film that still gets me Every time!You can call it a sympathy rating but I cant help but give this movie a perfect 10/10 because its MY review and despite the circumstances,this is really a GREAT film and I love it.Of course I give GOOD WILL HUNTING MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION. BUY THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

It contains everything you've ever wanted in a film, from great character development, amazing dialog, funny scenes, beautiful cinematography, and impactive moments. Matt Damon plays a genius from the south side of Boston who spends the majority of his time hanging out with his degenerate group of friends who get into fights among other things. He is picked up by a professor who recognizes his genius, and is sent to work with Robin Williams in order to get his mental state up to a good level. After conflict and resolution, Damon and Williams end up working together and everyone is happy.The reason I love this so movie so much is because of the range of emotion displayed throughout.

		<fullReview>This is an intense movie and includes many strong performances, capped off by Robin Williams's, which is probably the best cinema performance of his career. The movie deals with a lot of social and psychological themes - denial, repression, social marginalization, self-esteem, love - without becoming corny or a spoof. That is, the story can be taken seriously, and for Hollywood, which has a track record of reducing event he most complicated issues to the most simplistic level, this is a major accomplishment. The title character, Will, played admirably by Matt Damon, really serves as a metaphor for every person unable to actual their potential. Minnie Driver's performance is especially powerful, but this is Robin Williams's movie. His performance as the treating psychiatrist who is able to break through Will's resistance and defenses may be the positive portrayal of a mental health therapist in cinema history. This movie should be watched by anyone who is interested in mental health and by the public in general because this movie is about us.</fullReview>

An excellent cast, led by a truly capable director, set this punchy drama apart from the herd.Van Sant brings the relationship between Will Hunting (Matt Damon) - a gifted young janitor with no direction - and his washed out psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) out front and center.Damon and Williams take on the challenge and present the audience with a deep and profound interaction; punctuated by strong emotion and subtle affection.Hunting's relationship with the witty Skylar (Minnie Driver) takes shape around Maguire's interaction with Hunting. Driver proves a strong leading lady, providing her character with incredible insight and affection, while keeping the rough edges firmly in place. Sharp camera work and toned down lighting bring an atmosphere of change to life in the film - while not shying away from depicting the grit and grind of daily life in blue collar Boston. Expertly crafted and strongly executed, Good Will Hunting is certainly a coming of age drama for posterity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gus Van Sant first caught my attention when I sat down with some friends to watch "Last Days", a biographical movie about the final days of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain. The movie was beautifully done, with many long and winding scenes shot in single takes that seemed to capture Cobain's final environment and mindset perfectly. It wouldn't be long before I would see his similarly styled drama "Elephant" about the events leading up to a school shooting. I knew he directed "Good Will Hunting" but somehow its taken me 17 years to finally sit down to watch it in its entirety, and I am so glad I finally was able to scratch this gem-- number 130 on the IMDb top 250-- off of the list.Hot-headed adult orphan Will Hunting (Matt Damon) leads a pretty normal life for a South Boston reprobate: between his janitorial job at MIT and getting shmacked with his buddies (Ben and Casey Affleck) at his local watering hole, Will is pretty unremarkable?except that he's a genius, an inexplicable phenom that has a wealth of knowledge about many topics, but due to his hard-knocks upbringing, never had any substantial education. When he starts surreptitiously solving the complex equations that are posted in the MIT halls to challenge the students, he catches the attention of mathematics professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard). Gerry learns that Will is in trouble with the law, and is able to make a plea with the judge: In leau of jail time, Will has to study mathematics with Gerry and go to routine therapy. After many failed attempts with a number of therapists, Gerry calls on his former college roommate and psychology professor, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to help. After butting heads initially, Will and Sean start to slowly solve the one problem that Will can't?his own internal struggle.This film is a wonderful examination of love, manhood, and socioeconomic status set to a gorgeous soundtrack (Danny Elfman). The relationship between Damon and Williams is priceless and powerful, beautifully scripted and masterfully executed (Williams won the Oscar that year for Best Supporting Actor with this role), and the addition of Minnie Driver is, to me, the icing on the proverbial cake. She is a beautiful and quirky addition to the cast and she and Damon are comfortable and charismatic together (her character was based on Damon's then girlfriend who left him for Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich just before filming). The script is a taut psychological ballet, with some of the best monologues I've heard in a good long while (Damon's rant about hitting the hash pipe and joining the National Guard especially!) To be completely honest, I think that the addition of the Affleck brothers brought this picture down a peg, though not nearly enough to weigh it down in a major way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matt Damon is Will Hunting; an underachieving math prodigy working as a janitor at M.I.T. He is discovered by a professor who, through a series of unusual events, is able to recruit the young genius to work on complex math formulas. Hunting has a severely deprived upbringing, involving foster care and physical abuse. Robin Williams; in his Academy Award winning role, shows up as a sympathetic psychiatrist who is recruited to rescue Will from his many demons. Williams and Damon are excellent, and the script is well written and smart, although it turns a bit too sentimental for my taste at the end of over two hours. Van Zant could have tightened up the editing; noisy bar scenes are always an unnecessary tool; and there are at least one too many in Good Will Hunting. Even with its slight defects, the film is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matt Damon's breakthrough work. A masterpiece that's made possible by a good, simple, honest script, a bunch of high quality new faces and vintage actors, and a drive to tell meaningful story of real people.I watched this a second time recently, and picked up even more nuances that I missed years ago. Robin Williams played his 'therapist with unresolved past' part so perfectly. Great synergy between the young Damon and Williams.The under-estimated Minnie Drivers also made a supporting appearance here. Good chemistry between the love birds. Unforced, un-self-conscious naturalistic acting from actresses is so rare, a pleasure to watch.Evident in this movie, Ben Affleck is a genuinely modest human being who is really not conceited about his natural good looks or brain. I hope he take his return as writer-producer and actor-producer seriously. Hollywood can do with more progressive actor producers like him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple story, Beautiful telling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The GoodA great ensemble cast who play their roles perfectly. But it's the stand out performances of Williams and especially Damon that keep you hooked. Their immediate portrayal of polar opposite characters is the cornerstone for the film and watching their characters and relationship change is nothing short of brilliant. Many stand out moments from both but then Damon has his breakout moment and steals the show. The writing from the young Affleck and Damon is transferred very well to screen. They take a simple premise and slowly pull it apart until we have something beautiful to watch. It's dramatic, it's funny, it's sad. The writers make us relate and the actors make us believe in equal measure.The BadWhile the writers work the premise well, there are moments that are somewhat predictable. We know where the film is going and have worked out early on how it will end. They gave us great moments of drama, but no big twists in the story, it is very linear and i never felt like the route of the film would change. Also I felt it ended a whisker early. One more shot would have ended it well. The UglyThis is nit picking by now, but William's introduction followed the rather cheesy and much used line "Well there is one more!". This line wasn't needed. We knew Williams was coming and such an important character deserved a non clich'd welcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An understated genius works alongside an eccentric counselor to heal from his troubled past and learn the ropes to life, love, and acceptance in this feel-good film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting (1997) directed by Gus Van Sant tells the story of Will Hunting (Matt Damon), an MIT janitor who displays a genius level IQ by solving a mathematic equation that stumps even Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg?rd). Because of Will's rough background in a rough part of Boston includes a childhood plagued with abuse and causes him to have near-constant trouble with the law. After his genius is understood, Lambeau negotiates a deal to keep Will out of prison, given that he will attend court ordered counseling. Enter Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), Lambeau's college roommate who is a psychology professor at a nearby community college. Through therapy sessions with Will, Sean and Will both begin to heal from the pain of their pasts, as well as discover a hope for the future. Sean helps Will to open up to the notion of love through the stories of his wife's hilarious and endearing "idiosyncrasies." In the opening scene, Will meets Skylar (Minnie Driver) who persists until the end to help Will see that he is worth loving and being loved. The overall motif of Good Will Hunting is the idea of love and acceptance. Do we accept others enough to love them? Do we accept ourselves enough to allow others to love us? Do we accept our past in order to move on? Good Will Hunting is a classic coming of age tale that is excruciatingly relatable. The audience is enthralled with the poignant plot and the storyline is highlighted by the bare bones style of editing. Everything about this film feels very natural which is essential to the film feeling genuine rather than another Cinderella story clich. The lighting and sound are especially utilized because of the variance in setting. Will frequents a Harvard bar, Sean's office, as well as his own room. The sounds in each are very different: the loud chatter and bass music of the bar, the comfortable silences shared in Sean's office, and the buzz of incandescent lighting in Will's bedroom are all showcased. The lighting is also genuine to the settings being dimmer in the bar, almost sterile in the MIT scenes, and appropriately flickering in other scenes. Throughout the film, the audience follows the relationship between Sean and Will, as they both learn to accept themselves, each other, and their pasts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfection of "Good Will Hunting"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was by far the best constructed movie i have ever watch in my 17 years. The story line is excellent makes this movie interesting for it's entirety. The actors are 100% molded inside their character which gives the viewer an emotional connection to their feelings. And finally the movie contains none other than my favourite actor of all time.... ROBIN WILLIAMS. His effectiveness as an actor to exploit all the realms of his emotion treasure chest books is unparallelled. I mean he goes from playing peter pan and the genie, to an old lady and a therapist. Absolutely incredible. I for one am not a huge fan for swearing is movies, yet this movies uses then to perfection and it elevates this movies pedigree even further. It also helps when you have Ben Affleck and Matt Damon is a movie as well. This movie discuss the hardship to find perfection in ones life and in doing so has transposed perfection before our very eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If your looking at this review, trying to figure out if you should watch this movie or not I am going to help you out. I am one of those people that reads the 'User Reviews' and if your like me, we for whatever reason let them affect us whether good or bad. When I am stuck deciding between two movies I'll check the reviews and pretty much let that persuade me either way......AND I HATE THAT I LET IT HAPPEN!! We let ratings and reviews by complete strangers who have zero qualifications, make our decisions for us. I am as guilty as anyone. We have to stop listening to these FUN-HATING EBERT WANNABES who get their rocks off by writing these essay long reviews that contain nothing but BS. I feel sorry for those people that cannot watch a movie and enjoy it for what it is....a freaking movie. People who question the accuracy of FICTIONAL subject matter are sad, it's fiction get over it. I read a review someone wrote about how Matt Damon's character, who is a genius, all they complained about was how genius was misplayed and that a genius couldn't do this or they should do that so they rated 1/10 because they were so hurt by it. Don't let people who are mad at the world who don't get enjoyment out of life ruin what will be a very enjoyable movie experience. This movie rocks and you'll have lines to drop for days, you'll be talking in Boston accent for weeks after. WATCH IT YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU ARE GET A NEW HOBBY MOVIES Aren't FOR YOU.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the BEST Movies Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is spoiler-free. Please read on, especially if you haven't seen it yet.....Never has a film emotionally touched me more than this. Hands down, one of the best drama films I've ever seen. My father showed this movie to me at a young age. Unfortunately, he died not too long ago and I'm so thankful he showed me this wonderful film. After watching it several times in recent months, I observed some of the strengths that made him enjoy it as much as I did. Despite its noticeable flaws, it still holds up and leaves an impact in my heart!Is it slow-paced and predictable? Oh there's no denial about that yet it connects with us on such a deep level and gives us time to learn about these interesting characters. Also, the pacing is so hypnotic that I still didn't want to stop watching, even after it ended. The vast majority of people who dislike it are either disappointed by the hype it received or are offended by the excessive profanity. My solution for these two issues is incredibly simple. One is to get passed its publicity and just take it for what it is. As for the constant swearing, try not to judge the movie based on how times the F word is spoken and instead, merely appreciate the flow of dialogue or solely listen to the purpose of why things are being said. The only way to know whether it's good or not is to watch it. I'm aware that this movie isn't for everyone, but I personally recommend you sit down and watch it from beginning to end, even if you hate it afterward.For quite some time, it's been speculated that Kevin Smith and Rob Reiner at one point did revisions on the script, all the better for it! This movie is brilliantly written with powerful scenes and an alluring plot that revolves around a troubled man (played by the talented Matt Damon) who needs direction in life. Its internal conflict is something that is thought provoking with an astonishing payoff. The characters are alive and believable, while Van Sant effectively puts the audience in the right atmosphere. Some fans might have been disappointed with the apparent blandness of Skylar (played by Minnie Driver) or perhaps her weak performance, but I think she tried her best and had excellent chemistry with Will.In conclusion, watch this movie to see how amazing it is. Anyone who was associated with "Good Will Hunting" should be proud of themselves, because they have earned my respect as an audience member. Not exactly a masterpiece, but something you can relate to and care about!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart and touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting may be clich and predictable, but still an excellent film. Affleck and Damon, with the help of both Rob Reiner and William Goldman, created a history that is at the same time smart and very beautiful and touching. The conflicts of the main character may be very relatable to anyone. For example, how many times you've realized that you could do easily certain things, but you refused to do so 'only' because they aren't what you want for your life? Obviously, Will had his other conflicts, such as the trauma which leads him to do the bad things, and which as well disturb him in his relationships. This is what i found beautiful in this film. Even a genius has enormous troubles, because he is a human being like everyone. I found Will Hunting character very likable as well. I mean, how many persons never got in trouble choosing the job, trouble to plan his future, and etc. I bet that very few persons never experienced or met someone that never experienced that.The acting is very good. Damon is in shape, maybe bringing his best career's performance to this film. Robin Williams did a very good job as well, so well that the role earned an Oscar for him in 1998. The film's editing and cinematography are extremely well made. A curiosity would be the fact that despite the story's events being set in South Boston, great part of the main cinematography is set in Toronto.Anyways, Good Will Hunting is a good watch. 8.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Good Will Hunting when it first came out in theaters; I was blown away by the story line. The screen writing is of a caliber unknown. Although the story is predictable in places, it presents a feel good approach. When the movie is over, you feel happy. Good Will Hunting does not leave you dumbfounded or begging for more because it delivers on all aspects. The chemistry between the characters is out of this world. The casting was spot on; everyone fits into their roles perfectly. I watched this movie with my mom and she cried at the very end. My mom was happy that Will finally made peace and moved on to a better life. Also, we were relieved that he ended up with Minnie Driver in the end. The movie is happy, feel good entertainment that all adults can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A View Into The Mind Of A Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the past few weeks, one man alone has succeeded in dividing and provoking opinions from across the internet in the most significant entertainment news of the past seven days. Ben Affleck was announced to be picking up the Cowl and continuing the cinematic legacy of the Batman. With Christian Bales performance of the caped crusader still fresh in everyones minds, many are unwilling to give Affleck the chance to prove himself. It was at this point that I decided to revisit several of his different roles from throughout his career in an attempt to come to a conclusion. The first of these films being the touching 'Good Will Hunting', co- written and starring both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.When a series of difficult equations are solved by a university janitor, he is pursued by a professor after he is arrested following a street fight. Help comes from mysterious places as he is released on the grounds that he meets regularly with both a Therapist and the Professor in an attempt to help him realise his full potential.He goes through several therapists in quick succession as he outsmarts and analyses them prior to them being able to properly get to know him. This calls for Professor Gerard Lambeauto call upon his old college friend, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Both characters grew up in South Boston, which helps them to develop a connection that will test their limits.Will (Matt Damon) soon understands that he has met his intellectual equal and their meetings play out much like a game of chess. It's thrilling to watch them both trying to gain the upper hand only to constantly counter each other. Williams is such an accomplished actor, always perfecting the role of the caring teacher as Hunting desperately searches for a father figure after having a turbulent childhood. Realising this, Maguire opens up to share real life experience as the genius has limited himself so much, knowing only what he knows from literature and quotations to protect himself from the pain of losing people.All the characters have believable motivations for helping Will and it's good to see how they all approach it in different way. From the assertive, Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg?rd) who attempts to push the genius down various career paths to Sean, who tries to guide him to find his own path, understanding that Wills difficulties originate from the abuse and neglect that he experienced in his childhood.Although Affleck isn't in the lime-light throughout most of the movie there are several key scenes which really triumph in leaving a lasting impression on the viewer. With honourable mentions to his final, poignant scene. On the other hand, collaborating with Damon to create such an incredible script is a testament to their skill. Far from being a skeptic, this has really made me far more open to his take on the worlds greatest detective.The movie really tackles many issues as you see the darkness that some talented people can face on a daily basis and how his past overshadows his brilliance, preventing him from taking leaps towards a better life. It really is a film based on self discovery and the events that rekindle his intentions to push himself further in his existence begin as he comprehends how many people care for him. I'd recommend this film to anyone as it can really resonate with any viewer. Everyone will, at some point in their lives, question the path their life will lead and this really is an extreme example of this as he has ran himself into the ground over the years trying to find his direction only to rebuild his foundations and understand his potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, great story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People talks about the writing of the movie and the fact that it was great by Matt and Ben. I will add to this that both of them were young, 27 and 25 each which makes it even more great.We learn the story and the problems of Will as the movie proceeds and from the other hand we witness his skills. Will was not just good at mathematics, he was very smart in general. Shawn(Robin) had hard times to with his wife, so he understood Will and he taught him that he has to let people get closer to him so he can feel the love that he did even if he lost his. He did not became Will's therapist, he became his friend.Will was lucky as being aggressive led hem to a cage but some teacher bailed him out because he found a math theory which he wrote. But Will was lucky too because he had good friends. They had fun together but they all new he was really smart and they wanted what's best for him.Eventually, when with the help of Shawn Will decides to use his skills i am happy to see that the ending included the leaving of Will in the manner his best friend Chuckie hoped. He is happy for Will while he is sad that he does not know when he 'll see him again but that's a great friend. Finally, people say that this movie didn't need to have a happy "romantic" ending but i would be disappointed to see that he goes for work and does not give a chance to the girl he connected so much. After all that is what Shawn taught him so he realized that he had to take the risk, they have math in California. I would like to watch Will surprise Skylar in the final scene but it's OK, i know he did. And he finally said "i love you".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is a fantastic movie with a great storyline and a very inspired cast.The script is very well written and developed by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck,they should definitely write another movie together some day.All the performances in this are truly breathtaking,but the best performance has to go to Robin Williams,he is a very funny actor but he is also an outstanding dramatic actor,he showed this in movies like Dead Poets Society and Good Morning Vietnam,but he proved without any doubt that he is just as good being serous as he is funny,and even won an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance.There was great chemistry between Damon and Williams in there scenes together and those parts are without a doubt the movies highlights.Well written and superbly acted,I would recommend Good Will Hunting to anyone looking for a good drama. A janitor currently who dosen't want to change anything about his life,is discovered by a professor in the college he cleans at.He ends up having a special gift for mathematics,but refuses to do anything with this gift.He gets help from a psychologist to find out what his problem is.Best Performance: Robin Williams Worst Performance: Cole Hauser</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is an absolute genius in terms of screenplay and performances. Robin Williams is the best of the lot. Not only it binds one into the strong narrative but also compels to think for a while about personalities. No one in the movie is wrong or negative, not even prof. Gerald Lambeau :). It's all about perspectives, about believing that raw fish tastes good (what's good for you might not be the same for all)The rating might seem a little prejudiced to some, me being a big fan of Robin Williams :), but the movie definitely deserves a 10/10. Enjoy the show folks .. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie !!!! Better Soul and Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow saw this movie finally the other night because I had heard of this movie tons of times from my friends and have always heard references to this movie in other movies and shows on television.Good Will Hunting , from the great things I had heard from I assumed I would like it and I did - Matt Damon and Ben Affleck did a good job with this script / movie you can tell the work they put in to. The characters that Damon and Williams play are outstandingly brilliant in many ways. Damon and Affleck must have realized as they were putting the movie together as these characters develop so much through out the movie that they would touch the audiences hearts , they touched my heart. As Will Hunting has his ups and downs in life with his brain and some direction in his life from Sean ( robin Williams ) He grows up in a real way that I seen people do in life. Robin Williams can do comedies and dramas he has proved it in this role and other roles- him as Sean is very clever , witty , gentle has wisdom and very emotional in this movie especially about his wife and about Will in the way they form a bond. When ever Sean talks to Will there is a very special tone in his voice were he relates to Will and understands him very well.Skylar also added some special touches into Wills life were he realizes what love is and romantic wise ? adds to the movie . and Affleck ? well I finally know who he is and in the movie his and wills friendship is clearly seen after awhile.Good Will hunting is about a lot of things like Friendship , Love , believing in yourself , Helping out other people , Growing up and much more its a very beautiful movie - I think like a couple other people on here a bit to much swearing but I say this movie gets 8 and thats well!! I might have to watch this movie again soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just re-watched this movie about 10 years after last seeing it. And I realise now what all the fuss is about. The script is fantastic. And the acting is perfectly judged. The film has so many things going for it. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are superb, and they just gel so well on screen. Their gang of friends is lewd and crude but very affectionate and best of all, they swear authentically and talk in native accents. Robin Williams is a strong character as usual but most of the time is quite restrained, and acts well off other characters. Stellan Skarsgaard is perfectly convincing as a wily mathematics professor who is an old friend and rival of Williams' character. Minnie Driver acts well and has some great scenes, but I think her character is too much of "the love interest" -- it's a pity. The plot hums along nicely and, all in all, it's a satisfying movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One-of-the-best teacher-student drama ever PERIOD!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film shows the value of a good teacher in one's life and it also portrays the difficulties faced by geniuses so poignantly. In a way this also gives a preview of what is to come from both Affleck and Damon,brilliant in their own rights."Good Will Hunting" feels like instant therapy. It is about society's inclination to push people who maybe aren't ready to be pushed. And it's for those who believe they are academic underachievers. It does not realize how much it flirts with the "person who doesn't want to be helped" scenario. That is a powerful theme, used to devastating effect in films such as "Leaving Las Vegas" and "Taxi Driver." Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are happier than that. Where others see reality, they see hope. And so they won't quite go there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like the movie, I just think Boogie nights deserved a nomination more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that everybody will hate me for this, but I think that Good will hunting is one of the most overrated movies ever made. Aside from its acting, there's nothing really that special about it. I liked it, but it shouldn't have been nominated for best picture.Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, a janitor who has a brilliant mind but a terrible attitude. The film mainly focuses on his relationship with a professor(Robin Williams) who, as he gets to know him, is the only one who truly understands him.Now, I didn't dislike the movie. I thought the acting, especially from Damon, Williams, and Minnie Driver, who plays Will's girlfriend, was strong. And it held my interest the whole way through. But I really couldn't find much that special about it, excluding the performances.Some of the scenes are rather cheesy, I felt. And some of them are gut wrenching, but yet some are cheesy. Also, some of the characters are unnecessary. Those are Will's friends, played by Ben and Casey Affleck, and Cole Hauser. The scenes with them in it are weak compared to the rest of the film.Also, there are moments where the dialogue is smart and funny. But yet there are scenes where you can sense cheddar in the room.I'm glad that Damon has won an Oscar(not Affleck, cause I get the vibe he didn't actually contribute). But I don't think that they quite deserved it. Also nominated for best original screenplay was The Full Monty(love that movie) and Boogie nights(love that one even more).It sounds like I didn't like it. Not true. I never said it was a bad movie. I did enjoy it, just not as much as everybody else on planet earth. Sue me, I don't care. Boogie nights deserved its place on the Oscar ballot, or Jackie Brown. Good movie, has great moments and performances, but not a great movie.B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People who pursue an endeavor and lack the passion needed for fulfilling their venture, inevitably fail to generate success regardless of their talent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Working as a janitor at MIT, Will Hunting (Matt Damon) enjoys spending time with his friends Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), Billy McBride (Cole Hauser), and Morgan O'Mally (Casey Affleck). From the slums of South Boston, Will is a diamond in the ruff, as he possesses natural intellectual capabilities far beyond what is typically achieved from any formal education. Despite his extraordinary intellect, Will is haunted by a long history of self inflicted legal problems. After unintentionally exposing his raw talent for mathematics, Will is approached by Fields Medal winning Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg?rd) who offers to resolve Will's pending legal issues in exchange for two things: his assistance in solving mind-bending mathematical equations and his agreeing to speak with a therapist. With the unwavering determination of therapist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), Will is forced to uncover the secrets from his haunting past, confront his current misguided motivations and pressing relationship issues with lover Skylar (Minnie Driver), and evaluate the possibilities for his future. Good Will Hunting is a film that really drives home the idea that people who pursue an endeavor and lack the passion needed for fulfilling their venture, inevitably fail to generate success regardless of their talent. With the rallying support of those closest to him, Will remains uninterested in the countless opportunities he is presented through professional connections of Professor Lambeau, to do little more than use his highly evolved gift of intellect. Will's commitment to friends and his constant strive for self preservation are the only passions that drive his daily existence. He views his photographic memory and ability to solve the most complex of mathematical equations a burden, and uses his ingenuity only for personal gain or getting himself out of a sticky situation. Will's lack of interest in mathematics and defiant attitude towards the use of his incredible mind baffles and frustrates Professor Lambeau, as is boldly illustrated with the following remark to Will: "Sometimes I wish I had never met you. Because then I could go to sleep at night not knowing there was someone like you out there". Lambeau drops to his knees just prior to this line, and is looking up at Will who is standing in front of the Professor's door. The camera angle suggests that perhaps for the very first time, Lambeau feels inferior to someone who possesses no academic credentials or scholarly achievements. This is a significant and telling moment in the film since Lambeau proudly measures his success by the outstanding awards he has received over the course of his career. Lambeau spends his days living and breathing his love for mathematics. He has earned a Fields Medal and is highly regarded for his work. The Professor's self proclaimed success is, in his eyes, evident from the many awards he has received for his triumphs in mathematics. Similarly, therapist Sean Maguire considers himself a success in his own right. He draws upon his relationship with his wife and pursuing a career that he truly enjoys as being the factors that have made him a success. The noteworthy achievements for each of these men stem not from their intellect or unique talent alone; the passion they have for their work has led to their success. The very powerful message of what it means to be successful, and what it takes to get there, is carried from scene-to-scene throughout the entire film. Will Hunting is forced to expose his internal demons long enough to sift through years of baggage and determine what ignites his passion. Perhaps the most telling evidence that an insightful internal breakthrough is about to occur happens during the fourth therapy session with Sean, after Will had refused to speak to the therapist for the second week in a row. Very light music is the only audible sound at the beginning of the scene which then slowly fades into Sean whistling softly followed by a sudden silence. This brief moment of silence catches the attention of the audience directly before Will decides to finally speak. This dead track is strategically placed in this scene to draw attention to the fact that a change in relationship has occurred between the two characters. It also symbolizes an end to the fear of personal exploration that has prevented Will from facing his life head on, and finally puts to rest his days of cowering behind excerpts from an encyclopedia. Like so many people in the world today, Will Hunting spent twenty years of his life content with simply going through the motions of day-to-day life. Regardless of his incredible talent, there was no self proclaimed success because his talents were not his passion. Simply put, the foundation necessary for achieving success was nonexistent. Passion is not difficult to come by, but one must be willing to embrace their inner most desires and perhaps set aside their talents to proclaim to the world that their journey through life has been a success. Good Will Hunting brilliantly brings to light the dark side of success and the limitations of talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting centers around a boy named Will Hunting (Matt Damon). On the outside, Will looks like an average teenager from an impoverished neighborhood. He wears raggedy clothes, he lives with his best friend in the slums of Boston's South End, he hangs with a band of rowdy drunkards, and he gets into trouble with the law almost ritualistically. However, there is one thing that makes Will worthy of the audience's attention, that makes him different from anyone else in the film. He's literally a genius.Early on in the film, it is established that Will has a natural ability to solve complex mathematical problems and absorb and memorize information. This fact is discovered by Prof. Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg?rd), a brilliant mathematician, when he finds that one of the unsolved problems left on his white-board had been solved on a white-board in the hall. It quickly is realized that Will has no real direction in his life. He holds no true aspirations and so he does whatever it is he feels like doing with his friends, unable to contemplate a life beyond that. Lambeau enlists the help of several separate psychologists to try and come to terms with what is blocking Will from his potential, be the boy deflects their efforts in the most humiliating and degrading of ways. However, Lambeau finds an answer in an old schoolmate-turned-psychology-professor Sean Maguire (Robin Williams).Despite being an intellectual giant and a well weathered member of the South End, Will still has his vulnerabilities. One of these is that he's unable to get close with anyone. During the first-half of the film he is introduced to Skylar (Minnie Driver). They soon hit it off and start dating. However, when Skylar requests that he move with her to California, he quickly shrinks away from her, spilling reason-after-reason why he can't commit to such a thing. Eventually, his ability to commit to a full-on relationship is challenged and, on Will's terms, they end up breaking up.Will is very defensive when it comes to facing his issues, and he uses his intellect in a smart-aleck fashion to help shroud them. For a while, Will is even able to keep Sean at bay, using the sensitive issue of his late-wife to fluster him and keep off of Will's problems. But this only works for so long, as Will's first attempt at this causes Sean to show the rage-filled defense that he will exhibit to uphold her honor even in her death, forcing Hunting to dance around the subject in a sparing few incidences. Despite all this, Maguire comes to gain Will's trust, to an extent, and eventually he slowly makes with Will, helping Will come to terms with his childhood abuse by the end of the film and ensuring that the events of his life weren't his fault. This release helps Will to gain some sense of direction, awakening the drive for him to finally pursue Skylar in California.There are a couple of techniques employed in the film that helped to compliment the overall theme nicely. One such technique is the use of irony. The idea of a person with an natural intellect living in a slummed area such as Boston's South End sounds absolutely preposterous, yet that very prospect is what helps draw the viewer into the story, dying to know what is keeping this insanely smart kid from escaping what we all consider a nightmarish situation. Something else used in the film is a motif. A motif is a repetitive image or message (literal, symbolic etc.) that communicates a sub-theme beneath the established theme. For this theme, I think it would be the idea that intellect alone cannot aspire greatness. Drive and a want for something better in life must accompany aptitude to help make something of one's life. In addition to that, I think Will had to learn that hiding behind fear only breeds contempt and failure and unhappiness, and that the only way to conquer fear is to take that leap of faith. To take a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amidst a flow of sensational movies, this stands out as one I can hardly remember</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1997! What a great year for movies. There was Men In Black, one of my absolute favorites. As Good As It Gets, The Full Monty, L.A. Confidential and I know I am forgetting at least another 10 great titles. And this one. I am not including Batman and Robin and Titanic for obvious reasons.What I remember, is that I never thought that a story, that may sound extremely ordinary when summarised, could be so fascinating to watch. Here were these, at the time, totally unknown guys, and a director, that had done mostly obscure projects, at least outside of the U.S., could get so much done with so very little.So, if I can't remember the particulars of this movie, it is because I haven't seen it since it came out on video (not DVD), since it hadn't been introduced yet. That's why I am not giving a rating on this title.When the Academy Awards show came along, you sat up and took notice. What a memorable speech from those guys. That's what I remember the most. Also, the Robin Williams speech, where the tears almost overflowed through the small screen.Since then, I thought about seeing it one more time, but I think that it would have been redundant. You couldn't get the same vibe as the first time you watched it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ultimately, Will winds up doing his mandatory psychotherapy with a college-days friend of Lambeau's, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Maguire is a Southie himself. The essence of the remainder of GWH is the question of the nature of Will's inner demons and whether he will conquer them with the help of Dr. Maguire, through his relationship with his homey friends, and/or through his newfound love, Skylar (Minnie Driver). If I have any contrary comments about the movie it's that the relationship between Will and Skylar is drawn too quickly; she comes to see something deeply lovable in him in the span of a few weeks.And that perception of hers contrasts with the early period of Hunting's therapy with Sean, in which we see him exhibiting a harsh judgmentalism of everyone?all of whom are his intellectual inferiors. We wonder if that harshness will affect his growing affection for Skylar. ...For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2009</fullReview>

But it's impressive to think Matt and Ben actually WROTE this screenplay back when they were in college.The movie itself is a true coming of age story for a unusual young man. However the unique of the character makes this movie. The story itself has reach characters that make the movie fun to watch and see what unfolds.This is a light hearted, feel good movie that anyone can watch and enjoy.

I think the story was interesting and worked really well. There were a lot of little nuances, like the Dunken Donuts coffee, and the interaction between the friends that made this film great. Ben Afflec and Matt Damon had great chemistry; maybe it is because they were such close friends in real life. All the acting was really great. The accents were priceless. I'm glad that Robin Williams was finally able to get an Oscar because he is really great actor and he totally deserved it. This film made me wish I was better at math, seems very lucrative. I think this film is great because all the people seem real and their lives aren't thrilling but you really feel for the characters. I found this movie extremely entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

To those that have not seen Good Will Hunting, I suggest that you see it as soon as humanly possible.

		<shortDescription>how ya like them apples!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this film on DVD after recognizing the title at the local video store. I was pleasantly moved. it is now one of my favorite movies. as i am sure many others were, i was shocked and initially a little doubtful upon hearing that the screenplay was written by Damon and Affleck, and couldn't help thinking that perhaps the latter's input was the occasional pizza run and neck massage for Matt's writers block. i am not a Ben affleck fan and use his name in the credits as a sign to steer clear but he doesn't manage to cripple the subtle magnificence of this picture. will hunting is a gem of a character, complex and heavily guarded, possessing a unique and superior gift and masking it with an arrogant mistrust in anyone but his four drinking buddies. robin Williams gives what i rate as his best cinematic performance as the only outsider to break through will's defenses and have any influence on his actions, using his own experience and surrendering his own covers to eventually gain wills trust and, in a poignant scene, releases will's true emotions and gives him the confidence to let himself do something with his gift. The effect that will has on every person he meets is relentlessly entertaining, whether it be the Harvard business student, the shrinks (and hypnotist), the other mathematicians, the job interviewers or Skylar. His un-rivaled knowledge and accompanying wit shape some hilarious and impressive scenes. when reading through the comments made about GWH i cant help but laugh while feeling sorry for those people giving one star and advising people to "avoid the hype". there are even a few people complaining about the language used. uuuuum, do you expect a person of will's background and lifestyle to speak in perfect English, avoiding profanities as to please those around him? the essence of the film is the character of will and his struggle to transcend the injustices of his upbringing. have the people making these comments any knowledge of movie history or prestige? the greatest movies made throughout history are those that step outside the boundaries and portray REALITY or a dramatized or sensationalized version of it. thats the beauty of cinema, we see the poignant moments of life portrayed in new and thought provoking ways. i advise anyone complaining over the language used to watch the likes of "a clockwork orange"; "goodfellas" ;or "shindlers list". these are great movies, high up on IMDb's top 250. i am not saying that GWH breaks any new ground in terms of explicit viewing because it doesn't; the language fits appropriately and any attempt to dull it down would ruin the essence of this masterpiece. I wont compare this movie to the heavyweights of cinematic history, because it doesn't need to be, GWH simply is a picture that must be seen, and WILL always be treasured by movie fans, it moves you in a way not many things can in the times we live in. The hype is just. "ordinary people" gave a similar message, but Good Will Hunting delivers it in astounding and unforgettable fashion. this movie is what superlatives were invented for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite one or two flaws, worth watching for some excellent performances and a fairly original story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been meaning to see this film for a long time I finally managed to last week and was largely impressed.The film is very entertaining and has many memorable scenes of great acting and writing that are some of the best out there. I don't want to get into the plot other than say it is fairly plausible and original, borrowing from other genres but never feeling like its something we've seen before.First of all, I'll talk about the films most impressive aspects. The best thing about this film by far is Robin Williams. I haven't seen too much of his dramatic work but his performance here is certainly the best I've seen him give and was definitely deserving of his Oscar. He wonderfully delivers some of the best emotional scenes in the film and is brilliant in virtually every scene he's in. Similarly, Minnie Driver is impressive as Will's girlfriend and brings a lot of welcome humour and credibility to her role and, along with Williams, keeps the film mature and not too immature- something I'll talk about soon. Similarly, Stellan Skarsgard is solid as a mathematician both jealous and fascinated by Will's talents.The other good thing about the film is many scenes in the film. Many of the scenes between Will and Sean are well written and their is a fascinating and compelling speech made by Damon towards the end of the film on his refusal to work for the government.The always excellent Danny Elfman delivers a very good score also.Unfortunately these good aspects are held back by the completely unnecessary amount of gratuitous swearing throughout and average performances of Damon and Ben Affleck. If profanity is done tastefully and humorously (as shown by Quentin Tarantino) or is said out of desperation then that can help the material work. Here it doesn't. I didn't keep count but this film has an unbelievable amount of bad language that added nothing to the story and just felt like it was being used to fill dead spots in a conversation.Another problem is the character of Will. He is far too cocky, arrogant and foul-mouthed to evoke sympathy and I believe his character should have been altered to make him a little more likable. Similarly Damon (despite one or two decent emotional scenes) is not very impressive either. Then again, thats probably his characters fault. The most annoying aspect of the film is Ben Affleck's character who I actually got so annoyed with I felt as though his screen time should have been shortened by half. Like Damon's, his character is the complete opposite to the one he plays in Armageddon and is largely unlikable and unappealing given he acts so stupidly throughout. Affleck (again, despite one good scene towards the end) therefore is unable to bring likability to his role either.However, thanks to an original and intriguing story, some excellent performances by Williams, Driver and Skarsgard, the film is well worth watching.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What 'education' really means</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other reviewers, professional and public alike, have praised this movie to the skies for its superb writing, fine acting, and smooth direction. This was, of course, the career-maker for two of Hollywood's biggest stars, and an inspiration to young would-be filmmakers.One element that has not, perhaps, received as much attention is the degree to which this movie deconstructs for the audience one of its primary tropes: what it means to be educated. As an educator, I find the point a crucial one, and one which elevates this movie from the merely "very good" to the level of "important."There is certainly a simple surface reading, in several scenes in which the audience is explicitly told that it is individual talent, ambition, and personal character which make for genius, not just a collection of degrees after your name from a prestigious university. The best of these is the scene early on at the bar, as Matt Damon's "Will Hunting" character dresses down one preppie pseudo-intellectual after another, revealing that the 'education' they have received could have been bettered at any local library. It's funny, and it's true: education doesn't happen when you get an "A" in a class, it happens when you internalize a bit of knowledge so thoroughly that you can integrate it, on the fly, with other material, as Hunting proceeds to do in a blistering (and hilarious) verbal assault.But just as important is the subtext of Damon's character's story-arc as he proceeds from working-Joe to star-pupil. Rather than being seduced by the prospect of grants, lab-space, or prestigious employment which his degree could net him, Hunting chooses to pursue his principles (and the love of his life). It could be a ham-handed, overly dramatic feel-good moment, but it's not because Hunting doesn't arrive at this decision by giving up his brains and following his heart. Quite the opposite. His decision is almost cold-bloodedly rational. It is arrived at after much debate, external and internal, and a number of quotes, statistics, anecdotes and analogies are forwarded from both sides of the debate: it's an instance of education in action, not as a bloodless, disconnected ivory-tower theory, but as a living model for our lives. Would that more students would approach their educations in that fashion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You gotta like this if you like meaningful movies.The plot is kind of very "Hollywoddish" come to think about it. "the mathematical genius + redneck from Boston gets fixed by the ultra cool looks like a failure but actually a winner shrink". now the beauty of the movie is that they acted and directed this plot out in a very believable way. I mean this plot and storyline could have easily been killed if it was done by some other people. Hats off to the cast, the director, and the writers(who r also part of the cast).Matt Damone and Robin williams acted "Real". THats a very important factor . And the girl, well if she ain't British then she sure can act! The chemistry was awesome between matt damone and the girl(sorry don know her name).Only reason, the only reason why I did'nt give the movie a 10 was that I felt that the storytelling lacked direction at times. everything else was just as close to perfection as it can be. The ending made me say "wow".Don't see this movie if you are expecting a typical Hollywood "weeeee look what we have found. A genius from the gutters. Well show you the cool transformations in his life". See this for some amazing acting (esp by matt damone and robin williams), some truly awesome dialogs and a very cool ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slight Spoiler!I was really impressed when I saw this for the first time, and out of all of the actors, I focused my attention on Robin Williams. Usually an actor in works of comedy, his role in this movie was serious. Never had I seen such fine acting on Robin's part. This movie really defines his ability as an actor.This movie requires one to think pretty quickly, as you can miss a lot of the detail as you head into the movie. This kid, who plays as a janitor has the mind of a math genius, however, he has a troublesome life. Robin's character eventually shows him the path that he should follow to make his life better, and put his "gift" to use.I rate this very highly. It's an excellent movie. Not entirely family-friendly, but the adults and teenagers both might have something to appreciate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Try to understand this ... please?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1- It's a movie, you don't believe the plot lines? Welcome to Hollywood. For example: Do you think 8 guys would cross Europe &amp; find Private Ryan? Of course not, but you've got to buy the basic premise folks. ANYTHING can and does happen IRL, why not this? (who cares if it is a Math Genius or a Stud athlete - hell both are rare, but how many 'sports stud' movie characters do we automatically accept?) 2- The REAL story within the story is not about the boy-girl relationship, or the buddy relationships. It is a man who finally realizes that another man knows what he's been through, GETS IT, and at the same time, has shown him that whining about it is not the solution. Robin William's character stands up to Damon's character in a way that nobody else ever has - and it works! Especially his "I'll end you..." line. (I was sitting in my seat thinking, "Robin Williams might kill me") I'm sure he'd never been made to believe that somebody would represent anything to him that strongly. THIS is the relationship in the movie that matters. Whether he makes it w/the girl or his buddies die by age 30 really is secondary.3- Real life, sadly, involves less than perfect people who use less than perfect language. Sad, but true. Yeah, it was a bit much, but that's what Hollywood does. More people are jerks than are NOT jerks. They brought you down, and they brought Damon's character down, just like real life. So the point was made.Bottom line? Enjoy it for what it is. A well told coming-of-age 'hope for the best in an imperfect world where you have both incredible strengths and weaknesses' kind of story. It is not a flawless story (name ONE?), but it made you care about some of the folks in it, which is more than most movies do. There ya go!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The quote is from one of several memorable scenes from the movie, when Will presses Sean's buttons in their first meeting, only to be VERY surprised by his reaction (and also probably gaining respect for the man, which evolves into a genuine friendship). I just saw it again for the umpteenth time.Other favorite scenes include his emotional confrontation with Skylar, in which he finally drops all pretenses and shows her the real him, and the final emotional scene with Sean, when Will finally bursts open like a dam.Oh, lest I forget, Lambeau's surprise in the beginning, when he finds out who's been solving his mathematical puzzles, is a gem.Everyone was outstanding. For Robin Williams, this performance ranks right up there with "Awakenings", "Good Morning Vietnam", and "Dead Poet's Society"; the breadth and depth of the characters he's portrayed in all of these movies is amazing. He rightly deserved the Oscar. The man's a d*** genius.Hard to believe this is the same guy who played Mork.It's just too bad he hasn't had very many of these kinds of roles, and too many of the soppy, sentimental melodramas like "Bicentennial Man".Mini Driver, though I'm not a fan of hers, was also very good, and added the right balance to Will.Everyone, and everything about this movie was excellent; it hit all the right notes. My hats off to Damon and Affleck for their screenplay! Reading some of the negative comments about this film, I have to say I'm stunned. Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but, if you didn't like this movie, I can't imagine there are very many you will like, as it doesn't get too much better than this.What a shift for Matt Damon, from playing an anti Semite, upperclass, preppie jerk in another excellent film, "School Ties", to playing a blue collar, streetwise roughneck here.I can't say enough good things about this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi, i am Sam Radseresht. When i first saw this movie, i thought it was the film with the most bad language in the universe. But then, i looked at it again and again. And in the end, it practically became an obsession. I admired Robin's character Sean so much that i even wanted to be a therapist. I put books all over my room, read them, and studied hard in school. The film was truly a strong inspiration to my life, and i do want to take the opportunity to thank Robin Williams, for making his character so believable and real. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck for writing their wonderful screenplay that consisted of so many beautiful words of knowledge. Gus van Sant for making it possible and my mum for buying it a our local Virgin. So, if you wan't a movie of speech, excitement and emotion, Godd Will Hunting is the best so far. Even if you may not be a fan of Matt, Ben, Robin or any other cast members, please do watch it for they certainly deserve a big applaud. It is one of those movies that will catch and touch your heart. A sea of Emotion. And in the end, there is a message for us all, but that is for you to find out. It focuses on Will Hunting (Damon) and how his troublesome past has left him isolated and off his path. When he is mopping the floors of MIT tech (boston), a teacher recognizes his astonishing talent and works with his math studies. Problem is, Will does not want that, and the Maths teacher cant understand his problem. So, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) teaches Will to not be afraid, and realize to not waste his talent but use it. Together, they discover their resolutions and reveal their secrets. But what strikes me about this movie is everything. If i was to find one word to describe watching this movie,,,..... Impossible. It just takes quite a lot to describe it. When i watched it, there was one scene that was so emotional, i could feel goosebumps on my skin and water in my eyes. A heartening experience, powerful and remarkable acting. SEE IT NOW. IT IS MORE THAN A FILM!!!!!!</fullReview>

Go bowling With Professor Lambeau and have a nice conversation about "exciting math theory." I think it is definitely believable, hence the word PRODIGY. Some people don't like the fact that they aren't the smartest human being in the world. This upsets them, so they must claim "fallacy" to make themselves feel better.

Well its the story about a mathematical genius who lives in a "safe world where no one challenges him." Every night he gets drunk with his buddies. One day he gets caught by the police for fighting and would have been sentenced to jail time, if it were not for an MIT professor who knows of his abilities and gets the judge to release. The conditions are that he must see a therapist and meet with Professor Lambough, the MIT professor, weekly to work on math studies. Will meets his match with a therapist (Robin Williams) and together they become friends and find solutions to life's hardest problems. A great movie, the best I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With A Stroke Of Good Will, Unknown Matt Damon Becomes A Star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Good Will Hunting" is a movie about a young man from the south side of Boston, the rough and tumble neighborhood of Southee, who is having tremendous difficulty coping in the adult world. He is reaching his twenty-first birthday and the age when he is no longer a ward of the state. The question is can he conquer his demons, grow into adulthood and be a contributing member of society.Will Hunting (Matt Damon), an orphan approaching adulthood, has moved in and out of several foster homes as a child, and has had several run-ins with the law. But he is also a genius, who can solve math problems on the level of Euclid and Pythagorous. The only question is: In which direction will he turn? Will he stay with his street-wise gang of friends? Or will he grow up, start looking for a career job, and start taking some responsibility for his own predicament? Will Hunting is cocky, belligerent, and downright nasty at times until he finally meets his match with Dr. Sean McGuire, (Robin Williams). McGuire talks Will's language, sports, sex, and even profanity to try to get inside the boy's head, to see what's really bothering him.Comic relief plays a large part in the movie. In one scene, Will accuses his first therapist of being gay and making a pass at him, sexually. Also at a local bar, Will is trying to protect a friend from getting humiliated, and gets into an argument about colonial imperialism with a smart aleck. This bar scene is also very enlightening."Good Will Hunting" is the movie that made Matt Damon a star. Matt Damon, along with good friend Ben Affleck won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Robin Williams won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Will Hunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is wonderful just because it is all genuine human emotion. How it is natural for anyone, no matter how bright they are, to not want to experience life because of their own field of experience. How we can cripple ourselves with our own sadness. We see Will Hunting who has this amazing gift for mathematics, yet he does not use it. I think it is very poignant to show how on the surface, it appears that will does not use his gifts, or try to accomplish anything outside of being a janitor because he is stubborn. When the movie progresses, we see that he is not stubborn, just in a great deal of pain. The movie as a whole is great because of the chemistry between Damon and Williams. Being a psychologist, Sean Maguire(Williams)is supposed to unravel the enigma that is Will Hunting(Damon). To find out why someone with such exceptional abilities is constantly in jail. Sean attempts to guide Will. He does not show much companionship towards Will early on. Sean would not allow Will to toy with him as he toyed with numerous other psychologists. What I love about this movie the most is the fact that Sean was only able to reach Will and help him, is because Will first reached him, and helped him. Sean was still grieving over the death of his wife. Grief that was preventing Sean teaching at MIT instead of teaching at a community college. Will encouraged him to move on. Will was grieving over the painful experiences of his childhood. Sean encouraged him by making him realize "It's not your fault." One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Any film and any actor that can truly portray vulnerability, pain, and the will to do what is best for you, is a great film in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible but authentic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the incredible story of Will a working class young boy who besides working as a janitor first and in the building construction afterwards, is also a genius in mathematics and several other scientific fields which he learned all by himself. But simultaneously he is a petty delinquent for which he has already got a criminal record mainly for assaulting other people in street fights with the likes of him. Despite being a real genius he is also an insecure boy fearing life and love due to the very unhappy childhood he had, which makes it very hard that he can take advantage of his intellectual ability. It also leads him to be rude to those who want to help him since he doesn't trust anybody. All through the movie we see the work of the two men who try to bring him to life and to take conscience of his own value: a maths professor and above all a psychiatrist who had his own problems in life too. This is shown in a brilliant way in terms of players' performances, images and dialogues with deep analysis of feelings and behaviours. All the players are excellent. A special reference to Minnie Driver as the boy's girlfriend with her spiritual and intelligent look and her moving reactions to some of Will's difficult to understand attitudes. This story is genuine indeed in terms of sentiments and actions and very well put on film. One of the best movies of its year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under-rated music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film for reasons mentioned elsewhere, but what I would like to add is a comment about the wonderful music that accompanies the film. The songs are written by Elliott Smith, who was truly an under-rated song-writer. I would urge everyone who enjoyed this film to go out and buy his album Either/Or, you will not regret it. His softly sung love songs add perfectly to the overall feel of the film. Elliott Smith subsequently played a song from the film at the Oscars ceremony, a somewhat bizarre scenario as he was a quiet and reserved man, somewhat out of place in that environment. Tragically he died in 2003, but his music lives on as an inspiration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams' best performance?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my all time favourite films, 'Good Will Hunting' portrays the trials and tribulations of a 20-something genius fighting to reconcile his talent and his lifestyle. Matt Damon is superb as the fresh-faced, insecure Will Hunting, and displays a striking sense of vulnerability beneath a rough, uncompromising exterior, particularly in the psychiatry scenes...which brings me to Robin Williams. Whilst I have occasionally thought that Williams can tend towards the cloyingly sentimental, his performance here as Will's psychiatrist is truly towering, which was acknowledged by a 'best supporting' Oscar. Peter Sasgaard (think that's how you spell it!) is also worth a mention, with an excellent performance an unlikable, but ultimately well-intentioned professor. Minnie Driver also stars in a nicely portrayed, if somewhat limited role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Genius Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is a beautiful and thoughtful film, which comprises the main aspects of brilliant film making. Director Gus Van Sant has taken the script and plot created by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and created a world in which the film seems real. The film is strikingly naturalistic, which blends well with the fact that Will Hunting is such a genius. The relationships that Will Hunting finds himself in throughout the film are portrayed in honest and fantastic ways, showing the diversity of the character and the way in which he interacts with the people trying to help him in his life.His genius is undeniable, but his person is generally flawed. He is charming in the most unnaproachable way...his world is made up of loyalty to his close friends. It is a safe world that keeps his immense intelligence out of the limelight, he is just one of them.Matt Damon is brilliant as Will Hunting, as he illustrates the emotions of the character so vividly, you feel as if you go on Will's journey with him. His ability to write co-write the script also writes volumes for his artistic intelligence. His performance is helped by the truly excellent Robin Williams, who gives a performance on a par with One Hour Photo, or Good Morning Vietnam. He is immensely believable, the park bench scene is one of the most raw and touching scenes in recent cinema, and the background of the character is identifiable and a constant source of interest.The support of Minnie Driver is classy and fulfilling, as there blossoming relationship is so believable. And co-writer Ben Affleck is superb, in his only acting role of merit, as Will's best friend.The Oscars were well deserved for this excellent and beautiful film, any argument that champions this as an American dream style film or a corny coming-of-age love story, has missed the point of the film. It is about potential, redemption, loyalty and love. Truly brilliant film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damon + Williams + Math = Strangely, Brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case you haven't seen Good Will Hunting (it's OK...I hadn't seen it until 3 weeks ago), it tells the story of a poor Bostonian young man named Will, played by Matt Damon, who has had an incredibly turbulent life and whose social status prevents him from achieving something. Though Will is brilliant and should be attending a school like MIT, he mops its floors instead. After getting into some trouble with the law, a MIT professor who needs Will's help to solve a perplexing mathematical equation takes the young man under his wing and helps Will receive a lighter sentence, providing he goes to a therapist. After seeing many shrinks, Will finally meets with Sean, played by Robin Williams, who eventually guides and befriends the reluctant Will.Good Will Hunting is by far one of the most intelligent, well written films I've seen in a long time and it's quite deserving of its Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Moreover, Robin Williams shines as the psychologist who is struggling to battle his own feelings of loneliness and worthlessness after the passing of his wife, and Damon is incredible as the hard-edged genius at the core of the film. Minnie Driver is also very likable as Will's girlfriend who constantly tries to get him to open up without angering him in the process.Unfortunately, Ben Affleck as Will's best friend Chuckie is downright annoying. He tries to steal each scene he's in by screaming in his thick Boston accent or by stepping on the lines of other actors, but he fails to be compelling or interesting. I think I actually groaned every time he appeared on the screen. Still, overall Good Will Hunting was a thoroughly enjoyable film.</fullReview>

I'm tired of watching the same movies with different actors, different titles over and over again. This one was truly original. It was long but went by so fast. I have now watched it at least 5 times and still haven't tired of it. The acting was also superb. Matt Damon at his best, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck. Ben Affleck hasn't been able to match his ability since. I highly recommend you to watch this and don't get the people who said they don't get what all the hype is about.

		<fullReview>The double ego of maths genius and waste of space scrapper has been done before, it is a clich now. However, this film is done well. The comparison between will (matt Damon) and his psychiatrist (robin Williams) is intriguing and nicely put together. Mini Driver plays the girl will wants, who is an intellectual who can merge into a group of lads, as when she tells the oap's 50th anniversary present joke. She also has a mean laugh!!! Will is an interesting character and he portrays the idea that even though you may have a skill, its not worth using it if its going to make you unhappy. You should do what will make you happy in life, as long as it doesn't hurt other people. Id happily watch this film again, its a romantic comedy,tame type of film you have cravings for sometimes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GWH as a case-study in saving a non-active "protagonist"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find GOOD WILL HUNTING immensely engaging throughout. And from the point of view of a writer analyzing the script, that's amazing -- because Will, the ostensible "protagonist", lacks two of the usual defining traits for that role: he is acted-upon far more than he acts, and he has no "story-goal".Early on he solves the hallway problem, he picks the fight in the playground, rescues Chucky in the Harvard bar, and pursues Skylar. From there on he coasts, until the end when he makes his one and only life-bending decision in the movie: He leaves Boston to go see about a girl.To those teaching story-craft, I suggest it's more useful pedagogically to hang the label "protagonist" not on Will, but on Sean, the therapist played by Robin Williams. Will is little more the protagonist than, say, the "Mona Lisa" would be in a caper movie depicting a bunch of guys trying either to steal or save that painting.Sean does have an announced story-goal: Save the kid. And he acts-on Will until he, Sean, achieves that goal. (Sean also has a personal need, though it's one he's not aware of: He, like Will, has to be saved. This amounts to another story-goal the audience wants to see achieved, and again it's Sean's effort that achieves it: In the course of saving Will, he saves himself.) This view is of interest to more than academics. The practicing writer ? and directors and dramaturgs -- should study just how it's pulled off ? having a lead character who's essentially passive, and yet who holds and satisfies our attention throughout. GWH is a good case-study in how to break a craft-rule and survive.GWH footnote: The "official" version of the screenplay published by Hyperion does not have a single scene, not one, that's identical to the movie as released.</fullReview>

I personally am going through that right now. I picked up and moved on a whim January of last year. Thats why i can truly relate to matt damons character and to add to this brilliant movie formula you have robin williams. If you have not seen this movie or are anything like me you will definitely want to pick this up because after one time you will end up watching it over and over and over again as i do.

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting, a story of the profoundly gifted Will Hunting will resonate with all who still hunt for good will in the world. Stunning performances by the headliners; Driver, Daimon, Affleck, Williams, and those by actors not so well-known, make this original story by Daimon and Affleck unforgettable and real. Set across the disparate social contexts of the intellectual elite of MIT University and the impoverished blue collar world of South Boston, this story reveals that love, once again, transcends all. And love is its subject; the courtship, delights and follies of lovers, the love shared between men, the love for the natural beauty and truth revealed in science and mathematics, the platonic love between teacher and student, parent and child, and the violence and perversity of love betrayed.This academy award-winning "best original screenplay" had a solid and natural up-bringing. Daimon and Affleck grew up in the widely diverse cultural context in which the story is set and their penetrating view of this world brings it credibility and importance.In what is perhaps an unlikely assemblage of scenes and dialog, this classic story of struggle in pursuit of love and meaning is delivered by the strength and brilliance of the performances. In the end, its value, as entertainment and as art, derives from the truth of human nature embedded in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the remake of Hitchcock's masterpiece 'Psycho' I didn't know if I would ever watch a Gus van Sant movie again. But at a rainy Thursday night there was nothing on TV except Good Will Hunting. Hearing some people say how good this movie was made me want to give it a chance. So I did. Thirst I must that the acting is pretty decent here, even Ben Affleck (who I normally can't stand) seems to know what he is doing here. Robin Williams gives a marvelous performance and so does Matt Damon. I already knew how talented Matt Damon was when I saw him in Rounders and the Bourne Identity, but I think this was his best performance I have seen so far. The dialogue of the movie is superbly written. Some of the sentences really make sense and go deep. The story isn't bad and the character development is also very good. The direction is fair enough although I didn't really pay attention to that. Maybe I even overlook the 'Psycho' remake incident. No not really!!!!!!But still this movie is very good and I sure recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good movie once in a while. Grade 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's great to see the film that propelled Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deep into the slime and bowels of Hollywood (and in Mr. Affleck's case, before banality and big budgets crept in). Here, the two are inadvertently amusing and prove that the celebrated screenplay deserves all the gloss ?despite occasional lurches into intellectual pretension.Damon simply oozes with intelligence ?and you simply believe him, 'psychological issues' and all. American academia's nefarious exploitation of genius, corporate capitalist corruption, friendship, the hypocrisy of The Good Life, finding your own niche in the world- these are among the things grazed by and effortlessly woven into the dramatic flow of the story- which is ultimately "Good" Will Hunting's discovery of self and love. The terribly maudlin Robin Williams injects warmth and scruples, and the Elliott Smith music resonates with redemption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good to watch, inspiring of sorts, but has loopholes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been many stories and cases about someone being mistreated/ abused/ abandoned as child growing up to hate the world, hate everything around him, and being disillusioned. In this movie, the protagonist, Will (Matt Damon), with that kind of past, is a mathematical genius working as a janitor at MIT. A Field's medal winning professor at MIT recognizes his talent and takes it upon himself to nurture and nourish it.There are some serious loopholes in the movie. First, Will, though totally self educated, is shown to be genius at anything he can lay his hands on-- from history, to law, to organic chemistry, to, of course Maths. And all this while fully self educated. Its far more difficult to believe when, in the movie, he is mostly shown hanging around with his no good friends, picking up fist fights, drinking, getting in crimes, etc. I can understand amazing talent, yes, but even for that talent to show off as well it did in his case, the mind needs to be free from all this distractions. I can't help wondering how, he, in spite of all this disturbing things currently going on his life, he manages to do that. This is rather unreal to me.Historically, the geniuses talked about in the movie and compared to Will (Einstein, Ramanujan) both didn't come from broken or abandoned families. Yes, both were geniuses who started of doing something else and were recognized late as geniuses, yes -- but that was because of social or educational systems in which they grew up that didn't recognize or encourage their merit. They could put their minds fully in the scientific or mathematical problems they were working on.There are more clichs -- like the bar scene. I have something similar at "Harvard" bars, yes, but what is shown in the movie is rather exaggerated. Then, when referring to Ramanujan, the Maths Prof signs of the dot on forehead to indicate Indian -- thats a silly and stupid! MIT (and boston area, that has the BHCC too) has always had a lot of Indian maths profs and students, and while that action might have been understandable in the middle of cowboy country where no one may have seen an Indian for real, its difficult to imagine someone who works with so many Indians to give such a stereotypical description.Then, the Maths prof himself, and his apparent inability to understand the effect of Will's past. Most MIT profs I know are more sensible than that. The relations between the faculty and the folks grounds dept (where the latter is seen swearing at the prof after he leaves) is much better here, and there is much much less swearing than is seen in the movie!Wonder what the Bunker Hill CC folks thought of the movie, since in a way, it pits MIT against BHCC.Still, its a good watch, and personally -- I can relate to somethings in the movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story about a tough orphan who is an absolute genius struck a familiar note for me because Hunting (Matt Damon) reminds me of my father. Born at the turn of the 20th Century, his mother died after his birth and his father became such a drunkard and tyrant that my father left home at age 11 and did not complete school. A roughneck, stevedore, prize fighter, lumberjack, gun slinger, cowboy and rodeo rider, he finally married at the beginning of the Great Depression at the age of 30 to society girl and concert pianist who gentled him down. After I was born he sought a more stable and safe occupation and became a carpenter. He took correspondence courses to complete his education eventually getting his degrees in civil and construction engineering,I knew he was smart in mathematics but I didn't know how smart until I took a geometry class from a teacher that was a retired professor from the University of California. One day he gave the class an problem that had never been solved. I took the problem home and asked my father if he could help me with it. Within an hour he had solved it. My professor was amazed. He gave me two more unsolved problems and my father solved both. Like Hunting he was an absolute mathematics genius. Nothing more came of it. My father was a brilliant construction engineer and that was his calling.So the movie had a tone of authenticity to it. It was a good story although at times it was a bit contrived. I am not a fan of Robin Williams but his performance in this movie by itself made it worth watching. If there was a negative it was Minnie Driver who was miscast. Because she is an ugly duckling, perhaps that is why she was chosen but her acting and her accent were atrocious and I had to knock off a couple of stars on its rating. Otherwise, it is well worth anyone's time to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've noticed that this movie has received some harsh criticism. First of all, if you watch the movie and pay any attention, you can see that the story does make sense, and the casting works (I don't think they ever mentioned anything about an Irish gang). Is the story believable? Maybe. But the writing is good enough that it can get you to think, which is important. Also, any movie that can get such strong feelings from viewers, good or bad, has made an important statement.The acting, particularly Robin Williams, is definitely top notch. If Ben Affleck could find half that level of integrity again, he might have a new lease on his career. This was the movie that (in my eyes at least) really established Matt Damon as an actor that could hold a movie almost singlehanded. And, while I'm not often a big Minnie Driver fan, her stark contrast to Matt Damon's character definitely livened up the movie. I can never really tell if the Academy picks them right. But I do know that this was a good movie. It doesn't weigh you down with anything especially sappy or depressing. It just tries to tell a story.</fullReview>

From the previews I was eager to see Good Will Hunting, however from word of mouth I heard that it was full of cussing and violence. Well the rumors got the best of me and tragically I did not see this wonderful movie until a little over a year ago. My friend Maggie told me I had to see it that she watched it on tv. Maggie being my best friend, I listened. I rented the movie and watched it. WOW! I have never been so impressed with a movie in all my movie watching life. (And I watch ALOT of movies.) This movie is the best written, best acted, best directed, and best depiction of real human emotion I've seen to date. Not only does it deal with actual problems that go deeper than "I'm in love with Bobby but he loves Barbra Anne!" but it also shows how a real human being would deal with these problems. Truthfully this is one of the greatest movies of all time, and honstly yes there is a considerable amount of cussing and there is some violence. Still I would recomend this flick to any one of my friends, Christian or not. Well there's my two cents, don't spend it all in one palce now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Good Will Hunting" portrays a powerful struggle of a young man (Matt Damon) who is a math prodigy with decisions about life's lesson. Trouble never seems to be far behind him when choices are steered in the wrong direction. No longer being of free will to make his own decisions, the only choice for Will is to be placed in a state penitentiary or to complete psychiatric therapy for his anger management issues. Determining a correct path in his life is not the only decision which Will must face as a young adult, but it can be one of the toughest. While facing the judicial system, Will must make his anger work for him, not against him. This is a huge obstacle in maintaining friendships while trying to reinvent himself. Will has the potential to become an elite mathematician, but instead uses his free will to experience his own road in life. Although choice is a powerful tool, unless used to the fullest positive potential, it can possibly back-fire. Decisions are faced everyday in each of our lives, but some of us take for granted the gift of decision and free will. While being given a great gift one could consider Will as a man with potential, but no desire or initiative. One might consider this the ultimate dilemma in life. The realistic `view of the working-class' is portrayed throughout the movie, providing a sense of belonging to the millions who fall in this category. The setting was a bit predictable, which led watchers to feel the connectedness. The dialogue might be appealing to a younger generation, who use vulgar words to express themselves, versus an older generation who find this repulsive. All in all, I give this movie an A-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did I miss this fine film previously?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the title turned me off, and with the cast, I thought it would be another teen film. This however kept me riveted as to how Will would turn out and how his mentors would handle him. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have gained new respect from me for their fine story. Robin Williams was such a silly twit in so many roles, but he deserved his Academy Award as the understanding psychiatrist. As Will said to him, "I have never met a psychiatrist who talked so much."I did not like Minnie Driver. She is very unattractive and even though they explained away her English accent as private schooling, this did not convince me. Even so, it is a fine film and the ending was just right!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting, a breakthrough for actor Ben Affleck. In Good Will Hunting we see the cunning, snappy remarks made by all the lead actors Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck and Minnie Driver. This movie shows a good template for what every movie needs, good writing, acting, directing, and a well though title. If anyone deserves an award for memorizing dialouge it's Matt Damon spitting out that huge speech in the one job interview scene. Also this film is known for the winning of the two Oscars which were Best Original Screen Play and Best Supporting Actory which was Robin Williams, a well deserved award for that matter. Good Will Hunting recieves a perfect 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is an orphan who has been to a number of abusive foster homes. At twenty, he starts working at the prestigious MIT as a caretaker on parole, since he's been involved in several assaults. One day the tough maths question on the board is found solved and the searching of the mystery genius begins. When Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) realises it is Will who has solved the difficult tasks, he decides to help him by offering him working on further maths studies and seeing a psychotherapist. Talented and yet highly defensive, Will manages to scare all the shrinks away and eventually Professor Lambeau has to turn to psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), his university roommate for help. Sean's unique approach finally touches the deep inside of Will's complex and it gradually dilutes Will's insecurity and distrust of people. Meanwhile, Will falls in love with Harvard med student Skylar (Minnie Driver) but later has to confront his inner uncertainty. In the end, Sean and Will helps each other to deal with their own issues.I simply do not comprehend why on earth some people out there don't appreciate this film, and I don't think I have to, because I know this is a GOOD film. The acting is intense and the dialogue is witty and often hard for the actors to carry out reading. The story is about a highly intelligent young man who has too many past injuries to heal and who eventually is given a helping hand (two, actually) to rediscover himself. The ending is just a clever one. 9.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The dialogue in this movie is riveting because it gives you a feeling of a chess game of wits and rhetoric, set in modern times. I agree with others who've said that the movie's draw is that basically it's a well-written essay on the extent of the power of the intellect. Will Hunting at first seems like an omniscient god, but the question keeps coming up: so why is he a janitor? The answer is that no matter how much you know, you cannot go anywhere without trusting other people. You can't find love all by yourself; you have to have faith on someone to return it. Will's problem is similar to being rejected by girls over and over again: the hurt/pain tells you it's not worth it and fate will let you down anyway. Anyway Will thinks that by not trying to take his life anywhere, he's playing it safe. The thing is, he's right in that it is the safest, most controllable thing to do. He should see, however, that it is possible for people other than his childhood buddies to love him unconditionally. He refuses to see it, until Sean without asking or warning simply shows love. He didn't ask for it but he got it anyway. That is how you move a genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>some of you have taken great pleasure in pointing out the negative things in this film (e.g. will's arrogance, etc.)...but I think a positive look at the philosophy behind some of the ideas may just give us some practical advice to how "the good life" can be spent...my favorite scene is in the meeting room with robin williams and matt damon where they both harp on each other for using a "super-philosophy" for merely surviving through our self-protecting mode of existence. Robin Williams' excuse was that he had already played his cards and doesn't regret a minute of the time he spent with his wife despite the great pain he feels now. Matt Damon is in utter confusion, not knowing how to commit to anything in a serious manner; instead pushes everything out of his life as a defense mechanism. It can be said that both use this super-philosophy to supress what could be a genuinely lively and thriving future, as a means to not love to the fullest potential. How can a person live life abundantly without ever putting themselves in a position which risk is involved? In my opinion its impossible. Is this what you gather from the "super-philosophy" scene? let me know what you think...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant script. A genius.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a brilliant script that I hear Matt Damon wrote for a English class when he was in college.Mysteriously I always missed the movie when it was on television, and it was played several times. I would watch just the start and miss the rest each time due to some or the other reason. Finally I watched it in whole now on 21st Nov 2003.Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a genius for whom most of mumbo-jumbo math and O-chem is "just a joke". He works as a janitor in MIT and solves a problem written on the board in the passage he mops. He is discovered by Prof. Gerry who gets him out of jail (assault charges) on two conditions 1) Will Hunting works with Prof. Gerry 2) He sees a therapist.Will has a tough shell around him which he doesn't let anyone crack open and trespass. He is cocky, abusive and least bit considerate towards Prof. Gerry's attempts at polishing him into a Genius who can be of use than a Genius who just ends up being a construction worker all his life. Enter Robin Williams and the rest is for you to watch. Must watch.Robin Williams plays his role so well that you forget you are watching a movie, you forget he is an actor and not a professor or a psychologist. This happens to me each time I watch a Robin Williams film. The sessions that Robin Williams and Matt Damon have are some of the best parts of the movie and the last session where Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) finally succeeds in opening up Will Hunting is the best scene of the movie.The character of Will hunting seems to be complex but it is not really. Why would a genius not want to work for some big company or the US Defence and make millions or billions? Why does he just wanna be what he is? And it frustrates you as the viewer, while ur trying to find the key that would open him up. Ur frustrated waiting for him to stop being so arrogant, why the hell can't he be a bit 'nice' to these guys? Ur trying to be a detective, and trying to find the great reasons. And that is how the script brings a mild suspense and tension to itself, mild.Minnie Driver, the English girl is an amazing actress. She is such a normal girl, who laughs loud and can still be gentle and she is very smart too, and vulnerable. U think why is Ben Affleck doing whatever he is doing in the movie. Ben Affleck answers this question brilliantly in a scene that works as a catalyst in the transformation of Will Hunting's character. Stellan Skarsg?rd (Prof. Gerald Lambeau) who takes up the challenge of refining the Gold ore that he mined shows great patience. One would really feel for him and his passion for math, especially if ur a lover of math.This is one of the best stories and a very well sketched script. Go get a DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Dialog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this for the second time last night. I liked it pretty good the first time, but liked it even more on the second viewing. Perhaps I was let down a little when I saw it the first time after all the hype? Anyway, on my second viewing, I really noticed the incredible dialog between Robin Williams and Matt Damon's character, most of which was delivered by Robin Williams. Superior stuff. Mr. Williams, you are far better at drama than comedy!!! In fact, it is so good, I really have a hard time believing that the same talent that produced Dogma wrote the dialog in this movie! I think there must have been some assistance on this part.I even thought Affleck did a pretty good job in one place, which I missed the first time. At the end of the movie, when Ben's character goes by Matt's character's home to pick him up for work, and Matt is not there, you can actually see the light bulb come on ... very slowly ... while watching Ben. Well done.Cool story. I don't know what it is referred to in a story, script, or screenplay, but I am noticing it more and more, and it occurs in this movie too. What I am referring to is when something is explained in one context earlier in the movie so that it is more fully understood later in the movie, usually for a very emotional purpose. In this movie, some of William's brilliantly rendered dialog concerns telling his buddies he has to "see about a girl" when meeting his future wife for the first time, instead of seeing game 6 of the World Series. This dialog is very emotional. So, later, when Matt uses the same line, all is understood with little said. Elegant. Same concept was used in Rock Star concerning "taking a pi$$". But, the best I have ever seen this done was on the last Cheers episode that Shelly Long was on when Dianne and Sam were saying goodbye. She supposedly was only leaving for a few months. He says "Have a good life." She explains that he says that as though they will never see each other again, which we know to be the reality as does Sam, though he won't admit it. She has explained the meaning of the phrase to us the viewer. She asserts, she will be back. After she is out of earshot, Sam says again "Have a good life" letting us know the finality of their relationship. One of the best pieces of dialog I have ever seen!But, back to GWH, I think it is a very good movie, and well worth watching. Very impressive for them (Ben and Matt) to have done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>added facts about the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a full-time sculptor living and working from my studio in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. Over ten years ago I moved to Northern California where I met, at a gallery opening, the American Poet William Leach. We fell in glorious love and eventually moved through New Mexico, Iowa and to Canada where he died at age 45 years of age, 6 years after I met him, we were married in hospital one year before his death. While in California he told me the story of his life including a story about being a janitor and some of the 'events' that happened during that time, he also mentioned that later friends had spoken to him about the interest in making a movie about his life, which he had no interest in, in fact the chaos this would have caused in his very private and reclusive life as a poet. Later when we were living in Iowa a friend said we had to see a very wonderful movie about a 'genius janitor' and told us the basic story of the movie. We both were in shock! This was the movie, years later, about William's life at that time. He was never able to watch the movie although he tried, but tears would stream down his face, and when I finally asked him, gently why he cried, and why he could not watch the movie, besides seeing all his friends depicted and recalling that time of his life in such detail, he replied, "I had so much to offer and I was pushing a broom". And we never spoke of it again. I think it is important that people know at some point in history that the movie was based on a real person, a very amazing person of great personal strength, a beautiful person filled with love for the world he lived in, and such a gifted poet. He wrote 6 books of poetry, all remain unpublished, he received news of 7 poems to be published in Descant, in Canada, the day after his death. If anyone has any interest in contacting me to learn more about this man, a Renaissance of splender and joy, please contact me, he was the 'genius janitor' depicted in the movie, "Good Will Hunting", and his name was William Leach, poet. Thank you! Susan Murar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoilers*Every time I see this movie I can't help focusing on the elitist premise. I still love it, but it's getting harder and harder to get carried away with it.Ever notice how everyone in this movie is either a violent, profane slobs or cultured elites? The two characters who seem to belie this (Will and Robin Willams) are really just fallen elites: Williams, one who wandered far from the ivory tower and ended up teaching at Bunker Hill Community College; and Will, one savaged by the blue collar world he was born into.Indeed the point of this movie is to bring Will and Robin Williams back into the fold, because how could anyone actually finding teaching at a community college rewarding? Or construction and demolition? My Word, that is for the lower classes.Perhaps by dint of their natural talents, Will and Robin Williams don't belong in the worlds of community college and construction. Fine, I could buy that, if the Affleck and Damon hadn't felt the need to paint those worlds with such a broad and unflattering brush. To show the Bunker Hill Students as slack-jawed fools the first we enter William's classroom. To have William's character leave pack up and leave the hopeless, intellectual black hole that is their screenplay's Bunker Hill CC. To have not one character outside the elite-working class polarity, like a middle class college grad (not from an elite college)? Minnie Driver's character was an opportunity to aerate this suffocating polarity, but Matt and Ben saddled her with a trust fund and med school.Would it have been a tradegy if Will--after being counseled and helped by Williams--went back to southie? Or went back to his construction job? Is his working class life so utterly irredemable? In Damon and Affleck's simplistic, MIT-Harvard-Ivy-League-or-nothing world, yes. Will's genius is nothing if it cannot be utilized by the establishment. I mean look at the alternative! And his reward is a big-breasted, big brained English babe and all these companies he interviews with at toward the end are willing to pay him.It's not surprizing that Affleck and Damon came from middle to working class backgrounds to write this. Indeed, the most rabid snobs are usually those from humble backgrounds who achieved vast success. And nothing aggrandizes that success more than showing the ignorance, sloth, and violence from which it escaped.Anyway, I wish I could still enjoy this movie the way I did six years ago.</fullReview>

Although I'm skeptical that this movie really deserves a 10 from an artistic perspective, I don't regret my vote, because I think this movie is the embodiment of what moviemaking is all about. It tells an incredible, human story in an honest, deep, and very enthralling fashion. Also, I think the acting is just amazing, *especially* by Matt Damon, Robin Williams, and Minnie Driver.

		<fullReview>Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is the janitor at the most prestigeous college in the country. He is also the most brilliant person there. He solves incredibly difficult equations in minutes, where it took others years to. He is well read in history, mathematics, and art. But spends his days drinking with his buddies. It is not until one of the professors (Stellan Skarsgard) discovers his genius, that his life starts to turn around for the better. But he also has alot of anger. As a part of Will's probation, he must see a shrink (Robin Williams). Will also meets a girl (Minnie Driver) that seems to be his soul mate. With the help of Sean the shrink and Will's best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Will acknowledges his potential and his abandonment issues. This movie is very well written and acted. Most especially by Damon and Williams. It shows that even the most complex person can find solace and understanding in others, if he only opens up. The movie was nominated for 9 Academy awards, it was truly one of those special feel good movies that had a message. And has quickly become one of my favorite films.RATING: **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a sound satisfactory performance from all involved. For first timers, Damon &amp; Affleck do well but the real chemistry sizzles between a laid back Robin Williams &amp; Damon. Williams returns acting to the old Hollywood style of gestures and emotive expressions and says a lot more with his eyes, demeanour and personality. This is a defining moment for Williams who convincingly breaks from the slapstick comedy gamut to settle into a thoroughly serious role and gives the performance of a lifetime. The scene where he breaks thru Damon's chaotic personality with the mesmerising but calming "It's not your fault, it's not your fault" just blew me awayI came away feeling enriched by the entire experience, with a lot of admiration for Affleck and Damon but with great respect for Robin Williams.

		<fullReview>Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deserve a lot of credit for this movie. One reason they painted such an excellent portrayal of life as it really is or could be, may be attributed to their youth. Youth facilitated this film with universal themes of the transformation from youth to adult, and to balance the rebelling nature of Will Hunting, Robin Williams adds (with a very well developed character) the humbled but wiser soul of an older man. Even though Will being so naturally gifted at math seems a little out of the ordinary, it is supposed to be this way. The movie takes this abnormality and uses it to make everyone realize how much like Will they are. Math may not be your strong point or your weak point either, but this characteristic of Will is simply an example of a trait that could cause any type of tension or problems in the life of a person. I especially love how Williams' character is written into this same theme so that personalities young and old clash. This is one of few movies that can truly move me emotionally every time I see it, and it is because it can be related to every human that ever lived.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched this movie about 5 times and I have to say I really love this movie! It's about life and growing up! There are some very touching scenes with clever dialogue and GOOD acting. Robin Williams is perfect as the psychologist and Matt Damon is trustworthy, so is Ben Affleck. Minnie Diver is also acting good and you can truly say that it's something between them, the only bad thing is her laugh! But there are some flaws that makes this film not as perfect as it could have been. The fighting scene are just ridiculous and Casey Affleck is acting a little bit too "dumb". Cole Hauser isn't saying anything at all! Stellan Skarsg?rd is not convincing as a professor, especially in the scene where he thinks that the answer is wrong but Will says it's right and set the paper on fire. And there is something with his accent.. Anyway, apart from some stupid scenes this is a touching film! The ending is also very good, it's just so genuine! I gave this 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I definitely liked this movie better the second time I saw it, and I was trying really hard to hate it. It turned out to be an average movie, in my opinion. It isn't a movie I'd want to watch again and it didn't inspire me, but it definitely wasn't as bad as I was hoping it would be, on second viewing. I couldn't really remember it that well from the first time but I recalled not being too impressed. The overall plot is rather contrived. A troublemaker twenty-year-old orphan is a misunderstood genius. I don't really go for those "genius in disguise" type stories. There are a lot of people who are extremely intelligent or brilliant, but aren't exactly the type of people you would care to know more about, or I wouldn't. Maybe it's just that it seems so cliche. I just don't think such a type of person deserves a movie. The end is wrapped up too neatly; it is the perfect ending to the perfect example of a contrived film. The title is kind of clever. And there is a lot of humor. Ben and Casey Affleck do a great job, as does Matt Damon, at times. Robin Williams annoys me when he gets all serious. I thought Minnie Driver was at times funny, and other times obnoxious. The movie had its moments. But my final opinion? I saw it a second time, I've gotten everything I can out of it.

		<fullReview>Let's see, will has a brain the size of the universe, but he just sits around in his apartment drinking beer and reading undergraduate textbooks. He's never had a real relationship, but we're supposed to feel that Minnie Driver should fall in love with him because...well, for some reason or other. He sees her as a way of proving himself superior to the wealthier types actually enrolled at a university, but, well, we just know that underneath he's got a heart of gold...God knows why... Wait; am I actually supposed to like this guy? Even Minnie Driver's character doesn't seem to; she's more like someone having a polite good time with a mere acquaintance than any sort of potential girlfriend. Even Robin Williams character seems to see Will as basically negative, if excusably so, and his portrayal of an incredibly nice guy almost proves that Will needed that just to relate to others. This film is not about an interesting character, "darn" it! It's about a jerk who we have to assume to have some redeeming something-or-other inside him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would have liked it better if it had been hyped less</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got around to seeing this film and frankly, with all the hype that surrounded it when it was new, I had expected something better. It's interesting that it's a film written by two childhood friends and that they made it big. It's less interesting as a film, period. Don't get me wrong; it's not really a BAD movie, it's just an average movie with nothing terribly surprising, innovative, or new, and it had a big reputation to live up to. The concept of a genius in janitors' clothing was new to me, and while it's refreshing to see a topic in a movie that hasn't been in a hundred movies before, the way the rest of the story played out was somewhat predictable. Didn't mean I didn't like it, just that I wasn't surprised by it. I was expecting something a bit more surprising or shocking, and frankly the only thing shocking about this movie was the language. Couldn't it have been made without quite so much profanity?Some of the lines were quite a pleasure to watch -- especially Will's brainy monologues. And the acting was all around quite good, especially by Minnie Driver and the two leading male characters (Matt Damon's Will and Ben Affleck's character). Overall this isn't going to be one of my favorites, but I'm not sorry I watched it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Good Will Hunting and I was quite amazed at how the movie turned out. Upon watching traliers I figured it would be a cliche show but boy was I wrong!!!. The acting was excellent, Robin Williams and Matt Damon play their best roles ever as a struggling shrink coping with the loss of his wife and a genius from Southie (yes it is possible). Cole Hauser, Ben &amp; Casey Affleck and Minnie Driver are excellent as Will's friends. I also liked the fact that they put a little bit of baseball history in the movie (Pudge Fisk) as well as many humourous lines. For a movie that catapoulted 2 unknown actors (Affleck &amp; Damon) into superstardom, i rate it 10 out of 10 :) so if you like apples, then i suggest you watch this Masterpiece of a film, then you can tell me how much you like them apples!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never get tired of a good story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never saw this movie in the cinema. I regret this. Many months later, after the hype subsided, I decided to rent the movie on video. What I watched was a thoroughly entertaining story!It's this kind of story that is simple enough to get enticed straight away and real enough that you don't lose interset half way through.The real hook for Good Will Hunting, though, is Robin Williams performance. He was good in 'Awakenings' and even better in 'Dead Poets Society', but never better than here as the burnt out councillor who hasn't been challenged in years. He finally meets his match in Will Hunting (Matt Damon).There are many sub-plots in this story, but the ones that will make you sit up and take notice will be the exchanges between Will Hunting and Sean (Robin Williams).There are also many fine supporting performances, some of which have never been bettered in other movies. Stellan Skarsgard is convincing as the pretentious, insecure MIT professor. Ben Affleck also delivers his best performance to date as the ever loyal, Chuckie. Perhaps the only let down performance is by Minnie Driver.Overall, It's the kind of movie you can sit and watch time and time again and never get tired of.I rate it 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie with my dad at the movies back in '97. I remember how it hit my stomach and made me shiver, and how I returned to the cinema the very next day to watch it again.The moment I got it on video, I watched it every day after school. It was a great movie and I loved it. I cried. I laughed. It was a movie about life.But now, after having seen the movie too many times, every line is like a quote and I'm thinking, this should be a book. I'd rather read the script over and over again than watching the movie another time. Don't get me wrong though, the movie's great, but I think the book would've been better.This is the movie about Will Hunting, an intelligent kid with a disturbing childhood. Because of his childhood he has psychological issues and does not function well, but thanks to a job he got through his parole officer, he gets in touch with a math professor who takes him under his wings, but what will this mean and how will Will handle it all?It's clearly a brilliant movie about troubled minds, growing up, and how we're all different in similar ways. Watch this movie once or twice, but refrain from watching it too many times.***/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the odd comments by one fellow here who claims to be a mathematician; This was not only an excellent movie but an entirely believable one. Not just believable but IMPORTANTLY so.Contrary to our mad rush to find the minimal acceptable and attempt to improve the self image of the mediocre, Talent DOES exist. It could be, should be, thought of as the key attribute of man.And truly talented people CAN teach themselves anything and everything - I learned early in life to use the word genius with caution, when a frustrated (and slightly jealous) teacher said to me as a precocious pre-teen "It is not enough to be a genius (Very High IQ) you have to be a genius AT something" - and that is true, so I will not describe Will as a genius but very talented. One salient point of the movie was Will's trave(ai)l from talent - IQ genius - to being a genius AT something. You know as he's driving off in the wonderful gift from Affleck (who I did think was very impressive, maybe a touch more than Matt) THAT was to become the quest, the search for his proper role / accomplishment / (and yes, contribution). Even though we are encouraged to think it is Mini Driver he seeks, it is himself and that ultimate of all, creative accomplishment (as mathematics can be as creative as sculpture and music).This understanding and acknowledgement of original talent is also discouraged as we have turned `Education' into a self serving, institutionalized, industry that sells knowledge rather than disseminating it.One of the best lines in the movie is when Will tells an imitation scholar student that he will eventually discover, if his parents haven't already, that they are spending thousands (hundreds of thousands) to teach him things that can be bought by a talented person with three dollars in overdue book fines from the library.Perhaps that was what made it such a great movie for me, I've been there, all of it, South Boston and the hallowed halls on Mass Avenue.I started sitting in college class rooms - auditing - while still a young teen. Had to play hooky from ridiculous `High' School to do it. In fact, I can even appreciate Will's `attitude' as today's society evermore dedicates itself to conformity and forcing same regardless of talent.Made a pain-in-the-a!! of myself by correcting the professors and knowing the answers before anyone else. Never paid a dime in tuition (even ignoring a bill for campus parking in Cambridge) and got tested out as a Masters in Engineering (by a short lived program from the ASME that was undoubtedly squelched by academia because they weren't getting their piece of flesh).I DO know whereof I speak, and the `mathematician' is just another one of those jealous of talent.THIS IS A VERY GOOD, if not downright great, MOVIE!</fullReview>

I was at my friends house sleeping over, it was about 2 in the morning, and i could not take my eyes off the screen. This movie is amazing, although the cursing gets a bit much, it adds to the feeling and tone of the movie. It also helps that Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Casey Affleck originate from the area, making it more realistic.Damon, Williams, Driver and Affleck all deliver touching performances that really make you relate to them.

		<fullReview>I think it is safe to say that anyone who has seen this movie will wonder how two young actors managed to write such a beautiful and realistic story, with characters you can relate to despite the fact that one of them is an overlooked math genius. Add to that creditable performances from everyone involved (esp. Robin Williams in semi-dramatic mode), good directing and wonderful musical contribution from Elliott Smith (who was unfortunate not to win a Grammy for "Miss Misery"), and you have one of the most endearing movies ever. You can tell right away from the first scene that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are the bestest of friends, and they have several poignant scenes in this movie. Minnie Driver was good as well, and you have to feel for her character. Well, like I said before...those two really should write more scripts, who knows what other stories are stored away in their heads. Watch this movie if you haven't already!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is an excellent movie that provides a real celebration of the human spirit. Will Hunting is an everyday Joe, who works as a janitor in some college. Despite his meager lifestyle, Will (played by matt damon) is extremely bright and has a gifted and interesting outlook on a number of things. He ends up being sent to a psychatrist, played by Robin Williams, and thus a story about this young man unfolds. Despite very strong language and some crude humor, you start to get inside this guy's head and really relate to him. Underneath his hard shell is just this soft, sensitive guy wanting to be loved. With best friend played by Ben Afflek, who encourages him to get up and leave his life as a shmuck, and girlfriend, played by Minnie Driver, who loves him, he starts to realize he could be making something of himself. A truimphant ending will leave you with bittersweet tears. A stifling performance by the whole cast who was wonderfully chosen. 9 out of ten!!!!!!</fullReview>

I also thought that Robin Williams deserved that Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor because he did an excellent job. Someone might wonder, do they really need to swear that much? But they do because Will and his friends are supposed to be living a tough life and you imagine that they would swear a lot. So because they do swear so much, that proves that Ben and Matt are very good writers and in my opinion they should write more scripts in the future, whether it's together or separate, even though they probably would do better together. So over all this movie was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very rarely does a movie stand out like this one. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's story is so beautiful that you experience every type of emotion throughout the film.Robin Williams deserved the Oscar for his performance and it's sad that people often forget that when he does a serious film - he's brilliant. He doesn't showcase that other side of him often enough and he's probably the only actor besides Bruce Willis who can play every type of character imaginable. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were brilliant as well and deserved more recognition at the Oscars other than the win for the screenplay.I am not a fan of Minnie Driver but her performance is haunting and she really put all her heart and soul into this role.

		<fullReview>I like the way I felt after I finished watching this film. Not in a happy Hollywood ending kind of way, more of a contented put my feet up thing. These days it seems that a film is either transparently contrived as a money making vehicle, pretentiously aimed at being an art piece or just plain bad! It was nice to see an excellent story done in an above average way! My only regret is that a few scenes were not left on the editing room floor. For example why was the "don't masturbate in my moms room scene there". Not because of the subject matter but because A: it wasn't interesting or well done and B: It had no connection with anything else that happened. It could have replaced with another interaction scene between Damon and Driver so that when all the, "I love you's" started flying around I wasn't left scratching my head and thinking, already! You may think I didn't like this flick. Wrong, it was excellent and I give it a nine!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh therapist, where art thou?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just once I would like to see Hollywood portray the relationship between therapist/counsellor (Robin Williams here) and client (Matt Damon) in some way that is approximately like the real thing. It is NOT normal for counsellors to have sex with their clients (as in most British dramas involving therapy) or for the therapist to physically attack their client, as here. And then in the next scene their relationship is 'back to normal.'This is a serious issue because inaccurate portrayals put people off from going to therapy; therapy that could really help them.So, the acting is fine and the plot is interesting, but I guess I am just too close to the topic of counselling and psychotherapy to be able to enjoy a movie that portrays that so badly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Important Movie For Me Personally</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My opinion of this movie will never be objective, and I suppose that's a fact I'll simply have to deal with when addressing its detractors. The fact is, for me, this movie came along at a time when I really needed a movie to help me center myself. I was struggling in school and fighting depression when this movie came out, and, after I saw this film, I felt like I would be able to cope with my life more. The fact is, the movie simply spoke to where I was in my life. I was letting people down, struggling and failing to meet the expectations of others and expecting constant failure, setting my personal goals in life lower than they should have been, letting my cynicism and self-hatred get in the way of pursuing my goals. I just loved everything about this movie from the clever dialogue to the interesting compilation soundtrack between Elliot Smith and Danny Elfman. The acting was top notch feeling real and unstaged, thanks in no small part to the fact that Affleck and Damon didn't hold back with the dialogue choosing a real conversational manner over moviespeak. Though I am nowhere as smart as Will, I can appreciate his struggle with his own feelings of self-doubt and Matt Damon managed to get those feelings across without overplaying his hand. I suppose more than anything else, this movie convinced me to try again, and for that I will always be grateful. It helped me get where I got today through its hopeful, yet true message.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't like swearing? Make an acception for this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people here have commented on why the characters in this wonderful picture swear so much. They believe that it's unnecessary and takes away from the movie. But they are wrong. The cussing in this movie is only part of their background. It shows the imperfections in them, and their words are backed up by their actions.That's all there is to it.  Now to the movie itself. This is absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen. Matt Damon did a marvelous job of playing the flawed but gifted Will Hunting. Will is flawed in that he pushes people away, he doesn't allow himself to become emotionally attached to anyone. Where he is gifted is in his extraordinary mind. He and Minnie Driver have great chemistry, and both are able to take complete control of their characters and play them to the fullest. Will is a complex character that will keep you entertained the whole movie, and in my opinion, I believe that Damon is a much better actor than Affleck. Too bad he has not gotten the attention he is worthy of. Besides the excellent performance by Damon, Robin Williams has also proved his ability to play completely different characters, and seemingly with out much difficulty. Before watching this movie, I thought Williams would continue to remain in childhood films such as Hook and Jack. Characters that were always happy in a way. In this movie, however, he plays the troubled therapist, Sean Maguire, a person still grieving over the loss of his wife to cancer. The scenes with Damon and Williams light up on screen, for both of these characters need each other in order to move on. You'll understand when you see the movie. Williams deserved the Oscar he got for portraying Maguire.  Is there a lot of swearing? Yes there is. But who cares? After seeing a movie like this, you'll have a feeling that these people are no longer trying to waste their lives, but move forward. I highly recommend this movie. Enjoy!MJR</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie seven times already, and each time I like it better. It is also the only movie thusfar that has brought tears to my eyes and left me unable to make some kind of wise-crack to release the emotional tension (the moment Will Hunting breaks up). Everything about this movie is brilliant: the photography, the acting (what a performance by the ever so irritating Robin Williams, whom I forgive all the Flubber, Jumanji and Robin Hood-crap for this flick), the story, the dialogue, the music.The story starts of as a no-good punk teenager drama, with lots of swearing but already the emotional weakness of the characters can be sensed underneath the tough surface. It then develops into a story which beautifully explores how difficult it is to love someone if you haven't had a loving childhood, and are inclined to distrust people. Out of fear of betrayal, out of a desire to keep control all the time, Will Hunting (a superb Matt Damon) first tends to settle for nothing rather than to have the high peaks and of course the great downs that inevitably come with relating to people other than himself. In the end he learns that his first option in unliveable, through some sublime dialogues with his surrogate father, the psychiatrist (thank you, thank you, Robin Williams) he gets to knowThen there is the music, of course. Very seldom have I seen a movie that had such appropriate music in it as the Elliott Smith songs: as well textual as musical After seeing this movie, I've started buying his work like a madman, and I can assure you: it's worth the buy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are accredited for winning the Oscar for Best Screenplay for the film Good Will Hunting. Directed by Gus Van Sant, the screenplay is brought to life very skillfully and with poise. While both actors had a part in its conception their involvement does not end there. Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, is a disillusioned and seemingly lost orphan genius from `southie.' His friends, i.e. Chuckie played by Ben Affleck, are his only support in a world which is very cold to Will. Will's emotions and frustrations come to life through violent rebellious actions. Robin Williams plays the role of a psychiatrist who helps Will to find his place in society, and inevitably the `good' of Will Hunting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this film at the movies, my friends and I were all set to see some film about a giant boat sinking and tragic love, blah blah. Lucky for us, the seats were all taken for that one, and so we agreed on Good Will Hunting, with all but one of us not knowing who these Damon &amp; Affleck people were.This theater was also filled up (to start with anyway). Let me say to anyone reading this that I live in the buckle of the Bible Belt. That being said, the first 10 minutes or so of this film saw a gradual emptying of the seats, with many a disgusted snort from my fellow moviegoers. The so-constant-it-was-mind-altering barrage of the "F" word was hard to take at first. Not that we'd never heard it before, but it being used so carelessly and often was shocking. However, being too cheap to try and buy tickets for a later showing of Titanic and too chicken to ask for our money back, we endured. After my head stopped swimming &amp; I refocused, I was really genuinely glad we stayed.As aforementioned, this was the first I'd heard of Matt Damon or Ben Affleck. I found both of these young men to be excellent actors and they have proven that many times since this film. The fact that they wrote this screenplay and saw it through to production and were able to star in it is pretty amazing also. My favorite part of this movie had to be the scenes between Mr. Damon's character and that of Robin Williams. Robin Williams is simply divine, in my humble opinion he is almost without equal in his chosen profession. He and Mr. Damon moved us all to both laughter and tears. Each actor cast in this film played their parts with excellence. Good Will Hunting is superbly written, fantastically well acted, directed and the cinematography was wonderful also. The cursing, in retrospect, was really part of the vehicle that gave you a sense of place in the film. I've since learned (from a native of the Boston area) that this is the way certain groups of folks from around there commonly speak. I hope you will excuse our ignorance here below the Mason-Dixon line. If you are from the South and were warned away - don't be afraid, this really is a mighty fine f**kin' film!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now here's a movie to remember. A fine story, some great acting and realism at it's best. When I look at this movie, time and time again, I get carried away every time.The conversations are high-standing, yet completely "every-day talk" and common. No fine script-scentenses here, only regular dialog. This makes the movie more realistic than some other drama's. And the way story's are told; pure genius... Think for example of the way Sean talks about his wife, or Chuck tells about his uncle. And, really brilliant: Seans monolog in the park...The acting is (dare I say it?) perfect, or at least very close to that term. The expressions on faces, the body-language, everyting. Very clear about the film is everybody's position in the movie. Every person has his own personality, and it's very clear what their motives are.Another apect that is very well worked out is the story. Not just a regular story, but a fine recognisable plot. Very great are the things Sean and Will have in common; their past, their fear of loving an(other) woman and so on.Then there is the symbolism. This too is something they really thought about while making this movie. For exemple; Sean keeps buying this lottery ticket but never wins anything. They talk about the odds of winning a price. This refers to the great gift Will has; he symbolicly has a winning ticket, which is his gift. Or think about the way Will tries to figure Sean out by looking at his painting. Here he switchs roles with Sean, as he starts to "see through" the shrink, in stead of the other way around.So there are plenty of aspects which are pretty good thought through... Nothing to complain about, if you ask me. A movie to remember forever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without a doubt, Good Will Hunting can be considered one of the greatest films of the twentieth century. The writing was superb, the acting first rate, and the camera work brilliant. I consider myself to be a good judge of movies, and I've seen many classic films, and many really crappy ones. Good Will Hunting is definitely in my top five list (with a bullet!). It has everything that a moviegoer could want in a film, and just think, without this film, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck might never have become truly famous. Now that would have been a terrible crime! The two of them (in their finest performances to date)were so phenomenal along with the Oscar-winning performance of Robin Williams. After watching this film, I cried for hours. This film has the ability to touch people in a way that no other has been able to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies do not need special effects to captivate audiences. What good movies should need (like Good Will Hunting) is some astonishing dialouge and lines to keep people laughing and possibly even crying."Good Will Hunting" is a movie that makes you think. The characters are so real, that the movie does nothing but captivate the audience by the authenticity of the actors. Both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (who also co-wrote the movie) share this unique bond that audience members admire.For those who havent seen this, I completely recommend it! It is a great film with spectacular dialogue, superb acting and above all- a geniune story guaranteed to touch the heart!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have read at least 60 other reviews for this movie. i smiled at the good, and twitched at the bad. i do believe that everyone has the right to express their opinion, but some people get out of hand. one review said that Matt and Ben did not write the script, they did write the main script, but may have had help with editing. Several reviewers don't even know the names of the writers. in my opinion, Good Will Hunting would've won Best Picture had it been released only a week later, putting it in 1998. readers of this review are probably thinking that i am some over-obsessed teeny-bopper. in some ways i am. i do think that ben and matt are "hotties". but that it not the reason that GWH is my favorite movie. i read the screenplay. i pictured the scenes as matt and ben may've pictured them. i recited the lines. i laughed at the jokes. i read background information, such as how they wrote it, why they wrote it, and why they cast the people they cast. i looked past the swearing, past the reviews, i saw the raw screenplay. all i had was that.my copy of Good Will Hunting is barely one week old and has been watched in full, only 3 times. in those 3 times, however i have looked deeper. i looked at the actors, i listened to their dialogue, i watched their actions, i connected with the characters. many people were offended at the language, because it is real. not hollywood real, but really real. parents shield their children from "four letter words", yet they will let them walk out the door. the purpose of this review is not to yell at those who hated it, it is to convince them, look deeper. the purpose of the movie is to make people aware of how young men spend their time, how real people talk. Ben Affleck does not over exaggerate his movements, he does what he would naturally do. Good Will Hunting is more fact than fiction, the diologue, the people, the actions, they are are real. the plot was made up. in conclusion, i would like to say that only those true to boston can do a boston accent. and only an idiot would overlook this movie, or to label it "over pulicized". give Will a chance, i guarantee that if you look at the heart, you will find it entertaining. Good Will Hunting gets 10/10 and Matt and Ben get my respect. Have a nice day! KD</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie (although not a classic)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of this film is so simple (and contrived) , so everyday , so condensated , that you can write the plot summary on the back of a matchbox (!!!) . You see exactly what you KNOW that you will see . Nevertheless the result is very good and effective .PLOT : Will Hunting ( Mat Damon )is a 20 year old with problematic domestic background . He lives alone and is a restless "boem" like character who has had a couple of problems with the law in the past . What many don 't know is that he is a mathematical genious and his IQ is much beyond average . When a professor in University discovers this genious accidentally , he wants to promote him . Of course Will is reluctant as always : he doesn 't believe much in himself and he refuses to cooperate. Naturally (as it always happens) his friends like the character of Ben Affleck encourage him to exploit his talents and leave them behind , since he deserves something better (how original !!) " You have the golden lottery ticket in your hands , but you are afraid of going to cash it in " . Middleway he forms an erotic relationship with a girl (Minnie Driver) but (what a surprise!!!!) the relationship fails due to his unobediant and non-trusting character" So where are your 12 brothers ????? " (!!!!) she asks him wanting to expose his lies and his lack of trust . Perhaps the most original part is that the lead attends a psychiatrist . After he changes 5 doctors (noone could stand him !!!!) he ends up in the hands of Robin Williams who was witty enough to push the proper buttons and finally communicate with Will . Robin Williams gives not only the best performance of the film but one of the best in his carreer . The session scenes are DEFINATELY the best ones in the movie . Although when the screenplay was written the filmakers had no idea who the role would end up to , now I really cannot think of anyone else than Robin Williams playing the shrink that successfully . The supporting cast is credible . They are simply there to serve the movie and not outshine the central character (intentional probably) . Mat Damon is quite good . He convinces mostly as a spoiled brat who wants to poke his fun to everyone , doesn 't want commitments with anyone and simultaneously he is a misunderstood genious who can't fit in anywhere : the incarnation of a problem child . As I said this is no classic (like Crammer Vs Crammer or the Rainman ) but is is one of the best social dramas (like the Prince of Tides ) Hollywood has ever made . The direction is subtle ( VERY subtle ) and so is the supporting cast . So if you add the cliches of the script what do you have ? I believe the movie lays on the shoulders of Damon and Williams . Their chemistry works and gives us a dramatic story with dignity and not melodramatic tensions . If you are not convinced there is at least one reason why you must see this film . ****SPOILER ALERT***** In the end we see something extremely rare : Will finally bends his lack of communication he bursts into tears . His shrink hugs him tightly like a father figure and tries to confort him ******* This is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in cinema simply because it is REAL (although none dares to put it in films because they don 't want to show a man crying) . Even for that GWH deserves a solid8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was a movie that affected me strongly and caused me to do some deep thinking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is a realistic movie that has a message about people and life. It works on many levels - the characters and plot are interesting as a well told story, the interactions between Will and the psychiatrist are revealing and compelling, and the questions it raises about life and lifestyle choices are deep and complex. I also really appreciated the relationship between the two friends. The conversation they have while working, when Will's friend tells him about his hope that Will be able to break free of this life, is so real and so beautifully done that I can't think of many film moments that come close. Robin Williams does a great job of creating a character who is flawed, yet incredibly capable of reaching Will and helping him to change his life. To add to the realism, the psychiatrist is also changed for the better because of his interactions with Will. Finally, the photography, attention to detail, and the incredibly good choice of settings and background helps to make this movie believable and great. Everything just comes together so well, it should be considered the best movie of the year. I give it 5 stars, the highest rating available.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Congratulations to Ben Affleck and Matt Damon for this one. The story is just fantastic. The boy-genius who just wanted to be normal and didnt want to get the opportunities because he was too afraid of the changes in his life and that he would lose control of the process. Actually, this film isnt just about the charismatic character Will Hunting, it`s really about us. Maybe neither the director nor the writers wanted to tell this, but that`s just about it. In this lonely world we are afraid to open ourselves to the people around us because we fear they might hurt us. We want to be in control of our own world. Ok, this shields away most suffering, but it also blocks a great heap of happiness . Will has a hard time discovering his true potential and what his life can become. But, than again, so do we. Some people I met hated the film because he rejected great job opportunities and went after happiness. I think these people are afraid to pursue their dreams too. Never give up your dreams</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although not a family movie, this is one of the greatest flicks in modern times. Don't look for big special effects, a big soundtrack, or a historical backdrop. This is a gritty film that is well written and well made. To me, Matt Damon will always be Will and Ben Affleck will always be Chuck and this will always be their best roles. That is not to undercut the great performances of Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser. The classic lines that come from this movie will live on forever with some of its true fans. Robin Williams does a fine job in one of his more low key performances. Other supporting cast members also stand out. Once you see this movie, you will either love it or hate, but you will come away with a few (if not more) memorable, well-written, well-acted scenes. For the well-rounded movie viewer, it is a must!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really quite slick and cool.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I heard about this movie prior to seeing it sparked my interest more than usually happens, the Oscars didn't really have a lot of bearing but they helped, and what is more I am not disappointed with it.Matt Damon plays a young Indiana Jones (IJATLC) sort of character, he knows history like the back of his hand, he can spout poetry, titles, quotes and even entire sentences from a specific book as easy as his name. With the winning script they do their best to avoid most of the cle she's, they do not glorify what he can do very much, just enough to establish the extent of it, they make a lot of mention of previous cases of genius discovered in a strange place just so that your disbelief retreats a little, and they down play the whole teacher relationship details and leave the inevitable kids change to accepting the teacher to a single, clear and early point.It manages to be attractive and entertaining but also with relevance to reality and people relationships. Wills trouble with accepting people does not come off as corny and unbelievable but one of a few prominent aspects that have front row seats. You really have to like the movie for it's rich entertainment status. One unsettling thing is the lack of conclusion to the ending but it is probably better that way, what was shown at the ending would make the difference between one category and another, it keeps the focus on the right parts of the movie.Williams never really reaches great in his performance, he basically just plays a recessive person and sincerely states some lines, compare his supporting performance to say, Christopher Walken in The Deer Hunter, there is a role with some content and depth, or, though I know this will cause trouble, Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator, just as Crowe brought some winning depth to a done time-and-again character so too did Phoenix, through tears, amusement, heartbreak and rage he constructed an in depth performance. Williams win to some extent confirms the history of the award though, how did John Geilgud for his one track comedy role in Arthur, or Don Ameche for a single teary scene in Cocoon or Sean Connery for playing a mature version of the same character he had always played win, it's a career award, Williams has had an entire career of comedy roles and been nominated three times previous, such a change in this role and the fact that it was time brought the win.Back on the movie, it really is cool, though not as impacting as Titanic it well deserved its nomination. This film gets a solid 8.5, it isn't 100% original so consequently can't take all the credit, but see this movie if you have not already, it is more than worth it.</fullReview>

And Robin Williams ends up winning an Oscar with one of his only serious roles. How ironic? He gave the best performance of his career. Although Ben and Matt wrote it and everything- Robin just stole the picture.

		<fullReview>Yes, the genre of the troubled genius given guidance in the finer aspects of life is a cliche. Yes, it's somewhat predictable. And yes, there's a lot of cursing. However, all the other elements in Good Will Hunting help the film not only succeed, but soar. The script Good Will Hunting is the antithesis to the Hollywood system as we know it: Two talented young actors, yet to make their big break, come up with a polished, original, and personal script, rather than the screenplay-by-committee published by the major studios for the sole purpose of commercial gain. Every line of dialog here, rather than succumbing to the pit of tired cliches, comes off original and with personality. Every scene here, the characters relate to each other believably, while remaining completely engaging. One of the best examples of this is in the fantastic scene between Will and Chuckie at the end about what Will would be doing in 20 years. Through Chuckie's blunt honesty he shows us how true of a friend he really is, and the true depth of their relationship. Outside of maybe Pulp Fiction, I don't think I've seen a script this original and absorbing in some time.Robin Williams gives the performance of his career here, even topping his great work in Dead Poets Society. Here, he's not the schmaltzy, kindhearted savior he's been in his last couple of movies. Rather he's a good, intelligent, but flawed man who is there originally just to guide Will, but ultimately his experiences with will help him confront his own issues. His performance is not superficial, but nuanced- knowing about life, but at the same time, not knowing, and learning along with Will. Similarly, Matt Damon did a great job giving us the outwardly cocky genius-with-an-attitude that is deeply hurt inside and grows to show us that he doesn't know everything, but is willing to learn. Ben Affleck is amusing and honest as his friend Chuckie, and Stellan Skarsgard and Minnie Driver do great jobs in their respective roles as well.Looking around here, I see quite a few negative comments for this film. Frankly, I'm stunned. The work of everyone involved in the film, particularly Damon, Affleck, and Williams, raises what could have been a complete cliche to cinematic excellence. Everyone criticizes the Oscars for their dubious selections. However, when they honored this script and Robin Williams' performance, they couldn't have gotten it more right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is a really good story, which makes for perfect cinema. A good story, a great script, and a super cast, with a fine director in touch with the material. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have concocted a great script which is both endearing and funny, while involving for the audience. Damon was fortunate to get the part of Will Hunting, but Affleck does show great class in the small role he has as Will's best friend Chuckie. The acting, in fact is one of my favourite aspects of the film. Damon is a revelation in his role as the confused and bitter Will, who struggles to let anyone in his life, or get under his Boston skin. An Oscar nomination was justified. Williams achieves a career high with his portrayal of the shrink who helps Will find direction, while also allowing himself find direction too. Williams is perfect for the role, showing great vulnerability, and a soft underbelly. The bench scene where he has a two-minute take with Damon, telling him he's never experienced life outside of Boston, is a moving and enlightening scene made special by Williams. He deserves his Oscar. Minnie Driver was fortunate to get an oscar nomination, but she does show great feeling, and her part was well written to allow her space to make the part her own. She has an expressive face perfect for acting, and she does a good job.Gus van Sant takes rather a back seat here, visually, to concentrate on the material and acting. He lets the actors show off their talent, and does a remarkable job in bringing out the best in them. Danny Elfmans score is low-key and carries his trademark, if bearing a theme or two from braveheart from time to time.Good Will Hunting is a great film, full of emotion, and humour and carries a great story along, which everyone can learn from. The characters are original, and the acting is stupendous. This is a must see film, purely because of its sheer class in every department.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is a very frustrating movie. It feels like it should be good, and I very much wanted it to be good, but it never quite reached that point. A movie with so much going for it--a good cast, a great setting, and an interest basic story--shouldn't be as simple-mindedly written as Good Will Hunting is. Hardly Oscar-worthy, the script plays more like a final assignment from a first year screenwriting class. Almost completely lacking in invention and subtlety, the script seems aimed toward the lowest common denominator of the age group that wrote it--in this case, early to mid-twenties. While the movie is not completely devoid of meaning or entertainment, there is so little of either one present here that the movie is only worth watching if you don't know there are a number of better and more mature ways the story could have been told.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote this movie they didn`t know they were "sitting on a winning lottery ticket" but they had a good feeling it was!! Thank God they were`nt to wimpy "to cash it in" because this is a great movie. To many movies come out that just don`t have what GWH has. Although i can`t call it a classic (mainly because their is to much profanity in it), the movie is still worth seeing atleast 2 or 3 times. The language problem is most likely the reason this film didn`t win an academy award for best picture. Despite this flaw in the movie it`s still one of the best films of the 90`s. I know they were trying to make it more like real life with the swearing but not even construction workers and sailors put together swear that much. If you can get passed this part of the movie you will find a great film that has excellent acting and a fantastic story that you don`t see in alot of movies out their. rating (best of 5 stars) .....4.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually comment on movies, but I felt compelled to respond to some of these poor reviews. The justifications for giving Good Will Hunting a low mark seem (in general) barely thought out and petty. Someone's assertion that Affleck and Damon simply couldn't think of what to say so they kept using the "f word" stands out. Go to this web site's Good Will Hunting memorable quote page. There is a reason why it is one of the longest of any movie featured.Arguments that the individual story lines are unrelated and the ending is weak, lead me to believe you must have been trying to put moves on your date instead of watching the movie. Instead, of giving us a hokey feel good ending, Affleck and Damon offer something much more insightful and honest. Will recognizes that he must deal with lingering emotional problems before he can be satisfied and successful in any profession. The ending is only a recognition of the problem, not a solution. So instead of neatly wrapped up closure, Good Will Hunting ends with something much closer to real life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that this film was nominated for Best Picture makes me sick to my stomach. The fact that this film was nominated for anything makes me sick. Every award this film was nominated for should have been a nomination for The Ice Storm instead. The Ice Strom was interesting and touching on so many levels and it was filled with brilliant performances. This film interested me in only one way; why the hell did so many people like it?At the end of this film we are supposed to think that Will has learned something. Well I hate to break it you, but he's still an arrogant jerk. And Robin Williams, give me a break. The only good performance in this horrible movie was given by Stellan Skarsgard. Also, how can can script comprised of mostly the F-word win an Oscar?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every movie has a theme that has been used before in a movie. Only after you have seen this movie completely the behaviour of Will starts to make sense. And even than, the depth of his troubled life isn't totally clear. This movie is full of mental challenges. Brilliant written conversations constantly change your perspective to the story. In a nutshell: bit by bit you start to understand you can't possibly understand what Will's life is about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is a very special film to me. The thing I love about this film is the relationship factor, the way relationships develop throughout the film - between Will and Sean, Will and Skylar, Will and Chuckie. I also like the way we see Will grow through the film and especially the way Sean and Will overcome their grief together. I thought Minnie Driver was illuminous throughout the film, Damon was excellent as Will, and Robin Williams deserved his Oscar. The film made me cry a lot as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Good Will Hunting" (1997:***). For awhile, I didn't think I was going to like this movie; there are too many clay-pigeon stupid jerks introduced simply to be demolished by the superhuman intelligence of Will Hunting (hated that bar scene, especially). It's a relief when Robin Williams finally shows up as his therapist, because you sense that this cocky but self-destructive kid has finally met his match. The heart of the picture is the prickly relationship between these two, even though it does lead to the inevitable (and still potent) breakdown scene in which the mixed-up young man cries on his therapist's shoulder (e.g., "Ordinary People," "Prince of Tides," etc.). There are almost as many scenes in this movie that don't work as do (the dreadful one in which Hunting substitutes Ben Affleck, as his best friend, for himself in a job interview should have been cut). But a good supporting cast and some tangy Boston atmosphere helps, and Matt Damon finally does win you over. This is also one of Robin Williams' best dramatic performances. He really anchors the film. I'd be interested to know how much input he (and others) had on the original screenplay written by Damon and Affleck. All-in-all pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good movie, but hype unjustified</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I enjoyed this movie, I think all the hype was unjustified. Matt Damon was somehow unconvincing in this role, though he is an extremely talented actor (perhaps this is due to the unbelievable plot). Robin Williams' performance as the troubled psychiatrist was nothing short of brilliant, and to me, was the best (and most underrated) thing about this movie. The movie did not engage my emotions as I believe it should have. I could not help thinking how hard it seemed to try to be a cross between "Forrest Gump" and "Ordinary People," and as a result proved inferior to both. Also features a memorable performance by Skellan (sorry, forgot the last name!) as a mathematics professor but I did not care for the annoying Minnie Driver as Damon's love interest. The ending was also somehow unsatisfying. Did "Will" ever make anything of himself or not? One wonders...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is one of the most beautifully written, directed, and acted movies there has ever been. I've read the screenplay and seen the movie numerous times, and I can tell you that there has never been a more original film. My love of this film is one of the reasons that I hate Titanic so much. Good Will Hunting deserved all of the Academy Awards that it was nominated for, more even. It was one of the happiest moments of my life when I saw Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Robin Williams accepting their Oscars. No one has ever deserved them more. I feel sorry for Minnie Driver though. She deserved her Oscar much more than Kim Basinger did. Kim was barely in any of L.A. Confidential, while Minnie was one of the most important characters. They all deserve Oscars.</fullReview>

Matt Damon and Ben Affleck did an amazing job with the script. It's catching, it's bright and it's got a life of its own. The character "Will Hunting" is sooo complex! If you watch the movie 100 times you'll find 100 people who could relate to this guy. It's unbelievable!

		<fullReview>I vehemently disagree with anonymous from Vancouver, Canada. Good Will Hunting truly shines in our lackluster times of modern Hollywood movies. Matt Damon reminds me of Pacino of the 70's. He is a young and a very talented actor that can hypnotize his audience almost at will. This movie could not have been successful without the supporting cast of Williams and Affleck. Driver may not be the "Cameron Diaz" but she is certainly a talented actress. The scene at the lake with Robin Williams' "uncut" extended performance is just jaw-dropping. The amount of depth in the character development and the complexities of the plot spun by this movie is just simply amazing and sensational. This movie is an exclamation point. Good Will Hunting stood out from the crowd without a question. Overall, I love this movie and would recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every once in a while, director Gus van Sant gets sappy, and movies like "Good Will Hunting" are the result.The director of terrific films like "To Die For" and "Paranoid Park" is nowhere in evidence in this story about a math phenom (Matt Damon) working as a janitor while a bunch of dumber and richer kids get all the good stuff life has to offer. Robin Williams plays a counselor, Minnie Driver plays a love interest and Ben Affleck plays a best friend. The film launched the careers of Affleck and Damon, who won an Oscar for writing the film's screenplay. But the screenplay is one of the worst things about the film, full of lines and speeches that maybe looked good on paper but aren't at all believable as things people would actually say in any version of reality I know.Not a bad movie, but not one I'd waste any more time on, and certainly wildly overrated.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only is the premise very interesting, but Gus Van Sant's use of lighting in this movie is incredible. The screenplay is superb (it won best original screenplay ), and the acting is awesome. I have seen this movie at least 15 times and I love it more every time. The fact that Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, Cole Houser, Minnie Driver, and Robin Williams all launched serious acting careers from this movie, is impressive. (Williams had already done a lot of work, but GWH was the film that really gave him the respect he deserves as a serious actor). I have been to Boston 3 times since watching this movie, and each time, I visit Southie (the Irish neighborhood Will is from), the Harvard Bar (Broken Arrow, the exterior shot of the "Haaa ved Baa" scene), and Bunker Hill C.C., (the Community College Robin Williams teaches at), in honor of this movie.

Just let me tell that I couldn't believe my eyes when I noticed this movie was ranked among the 250 best movies ever as that's certainly not the case as it's the kind of movie you have seen before...It's the story about some janitor (Matt Damon) who happens to be a math-genius but he prefers to hang out with his friends (Ben Affleck) beating up some guys. Everything changes till he met Sean, a psychiatrist (Robin Williams). Matt Damon plays his role in a perfect way and he could be one of the better actors of these days as he plays the streetguy in a pure James dean/Marlon Brando-way, tons better than Affleck who seems a bit lost here. And finally a normal Robin Williams and it's a shame noticing how great his acting is, how much he can handle and knowing he wasted so many talent in c**p like "Toys"."Good will hunting" is a great movie that deserves two hours of your time, but not a place in the Top 250.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By definition, most of us are fairly ordinary, but we seem to expect that people with marked ability should make the most of it. To use the biblical phrase, hiding one's talent under a bushell ( a brand of tea here in Australia) is a sin. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, better known as actors, put together the screenplay here which has to be regarded as a promising first attempt (they did get an Academy Award for it), but which is still rather uneven. There is some good dialogue and some very trite stuff, the characters do not surprise or even develop much and the story is reliant on coincidence.Will Hunting (Matt Damon), from working class South Boston, is a 20 year old janitor at MIT, who happens to have mathematical ability exceeding that of the professors, not to mention a photographic memory and a firm grasp of Western history and philosophy. Something of a coincidence? Strangely, he remains undiscovered until he is spotted by a professor solving on a blackboard a difficult problem set for students. Will has an attitude and a liking for thumping people (acquired it seems in his disturbed childhood) and is about to go to jail, but the prof intervenes and Will is let out on a bond provided he learns some maths and sees a counsellor. After a couple of false starts (to emphasise just what a difficult little b'stard Will is), Robin Williams hoves into view as the counsellor, Maguire. The rest of the story concerns Dr Maguire's attempts to help Will sort out his problems, which become more complicated when he become involved with English medical student Minnie Driver (called Skylab or something).Both Matt Damon (nearly B A Harvard) and Ben Affleck (his childhood friend in Cambridge, Mass.) have middle class backgrounds and it was no doubt a bit of a challenge for them to write a script about someone like Will. It would have been very interesting if someone really from a poor Boston background like Mark Wahlberg had done it. Will is sensitively realised and we see that it is difficult for someone with his fractured upbringing to have much self-worth. Yet no-one with a brain like his lacks an ego and I couldn't help thinking he wouldn't need Robin Williams to discover it for him.I thought the most intriguing character in the film was Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard), the MIT maths professor who discovers Will. Even though Lambeau has won the maths equivalent of the Nobel Prize, Will can still out-prove him, if that's the word. He is jealous, but he also is determined that Will succeed. He needs to believe Will is like him in that he must be pushed to succeed. Then Lambeau can tell himself if he had been pushed even harder he might have reached Will's level. At least then he will get some of the credit.I had Gus Van Sant down as a rather odd-ball director with a gay sensibility (`My Own Private Idaho', `Even Cowgirls Get the Blues') though he got a bit more mainsteam in `The Rainmaker' (also with Matt Damon). This is a very nice ordinary quiet mainstream picture with a few good moments. Van Sant has since revisited the topic of nurturing genius (literary this time) in `Forrester'. This earlier effort is more effective because the Will character is a kind of Mozart of math, with God-given ability, and it's hard not to root for him, whereas the protagonist in `Forrester' is a cultural product, albeit black and from the slums. With his beefy glower, Matt Damon looks right and projects Will's hostility well while Robin Williams turns down the volume and puts in a restrained, almost elegant performance. You could rent worse for a quiet, cerebral, Friday night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My dear Mother and I sat down to watch this film last night. She loved Robin Williams and heard that his performance was exceptional. Me? There isn't one person on this film that I liked but my Mother and I enjoy watching movies together and I parked my dislike so that she could enjoy the experience. She didn't.That said, almost from the start I had the sense that Affleck and Damon were too academic in real life to write a script which represented - for one thing - how street toughs really talk. I've hung with street toughs, befriended many rough and tumble guys and grew up around Uncle's who cursed like sailors. But we never uttered so many f-bombs as these pretenders did.It's not that I was offended, I still curse a lot. The point is this script seemed to be penned by someone who had all the imagination of whomever it was that coined the lyrics to "Wango Tango" sung by Ted Nugent. It doesn't do anything but bore me to hear a lot of cursing because people really aren't saying anything when they use profanity. They're just posturing. In Affleck's case, he looks so out of place trying to come off as tough. Even if he has the acting range of a fence post, his use of profanity seemed forced - as it did for the rest of the characters during the thirty minutes we watched.The thing with me is the conduct and persona of actors outside of their roles affects what films I'll see. Damon has "gone political" (my reference to famous people chiming in on their view of politics - a big turnoff for me) and Affleck just seems like he should be an accountant which, in and of itself isn't bad. In his case, he simply doesn't add anything to any role I've seen him play outside of his depiction of George Reeves.This movie also carries with it an air of cloistered academia. That is to say a pedigree shared with "Love Story" and others which attempt to portray academia as a ticket to govern mankind when in fact, they are the last people I'd want in positions of power.I'm a very intelligent man. Not on the level of a savant, but measured to have an I.Q. of 139. My nature is that of an analyst. I like to gnaw on deeply mystifying subjects as Cosmology and how life came into existence on this planet for examples. What I don't like is intelligent people trying to come off as street tough through the over-use of profanity or people who carry airs of knowing what's good for the world when they hardly get themselves out in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I know it's not his fault, I heard you the first time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years ago, Good Will Hunting was realeased to critical acclaim. However, I was too busy watching Batman &amp; Robin and The Fifth Element and the movie sailed right over my head. Then, last year, I began my film library and I saw that Good Will Hunting was airing. Since I knew basically nothing about what was a `classic' movie and what was a `good' movie so I taped it anyway. Why am I telling you this? Because I need a good way to begin my review. Will Hunting is your average Boston lowlife. He's in his early 20's and works at MIT as a janitor. He seems happy with his life and spends most of his time with his friends Chuckie, Morgan and Billy (Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser). One day, a teacher at MIT, Mr. Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg?rd), leaves a problem for his students on a blackboard outside his class. The next day, the whole problem is solved with the right answers. None of the students step up to take the praise for the problem, so Lambeau goes off looking for his genius mathematician. Will, on the other hand, gets into a fight with an old enemy of his from high school and hurts him pretty bad. He gets put in jail. Lambeau discovers who his magic mathematician is, and tries to get Will out of jail. He strikes a deal: he pays the bail but Will has to take courses with him and have a session with a psychiatrist. Will accepts, but wears out 5 psychiatrists before finally settling for Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), a widowed Vietnam vet. With Sean, Will will learn to release his deepest, innermost feelings and secrets.Good Will Hunting is a well-written and well-acted movie that holds up for its entire running time. It never becomes boring. The script, which was `written' by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, only falls into dreadful gooey tears once and the rest remains realistic and engaging. However, I'm cautious about the credits of the script. How can someone who can appreciate the incredibly cliched script to Pearl Harbor enough to appear in the film be behind such an amazing script? It doesn't make any sense. The script is exemplary, whoever wrote it, and it won an Oscar.The acting is also very good. Matt Damon is very good in his first leading role, showing emotions in a restrained shell. Whilst not his best performance (The Talented Mr. Ripley was better, in my opinion), it was good enough to get him a million and a half big roles in big movies. Robin Williams shines in a role that at least strays a bit from his usual Patch Adams mediocrity. He won an Oscar too. Ben Affleck overacts outrageously as Chuckie. Whilst his part was promising, leave it to the minimally-talented Mr. Affleck to turn it into a parody. Minnie Driver does a good job as Will's girlfriend. Casey Affleck, who's just as `talented' as his brother, does a pretty good job.Like all movies of an uplifting nature, you know eventually they'll try to make you cry. This is the part I dread. The story of Sean and his father is sad, but it takes more than that to make me cry. There's also an annoying sequence in which Sean keeps telling Will `It's not your fault, it's not your fault' over and over again.Good Will Hunting is not the classic I thought it was, but it's still a good movie. If you haven't seen it, you should definitely check it out. 8/10</fullReview>

It's about ? not them but guys similar to them: young, intelligent, but very insecure concerning their future. I guess, this is how many script debuts are like. Luckily, they found some good actors with Minnie Driver and Robin Williams and a famous director, so they managed to make a solid movie that doesn't get boring and makes you think about life. It's a small film, with no particular peculiarites (except the fact that Will is a maths genius, a fact that doesn't dominate the film as much as I believed before I saw it). This makes it even more remarkable to me that it became so successful and won two Oscars. 6 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

The film deals with a troubled young janitor at MIT named Will Hunting (Matt Damon in an Oscar-nominated performance) who is a mathematical genius in spite of his minimal education. "Good Will Hunting" is a combination of "Rocky" and "Ordinary People" in the fact that you pull for the underdog (Matt Damon) and you see how psychologically scarred he is through the man who is acting as his psychiatrist (Robin Williams). Is "Good Will Hunting" a great film? No, but it's one of those films that you can't help but like due to the elements that are in it. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

Its formulaic elements (the story is a meeting between Ordinary People and Little Man Tate) were appealing. Does it have it's flaws. Yes. It does go on a bit too long, and Minnie Driver's character borders on caricature. But the rest of the film is amazing. Matt Damon sparks life into his already great role. In a year where young actors did their best to impress, Matt Damon rode out on top (along with Edward Norton). His performance is full of charm. Robin Williams won a long-deserved oscar for a great performance, though it doesn't top his best (Mrs. Doubtfire). The directing by Gus Van Sant is good, but doesn't top his best either (Drugstore Cowboy). All in all, a very good film, one that I will see again, but it isn't a classic.</fullReview>

But it was still a great movie, thanks in large part to a generally solid script and terrific acting by everyone involved, especially Robin Williams, who should give up comedies entirely, since he's such a tremendous talent when given a dramatic part.

		<fullReview>When searching for intellectual success and humanistic relationships between life and career, there is a simple formula which works for a few people. It is an equation which reads, Superior intellectual equals power, but results in pain and isolation. Such is the story of Will Hunting, superbly played by Matt Damon. Born with a I. Q. Genius, the young man seeks friends and mathematical challenges alike. Consequently when he finds either, he attacks one and embraces the other. As a result, he lives in a world of turmoil and volatile possibilities. Unable to tolerate authoritative or academic hypocrisy, he armors himself with the sword and shield of intellectual arrogance and gives battle to anyone and everything around him. What troubles him the most is the dark pain of abuse in his youth and it is here he is most vulnerable. Robin Williams who portrays Dr. Sean Maguire give one of his most stirring performances as a sensitive and compassionate psychiatrist. Equally matched as they are adroit, the two battle in an emotional arena, each seeking to fathom the other. The result? The creation of a truly remarkable film. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is undeniably a character-driven film, and I'm sure I would have enjoyed it much more if the eponymous character was a little more realistic. Matt Damon clearly knew he would be playing Will Hunting- he and co-writer Ben Affleck crafted a self-indulgent character that actors dream about. First of all, he's great looking. Secondly, he's wild and rebellious. Thirdly- and best of all- he's a genius! Any flaws in the character are created only to give Damon opportunity to display himself as an actor. Robin Williams is totally uninteresting- how'd he get an Oscar? And Minnie Driver- why is this woman an actress? Had this movie been written by someone with any sense of character, it could have been great; as it stands, it's barely good. (Gee- a closing line almost as cute as the movie's title!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not one of the people who said, "Wow, this is the best movie I've ever seen!", but I did like it a lot. I think the reason I didn't love it is I thought the conflict between the Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsgard characters was somewhat exaggerated for dramatic purposes, and I didn't always buy it. I did like the relationships between the other characters, especially between the Matt Damon and Ben Affleck characters. My favorite moment in the movie is Affleck's speech to Damon where he tells him his favorite part of the day is when he thinks Damon isn't there. And Williams was really good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good, except for a bogus ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barbed script full of "F--- you's" doesn't seem like a likely candidate for a Best Original Screenplay Oscar, but this one did win and I think the performances are the reason. The acting here is so strong--particularly by Matt Damon, who co-wrote the thing--that I believe it makes the writing seem better than it is. There are some terrible sequences that can be blamed on the script, direction and editing, such as the bit where Damon's friend Ben Affleck substitutes for him at a job interview. However, the acting usually rescues it, with Oscar-winner Robin Williams pensive and endearing as a psychologist who becomes therapist and mentor to closet-genius Damon. Minnie Driver is also excellent as an unlikely love-interest for Matt, but the finale is almost too hokey to believe. In their efforts to tie this all up with a big satin bow, novice writers Damon and Affleck sink their modest little ship just as it's about to dock. Too bad. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Williams should have been the centre of this movie as he struggled to swim upstream against the tide of an emotionally and morally immature story.I am really not sure how this movie can be so popular: it is a fairy story about growing up which isn't grown up at all: at every opportunity for deep and revealing conflict at the emotional and intellectual level, the script ducks. Thank God Williams and the others strain to keep their heads above the water.Maybe as a modern fairy story this succeeds for the very same reason other fairy stories are successful. They offer not a view of life, love and growth but an escape from the same struggles we all face.Yep, this movie ends with the hero driving into the sunset.Wouldn't y'know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is a great film. It brings, heart, good (and bad) nature, and many other things in this tale of a janitor at MIT who is terrific at math. This man Will Hunting (played remarkably by Matt Damon) has many flaws though, and soon, he meets his match- Sean, a psychologist (Robin Williams gives a well deserved Oscar winning performance here) and little by little, starts to change. The way the film shows us Will , Sean and the supporting characters is spectacular and nothing is funnier than a Boston accent. Great all around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is definitely overrated. It wasn't badly directed or edited, and held your interest. But when you think back on it, uh-uh. Some parts that didn't go over well: Matt Damon, in an earlier scene, beats another tough guy to a pulp during a brawl on the basketball court. Later on, he gets manhandled by the out-of-shape Robin Williams and looks scared to death as the older guy has a grip on his throat. It was also unintentionally funny, right before this incident, when Robin Williams tells him he can bench press 280 lbs. In your dreams, pal - you are a small, hunched over, out-of-shape middle-aged dude. Also, Williams' character was ready to kill Will because he disrespected the memory of his deceased wife. A short time later, he laughs as he describes how his late wife loudly farted all the time, even in her sleep. How endearing.Then there's the scene where Matt tells off a stuck-up guy in the bar by giving him a history lesson from 1770. Like, anyone in a bar cares. Then, he gets Minnie Driver's phone number and it's a big trophy; an accomplishment. You would need very thick beer goggles to ask for her number. Then, there's the math whiz stuff where he connects the dots on triangles and it's like he he invents the theory of relativity. Also, Damon is a genius about everything......was he from Krypton??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over-praised melodrama of a gifted math-whiz who loves to flaunt his gift, but when approached about it, plays it off with an annoying "Don't bother me" attitude. After a street fight, the whiz (grumpy Damon) is actually given exemption from sentencing, provided that he dazzle a teacher as to why he's so good with numbers. The kid is so closed off that he's actually remanded to counseling with a hot-shot shrink to help open him up. The rest is a dull exchange of dialogue over several sessions until (lo and behold) the kid opens up and becomes a better person. Yay. Another one of those "realism" scripts, where they think the F-bomb dropped every other word is effective character building. Please. Plus some painfully forced macho moments, such as Damon spouting an endless deluge of analysis on the art of the pick-up, and his lackluster taunting of a rival. "Do you like apples? I got her phone number. How do you like those apples?" Congrats, gasbag, you got some flat-chested Englishwoman's phone number. Someone call the Smithsonian. Rent "Good Will Humping" instead.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, he plays the lead character...Will Hunting.He's ugly, mean, sarcastic and gives an absolutely horrible performance. He wears the same blank expression all through the movie. Everybody else around him are great and they really carry the show. Some people have criticized the movie for its frequent profanity, but that's how guys from South Boston talk. Also Affleck and Damon were born and raised in Cambridge so they have authentic Boston accents. It helps the tone of the film immensely.So, it's a very very good film. It could have been great with a better leading man.Well worth seeing...except for Damon. Concentrate on everything else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The praise about Good Will Hunting does not make sense!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to summarize this film in a sentence, I'd say that it's an overrated, predictable `self discovery drama set on the East Cost with a bit of romance and the dialogue of a Quentin Tarantino movie.' Surprisingly enough, an affiliate of the big Q himself (Lawrence Bender) co-produced it.There's nothing to really `give away,' so I'll just say this: If this guy was a `repressed genius,' then why did he wait to show it when he got the job as a janitor? How did this person become a genius in the first place? Why didn't they just send the guy to a mathematician, so his name would go into the history books next to Galileo and he might know the secret behind the universe? More importantly, why should we care about this person in the first place? Personally, I'd rather see a movie about a street flasher who targets the elderly. That is saying very, very little.The `self discovery'....`midlife crisis'....'I need to get my life back together' genre has been used so many times it's about as cliched as the standard Hollywood action film. That is the case with `Good Will Hunting,' a movie whose only sole purpose is to keep the halfway intelligent person alert. If you thought this movie was excellent, well, I don't know what else to say, except a recommendation to over 50 other cliched movies that also got an excellent review for no reason.Robin Williams' performance was increasingly mediocre to have won an Oscar, he did so much much better in `The Fisher King' and `Dead Poets Society.' The screenplay was just OK, and it also did not deserve an Oscar. Who picked Danny Elfman for the musical score? I thought I was listening to Yanni after his orchestra members consumed a box of laxatives. And the love interest with Minnie Driver just did not work. In fact, it ruined the movie. A little trivia for you, Damon and Driver did not get along with each other in real life during filming.Don't see it if you want something new. I would have spanked myself with a frozen drumstick if this film won a best picture Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How did this movie make it to IMDB's top 250 list? More alarmingly, how did it win the Academy Award for Best Screenplay? "Good Will Hunting" is an infantile, cliche-strewn, mawkishly sentimental mess.It starts with the a priori assumption that geniuses don't actually work hard at all mentally - they just naturally understand everything because they have a "gift" or "talent" (or... 'THE SHINING!'). Now, I don't want to dispute the part about geniuses being talented or gifted. We all know that Einstein or Newton or Mozart or Chopin or Nietzsche were ones in a million. Still, those men did struggle and did engage in serious deep thinking. They didn't have it easy - they challenged themselves.Will Hunting (part of the ambiguous title, where I thought that his last name was actually a verb, before I knew the story) is a genius who knows everything about everything (specializes in all fields, not just one - he just reads a lot and understands it too), except for love, relationships and real life. So, as his superbly insightful therapist (portrayed in a deservedly Oscar-winning performance by Robin Williams) elucidates, Will Hunting is a lost, lonely child in a dangerous, confusing world. And, in the process of challenging the therapist, Will exposes the therapist's own demons and they bond, much like in every other therapist-patient movie - first, through violent resistance and conflict, then to mutual understanding, then to tears and really dramatic hugs.There are also three other subplots in the film, and it's really hard to relate them to the whole. Nonetheless:1) There is the relationship between Will and a girl awfully played by the terrible Minnie Driver, one punctuated by Driver's laugh reminiscent of death approaching a starving man in the desert. Awkward Boy meets Crazy, Spoiled but Insightful Girl who assures him that if she could spend a day with her dead father she would give all the inheritance money back - this money, ironically, is what got her through school and allowed her to meet Will.2) A conflict between the therapist and the professor who discovers Will's "gift" or "talent," involving some kind of intellectual jealousy and an eventual forced make-up between the two forces. I assume this conflict is supposed to reveal the therapist as akin to Will and make the therapy sessions more believable, while alienating the selfish intellectual.3) And then, finally, there is the relationship between Will and, God I hate him, Ben Affleck, in yet another role where he plays a cocky b****rd. Sometimes he overacts, a lot of the time he underacts and he's just plain bad. Nonetheless, his relationship to Will eventually sets up the all-too-neat climax where everything resolves itself so well, you wonder what the fuss was about in the first place.So there you have it. A deep, complex psychological film about a guy in conflict and surrounded by conflict. The conflict, while there is a lot of it, is actually very superficial, resolved far too conveniently. While the guy, around which the movie and the childish story so selfishly envelop themselves, is not believable enough to be interesting. He's a tortured genius, a walking cliche - and one hard as hell to relate to. Damon, who I generally like, falters and overacts often, particularly in the prominently dramatic tear-jerking scenes.Consequently, I'm surprised at how much praise this film received. But then again, audiences love cheap laughs, cheap tears and cheap thrills. "Good Will Hunting" may stray from explosions, but that doesn't mean it's not a formulaic, by the book and terribly false feel-good movie. If you want to see a drama written by two very very rich celebrities about how tough it is in lower-middle class Boston when you're a genius, then "Good Will Hunting" is your thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overuse of F-Word Kills A Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some excellent moments in Good Will Hunting. Matt Damon, the genius, conceited, janitor working nights at MIT, doing the bars, and eying the women with his (real life) buddy and best friend Ben Affleck along with the Psychiatrist, Robin Williams, who tries to keep Damon out of jail and on the straight and narrow path.It's a very good coming of age character study, mixed in with some powerful scenic changes and moods. Director Gus Van Sant creates a genuine feeling for the characters and their situations so that you can (almost) feel empathy for Will Hunting and his troubled past. BUT...The film's tender moments are ruined to the point of destruction with the F-bomb coming out of Damon's mouth at every other breath. This approach seems to be more for shock value, and it is overdone so much that friends of mine who had seen this movie thought it was overkill as well. A couple of relatives walked out of the theater because the language became so bad it was like, "OK, when is it going to stop?" The movie becomes a chore, a task to sit through when it shouldn't be because of the non-stop profanity. Many will think Damon doesn't need therapeutic guidance, but his mouth washed out with soap instead.This is a movie where I actually like the censored TV print better! Without the F-bombs, the story is so much better and delivers a richer meaning than leaving them in.The bad language really hurts what could have been a GREAT movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film easily ranks as one of my all time favorites. The script is brilliant, the performances are genuine and powerful. Actually, powerful is the best word to describe this film. After the first viewing, I felt an overwhelming aftertaste of euphoria. There are so many valuable life lessons you can glean from this tale of a "super smart" yet troubled young man (Matt Damon)who finds the complicated simple yet the fundamental aspects of social human interaction very difficult. Given the fact that Matt Damon also co-wrote the screenplay (while in his early 20's) with real life pal and co-star Ben Affleck is even more impressive. I consistently find myself shocked to hear that some have not yet experienced this gem. If you love movies, you must see this movie. I can't seem to stop singing it's praises even as it approaches the films ten year mark.In short, if you haven't already seen this film, find some quiet time, rent it and savor one of the highlights of cinematic history.</fullReview>

I have tried Will's chat up line myself, but with no joy!Also, i heard that the Dog Track scene, mini Driver actually placed a bet on the dog that won the race in the film, hence a smile on camera that cant not be staged!If you like (simple) but very real films you will love this first film by both Ben &amp; Matt.

I know that most people are usually watch movies just for fun. But if you enjoy thought-provoking movies, movies that challenge and stimulate you intellectually, then this movie is for you. I think that we've all felt like Will at one point in our lives, and so then Will's journey (meaning the plot of the movie), in a way,remind us of our own journeys.I can't even tell you how many times I've watched this movie. It never ceases to amaze me and teach me new things. And even though it's such a deep movie, there is so much humor mixed in that breaks the tension. I have a friend who is also very fond of this movie, and we are always quoting humorous lines to each other when we're joking around. We also quote some of the more serious lines from the movie when having discussions. There are just too many great things about this movie to describe!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the writing debut of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Yep. They wrote this movie. I had a hard time believing it when I read it, too. Something that made it easier to believe what that I read in the trivia section that they originally wrote it as more of a Hollywood-like film, with government conspiracies and such. Luckily, they were advised to drop everything but the core drama. The result is this very interesting and thoroughly entertaining film. The story of one young man with vast, unused talent. Like many other dramas, this is based primarily in the dialog and the characters. Some of the most interesting scenes in the film are those where you see the interaction, the conversations between Damon and Williams. They play off each other very nicely. Gus Van Sant's fairly vague and undistinguished directorial style fits the story well, and I really enjoyed the usage of the cameras in the fight scene early in the film. The film has plenty of clever writing, mainly noticeable in the dialog. The plot is very good. The pacing is mostly good, though the film gets a tad slow every once in a while. Near the end I felt like it could have been shorter without hurting the film. The acting is all top-notch, though some of the dialects could have used a bit more work. Something that bothered me a bit about the end was how inconclusive and yet Hollywood-like it was. We don't really know what happens to Will Hunting after the film... but we get the feeling that he's going to be fine. I prefer the ending to 8 Mile, which was a good bit more ambiguous. In the end, a pretty good writing debut, and a solid directing effort by Van Sant. I recommend this to fans of dramas and the various names involved in it. 8/10</fullReview>

Robin Williams is the right choice as the unconventional psychiatrist, Will's friends all do a great job and Minnie Driver plays an excellent role too. Good Will Hunting is at the same time funny, fascinating and touching, and avoids turning into an embarrassing study of how human mind really works. Even clichs don't feel like clichs in this brilliant film. These kinds of movies really make your brain tick. Well.. Mine at least. As a closure: GO RENT THIS MOVIE ASAP!

The ultimate example of this stuff, The Mighty, last year's film starring Sharon Stone tells the story of her son (in the movie), who is a sickly boy who will soon outgrow his bones. His organ will be too large for the space between the bones and he'll die. And he does. The only mitigating factor is that he meets a boy his age who is all muscle and no brains. Together with this boy Stone's son can get about. It's like the old joke "Well, I'm the bum whole and if I shut down operations, you'll all be in torture, including you stupid brain! This movie Good Will Hunting is like so many movies from the kind of people who have given us things like child protection services, repressed memories suits, the abuse excuse in court, etc. America lives in an orgy of equalization, destroying everything and anything that looks better, let along outstanding.

The fight scene on the baseball court was not very realistic, and even though Matt played the character of will being a disturbed and lonely young man very well, I didn't feel like he would be the person who could possibly scare anyone.

		<fullReview>First I want to say that I thought the movie was quite good, in fact I gave it a 7. Why only a 7? Well I judge by the standards of movies I have seen and I travel a lot. Its not really as fantastic as 'Unbearable Lightness of Being' or 'Moscow does not believe in tears', but that is the price we pay for living in a society where Hollywood hype dictates what people go and see. Audiences rave about the sizzle and not the steak, which I feel is the case with many reviews here. Not only this film.One irritation I would like to comment on is why o why when Hollywood actors do a British character they ruin it by Americanizing their speech. Minnie Driver's character says 'guy' all the time not 'bloke' as a British girl would. Here's a wake up call for Americans: Hollywood is condescending to you! Yes, they think you are so thick (sorry dumb) that you will not understand unless a British character says fries and not chips. Unfortunately for the rest of the world, it makes us squirm in our seat and detracts from what would otherwise be a very good film. A further note on language, I am not sure what kind of people producers mix with, but my friends from University don't use obscenities in every sentence and I went to an Ivy league University. This comes over as sensation seeking and cheap and again it detracts from the impact of the film in my view.</fullReview>

The plot of course has the title character (Matt Damon) finding his way in life with the help of Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Stellan Skarsgard also do quite well in their roles. I'll never forget Williams's comment when he accepted his Oscar ("Thank you Ben and Matt. I still want to see some ID.") Like so many other movies (pretty much every one except the illogical "Gerry"), this certainly shows Gus Van Sant to be a great director. If this movie had any bad sides, it was that it paved the way for Ben Affleck starring in "Armageddon" and "Pearl Harbor" (not to mention the whole "Ben and Jen" thing; thank God that's over with).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now that's what I call acting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this might probably be the best movie of the late '90's. The screenplay is wonderfully written by Damon and Affleck. It is really touching and the acting performances are high class. Robin Williams plays one of his best roles in years, although I always love his movies. They couldn't have found any actor more suitable for this role. It's actually a shame he had to wait such a long time until he won his first Academy Award.Matt Damon is also surprisingly good as the rebellious but very clever Will Hunting. "The Rainmaker", "The Talented Mr Ripley", the Jason Bourne-movies... are all excellent movies where Damon gives very nice performances as well, but in these movies he never reaches the same level of acting as in "Good Will Hunting". Truly amazing! The movie is also filled with many beautiful and touching moments, but I will only mention the ones I loved the most. The scene where Damon and Williams meet for the first time and where Damon starts analyzing Williams and his life is breathtaking. It's unbelievable how such a young man with such a strong personally can totally break a man in a few minutes. My favourite scene is without any doubt the scene with Williams and Damon on the bench, where Williams tells about his life, his wife and her disease and death, where he tells Damon that he's just a kid, not knowing where he's talking about because he's afraid of loving someone more them himself. Where he also says that Damon cannot understand who he is and what he has been through, just because he saw his painting; that he cannot understand where Damon has been through either, just because he might have read Oliver Twist...This scene is certainly in my personal Top10 of Best Scenes ever.This movie is a real classic. Some people might find it too sentimental and my too optimistic as well, but for me he is certainly one of my Top10 movies of all time. This was the second time I saw "Good Will Hunting" and I'm sure I will see him many other times after this.Top class! **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched "Good Will Hunting" again last night, at least a year after my initial viewing. This time, I knew how the stories would be resolved, and I was able to more clearly see the brilliance in both the story-telling and the movie-making. And to think the screenplay was written by Affleck and Damon is truly amazing in its own right. I rate this a very strong "9" and it certainly deserves to be in any top list of movies all-time.To those several hundred of you who rated this movie a "1", I just have one thing to say - all of you are truly movie idiots, and wouldn't know a good movie if you actually saw one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The constant profanity jarred rather than added realism, and did little more than distract and make it seem the actors were trying much too hard. Though Will may have been a genius, but the writers sure are not. The formulas in this film are familiar to any 2nd Year maths student in university. The performances and direction, however, are very appealing, turning the cliched and typical plot into an enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inspiring piece of film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then you come across a movie that though including some classic clichs, still manages to stand out and really affect you. Somehow this movie achieves just that. One can think that there's nothing special about this move. That there's nothing more to it than beats the eye. Well I beg to differ.I first saw it back in 2003 and was completely absorbed by it. Back then I even considered it one of my favourite movies of all time. I saw it again this morning however and have to admit that it's maybe a bit too convenient to like sometimes. The overall great plot has some flaws, but it's still a great movie. I wouldn't go so far as to call it my all-time-favourite, not even close, but I still think of it as ONE of MANY personal favourites.One of the factors that make this such a great movie is that it includes top notch acting. Damon and Affleck are really great along with both Stellan Skarsg?rd and Robin Williams who put on tremendous acting, especially Williams. But alongside them I have to say that Minnie Driver as Skylar also brings something to the deal that is well worth appreciating. She has this natural charm to her, that is quite unique and adorable.Except from the great and talented acting, I fell for the plot. It appealed to me. Inhere also lies some of the clichs, but I feel that they made it in such a way that they get away with it. I don't now how. Can't really put my finger on it. But it works. They pulled it off. I found myself drawn to the mix between drama and humour, and was mostly intrigued by the relationship that develops between Will (Damon) and his therapist (Williams).There's something rather fascinating and inspiring about this film. I highly recommend it. I wish I somehow could capture the essence of the film and express it to you in a better way, but I guess you'll have to see it for yourselves. At least do that and make up your own opinion about it. It's worth that much. And even though you against all odds :-) should disagree with my judgment, I doubt that you'll find it so bad that you'd end up regretting you watched it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally I watched the long-awaiting movie. As what I expected, it did not disappoint me. Although a genius can have high IQ, high EQ can not be assured. Smart Will had serious mental problem. He could not make good use of his talent. On the contrary, he was abandoning his life. Even his friend Chuckie felt unhappy for that. What he said to Matt on the construction site just proved that their relationship was so deep. I was moved by it. I believe that it is satisfying if you have such a good friend.In fact Sean also had his unsolvable problem. Due to Sean's patience, Will began to accept him. It was the trust between them that changed their lives. Honest communication made them can overcome their respective problem in the end. Without trust, I can not imagine what our lives will become in reality. No trust, no friend. If you want to own a real friend, trust is necessary.Robin Williams deserved the academy award (the best supporting actor). Matt Damon was as good as his The Talented Mr.Ripley. Another similar excellent movie is Finding Forrester.Although it is not a masterpiece, it is absolutely worth watching. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting is the story of Will Hunting "Matt Damon" is a mathematical genius but is working as a janitor at a maths technical school, when he is discovered but due to criminal record is ordered to take therapy from Sean Maguire "Robin Williams" who attempts to control Will and help him lead his own life. Also stars Ben Affleck, Stellan Skarsgard, Minnie Driver, Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser.Good Will Hunting is a very powerful film, If you get through all the swearing you begin to feel Will's pain as his life story is thrown out on the table. Strong acting, believable storyline and a very original story, Great cast not a weak role and there are very few films in this genre that can get that across to the audience, it's a film to make you laugh, cry and get angry.Matt Damon gets better every time I see him, top film best of its kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic, thats it !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is an ultimate piece of drama. All of the cast has done an excellent job and Matt Demon and Robin Williams deserve all the kudos. Matt has portrayed a cocky genius and he seems to be born for the role. So is Robin Williams. The movie is absolutely immaculate except for one technical error that Will (Matt Demon) introduces Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck) as his brother to Skylar (Minnie Driver) and she believes the lie. If you have seen the movie fairly attentively(which you are compelled to - its so encapsulating), you must have noticed that when Will first meets skylar in a club, Chuckie is also with him and when Will gets into an argument with the pompous guy (I am not sure what his name is) on history knowledge, Skylar is present right there in the scene. Will says to the guy something like "You are trying to impress some girls and embarrass my FRIEND". Now if I was Skylar and I was as brainy as her (she is shown to be quiet a brainy person - at least thats what i feel), I would not have forgotten that Chuckie is Will's friend and would not have fooled by the lie which Will tells her later and introduces Chuckie as his brother.But this critical evaluation is uncalled for as this is not a mystery where all the events should concatenate properly. The movie is just superb and is a must see for everyone. It reveals Will's character (of a prodigy who does not like to be vulnerable to anything) with tremendous success and deserves the rating IMDb has given it.</fullReview>

The writing is brilliant! They are fantastic! Other than that, the direction is great, and the performances on all sides are incredible. Matt Damon deserved the Best Actor Oscar that he was nominated for for this movie. He was great. Robin Williams certainly deserved the Oscar that he got, as did Ben Affleck and MAtt Damon for their writing. Minnie Driver and Stellan Skasgard are also great.Ultimately, if you have not seen Good Wil Hunting, see it, and you will be ultimately moved and changed.

		<fullReview>This is one of the most powerful and pertinent movies of my generation's time. Matt Damon's portrayal of an abused kid growing up in an impoverished neighborhood in foster care is a most accurate depiction of the consequences of our broken society. The representation of abuse is painfully on target and the intensity of Will's intelligence and his perspective on that pain is enough to bring the viewer to tears. I have seen this movie probably 30 times and every time it still captures the same feeling within me, a feeling of motivation, of activation to intervene in the lives of real kids that exist in a world just like Will Hunting's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty remarkable work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A janitor at MIT, Will Hunting (Matt Damon) has a gift for math that can take him light-years beyond his blue-collar roots, but to achieve his dream he must turn his back on the neighborhood and his best friend (Ben Affleck). To complicate matters, two strangers enter the equation: a washed-up shrink (Robin Williams) who starts to coach Will through his transformation.Will's relationships with his best friend, Chuckie (Affleck), and new girlfriend, Skylar (Minnie Driver), resonate with a depth that unfortunately few other movies approach and its executed with such grace, style and heartfelt emotional realism that it's almost enough to make the concept of a violent thug that gets into trouble with the law could be a mathematical genius.Written by Matt Damon &amp; Ben Affleck this is an engrossing, emotional roller coaster with peaks and valleys of perceptive wit, unsettling anger, coarse humor, and touching affection. Damon and Affleck show a wisdom beyond their years with some of the dialog, which is witty and humorous.Despite the films predictable outcome, the superb acting is of such a high level; particularly that of Robin Williams, and Matt Damon; that the impact on the audience is spellbinding.</fullReview>

Robin Williams' character was so pathetically cliched that I personally wanted Will to go psycho and kill him, just so I wouldn't have to watch anymore. And Skylar was no catch, but Will never EVER deserved her. I mean, our first view of this guy has him assaulting a man who never did anything to him. We're supposed to like THIS character? No, mathematical ability is no excuse for this guy's anti-social danger. I fervently believed that Matt Damon was this character, but that doesn't mean it was well written.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie got lots of kudos when it came out and most of them were deserved. The acting is exceptional and in some ways the writing is fine as well. However, given my background as an individual therapist, the movie is a mess psychologically speaking. First, although I generally like Robin Williams in the movie, his physical attack on the main character (though deserved) would result in him losing his license. I have felt like hitting many clients--particularly sociopaths like Will but it just can't occur in real life--particularly since a guy like Will would also be the type to make sure the police and licensing board found out ASAP! Second, given that Will is a sociopath (he has all the signs of an Antisocial Personality), he would not be cured by the end of the flick. Many therapists feel that antisocials cannot be successfully treated while those who DO feel treatment will help would never think about doing short-term therapy with such a vicious powder keg. The movie is pretty good but the sappy Hollywood ending ruins the movie and gives the general public very unrealistic expectations about therapy.</fullReview>

Matt Damon Of course is who the movie focuses on, and he proves how well he can play any part given to him, a boy cleaning the school floors is actually the most brightest lad, the school has. Ben Affleck plays will hunting's best friend. &amp; there's abit in the end, which i really liked, between the Damon/Affleck characters which made the end enjoyable. Id Advise this movie for everybody to watch, you will enjoy it if you like a good drama. Written by both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck winning them both their first 2 Oscars. Proving how Talented Matt Damon &amp; Ben Affleck truly are. You'll see a young boy, living life on the edge actually achieve a goal, &amp; climbing through a lot of obstacles.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a relatable and emotional story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was sitting at home one day, and saw an ad for Good Will Hunting on TV. It was a movie that I had wanted to see for years, but never had the time to, so I got up still in my sleep clothes, grabbed my keys, walked outside, got in my car, and drove up to the video store. There was only one copy of it there, I asked the guy why so little, and his reply is,'People just usually steal it.' I thought that was sorta unusual considering that if you were gonna steal a tape from a video store, it'd Clerks, but I still hadn't seen it yet. So, I got home, poured out some nasquick, got some pop tarts, and popped in the tape, and sat down to watch it. During the film, I found myself on the brink of tears. The movie just hit so deep. The janitor that comes off as being some mischievous, beer guzzlin' guy, but is revealed as a brilliant person who has had a troubled past. Being an orphan. Being beaten as a children. Going from foster parent, to foster parent only to find more people that could pummel him. Then, he mets the therapist who can actually connect with him, and not just be another school counselor. This movie is just so emotional, and understandable that it just makes you think about life, and everything it's worth. It displays magnificent writing from Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, and amazing filming from Gus Van Sant. It is definitely a movie that one should rent or buy if they have not already witnessed its greatness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I avoided seeing "Good Will Hunting" for years due to its reputation as a "bad pic disguised as an Indie flick". Then, one night, I decided to try it. How bad could it be? If it was awful, I figured, at least with Affleck it oughta be funny (in an unintentional way).But guess what? It wasn't funny. It wasn't bad. In fact, it was pretty near great.The story has been done before, albeit in slightly different form, so don't look for anything too special here. Young Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is, secretly, a mathematical genius, who puts out a rebellious attitude to disguise this. While working as a janitor, his talent is discovered by a college professor (Stellan Skarsgard), and from there Will's life is changed forever. He meets his dream girl (Minnie Driver) and undergoes psychological therapy in an attempt to fix up his attitude. The only shrink who has any chance with Will, however, is another college professor: Sean Maguire, played by Robin Williams. Along with his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Will embarks on a journey that will change his life forever.Damon and Affleck, at the time relatively new to film-making, grabbed an Academy Award for "Best Original Screenplay" for writing the tale of "Good Will Hunting". Williams also received an Academy Award for "Best Supporting Actor", and the film was nominated for seven other awards including "Best Picture". The cast is terrific here - even Affleck isn't horrible - but it's Damon and Williams whose performances really reach out and grab you.Someone who should have won an Oscar was director Gus Van Sant. His unique directing style gets moving performances from the entire cast and really brings to life Damon and Affleck's otherwise ordinary script. There's also a not-so-remarkable score by Danny Elfman.I find this film to be severely underrated. If you give it a small chance, it will really have an effect on you. "Good Will Hunting" is one of the best films of the year, a shlock flick turned into a touching wonder. This movie really deserves much more credit than it gets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was amazed by this film. A story of a young man ,who has a brilliant mind, but finds it easier to use his fists in any situation. I was very engrossed by this film, especially when Damon, the main character and Williams, his psychiatrist have sessions together, discussing Hunting's painful past.The romance between Minnie Driver's character and Matt Damon's is very gentle, which helps the audience to relate t them as characters. The only thing I objected to was the amount of unnecessary use of swearing. Swearing is often used for dramatic impact and effect or to portray the society in which a film is set , but I found the fact that every other word was a swear word quite off putting and useless. Other than that I found the film enjoyable and humorous in just the right places. My favourite part is the scene with Williams and Damon where both men embrace and Damon's emotional barrier is cracked, allowing him to be liberated from his brutal past. Affleck's part is easily as important as Hunting's friend. Such sensitivity. What a beauty!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Will Hunting could have been a great movie, but it's nothing more than an average movie. It's been hyped up by so many people in the media, that the viewers are actually getting convinced that Matt Damon is the new miracle giving Hollywood new hope and glory, but it is quite the opposite. As an actor I think he's not convincing enough, maybe in the first part of the movie he seems to be able to let you forget he's just an actor, but at the end of the movie he starts to act out his character in such a way it actually brings down all what he did in the first part. As the writer of the screenplay he's not such a star either, again the beginning is okay, but the ending seems like a bad headache after a night of partying. The only truly remarkable thing about this movie is the excellent and undervalued performances by Robin Williams and Ben Affleck. Matt Damon and Minnie Driver should have been the last choices for their characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will Hunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written by best friends and stars Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and winning Oscars and Golden Globes for doing so, this is a pretty good drama, from Oscar nominated director Gus Van Sant (Drugstore Cowboy, To Die For, Psycho). Basically Will Hunting (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated (for actor) Damon) is a lowly janitor at a South Boston college, a bit of a rebel with his friends, including Chuckie Sullivan (Affleck) and Morgan O'Mally (Casey Affleck, Ben's brother), and hides a genius talent for memorising facts and solving/proving sophisticated mathematical theorems. It is when Will is facing imprisonment (for attacking a youth and a police officer) that he gets the chance to prove himself for Gerald Lambeau (Pirates of the Caribbean's Stellan Skarsg?rd). Will can either go to jail, or he can be supervised by Lambeau solving maths theorems, and see a therapist, which he disapproves of and believes he doesn't need, and manages to get rid of eight. Lambeau in desperation calls old college friend, now psychologist Sean Maguire (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Robin Williams), and after their first meeting, Sean is determined to connect with Will and his hostile, sarcastic defence mechanisms. It is after Sean strikes Will with his story of giving up his ticket to the Red Sox in the 1975 World Series (thus missing Carlton Fisk's famous home run in Game 6), instead to find a girl. This encourages Will to try and have a relationship with Skylar (Oscar nominated Minnie Driver). In the end, after quite a lot of bickering with Sean, Lambeau, and Skylar moving to California, Will sees the error of ways, gives up a job he could have got, and sends Sean a thank you note, saying he's going to "get a girl". Also starring John Mighton as Tom, Rachel Majorowski as Krystyn, Colleen McCauley as Cathy and The Cave's Cole Hauser as Billy. Damon became a star and obviously became Jason Bourne, Affleck is pretty good as Will's best friend, Skarsg?rd does pretty well as the teacher, and Driver is good as the English girlfriend, and of course, Williams deserved his Oscar for his subtle performance. It was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Music for Danny Elfman, Best Song for "Miss Misery" and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!</fullReview>
