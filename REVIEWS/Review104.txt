		<shortDescription>To The Negative Reviews, What Else Were You Expecting?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, seeing some of these reviews really made me laugh. "Generic, it's the exact same thing as if you were playing a FPS game!" Maybe those who are saying those things saw a different trailer than me? This movie is exactly what it was promoted to be. An hour and thirty six minutes of a lot of violence, jokes, and well, shakiness. Within the first 30 minutes of the movie, many people walked out murmuring to themselves "this is stupid, my head hurts" and I really questioned why they even bought a ticket in the first place if watching a shaky camera hurts your head? Why did a group of middle aged women go see this, and leave shortly after? DID YOU STUMBLE UPON THE WRONG MOVIE?Besides my little rant, I most definitely recommend this movie. I am not a major fan of FPS games, but having the entire movie filmed with Go Pro's, along with the great action made this a very fun and enjoyable movie. It doesn't take itself seriously, as it knows exactly what it is. As much as I hate when people say this, it is one of those movies where you really can turn your brain off and enjoy it.I smiled throughout the entire movie, and though the trailers show some really cool shots from the movie, there is still plenty of fun in the movie to where you really do not get bored one bit. The park-our scenes are truly something else as well, with major respect to the stunt- men who did their job perfectly. The music choice was also something that I truly enjoyed, it fit the movie very well. The acting, while little of it, was passable and did not really strike me as "bad." If you are a person who can't stand something like the Bourne movies for their shaky cam, do not see this. If you love action movies and really want to admire great fight scenes and plenty of mayhem, go see this.And for those saying the idea is not original, yes, movies shot in first person are not original. But for an action movie of this caliber, I would say it is an experience that is definitely worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TIFF 2015 -- Hardcore: Just plain fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Hardcore' is the riveting story of a newly-made cyborg who must save his wife from evil tyrants and...wait a minute. Who cares?? The whole movie is a blast!!Ilya Naishuller is a young director who had a very cool idea to shoot an action film from a first-person perspective using a GoPro Hero3 Black Edition camera. The proof of concept was released as "Biting Elbows: Bad Motherf***er". It was pitched publicly and helped to successfully crowd-fund the feature, 'Hardcore'.It's better to keep this short and sweet: the film is extraordinarily violent; not for the squeamish. It has plenty of action, free-running, stunts, and plenty of room for comedic elements. Even the opening titles give you a taste of what's to come!Sharlto Copley (District 9, and other Neill Blomkamp projects) plays the main POV's assistant throughout the film. Copley definitely gives a range of character performances and is quality. Wearing many hats, he guides you along as if you were needing assistance in a video game, which, by the way, this film makes several references to. In particular, the Chernobyl level in Call of Duty 4 with Capt. MacMillian. Even the opening scenes are reminiscent of Half-Life, and a lot of the free-running scenes are inspired by Mirror's Edge.For those who are wondering, no. You likely won't get dizzy watching a 90-minute action film from an FP perspective. Well, maybe you shouldn't sit in the front row. Otherwise, you will have a blast.'Hardcore' is an all-around fun time. Just be okay with the violence. It's only 90 minutes of your time that you'll likely want to experience over and over again. Or, you'll just want to plug in a play a few games. Either way, it's bloody fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Person Shooter - The Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* Spoiler Free *Just saw this at TIFF 2015 Midnight Madness. Judging by the constant applause and laughter throughout, the audience LOVED it. I thought it was truly INCREDIBLE and genuinely new... a landmark film. Hopefully that will be recognized without hindsight. I believe Hardcore has the chance to be Star Wars for this generation... or perhaps a Terminator or a Reservoir Dogs. I'm writing this to help ensure that happens. Context: I also thought Crank was great.The ENTIRE movie takes place in FIRST PERSON point of view (POV). ALL 90 MINUTES. It never gets old and the POV remains a strength throughout. I never got motion sickness (and the movie moves fast - incredibly fast). After the movie, the director mentioned the Vimeo short would be unwatchably choppy on the big screen. 2 engineers spent 2 months creating a special rig with 2 magnetically stabilized GoPros to shoot the film. This new rig is the reason why the audience didn't get motion sickness.I've never seen action like this. It's not just regular action scenes filmed in first person. It's superheroic parkour, fantastical fights, and video game gunplay all presented in first person. Seen from a regular angle, the action would likely be too cartoonish. The POV helps ground everything, making it more believable. Added Bonus: During many scenes you'll wonder how the POV camerman didn't get killed.Hardcore is incredibly violent, but rarely nasty. People who play modern FPS's will not bat an eye, others will be shocked and appalled. Expect a lot of controversy when the older crowd expresses grave concern about this film, while the younger crowd rallies behind it. Expect marketing to exploit this generation gap.Action aside, the movie has an unexpected sense of humour. Some driven by situations, some driven by characters, some thanks to the POV. There's not a lot, but what is there is gold - and a relief during all that action.The main character, despite never appearing, is able to communicate a personality. I believe FPSs will steal the ideas presented here. The circle is complete.Which brings me to Jimmy (Sharlto Copley)... Can't say much but he's easily as compelling as the action. His interactions with our hero (the POV) are not straightforward, and always intriguing. Somehow they form a bond, which winds up unexpectedly touching. Before the movie Sharlto said it was the craziest, hardest role he's ever done and it's easy to see why.The bad? The overall plot is good but not great. The bad guy, beyond being powerful and evil, has less character than the POV. Despite some attempts, women are relegated to lesser roles. (I believe the good far FAR outweighs the bad)Russian Hollywood has created the best first person shooter ever made. When POV becomes the new bullet time, you can thank Hardcore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is INSANELY awesome!!!If I could rate it a 20, I would, just from the shear story telling, character investment and novel first-person POV, not to mention all the video game tropes, puns, and long shots!!At least 90% of the movie are long shots, that's how well it was directed!It contains a LOT of elements from Counter Strike, Modern Warfare, Half- Life 2, Portal and Mirrors Edge, so if you like those games, you should absolutely love this movie!It has a LOT of gore in it, so I wouldn't recommend it to the squeamish, but if you're a high-octane true-blooded alpha male like myself, you should absolutely love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this with no preconceived expectations. I saw the trailer, it looked interesting, I went.I wasn't disappointed. Whether this is a commercial hit or a flop, it will be a cult film forever. It's an instant classic for no other reason than it's just so damn fun. Your best bet to enjoy this movie is to see it as an experience and not as art. Don't ask questions about characters background or whine when they don't explain random biker chicks with samurai swords... it just doesn't matter. I eat ice cream because I like ice cream...

		<fullReview>I was definitely already a fan of the Biting Elbows music video that gave rise, but was unprepared for the roller coaster of awesome that doesn't let up for 90 minutes. I don't know if it was the 98 foot Frank's FDX screen or just a more attached rig, but some of the action was shaky and a little hard to follow, especially when Henry would get moved or tossed around. Without a sense of motion, you can lose your bearings. Being an avid FPS gamer will really help here. I'd recommend not filling your vision to the periphery with the screen (like the front 1/3rd point, where I sat) and choose a middle screen height position, which will make it more like a computer monitor experience. That said, I still found it easier to follow then the hand to hand combat in the early Bourne films, and more enjoyable. The audio is a blast with a good system, so don't wait until it gets to the crappy 30 seat theaters with the turned down speakers the megaplexes seem to tuck away in unused corners. Sharlto Copley is extremely fun to watch in this film and did a great job not being the same character in District 9, and Elysium, proving far far from it (not a fan of Chappie, but he did well in that too).There are so many oo, ahh, wow, and shock moments in this film. I really want to see a sequel and would definitely be happy to help fund it if they go that route again. I think I will be seeing this again.tldr: if you grew up with or are a fan of FPS games, this movie is amazingly fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best action movie that I saw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not worth 18 certificate on the grounds of violence, I've seen more violent movies in my life for almost 58 years(I'm born in 1958 and I'm watching movies from when I was 3 years old). And I have seen thousands of films, almost all from 1961 onward and thousands of movies made before I was born. In terms of action, Hardcore Henry has the highest level of adrenaline, pure adrenaline, the highest quality. Now I believe that people, not all of them, only some people, can levitate. I'm kidding, of course. But everything is so well done in this film, that it almost seems truthful. The stunts are downright breathless. But not only. All actors, music, editing, everything. It makes you want to see it again and again, to understand it and feel better. An exceptional film, excellent. Ilya Naishuller, I want to work with you! And, to answer to a guy here on IMDb, concerning the problem he has with the stupid "dance routine" in the middle, I don't know Ilya Naishuller but, I'm almost sure that he wanted to pay homage to Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange (1971), a film in exactly the same kind, a masterpiece of the genre, a film about violence and how violence can be cured. Remember the dance scene of Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) to the tune Singin 'in the Rain? Maybe Ilya Naishuller will tell us... 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say "Look out Quentin Tarantino!" What a crazy ride! Director/Writer Ilya Naishuller is hardcore and takes shootouts to a different level. I loved the camera movement but it does take some getting used to. Overall, it was entertaining in a gory way and the splattering of humor made the gore a little more tolerable.One scene with the subtitles overlapping (not sure if on purpose) was interesting and funny because it was a 3-person conversation - whiny and catty - all talking at the same time. If you like Jason Statham and Quentin Tarantino action and shock value, you will love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why you should definitely go to Hardcore Henry: 1. This is the best action movie of the year, and probably in general. Remember the wonderful impressions of the scene in the church in the movie "Kingsmen"? So here are the impressions almost the entire movie. 2. The director obviously loves Tarantino, fine jokes, blood abundance and diversity of murder. sometimes people in the cinema was just hysterical. 3. Great soundtrack, which brought even a song by Queen. 4. The plot, though not perfect, but it was much better than expected. 5. Sharlto Copley rocks. 6. Lots of interesting cameo, even Tim Roth. 7. The film was made for just $ 2 000 000, and it Exceeds "Adrenaline" and "Raid". 8. The film was shot in Moscow. Very cool to watch the action taking place. 9. The film contains a lot of dirty jokes, plenty of jokes is based on the obscene vocabulary. 10. A number of references to (and not only) the gaming industry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is the ultimate action movie ever. the sci-fi used to create the moves and the picture is brilliantly done. i have never been more impressed by a movie. this is dope. its drama leading to revenge leading to fighting leading to trust. this movie is underrated and deserves more. just because this is not a marvel production people may over look it. i highly recommend this movie if u love either comedy- action, science fiction, drama, adventure. and this is the first action movie that i think deserves an award. The casting and story line have been hand picked by the producers. the overall outline is carefully planned. at some moments i felt like it was actually me that is doing those things. at first i only watched the movie because i was curious how a Point of view film would turn out so good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HARDCORE HENRY (2016) ***1/2 Sharlto Copley, Danila Kozlovsky, Haley Bennett, Tim Roth, Andrei Dementiev. Over-the-top sci-fi auctioneer part RoboCop part Frankenstein about an experiment gone awry involving the titular hero who winds up a patchwork of technical genius as a super soldier who attempts to stop demented Akan (Kozlovsky as an albino with telekinetic powers) from killing his wife (Bennett) in the process of world domination. Filmed with balls-out- brio and employing cameraman/stunt man Dementieve in a gonzo first-person shooter POV that induces vertigo among other stomach and head ache inducing visuals (you've been warned) with a fun breakneck mix of violence (often jarringly graphic) and slapstick comedy (Copley gets into his inner Peter Sellers as a clone). Original anarchic daredevil how-the-hell did they do that brio thanks to maverick direction by Ilya Naishuller who collaborated on the bonkers script by Will Stewart!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshingly Original Action from a Purely Punch-Drunk Perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What this boils down to is pretty easy: a ruthlessly simple plot that merely exists to feed cool fight scenes. Of course, the main gimmick is the shooting style: we spend the duration in the first-person, experiencing the gunfights and tumult of a mute protagonist from a perspective just above the bridge of his nose. To my great surprise, the filmmakers are actually inventive and unorthodox enough to keep this from feeling stale. In fact, apart from the constant threat of motion sickness, it works marvelously. They're even able to play it for some great laughs, often conveying the action hero's frustrations and feelings in pantomime like a classic silent film. Its dramatic chops are not a strength - in fact it seems to be a film entirely staffed by stuntmen, students and models - and it gravely struggles when the fireworks halt (albeit briefly) to further the story. The main foil is a particularly egregious example, akin to Tommy Wiseau playing Julian Assange with telekinetic powers. Theater really isn't what this is about, though, and if you were expecting Shakespeare you may want to undergo a thorough cranial exam. As a playground for pyrotechnics, special effects, parkour and crazily original fight scenes, it delivers in spades. You may feel guilty for enjoying this, but enjoy it you shall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Computer game or film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never have I seen a film that is so pious towards computer gaming ? namely a first person shooter (FPS). However, what is so intriguing is that this film is a standalone, it's not based on a game. How can it be replicating something that doesn't exist? (other than paying homage to a genre). The film's standout USP is the point of view stance it gives Henry. It's easy to see the mass appeal, as there are swarms of gamers living a second life in POV. This cinematography worked effortlessly throughout. The start slowly adjusted us to this shot, and after the first couple of scenes I was completely at ease with this direction, which was brilliantly assisted with a soundtrack that set an atmosphere of serenity at the outset. Hardcore Henry certainly lives up to its name, as it is steeped in an high octane, abundance of action. This non-stop action showed great promise from the start, but as the action kept on topping itself my interest eventually dwindled. I personally believe that a viewer is more appreciative of action when it is sprung upon them. Watching 'HH', I became aware of what was happening to an extent where I was thinking, "This will probably happen." It's a bit of a moot point; as what did I expect? The film is called Hardcore Henry. However, the hardcore status certainly would have remained if the action was toned down. There can be nothing wrong with hinting or even explicitly stating that action will occur and/or the viewer predicting/knowing something will happen, but when this film is attempting to mesmerise us by the relentlessness of it, I didn't want to predict it to the extent that I did. I wasn't let down it nor mesmerised by this film. I found it to be more of a computer game. It's as if Akan is the boss and Henry must fight legions of Akan's minions in order to face him. This is a simplification of course. Albeit, it works well as a spectacle. If there was any film I was allowed to watch without sound, at this moment I'd pick Hardcore Henry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't a perfect movie by any means, but it is one of the better action movies ever put out to date. It gives you entirely enough context before throwing you headlong into the action that it feels remenicent of the First Person Shooters of old, see games along the lines of Doom and Duke Nukem 3d, mostly in that after a short opening, the main character starts slaughtering his way through legions of the bad guys, and just never really stops.That said, the plot is light, they don't try and delve deeper into Henry's character, he has two flashbacks in the entire movie, and one of them is a short motivational speech that lasts for less then a minute before he is back to being an unstoppable super death cyborg.The action scenes, for as great as they are, can be disorienting with the use of shaky cam, but it really adds to the feeling of just charging headlong into murdering enough people to populate an entire village with.</fullReview>

It may not have been the greatest plot or film, but it certainly was a good action film that used a unique viewer perspective to provide an awesome ride through a plot that keeps you asking "ok, what next?" in the sense of a trigger happy gamer.

		<fullReview>DEFINITELY WORTH WATCHING. I would have given it a perfect 10 had the plot been a little bit more organized. I think the movie misses some audiences in the first 10-15 minutes because the confusion they wanted to create makes people think it's just some stupid beat-em-up movie and they walk out during the beginning. Once you get past this part, the movie enters a more organized pace and you are just drawn in. The filming from the first person view is quite amazing and the special effects, locations and stunts are stunningly real - unlike many Hollywood stunts and effects. This movie is fast paced and Sharlto Copley gives his best appearance ever IMHO. Hardcore Henry sets a new standard for FPV action movies and I doubt any other production will come close to it if at all - because this movie is unique and trying to make other movies like this will just make the genre seem silly. It deserves much more credit and appreciation and I think the media ruled it out just because it is Russian-made, not American. The Kingsmen first person fight scene was highly appraised whereas Hardcore Henry is far more elaborate and realistic - yet it received quite a negative response.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have Sharlto Copley and a few seconds of Tim Roth, but all the rest are Russian, including the writer and director Ilya Naishuller. You want to make a video game movie? Forget the game, just make the movie. It's completely first person, it has no context, no characters, just a weird almost drug addled shooter running for an hour and a half. The film that most resembles it is Crank, which was more fun, but less action packed. I mean it's non stop headshots and explosions and ripping off arms and smashing faces. The problem is that there is nothing else. You feel you are watching the cinematic sequences of a game that was never made.The good parts are that the movie is actually fun if you turn off your brain. The action scenes alone are very well done and almost hide that the army of henchmen that dies (the body count is in the hundreds, it feels) is just entering rooms without checking, running in open field and have shitty reactions. But that's henchmen for you.Bottom line: Pure action. I mean on IMDb it's tagged as Action, Adventure, Sci- Fi,Thriller. There is sci-fi, it happens in the near future, but without that sprinkle there is nothing else there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry is very interesting, it was this constant, over the top, insane trip in first person. About this point, I found that the shakiness and such could be off-putting at times, and resulted in a minor headache afterwards. But it was amazing, the stunt work and all was very fascinating and impressive.Hardcore Henry is insanely violent as we follow Henry through his journey for vengeance where he basically massacres his way through the movie. Explosions, bloodshed, all of that stuff. This film was adrenaline filled and at a high note through the entire film. The entire film was filmed in this perspective that makes the film seem very much like a first person shooter game. One particular scene most of all, where Henry has to clear out all the enemy troops while protecting 'crippled Jimmy' who is on this elevator. Another thing is Henry constantly being set these tasks and objectives, to do this and do that. All helps to build this very video game esque movie.Some penalize it for having a lack of story, but I personally feel that the plot was intriguing enough. I quite liked the story and the world building made me want to see more, perhaps a potential sequel?Sharlto Copley's Jimmy was definitely the highlight performance in this movie. He was charismatic and very likable. Perhaps the best part of his performance is his ability to play 'multiple roles' in this film (no spoilers!).If you just want a fun time, to kick back and watch someone kick ass. Hardcore Henry is the film for you, but be warned, it is not for the light hearted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film very hard to sit through. Granted, I am not a fan of hand held, nor jagged, high motion, video type camera work. I just find it dizzying, and hard to watch. This was non-stop. While a potentially interesting story, and a decent sci-fi angle, there just was not enough there. The direction felt very amateurish. It did not feel coherent. It felt as though they were relying on the gimmick, more that real skills. Everything about this movie screams video game. Henry wakes up after an accident at some point in the future. He has been badly injured and has had his arm and leg replaced with high tech limbs which will give him great strength and skills. All of a sudden the facility is attacked by a super freak with a group of ridiculous goons in tow. Henry is forced to rescue the scientist working on him (his wife) and escape. To say the plot is weak, recycled, poorly staged, and amateurish, would be an understatement. It is fairly easy to stereotype Russian goons these days. With King Vlad's continued antics, the recent state sponsored revelations of their sports world, and the Olympic doping scandal, the whole place looks like a nation turning into an asylum. But, these were cardboard characters, differing very little from comic book figurines. Lastly, the people responsible for the cinematography on this film should be tried on felony charges, as con artists. It appears they just decided to save a bundle by using a go-pro, and little editing. The result was an abomination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new experience...Just Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie yesterday without much expectation.This is my first review post on IMDb.This movie impressed me so much that today morning 1st thing I am doing on net is writing this.This one was a completely new experience.It made one of my old wish came true beautifully.I watched tons of action movies in my 32 years old life and sometimes wished to watch all those actions on POV mode.Honestly the director did it brilliantly.This movie is very much graphic.Not up to the level of SAW or Hostel but watching all those closely in POV takes it to a new level.Actually everything looks different in this Movie even if viewer have seen all those action already many times.I was worried that I may feel a little dizzy or motion sickness but nothing like that I felt.It was like any other movie.I don't know why I never heard about this movie before.It should be a cult movie for all action lovers.I am going to recommend this movie to all my friends.Watch it.I am giving 9 out of 10.1 star I am not giving for that telekinesis power of the villain,I did't like that part and the climax was somewhat predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent unexpected entertainment !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start.....This is my first movie review, i have been tempted before, however this film forced me to write. Action, non stop, 90mins worth of FPS. Don't let the fact it is shot in FPS put you off, the direction, and cinematography were very, very impressive. Looked like one big take. Music was sensational, (turn it up in 5.1), also view the credits til the end, while contemplating what just happened in that 90mins !! Granted, it is violent, (Kill Bill, John Wick )as FPS are(Duke Nukem, C.O.D.) some may say that it is gratuitous, however, it puts YOU in the action, and i heard myself say more than once "Nice one", after a good move, or "WTF am I now!" .....and that is why I watch movies.!! If you want action, can handle the violence then strap yaself in for a ride.! This movie will be close to the top of my picks for 2016.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You might need to watch this 2 or 3 times to fully understand the story. And if ya don't like the "shaky camera" thing, move along. I honestly hate the shaky camera, but this was so much different than normal shaky camera style. More like shakyish Omni, LOL. This was shot like Henry was wearing a body cam ( or through his eyes ), and you have no idea what's going on, and can be quite confusing, but the concept is spot on in my opinion.Basis of the story is the viewer (you) are Henry, brought back from the dead and enhanced with robotics, to find the bad guy, who kidnapped your wife, and rescue her. You meet this guy named Jimmy ( played by Sharlto Copley ) who helps you keep clear of the bad guys on the way to your finding your wife. Along the way you start to learn what is really going on, all the while, it's total chaos, kinda like a first person shooter video game. There's a lot of violence, bullets and gore and a hell of a lot of peeps getting maimed and killed and a bit of blood spatter, so be prepared for that. The story teases a lot, you're trying to figure out what's going on till nearly the end. All in all, a truly unique cinematic experience. Watch it at least one time, even if you don't care for the bloody violence. I felt like I was in Henry's shoes the whole time, experiencing everything he experienced. Effen awesome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious Hardcore First Person Shooter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hilarious Hardcore First Person Shooter(FPS). Thats the best way to quickly describe Hardcore Henry. This film take almost all the aspects you find in any good blood and gore soaked, first person shooter based computer game, you care to name and transforms them into a very watchable, action flick. The thrills and spills never end with action that is well paced, as is the inclusion of a variety of FPS elements, including a myriad of very familiar (to gamers) ways of bringing death, to a seemingly endless army of opponents. All set against different and novel back drops, as the film progresses. Sitting alongside the action is a a healthy amount of mostly very physical, predictably black, humour injected into this film, that works extremely well. There a lot to like here and yes a little to dislike. The FPS approach can be somewhat jarring on the senses, at times and the gore factor, is most definitely not for everyone. Especially those who like their action, a little more respectable. For myself, I can not help but like Hardcore Henry. Its fresh, its cleverly directed and acted with good casting choices, like Sharlto Copley. Copley must have had endless fun with the broad variety of characters he portrays with no small amount of humour, in this film. A must see for hardcore action fans. Eight out of ten from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mess, but an awesome one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very funny to read the reviews written about Hardcore Henry. It is all very contradictory in a most amusing way.. So now I just feel compelled to give my feelings/opinions on few points.-The violence is there and it sure isn't for the faint of heart but it isn't gruesomely realistic to the point where it would become disturbing. For some strange reason I feel that the first person view actually introduces a detachment which helps to cope with what is shown (I know, one would expect the contrary...) -For some there is too much plot, for others none whatsoever, well it felt just right for me, not the most surprising scenario mind you, but fine nevertheless. -The Go Pro etc.. camera work could be a real nightmare for your head and your stomach. I for one just can't stand at all the now very popular "lost footage" genre BUT I felt perfectly fine with this movie.. go figure! -The one critic I must rally to is that this movie does feel like it is a bit the same scene over and over. I'm pretty sure one could have introduced more variety, and the first person point of view could be just as striking in an other genre and not just for plain fighting scenes. -The good side of this last point is that you really can, and should, see for yourself if you like that movie; you will know pretty fast if that is something you can enjoy. If you hate the first 10min, well no need to keep on watching.. ;-) -Last point, kudos to the stuntmen, fantastic job!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found the movie very entertaining.It delivers the kind of, dream like, first person action experience,that was promised by the trailer. It's exciting, it's fast, it's nauseating, it's violent, it's cocky, it's funny and it's just bad-ass. Where it scores, for me, is that the feeling really is different from watching non POV movies.Hopefully it paves the way for such type of sequences, at least, being part of movies in the future. I also liked the sense of humor and the Russian touch. On the other hand, the villain is totally over the top and way too cheesy. Plot holes and plot development are well ..meh.But I think everyone gets the story and gets to have fun and that's what counts. This is not a movie to ponder upon and analyse. It's a movie to get your blood pumping.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A first person shooter's wet dream...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An awesome action packed movie is the result and it's a real roller coaster ride until the end credits roll.It is somewhat amazing the way the technique was utilized in this film and still seem to remain fresh the whole movie thru. Sharito Copley showcased that he is a great actor and I can't think of a movie he was bad in and he nailed it in this one.The pacing is extremely high and it takes some getting use to the style. The story sort of gets explained on the run and somethings you sort of figured out become clear down the line. Certainly a movie you got to watch twice because it is easy to miss something with all the action going on.You have to consider this as a high quality popcorn movie so go in with that expectation and you get a near perfection result in what it's trying to do.I wouldn't mind a sequel ,there is enough material to justify it. With the same pacing,a little more explanation and in a bigger setting it should be at least as good as this was. I even think there's enough in there for a trilogy and if done all by the same director and even the same crew that would really benefit in this case.This felt like a new cinematic mile stone and it feels weird saying that for a popcorn action flick but that's the way it is.If you're an action fan this is a real must see for you.I highly recommend it and can't wait to see what the director is gonna do next.Enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>awesome first person shooter in movie format</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have one question for you. Do you love first person shooters? If the answer to that is in affirmative then you will simply love this movie. This movie is simply a first person shooter recorded by someone else and you watch it. It has levels , stages , cut scenes , bosses , minions , weapon drops , med kits , final boss fight and all that comes along with a nice FPS game. It also has some cool twists to go along where you scratch your head wondering what the hell is going on. People who didn't like this movie are probably people who have never gamed in their life and got motion sickness or something on those lines. The movie starts off a bit slow but then it picks up and by the end you just love every bit of it. The movie was mostly shot on go pro , which in itself is quite an achievement . I feel bad that so many nay Sayers exist to this wonderful new idea. This movie is what the Doom movie should have been instead it was just nonsense. So here is my two bits , if you have motion sickness or do not like gaming then maybe this movie is not for you otherwise don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 90-minute cutscene doesn't make a good movie !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not gonna lie, when I saw the trailer for Hardcore Henry, I was enthusiastic ! As far as I know, this is the first time a full length feature film was entirely shot from a POV standpoint. I remember Doom's first person shooter scene made quite an impact back in 2005. In fact it's the only reason to remember that otherwise average movie ! Shooting that sequence was quite a challenge and it only lasted a few minutes ! Ten years later, the web is inundated with POV footage shot with GoPro cameras. The technology and quality have evolved to the point that a project like Hardcore Henry has become both conceivable and affordable ! But just because you can do it doesn't mean you should do it ! While it's admirable to try and bring something new to the action genre, the risk with POV cameras is to induce nausea for some of its viewers. A few scenes are usually okay, but a feature-length 90-minute movie ? On top of that, I was also worried that the first-person action sequences would be the movie's only redeeming quality, meaning that the plot would be almost non-existent and the movie would look like a video game.So to summarize, Hardcore Henry had the potential to either become a ground-breaking film that sets a new bar for great action sequences (kind of like Crank and Cloverfield had a baby !), or be a terrible stomach-churning video game B-movie, as if Uwe Boll directed The Bourne Supremacy! Unfortunately, the latter is closer to the truth. While I admit that I didn't feel sick at the end of the movie (which is an achievement in itself!), Hardcore Henry definitively suffers from its ridiculous story and dialogs, over-the-top action and cardboard cutout characters who seem to come straight from an 80's video game. All in all, it felt like I was watching a 90-minute cutscene, which is why I think this film will only appeal to hardcore FPS gamers who just want to see a transposition of their favorite game on the big screen. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pays Homage To The Great First Person Shooter Games Of The 1990's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The action sequences are fast paced we see only the hands and legs of the principle character Henry - we never see the face. And as a first person type film mimicking a PC game, we have intense scenes of gore and violence.The film concerns a cyborg called Henry who awakens from a deep sleep inside a laboratory on an airship. The first person he sees is a woman called Estelle (Haley Bennett) who claims to be he wife. Next we see the arrival of the villain of the film, a man with telekinetic powers called Akan(Danila Kozlovsky). He attempts to murder Henry. Estelle and Henry manage to escape via an escape pod and from here on wards, the film really picks up.The film is interspersed with encounters with a mysterious man, Jimmy (Sharlto Copley) who claims to know all about Henry. He helps Henry all through the rest of the film and gradually, the truth is revealed.The film is well shot, the cast is superb along with exceptional cinematography and sound-effects. The most well known personality in the film is South African actor Shalto Copley. He has played the role of Wikus van der Merwe in the Oscar-nominated science fiction film District 9, Howling Mad Murdock in the 2010 adaptation of The A-Team, Agent C.M. Kruger in the science fiction film Elysium, James Corrigan in the science fiction horror film Europa Report and King Stefan in the dark fantasy adventure film Maleficent. He also played the title character in the science fiction film Chappie.Ilya Viktorovich Naishuller makes his debut as a director. I think he has handled the project exceptionally. I am looking forward to seeing more of his upcoming movies.List Of FPS Games: Wolfenstein 3D(1992), Doom and Doom 2(1993-1994), Heretic(1994), Hexen: Beyond Heretic(1995) Duke Nukem 3D(1996), Quake (1996), Unreal(1998), Half-life(1998) and Halo: Combat Evolved(2001). I would like to mention the game Unreal. It is powered by an original gameplay and physics engine that now bears the game's name. It is called the Unreal Engine and the latest version as of 2016 is Unreal Engine 4. A lot of games have been built using the engine from versions 1-4 complete list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unreal_Engine_gamesAction movies you may also like: Commando(1985), The Running Man (1987), Die Hard (1988), Demolition Man(1993), Judge Dredd(1995), Lockout(2012).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It could be that I wasn't in the right type of mood to watch "Hardcore Henry", but I was curious about it. A first person action film? Sure, I'll give it a shot. Well, after watching it, I feel that it might work as a video game, but as a film, it doesn't work. It's hollow, it's kinda boring, and its first person gimmick gets old.Most if not all of the film is shown through the POV of a man named Henry. He wakes up in a laboratory, but he's amnesic and unable to speak. He's also a cyborg, I guess. What follows are numerous action scenes. A woman who claims to be Henry's wife gets kidnapped, so he has to rescue her and defeat the villain named Akan, a somewhat eccentric man with telekinetic abilities. I honestly didn't remember what the villain's name is, but thankfully I can use the Internet for info like that.Admittedly, the action scenes are pretty convincing. You see Henry running, fighting, climbing, and such, but there's little reason to care. There's so much action and camera movement that it becomes overwhelming. The camera work is also a bit irritating. It didn't make me feel sick, although I wouldn't be surprised if it made other viewers feel sick.Sharlto Copley's in this, playing different versions of the same character. (It's kinda weird.) Apparently, this film was very challenging for him. He gives a solid performance, though. The other actors are good. There are a few funny moments, like when Henry attempts to ride a horse. The film seems to be mostly concerned about action scenes and I just didn't give a sh*t about them. I'm also not a big fan of the way they were filmed.Watching "Hardcore Henry" is like watching a video game you can't play, which is a bit frustrating. If you've seen the film and you enjoyed it, that's perfectly fine. Again, maybe I wasn't in the right kind of mood to watch it, even though I was interested in watching it. I dunno. I think if I had to choose between watching "Hardcore Henry" or "The Raid 2", I would choose "The Raid 2". Now *there's* a good action film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, let's set the record straight that this movie is not for everyone; it's not a bad movie and it isn't a great movie. Hardcore Henry is exactly what was promoted in the trailer, it's a First Person Shooter camera view of the story. Imagine the movie "Crank" in first person view with a slight deviation in the story. I honestly didn't think I'd enjoy this movie as I don't like FPS based games, I'm more a 3rd person player; but this film was on point. I do give the guys who put out this film major credit for stepping outside the box a bit to give it a go, the film turned out better than I'd anticipated.It's rare to see something come out that isn't Facebook friendly over marketed regurgitated crap, so this was a nice break from such Idiocracy in the world and I thank the film makers for that. This movie isn't for everyone as it is like everything else, everyone will have their own views and opinions and that's cool; and that's what is great about sharing them. Now simply put, if you like action films, then you wont be let down. The cast is on point, the styling is fun; I'd love to see this in 3D. Hardcore Henry is a fun film to enjoy, go check it out.</fullReview>

Great effort for thinking something new and doing it. I really enjoyed Sharlto Copley performance as Jimmy. He was very entertaining. The only problems are the story. Its weak. The story was weak.

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to action in today's generation, it has to be entertaining, chaotic and violent in a reasonable justice for the audience. With Hardcore Henry however, it gives not only a full dose of it but it goes as far to be as entertaining as possible in terms of scale and concept.The film's plot isn't as much, but the concept of it goes like this; a human figure (who we don't hear speak or very much see his face) known as Henry is awaken from sleep and is soon revealed that he is part machine, part human, suffers memory loss and that he is married to his Co-creator's wife. It's not long till then he is pursued by a figure who helms telekinesis power and takes his wife as a hostage to make Henry retaliate against him and his army of goons. Henry isn't alike any human being, he's powerful, fast and it's further convinced to be the hero when mysterious figures (in the many different forms played by the great Shalto Copley) convinces him to find his source and find his wife.What makes this movie a solid roller-coaster ride is it's kinetic energy in action, over the top violence and brutality. Literally the entire film is seen through the eyes of the main character Henry, who we never see his face as mentioned before but we can clearly see he's a dangerous badass that literally makes him unstoppable in the form of Chuck Norris and Charles Bronson (if you seen their movies, you know what I'm saying). The choreography of the fights, shootouts, chases and even it's climax is taken to a new level, where the action feels and looks of a fist person shooter that works stunningly well. There's even a high body count and a dose of blood and gore to keep the over the top tone true to it's name.There isn't a massive A-list cast in HCH, but the creative talent of character player Copley (who co-produced the film) is well worth a watch when there's moments of character and dialogue. Tim Roth also surfaces but it's only a minute long, but he does serve purpose to the lead character.Hardcore Henry is a mix of Crank, The Raid and Kingsman with a high dosage of adrenaline, stylised violence and a fun concept that all action lovers should grasp the hell out-of it! Despite the lack of plot (hence my verdict), it is redeemable entertainment that can be classed as a popcorn action flick.4.5/5 - Autistic Nick- 4/5 stars- Autistic Jay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought I've seen it all, and then I saw Hardcore Henry and realized I have not. The filmmakers where inspired off of those first person shooter games, and watching this film makes you feel like you are playing games like Halo, and Call of Duty to name a few. If you suffer from motion sickness then you should stay away from this, it also has a lot of shaky cam, I usually don't like shaky cam, but here it was used quite effectively.The character is basically a cyborg, who does not remember anything about his life, he goes on the run, and trying to find clues to his identity.Sharlto Copley really lives things him up in his role, but there is a twist about his character. Haley Bennett is also good, but I thought she was Jennifer Lawrence in the trailer. There are some twists you won't see coming. The action scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat. I'm glad I saw it, but would I see it again, probably not, one time was enough.</fullReview>

Sure I don't mind playing a game of this nature and have done, but those are games not movies and this movie tries to blur the line between the two which for me doesn't work in the slightest.

		<fullReview>This is a new genera of film. It hold no bars, or punches. It is a truly epic movie experience. From start to finish I was truly amazed. The critics have ripped this movie apart. So sad. It's not a love story or a hero film. It is a science fiction revenge based thriller. With countless holy s#i! moments and a few laughs along the way. If you are squeamish or can not stand violence, then go see another film. This was more than I expected and I can not wait for this to be released on Blu ray. The only thing that would have made this film more epic was if there was a 3-D version. The film leaves an opportunity for a squeal, or at least a prequel. It would be nice to see a different take on some of the characters. However I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this film. My hats off and a bow down to the crew. A job very well done.</fullReview>

After watching the movie I really feel like I played a nonstop video game for two hours with the hardest difficulty as it doesn't give you anytime to rest.Honestly I think this title deserves a 6 or 7 more than an eight but I would give the extra point for the courage of the director of this experimental movie and hardcore action scene, queen playing in the background near the end.Pros : . Fun . Experimental / Maybe a new genre is created . Music . Enough blood for some gore lovers.Cons :. Exhausting . Acting . Too much blood for some viewersJust give it a chance and start watching. Within the 20 minutes you will know that you can finish or quit watching.</fullReview>

Bottom line, stop trying to make movies based on video-game experience - it'll never work... why?? because a huge part of the gaming experience is to make decisions and feel like you're in the situation... movie experience is an omniscient one, but always without any decision making power.I could go on about the lack of story, poor acting (other than Sharlto Copley, he was great), shaky camera movement (something that was removed from video-games for a very good reason) in order for you to not understand what's going on and add that "cheep" adrenaline feeling to it...But what really bugged me the most is how they wasted a perfectly good and brilliant Tim Roth...Bottom line, this feels like watching your brother play Quake or any other FPS for 2 hours - it's just boring and not the same thing as playing it yourself...A by-standard in the first person</fullReview>

While Hardcore Henry is undoubtedly one of the more ambitious films I've seen, it only ends up as film that showcases the cool aspects of a first person video game, but forgets the important aspects of actually making a film engaging.Many films have used the first person style for the occasional shot here or there, but I don't know that a film has ever been done quite like Hardcore Henry. It's supposedly shot entirely on a GoPro camera to give the audience a real "first-person-feel". Being an action movie, there's no shortage of insane stunts and bloody mayhem to keep the viewer enthralled. With that said, I wish they would have balanced the story with the action more. The premise is that Henry is a cyborg who appears to have his entire previous life taken from him, so he goes on a killing spree in hopes of getting his wife back. That's really all there is to it.The always great Sharlto Copley plays Jimmy, who helps Henry on his way to the villainous Akan. Copley gets a lot to do as several different versions of Jimmy and each implanted a new breathe of fresh action into the story. But really, it all ends up being one long action music video. Perhaps the reason I wasn't as invested in Henry's story was because he's virtually indestructible. He falls from buildings and motorcycles, gets shot dozens of times, and even gets himself caught on fire, only to be fine minutes later. How can I care about what Henry is going through if during every action scene I know there aren't any real consequences?I do admire the ambition of everyone involved. I can always get on board with someone willing to try something new with film, including the studio who green-lit the project, I was just hoping for a story that I could get invested in, instead of high octane action scene after high octane action scene. Hardcore Henry makes a definite splash with its action, but you won't leave the theater moved in any sort of emotional way.+Ambition+Action-Although too much shaky-cam/headache inducing scenes-I was never invested in Henry5.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loudcore Henry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry, like 10 Cloverfield Lane, is a big 2016 sci-fi directorial debut. But where Cloverfield portrayed a confident greatness beyond its filmmaker's experience, Henry opts to obnoxiously rely on being "different" rather than being good. A largely nonsensical headache of a movie, it should've been called Loudcore Henry (loud volume, loud performances, loud plot, and loud twists). Dripping with relentless noise and chaotic combat, it's more of a sleeper-hold than a round-house kick, simulating white noise over thrilling filmmaking. As one of the first films told entirely from first-person perspective, we experience Henry's mysteriously bad and villain-filled day through his eyes. While the movie gets some credit for being unique, it's mostly just disorienting, both in form and in content. The plot is a slap-dash collection of twists, both clich and confusing, covered in lazy attempts at humor and tonally unfocused music. Even the action, clearly the film's selling point, is so extremely violent and decadent that it misses its target of being bold and lands closer to being reckless. Nonetheless, many of those set-pieces are fairly propulsive, especially the marquee hotel scene. Unfortunately, with great movies like Dredd and The Raid covering this area, all that's left with Henry is that first-person POV, and eventually you wonder if that gimmick becomes more of a hindrance than an asset, confusing otherwise interesting action through a hectic lack of focus. Just because your movie looks and feels like a first-person shooter doesn't mean it should have the brain of a pre-teen gamer. Maybe I'm getting old, but watching someone else play a C-level video game for 90 minutes is not my idea of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, I REALLY liked the shorts this movie is based on, so I was ecstatic to see it was being made into a full length movie. Unfortunately it falls short in a lot of ways.The format is awesome, just like the short action scenes from you tube, but there just wasn't enough original content for me. I think action movies are mostly about those "woah, that was cool" moments, and this movie just doesn't have enough of them. It was kind of like watching a really long montage of people being punched and stabbed close up. Like if you watch the matrix, every part of the lobby scene is unique and cool. This was more like "oh there's a guy, PUNCH", "oh there's two more guys, PUNCH, KICK" repeated over and over. Henry also felt too omnipotent to me. After a while you'd see a room full of guys and know he's just going to go through a blur of killing all of them. If that just happened at a climactic moment, it would be cool, but it happens so often it looses all meaning.The plot was eh. This wouldn't be a deal breaker, but it certainly didn't bring the movie UP.One other minor thing. I think they could have done a lot more with non-combat stuff. Like intimate or flirty scenes could be really cool in POV, but there wasn't much of that...also, the title sequence was BRUTAL. Like I'm pretty desensitized to violence, and I had to look away at one point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holy freakin' hell! HARDCORE HENRY is insane! What a rock 'em sock 'em experience for us action fans! A full on first person shooter movie where you get to look trough the eyes of the hero. There's firepower, there's parkour, there's sex, blood, drugs, and rock n' roll, HARDCORE HENRY is brutal through and through and you can't get enough.It's a Russian film featuring familiar faces like Sharlto Copley, Tim Roth, and the beautiful rising star, Haley Bennett. During the movie, so much is going on, you may have some difficulties collecting the pieces together but those of us sci-fi fans will soon realize that the concept is quite familiar. Henry is part man, part robot, resurrected from death with no memory, he eventually learns that he's part of bio-engineering soldiers led by a vicious warlord. And the only person who can help him is this group of avatars designed by a master scientist/engineer. Clearly, writer/director Ilya Naishuller and co-writer Will Stewart are very specific as to which audience they're targeting with this film: gamers and those of us who are fascinated with that world.Obviously the true stars of this film are the camera work and VFX, it gets you badly wanting to purchase the Blu-Ray/DVD whenever it comes out just so you can see the featurette on how the production was done. Ilya did give us that Biting Elbows' viral POV music video, and so take that and turn up the amp to 11, and you get HARDCORE HENRY.I had my doubts at first, I mean the trailer looked awesome, an entire movie done POV-stye, who wouldn't want to watch that out of plain curiosity! But my concern was that the film would feel like you're just watching a GoPro video instead of something that's cinematic, another concern was that if a few minutes of the first "Cloverfield" already had my head go dizzy, what would 96 minutes of "Hardcore Henry" do to me?! But turns out, I had a blast. HARDCORE HENRY lives up to its title, it's hardcore, it's fun, and it's more than just a roller coast ride, it's like drag-racing. I think whether or not this method is as immersive as a 3D or a IMAX experience, can always be argued, but you can definitely file this under the category unique. I read a critic somewhere said that HARDCORE HENRY reminds him much of "The Raid," and ya know what, he's on point there, our protagonist in this film constantly battling so many villains, all at once, scene after scene, halfway through you start to wonder how and from where on earth do these villains keep on coming, they constantly pop out of nowhere, but then again, that goes towards the fact that most first person shooter video games out there are done in this exact manner where you keep finding yourself having to fight and shoot your way out, non-stop.Is this the future of cinema, is this as virtual reality as it gets for us without our having to wear those big oculus rift gears? Who knows, but it sure works for HARDCORE HENRY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Concept, Terrible Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe this to be the very First Person movie produced for mass audiences. The trailer is enough to captivate anyone that watches it at first glance, so I was excited to make sure I watched it on the big screen because it didn't seem like the type of movie that would be worth watching at home. I didn't go watch because of the plot, I went, like many others, just for the experience of a 90 minutes of a first person action film. Where it failed: All sequences looked the same except with different "thugs" and different guns. It felt like the movie looped at least 4 times. I am not sure the correct word to use in this situation is "bored" but I was tired of the same thing over and over by the first 30 minutes I wanted to walk out, but I didn't want to miss "SOMETHING", which never really came. The experience was not that great, it was not like the 180 degree cinemas they had back in the days where they would put you on the seat of a roller coaster and you could really feel like you were part of it. I wasn't able to feel included, it did not really seem that immersive as I thought it was going to be. Although I didn't come for the plot, I have to say this movie was just weird. I won't get into the details but it was all over the place, a mess really. I am not sure more like these will be produced, It will all depend on how the mass audience reacts to the title, but although I do not see a future for "first person movies" I do think this is a gateway into 360 Virtual Reality movies, which in theory at least, sounds very interesting. I have to say, go watch it for the experience of something completely different, but don't expect anything out of the ordinary</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollow triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hardcore Henry" is a numbing, unrelenting assault on the senses. It's extremely well-directed: the concept of exclusively first-person POV camera-work is carried out flawlessly. But the script will offend even viewers with single-digit IQs. The film is as stupid, repetitive and mindless as....well, a bad video game. It is also grotesquely violent. The action is non-stop, but utterly suspenseless; Henry is virtually indestructible, so there is no sense of danger or physical impact to any of his adventures. The climactic fight, where he single-handedly defeats dozens of superior robot-soldiers, hits a new low in stupidity, tastelessness, and simply not knowing when to quit. But I will give Naishuller credit for two clever winks at the audience: the poster of "The Lady In The Lake" on a wall, and the music from "The Magnificent Seven" in a scene with a horse. Despite the ultraviolence, it's only in rare moments such as these that the movie seems to be targeting adult viewers. * out of 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is the good and the bad:The good: This is rewriting the rules of cinematography in that the style comes not from previous narrative movies, nor from documentaries, but from the gaming world, which is how most young people experience their TV screens. They are masterful in their ability to hide the cut and place the viewer in the action. The bad: This movie is watchable on your TV in a lit room or on a small screen, but it's not watchable in a movie theater. The shaky camera is enough to give you a headache, which is also true of many video games. Although this movie is groundbreaking, it comes out when many movies have already been more successful making the POV style more watchable, such as Russian Ark, Birdman, and to an extent, Revenant. Those movies did it with a Steadicam operator, which is much heavier equipment, and to be fair, they lack the immediacy and faithfulness to POV of Hardcore Henry. More than those other films, Hardcore Henry shows what is possible in the POV style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Point Of View</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Producers in the film industry is always trying to find new and innovative ways of allowing the audience to feel more involved in their film and immerse them in the world that has been created. So in the competitive industry that is film, what else is there left to do to achieve this audience goal? In 2016, Writer, Director Ilya Naishuller answered this with 3 letters. P.O.V. No film has done more to immerse it's audience better than the crowd funded, first person shooter movie Hardcore Henry. This hard hitting action movie stars you, the viewer as Henry, a man brought back from the dead as a cyborg whose wife gets kidnapped by some telekinetic dude, and now you and an army of Sharlto Copelys must save her and stop this evil... So Chop Chop you better get a move on!THIS FILM IS AWESOME! The first person style worked perfectly with the fast pace action sequences the film is packed with. Of course the camera is going to be a little jerky due to it being the point of view of a person but its so slight that it's not a problem. The only time I would say the POV gets a little bit too jerky is the final fight, but in all fairness, Henry does have to fight and oncoming horde of enemies who look like the cast of A Clockwork Orange trained to fight in that super cool Showdown at House of Blue Leaves Kill Bill Vol 1 scene. To me the gimmick was fantastic and literally brought you close to the action. I know that this film is style over substance, but you walk in knowing this full well so if you can sit back and have fun then you are in for a brutally kick ass ride.The film only really has 4 actors really (the cast list is about 90% stunt people) of which only two are noteworthy. One for good reasons and one for being utter sh*t. Let's start with the good shall we? Sharlto Copely was good in this film, playing multiple different versions of himself on and off throughout the film. Although we don't get to care about his character all that much I still feel he did a good job playing a bunch of vastly different people. This is a tall task to which he deserves credit for.Now for the bad. Whoever played the villain did a terrible job. Everything about this guy makes you cringe, like his stupid accent and occasional over the top acting. Not only was the actor bad but the character is even worse. Probaby should cut the guy some slack. Akan is like an annoying boss in a video game who won't have a fair fight and waits until you fight through hordes and hordes of henchmen before he even gets his hands dirty. Due to his telekinetic powers every time Henry gets close to him he simply swats him away, this wouldn't have be so annoying if it only happens once or twice in the film instead of God knows how many times it actually happened. Maybe an annoying boss was what the film was aiming for, I don't know, but (SPOILER ALERT) looking on the bright side, at least this all made his death way more satisfying.Overall, Hardcore Henry is a brutally fun roller coaster ride of a film. Sure the plot may be generic and you don't care much for the characters, but this film is about its gimmick, its about letting the audience be a part of the film they are watching and in those aims the film has succeeded. So to close, I highly recommend watching Hardcore Henry and if you do choose to watch it, do one thing, have fun with it as this is one bad ass film and Henry is one Bad Motherf*cker.</fullReview>

If you're that sort of gamer, I'm sure this is candy - but it never gets beyond that gimmick to tell a good story. The camera-work is good for driving scenes. But for fistfights, running and parkour? Hell, no! I'm not rating this movie because it's not like I didn't know what was in store going in. Mildly curious, sure, but it has FPS written all over it from the start. Even so, I doubt I'll ever see this again. Here's a much better way to describe it. You know those Let's Play videos on YouTube? This is *exactly* like that. You're watching a video game that someone else is playing. Where's the appeal in that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great ride but boring story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now to begin with I came into this movie expecting a great action comedy flick and that's exactly what I got. This film is absolutely bonkers and it knows it, from the great fight choreography to the excessive blood, limbs and splosions going off, this film has all the great aspects of an action film.The corny acting in this film at first seems bad, but over time it really compliments the films old school action roots well and makes it feel like a bad ass action film from the 80's or 90's.Now this films plot is predictable, boring and drawn out. The lazy plot could have worked well with this film if they didn't keep bringing up a lot of exposition during the breather scenes in between fights, these exposition scenes only slowed down the pacing of the film and took me out of my adrenaline fuelled ride. If they just shortened or cut some of these scenes then the pacing would have been more consistent through out the film and I would have given this a perfect 10.Overall this films plot is very well put together and often gets in the way but it is still a really great ride and definitely worth a watch if you love over the top action films and for this reason I am going to give Hardcore Henry an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a film maker the aspect of this movie being shot entirely in first person makes me so happy because I know how difficult it must have been to be the camera operator, stuntman and actor all in one and it came out looking way better than expected. The camera quality is not what you would see on other big movies but you have to remember that it was shot mostly on two GoPros strapped into a harness on someones head. I will admit that it is hard to adjust to seeing things in first person for so long without holding a controller but if you just relax and watch the movie you feel immersed like no other film. You start to feel like you are Henry. Other movies make you empathize with the character but seeing things literally from their perspective makes you feel like that person is you. It is also amazing that you can tell Henry's emotions throughout the film without seeing his face or hearing his voice but by paying attention to his body language. That is some amazing acting and awesome directing. All in All it is a new style to film making industry and if you're willing to give it a shot it is definitely worth it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Congratulations Hardcore Henry, you just joined my very short list of "Movies That Should Have Never Existed". This is as simple as an FPS from the 90s. I mean even today's games have a more solid story than this. Many many many unexplained loopholes. Stupid story. Stupid characters. Fight choreography that came all the way from the 80s. This is just plain stupid. If you wanna go in details, here they are: - What is that man with telekinesis powers came from? Really? Just like that we would accept a meta-human in a story like this? - Everything in the fights is staged for Henry to win. Even the last fight with the "Last Boss". The bodies in the air were exactly like a perfect staircase for him to reach the bad guy. Seriously? - The story, again, is so plain stupid and very shallow. This is the most annoying part for me. The story in a game like Deus Ex (which is not that complicated) is more solid and acceptable than this one. I don't recommend anyone to waste their time and money to watch this crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Regarding Henry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry is essentially a first person shooter because it is told from the point of view of the protagonist whose face we do not see and whose voice we do not hear.Henry escapes from bad guys who are trying to kill him and a deranged scientist who is after in order to rescue his wife who has been kidnapped. Sharlo Copley turns up as various persons mostly with a cockney accent that sounds like Jason Statham. You immediately think that this film reminds you of the Crank films, until Copley shows up as a soldier with a stiff upper lip when he channels his inner Peter Sellers.Copley provides the humour but the film tries too hard to mimic a console game, Henry comes across as indestructible and I never really fathomed what what the story was about as it was non existent, although it did kind of feel similar to Robocop as the mad scientist is trying to create some kind of a cyborg army.The film was shot by specially mounted GoPro cameras but the film just feels too much of a gimmick and less coherent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect a good plot. I didn't expect any Oscar noms for performances. But what I Did expect was a film that lived up to the sharlto copley short that ultimately led to this feature film. First the strengths. Pacing. Action packed. Pretty funny. What I didn't like. Unfortunately the film didn't "wow" me the way I thought it would. The "short film" being, not only used but used as the climax, was a bit anti-climactic. It was clearly the best action sequence in the film, and I had seen it a year before the release of the movie. Overall, i really feel like the action sequences throughout the rest of the film lacked the humor, and the original design of that one scene. I just think they really squandered some opportunity here to take advantage of all sorts of first-person ideas, and failed to blow me away at all really. Some of the best scenes are very early based around a highway overpass.. Past that it kinda bored me a bit to tell you the honest truth. It was action packed, but again, i think they failed at taking advantage of the first-person shooter aspect, and everything that could've been done. Seemed like more running than anything, and all those jaw-dropping moments I came for, never came.The opening credits and the first scene are both too camp, and the lack of any background in the plot, hurts too. Again, I know what this is, and I know the focused appeal, but I AM it's target demographic, and yet it just fails to meet expectations. It also fails to be more effective than the short, shamelessly making that the best part of the movie, and not matching that sequence with any minute of the previous hour.Its good fun, but after seeing the short I was expecting a bit more "wow" than I got. Copley and his comedy saved it from a failing grade. 54/100</fullReview>

Daring take on a very ambitious script with really great action. Well produced and directed too. Jimmy was my favourite character(s), and for valid reason(s).From tanks to copters, snipers to fist fights, car chase to basic parkour, man, machine and supernatural, love, revenge, betrayal, and a lot more.Is the movie perfect?

		<shortDescription>Film Reviews: Hardcore Henry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enjoy video games? POV first-person shooters? Action movies? Unbelievable movie-going experiences? Being a part of something completely different and revolutionary for the cinematic art medium? Having a good time? A really really good time? Then Hardcore Henry is undoubtedly a movie for you. Playing more as a virtual reality experience than anything else, Hardcore Henry is the first ever POV action film where the audience doesn't miss a beat as Henry; a resurrected human turned robotic super human man who climbs walls, falls out of buildings, jumps, runs, kicks, shoots and his way to save the woman he loves, Estelle (Haley Bennett), from a telekinetic super baddie Akan (Danila Kozlovsky) who is out to release his own army of Henry wannabes and uses Estelle's and Henry's technology against themselves. That's pretty well it for narrative, but Hardcore Henry is not about story, heck, it isn't even about redemption. Hardcore Henry is unlike you have ever seen on the big screen and is mostly about tantalizing every single sense in your body. The film is a go, go, go adrenaline ride filled with shaky cam goodness that will redefine the way action movies are made and expectations of audiences, forever. For real though.Exploding its way through the sky with pure craziness and some of the best stunt-work ever filmed, Hardcore Henry is the feature film debut of music video director Ilya Naishuller. Naishuller, frontman of the Russian indie rock band Biting Elbows, who first introduced the first-person action filing in the music videos for their band in their infamous song "Bad M*therfuck", Naishuller directs and launched the band to online fame. After almost 33 million views, with the help of online word- of-mouth, the support of the Internet, Kickstarter and some studio execs, Naishuller was able to develop his action-packed filming style to the silver screen, this time, with with Henry front and centre.Henry, who is never really revealed in the film, was played by ten different stuntmen and cameramen, including its director, gives the literal vision of the film; provided the audience with his complete perspective, and all his kick-assery as well as some flashbacks memories, including a very repetitive one, where his father, played by Tim Roth, encourages Henry at a young age, after taking a beating from some bullies to "swallow the blood in his mouth, stand out, and go spill their's". Seems like some violent advice to tell a youngster, hence why Henry is so good at making everyone all bloody and bruised.Since its premiere at TIFF in the Midnight Madness programme in 2015, Hardcore Henry was being advertise as a movie going experience, unlike anything you have ever seen before. Thankfully, that pitch has been used with so many other films before this, yet, finally, for the first time in a long time, the tagline can live up to its reputation. Hardcore Henry is a gravity defining, atom bomb of excitement and energy on the silver screen. With a narrative pace that travels at the speed of light, the film never stops or ceases to disappoint fans of the hardcore action genre, it burns through its brisk and enjoyable runtime, and cements its place in your memory for life as one of the most exhilarating films you will ever see!Although much praise should be given to the super-sonic stuntmen and cameramen involved with this project, as well as all the dedicated cast and crew who were in love with the making of this film, including Sharlto Copley, who easily hailed the film as the most difficult project of his entire career, the results really speak for themselves. From the catchy use of Queen's undeniably catchy song "Don't Stop Me Now", which I played on repeat while writing this review (hence why you can probably catch many references to the song within the writing), to the brave filming style Naishuller was faithful to throughout the film, to the tremendously sweaty and pulsating score of Darya Charusha, Hardcore Henry is not for the faint of heart, provided endless in-your-face moments.Oh, and when we say faint of heart, we mean it. Since the film was mostly shot using a GoPro Hero3 Black Edition camera, the film is for no one person who can't handle shaky cam, (including my father, who had to leave mere minutes into End of Watch and continued the rest of the film in the restroom). Hardcore Henry is a phenomenal action film and amongst the most superior action films ever made, period. As an action fan, please do not miss this landmark film. By the time the credits roll, despite its lack of deep story and one out-of-nowhere twist, Henry can only be described by the most obvious statement possible: one bad-ass, hardcore mother*cker!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit I jumped on the hype train with this one, the trailer was great and a non-stop action fest that reminded me of a first person version of The Raid: Redemption crossed with the craziest first person shooter ever.Hardcore Henry is, however, a nauseating roller coaster that is just as relentless as the trailers promised. It occurs to me now there is a good reason for movies not to be filmed in the first person perspective. With video games it seems to work because we give input into the movements, here though, you're thrown around all over the place while sitting still. Honestly, the gimmick (and that's all it is) just doesn't work here.With that said, however, there are some great performances from Sharlto Copley, who is just a delightful presence at all times. Danila Kozlovsky is also pretty good, though his character doesn't make a ton of sense, and his having telekenetic powers really doesn't ... do anything except make him a harder boss for us to fight.Ultimately the movie isn't bad, and it's even pretty entertaining, but make sure you've got a strong stomach. Sure it's gory, but I'm talking about the f***ing camera moving around so much.Worth checking out if this kind of thing appeals to you, but it's not going to change your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardcore Henry Is Every Action-Laden Video Game Enthusiast's (Wet) Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shot entirely from a first-person perspective, featuring some delicious dose of ultra-violence, and keeping its viewers delighted with its never-ending action segments, Hardcore Henry is, by every means, an action-laden video-game enthusiast's (wet) dream come true on the silver screen, and despite it lacking a compelling plot or interesting characters, it manages to be an amusing ride.Hardcore Henry tells the story of its titular character, entirely from his point of view. Waking up in a water tank, he finds out that he's been brought back from the dead by his wife. However, when she is abducted by a group of mercenaries working for a powerful warlord, Henry is compelled to save her and finds an unlikely ally in a mysterious man who's well-aware of Henry's current condition.Written, co-produced &amp; directed by Ilya Naishuller in what is his directional debut, Hardcore Henry is filmed from an interesting viewpoint but it doesn't necessarily result in an enhanced film viewing experience, for its gimmick runs out of freshness sooner than expected. The plot is paper-thin, the characters are cardboard cutouts, and when the action isn't happening, it looks enormously dull.Nevertheless, what works in the film's favour is its kinetic camera-work &amp; crazy action stunts, which go hand in hand quite smoothly here. Henry is played by numerous people, ranging from stuntmen to the director himself. Sharlto Copley gets to have some fun as well, playing different avatars of a single character. And its action is unadulterated, R-rated in content &amp; is delivered without breaks.On an overall scale, Hardcore Henry is 96 minutes of non-stop action video game that will manage to entertain its intended audience but there is nothing memorable about it. Sure it takes a different approach &amp; thrills in bits n pieces but it also verifies that the first-person gimmick in an action film works best when used in moderation. Notwithstanding the shortcomings, Hardcore Henry will find its devotees.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoy first person shooter games, they get one into the action as if you actually are within the games realm and moving through it. This movie basically starts kind of that way as you "awaken" in your "body" and start to "play". This movie is pretty much running around similar to an old doom game but in "real" places rather than fictional areas, acquiring weapons and killing anything in sight. The cinematography is great as well as the action which is non stop throughout..truly a "different" experience to be sure. This kind of movie actually gets people's heads to move as if they were Henry as they watch, similar to an actual first person shooter video game. If your expecting an intelligent plot, forget it, if your expecting to feel the characters, forget that. This is pure unadulterated violet action throughout with great stunts. Enjoy it for what it is. If you write a review, write it for what it is not what it isn't....enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor movie with some brilliant scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically a "not that exceptional" movie. But this is not due to the sum of average scene. More than that I believe Hardcore Henry is a mix of very good and very bad scenes, all dedicated to the action genre.The whole movie is stupid, stupid storyline and unrealistic character and character decisions. But if you are able to overlook the subjects of logic and realism, you will still have to cope with a lot of shaky scenes. If you are able to overlook theses points than you will have an entertaining and fun experience. Some scenes are really great and fun. Some scenes are also brilliant and it is hard to guess how they made it. You will also get a new understanding of what it feels to be a stunt man.You will also experience some crazy characters, besides being nonsense they will make you smile every now and then.I think that the ego view is not adapted to a whole movie. The reasons behind this are that not every scene looks amazing in the ego sight, sometimes you want to see the whole scene, like a picture and not just a narrow corridor. Just imagine a movie like Matrix in ego view. I also believe that the gore elements were not an added value to the movie but this has probably to do with something like "taste".This movie is probably better to watch with friends in order to overrun stupid storytelling and dialogues and laugh about hard action scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You get what you expect from this kinda film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first want to start by saying that I enjoy action films and I enjoyed Hardcore Henry. This film isn't some groundbreaking masterpiece, but what it does it does good. Fast action, interesting fighting scenes and it grabs your attention right from the start and never let goes till the end.Sharlto Copley(Jimmy) who plays your and friend who's trying to help you does a wonderful job and brings humour and variety to a film which lacks that. What I want to say that if you take out Copleys character from the film it becomes bland and boring in 30 minutes, but Copley breaks the monotony and brings fresh air whenever the film starts to become stale.Here's the thing, if you care about story and this film making sense then this film isn't for you. The acting is quite bad if you take Copley (Who plays Jimmy) out of the equation and besides the gimmicky first person perspective the film doesn't offer much more.Anyone who's still deciding is this film worth watching or not I'll say this, go watch the trailer(That's the whole film) and if you think you'll enjoy that and don't mind the shaking cam then you're going to have a good time watching Hardcore Henry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did you expect?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I'm going to say that I gave this 7/10 based primarily for the camera work and action sequences.Hardcore Henry is an out and out action film. If you don't appreciate this genre, don't watch it. The whole selling point of this film is that it is presented in a 1st person format. If you are going into this expecting gritty realism/plot twists/suspense/drama then you'll be sorely disappointed. If, however,you want to see action and then some more action and then, after that, action again then you will be more than pleased.Beyond that there isn't that much to this film. Plot: basic. Character development: minimal. Sweeping vistas and montages: nil.I will say that I thought Jimmy was a fantastic character and where I suspected this film was going to go with him wasn't anywhere near where it ended up. And there was one scene that had me cracking up... Just wait for the cowboy musics :)Having said that; reading some other reviews I'm at a loss to explain such low ratings. With a title that literally has the word Hardcore right there I don't know what those people were expecting.You like action? Grab your popcorn, grab a beer, turn up the volume and enjoy.</fullReview>

What was the point of this film is still unclear. It was a dumb idea turned dumber. I cannot believe it has a rating of 6.9. I am not certain what I was watching but was very tiring and just plain stupid. What I sat through it is something else I don't get. If you want to waste your time I'd say it's perfect. It was like being in a first person video game for two hours. I'm so done with this crap. I was not entertained. I was expecting something to develop that would catch my interest but that never happened. It was sheer crap. Who would invest money on this tripe production is beyond me. I had to write something about this flick because it was utter crap and I am beating myself up for seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crapola. Drek. If someone tells you to see this flick, check their shoes for dope. Someone told me this was good and I'll never forgive them. Hardcore Henry probably caused the Death of Roger Ebert, from extreme nausea. This picture was so bad, it almost makes you wonder if they set out to deliberately produce a flop, as some kind of Russian insurance scam? If so, than they succeeded at failing, because this piece of celluloid calling itself a feature film hardcore sucked. It's the story of Henry--half man, half machine. His character is a mystery, (because it's unwritten, and because he doesn't talk), as is his mission, i.e. the plot, something vague about saving a girl. It's basically a live action version of a shoot 'em up video game. The gimmick is POV, right down to seeing the character's arms. Okay, they tried to do something experimental and there was nothing else to it, unless gratuitous, random action scenes are your cup of tea. It's not mine.It's Robocop meets Total Recall. This is the latest in the amnesia subgenre (think Memento, Paycheck, Hangovers I-III), wherein the hero has to piece together his shattered memory in order to figure out what's going on. Usually those pictures have an intricate plot. Hardcore Henry was a little light on the details, such as making any sense.To make matters worse, the storytelling incorporates magic realism sporadically, without defining the rules. They never locked down a premise to establish ground rules for the audience to follow along. Henry is chased through the streets of Moscow by an army of mercenaries led by a cartoonish villain who looks like Kurt Cobain's evil twin. He's out to get Hardcore, yet every time he corners him, he takes his sweet time postulating, thereby allowing Henry time to escape, a la James Bond. Henry is supposed to be in love with a woman he can't remember, who is supposed to be "beautiful," and the audience is supposed to glean this, even though Henry doesn't talk. He leaves her behind in scene after scene, only to set up the next action sequence to near rescue her.Tim Roth, hide your face in shame! Hardcore Henry was a monstrosity. Had I seen this in the theater, I would have asked for my money back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A guy wakes up submerged in some tank. Some pretty girl in a lab coat is running things. She installs a bionic leg and arm on him. She presents herself as his wife. When the research team is about to give him a voice, the villain named Akan appears. He's got impressive telekinetic powers and kills everything in sight. Henry manages to escape with the girl in a pod which is then released. Turns out they were on a plane. As soon as they crash down, the girl is taken and Henry has to fight Akan's army. Some guy named Jimmy shows up and explains a bit more about Henry's situation. Basically he will run out of power and needs to find a source of energy every so often. Suddenly a bullet hits Jimmy. Henry continues on his quest to rescue the girl, get charged, fight Akan's armies, and face Akan eventually. In the process he keeps running into several versions of Jimmy who help him out and explain what is going on.All this is filmed in first person perspective, very video-gamish, even more so as Henry and occasionally a Jimmy cycle through a variety of weapons as they make their way to Akan's HQ. The action is brutal, gory, relentless, but we get a variety of neat unfamiliar settings in Russia and situations which keep things very entertaining: Henry in a whorehouse, on a motorcycle chase, dealing with tanks, choppers, horses.Sure, the perspective gets tiring and nauseating, and I didn't even see it in the theater. It's best to see it in two sessions. And yes, the movie isn't character-driven or rich on dialogue (are there many American action flicks that are?), but so what? The story is very good, it gets you involved and you do care about the characters--at least I did. This movie is somewhat experimental and groundbreaking, one has to see it for what it is. No doubt one can recognize some influences but that doesn't take anything away from the courageous originality of Ilya Naishuller and the rest of this crew.I've always hated POV movies because they ruined horror movies for many years, were utterly formulaic, cheap and annoying with poor visuals, obnoxious character, awful green nightvision. End of Watch was important because it showed that POV can be used much more wisely in other genres. And Hardcore Henry proves that it can become a worthwhile subgenre within the action genre, of course it would take a foreign crew like this filming in other countries to pull it off. I don't see Hollywood developing the guts to film a movie as complex as this any time soon. Can't wait for a sequel.</fullReview>

GoPro camera work dominates and I mean dominates this film. it's a good thing. I see some comparisons in some reviews to a first person shooter video game. It's so much more. The parkour stunt work is the best I've seen since 'District 13". Explicit in its violence...explicit isn't a good enough adjective. Definitely earns the R rating. A hard R rating at that. I don't know how it skirted a NC-17 rating. Totally enjoyable. I would have given it a 10 but the nudity was pretty much unnecessary. My nephew would love this as he is pretty darn good with his parkour stuff, but his parents would strangle me if I let him see this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HARDCORE HENRY started out as an Internet phenomenon before becoming a fully-fledged movie. The director, Ilya Naishuller, starting out making intense music videos which featured office locations, a first person perspective, and plenty of violent action. Later he released a five minute segment of a planned film called HARDCORE which was absolutely blistering in terms of fight action and intense choreography. That five minutes is included in HARDCORE HENRY, the full-length movie version of the Youtube shorts.First off, a warning: this film will be divisive for many viewers. If you're not a fan of 'all action, no plot' type movies, then look elsewhere. The whole thing takes place from a first person perspective (via a Go Pro headset) which takes some getting used to, but as I'm a big fan of the found footage genre I didn't have a problem with it. Another warning is that one of the people I watched the film with suffered from motion sickness and had to abruptly leave after twenty minutes to empty the contents of their stomach in the nearest bathroom.Otherwise, this film is great fun. It might be a one trick pony but it succeeds in what it sets out to do, which is to offer endless, well choreographed action. It's a chase movie in which the voiceless protagonist escapes from a mad scientist and his army of mindless automatons, all the while trying to rescue his kidnapped wife. Sharlo Copley has a fun supporting role as an ally who keeps coming back to help out no matter what. The free-running scenes are fun, the fight scenes are great, and there's all manner of vehicular mayhem involving motorbikes, vans, cars, and even a tank at one point. Things build up to a fantastic closing half hour which is basically one long action scene and I thought it was delightful.Watching HARDCORE HENRY is very much like playing a first person shooter video game, albeit without the user control. It's undemanding viewing that gets straight into the action without bothering with much in the way of set up. The acting is quite poor and the humour is often in bad taste, with some truly dumb segments like the brothel scene. However, to make up for this, the special effects are excellent and the action is truly blistering. It's one of the freshest and most inventive action films I've seen since the two RAID movies.</fullReview>

I certainly didn't leave the cinema feeling like that after Star Trek 3 or BvS and they were put together with a far bigger crew and budget.I've just bought it on Blu Ray and it will be well served in my movie cupboard. It's like a Hard Boiled, Chocolate or Warrior King that although not being the most polished, perfect film is certainly one that you will remember as being pretty damn mental and memorable.If for nothing else, the film makers need to be commended for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Action Movie in a Long Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hardcore Henry" is one of the best--if not THE best--action movie to be released in a long time. It is non-stop action from beginning to end. Told from a first person perspective, you feel as if you are battling all the bad guys (and there are plenty). You feel just about everything Henry feels. Henry awakens in some sort of high- tech laboratory, being put back together by his wife. What happened to him you never really find out, but it is amazing to see what all Henry is now programmed for. Seems Henry is on his way to a happy reunion with his wife, when bad guy Akan and his goons appear, attack Henry, and kidnap his wife. The pursuit is on.I will not give away anymore of the plot, but there is a nice twist. Oh, and is justice ever meted out in this one. As stated before, the action sequences are almost unbelievable. This is one action movie that doesn't bore you to death with a micromanaging plot, sidetracking love stories, or a lot of talk. This is action to the extreme! Loved it!The movie is rated "R" for constant scenes of graphic violence, language, and brief nudity. It thoroughly entertained me and I highly recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry is a great film. Anyone who says otherwise is old and boring. That said, it's more than just a movie it's prescient. Like many firsts of its kind, Hardcore Henry is a bold new vision of where we are going with experiential entertainment and storytelling. In some ways simply by watching this film you will be rewiring your brain and expectations for films to come. Certainly, the film benefits from a thriving gaming culture which has existed for decades, but what games don't allow you to do is the ability for a passive experience. Sure it's fun to be in control and make decisions, but I find that sometimes I just want to go on a wild ride and be entertained without the frustration of being as coordinated as a teenager. As gamers get older, there will be a demand for trills that transcend a joystick which are capable of exciting viewers and giving the thrill of the hunt. For me, Hardcore Henry is a solid down payment on the future of media.</fullReview>

Another thing that I really enjoyed about the movie was the amazing soundtrack placement, the music was so well played into the song, from the harmonic sounds you hear when he sees his wife til the amazing cuts of music during the fights, cant say too much because don't want to spoil it. Good CGI, Good Music and an amazing use of First Person Shooting mix with decent acting put the bar way to high for upcoming "FPS" movies in the future but that's something good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You were never a big fan of my work, maybe this will change your mind." Henry is awoken with no memory and most of his body gone. Estelle (Bennett) is talking to him about what happened, how she is rebuilding him, and then gives him instructions on how to get revenge on the man that did this to him. He is helped along the way by Jimmy (Copley) and together they try and end the reign of destruction. This is a very hard movie to watch for me. The movie is very gimmicky and filmed like a video game, in the sense that the movie is all done 1st person. You never see Henry, or hear him talk. is a sense...you are Henry. The movie is very much filmed like Call of Duty, even to the point of the character grabbing guns from everywhere, finding ammo and grenades and fighting off wave after wave of enemy. It is also like Call of Duty in the way that when you play you just go around shooting people with no real plot or reason. The "plot" of this movie is very loose and unless your a huge video game fan this may not appeal to you at all. To me this seemed like a nauseating rip off of Crank, and it was just too boring for me to get into. Overall, the gimmick for the movie didn't work for me. On the other hand, the gimmick is the only real reason to watch this. Teens will love it, but its rated R, so not sure who this is made for. I give it a C+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A video game that you won't play, but watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The entire story was told from the Henry's perspective, I mean what he sees through his eyes are the visuals we get. The first person point of view. Like the video games, but you won't play, just sit back and watch it. So you won't see the Henry's face, because he's you and you won't utter a word. That character was actually performed by many stuntmen and their risky stunt sequences pay off so well. That means, the main character is the cinematographer of the film. So all the credit must go to them for doing multiple task at a same time.It is a one day event based narration. All about running and chasing, right from the beginning. Along the way it lets us know why it's taking place and who's behind it. The rest of the cast was too amazing, especially that South African actor of 'District 9' fame was simply brilliant with different getups. I also enjoyed the Russian locations which were something refreshing.The story was simple, but puzzled. They explained nearly everything, yet a few doubts remain with us. So I'm expecting a follow-up, more than that I want it to be a trilogy and nothing less. For the sequel, put us in the cinema hall, but give us Virtual Reality Headset, I think that's how the future of cinema should be, especially for this film.Very unique and craziest film, one of the best of this year. It was kind of similar to Statham's 'Crank', as well as good as that one. If you like action films, then surely you would love it. Especially if you're a gamer, then it will be a double treat. The Americans did not show interest in this like usual which is not Hollywood or British. Especially critics never appreciated the creativity, but this is a must see film and the rest of the world accepted the truth. So don't think of skipping it.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TL;DR 8 because this was a fun action movie, I like FPS games, this movie fit perfectly. Excellent action, jaw dropping moments. Easy (simple) plot, but perfect for this movie. If you don't like excessive violence, don't watch. If you like relentless action, watch.So I'm going with an 8 because obviously the plot is pretty simple. Generally simple plots would drop the rating significantly for me but in this case it's important for the plot to be simple. What we have here is a standard action movie, but what it did was hit FPS on head. For folks that are not a fan of the genre or don't even know what it is, I can see where this would fail their expectations.I'm not going to waste my/your time with a synopsis of the plot, if you want to know, watch the movie or read that elsewhere. What I will say is the action was amazing. It starts at about ten or fifteen minutes in and doesn't really relent from there. We get to watch our 'hero' slowly adapt to his new body throughout the film, and the progression of which is executed extremely well. There are plenty of things that will make you grimace, make you smile, or make you cheer (or something along those lines.) As others have mentioned, most of this involves gore. I won't give specifics, but it really plays into the gamer mentality. I'm good with this. I liked what it did even when it was gratuitous as I'm one who enjoys shock value when timed appropriately. Some may find too much shock value here, I did not. It's a movie, it's make believe.What I didn't like... Well, I was under the impression this would be more or less one continuous take, it was not. The cutting in it broke the first person perspective. I get why it happened, but it fractured the progression of the movie. It would have been really sweet had they not broken things up. There were many cases where time more or less jumps ahead to skip the 'in between'. Also, maybe the cam was a bit too shaky. The only other thing I didn't like is maybe the simple plot, more on that...What I liked especially... I say I didn't like it, but the simple plot was important. It's hard enough to keep track of what was happening with the shaky cam and the relentless action let alone a deep plot. Simple plot = good in this case. So oddly while I didn't appreciate the simple plot, I also really liked it. Also, Jimmy. What a great character, even if confusing at first. There are great characters (mostly Jimmy) and there are great scenes. Henry has a very smooth progression in his abilities which I appreciated immensely, unlike a certain Star Wars movie.This got much longer than anticipated, but to briefly recap, watch this movie if you like action movies. Don't watch this movie if you don't want to deal with shaky cam or first person view. Seems pretty simple, I loved it. Nothing complex, incredibly fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly recommended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of this movie is extremely similar to CRANK (2006), but all shot from the POV of the main character using GoPro.Originally the director made a music video based on this concept, so I thought it might be boring when stretched into a full movie length, but they manage to keep it interesting with new ideas.The director is Russian and the movie takes place there. There is a lot of &#x202a;Parkour&#x202c;&#x200f; and crazy stunts that you can see on YouTube from Russian teenagers.Some nitpicking: 1. The cuts aren't very clean - and in some cases it's pretty obvious that they cut into an entire different location - but it doesn't matter, since the entire movie has the aesthetics of guerrilla filmmaking. It's like one long clip made for YouTube. 2. The cuts are less distracting than the jump cuts in the same scene, which feel a bit out of place. 3. The quick change in tone and music is a bit distracting. 4. The fish-eye is a bit distracting at times and reminds you that some of the stuff is actually shot with a GoPro.All in all, it's a very enjoyable film with great action and crazy stunts.Sharlto Copley (DISTRICT 9) is very good in his challenging role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very creative execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a hardcore, Testosterone filled first person action movie with creative and clever executions. If you are a gamer, you can clearly see that this film emulates a lot of first person shooters and other action video games and it does a fine job of it. This started from the popularity of those first person action clips on youtube, which lead them to create this awesome action packed movie. Sure, the story maybe a bit confusing and all over the place. But for a film like this, it's not about the narrative but more about the experience. Kind of like "Mad Max: Fury Road". Some critics claim this is like a stylistic music video with some choreography thrown in. Even if that is the case, it's about the experience and what you get out of the film that counts. Was the movie at least entertaining and brought something new to the genre or not. And it is bloody entertaining and is extremely creative when it comes down to the action. That is one of the reason why some of John Woo films got a lot of recognition. Because of it's stylish characters with the guns and bullets flying everywhere with the protagonist jumping and shooting in a stylistic manner. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it was a fun and exciting time seeing this.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FPS movie again, first pretty good one I've seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie didn't pop up at all, FPS -movies, they are usually so basic crap (made of games etc. my opinion). This was insane massacre and at some points I got totally lost. That's also very good thing, you actually have to understand what the heck is happening.Started very well, usual story, memory loss and so. Then everything goes out of hand and you are trying to figure out what the movie is this about.Anyway, for and FPS movie this was fresh and surprisingly interesting. After the beginning things go like WTF. Not too much shaky cam or so, very entertaining.Little minus: Many scenes looked like some real-time rendered stuff, badly but I think it was the idea.Still while this was crazy, innovative production I hope there will be no more likes than this one. Well maybe in future... This is not quite a spoiler but when he runs against vigilantes and tries to find his identity the FPS don't work very well with custom background, actually those hands and all looked seriously CGI but how else make it work?Last parts of the movie made me little sad because there wasn't enough explanation of things.Not a masterpiece but worth of watching if you have no idea what to do for the evening.Worth to watch if you like FPS games and got over those horrible "others", I'll give this crazy movie 8/10 because it's kinda impossible to make movie like this. Darn they messed up in the end... It was like a feeling that there were lot's of directors and writers, movie changed totally.Great effort! -another one (not actually FPS) was Max Payne -movie. Not very interesting and didn't quite follow the lead of story. (I think it was pretty good but the game vs. movie comparison cannot be made with those two...and all you action freaks this is kinda movie you gotta see, I was expecting something like pg.13 movie, there are blood gore and splatter. And this is it :) Hopefully like this creepy one but PLZ no remake movies of this.8/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deafening howl to gore action lovers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People, you have got to watch Hardcore Henry if you wish to experience non-stop gut-wrenching action that is beyond the levels of Shoot 'Em Up. The action this movie has, places it right up at the top amongst the elite avant garde action group.MAGIC OF HARDCORE HENRY What does a good action movie need? Thrilling stunts, profuse gore, constant adrenaline rush, great story to keep it all together. Well, Hardcore Henry has it all, except for the latter which unfortunately stops it from becoming an epic action flick. Nevertheless, we keep our eyes closed and ignore those apparent bits just for the uncanny style of film-making the movie induces.BREATHTAKING ACTION It is hard to look away (unless you are a wimp) from this action-packed affair of a movie, which gives you a first person perspective akin a game. Just imagine all those place where action might seem possible, and it is all there. Imagine the heights a flick could go to create palpable gun fights, and it soars high to shoot them all. Imagine how ugly a hand-to-hand combat could go, and it surpasses it too.Hardcore Henry might be odious when it comes to showing gritty yet ugly fight sequences, but they are all spot on. It walks you through a world of chaos as if you were in those Henry shoes. Things that happen in 1 hour 36 minutes of stark scrimmage is something you might want to prep your feeble heart for, in advance.SPOILERS BLEEDING AHEAD The surreal part about Hardcore Henry is that Henry can't speak. So, that leaves us with all ears, listening to other characters talk.The best character of the movie is undoubtedly Jimmy played superbly by Sharlto Copley. He puts himself in a couple of crazy shoes creating mind-boggling characters, out of which the best one is that of the British World War 2 Corporal. As he occasionally drops off witty one-liners icing them with "Laddie" he scores extraordinary kills alongside Henry.A grenade a day keeps the enemy at bay.Also, watch out for that musical dance bit that he does whilst leaving bodies.Hardcore Henry has a gaming air to it. Right from the start, it would seem as if you are playing a great action game. Guns, grenades, hand-to-hand, it has everything squeezed for emphasis. It has a stunning sniper moment too! STORY-LINE AND TANGIBILITY Unfortunately the flick scores really low when it comes to showing a decent movie mien. Things that stop it from hitting that territory are its surreal looks and a weird comportment that it tries to build for its countless action shootouts. The plot of the movie seems like a game rip-off.Also, there is a sustained palpable absurdity to it that makes you take its characters for a joke. Also, some actors, despite the theatrics, degrade its quality beyond limit. Starting from Danila Kozlovsky as Akan, who comes off as a strong villain, is really shoddy with his acting.Hardcore Henry movie scores the lowest in Screenplay as well. There aren't many good lines to cherish except one or two. Melodrama looks really fabricated as well.THE FINAL VERDICT You could only imagine the heights the director Ilya Naishuller is willing to scale to ace this beauty. Visual effects are insane! Stunts astounding! Watch out for some thrilling slo-mo bits that the movie retains. You can't help but give an ovation to him.Overlooking every flaw the movie has, for its avant garde rare 'reaching-for-the-moon style', we focus on what it Hardcore Henry really is. Outright Hardcore! PS: If you are a die-hard gamer, you are going to fall in love with this movie instantly.PPS: Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different, but not necessarily a better way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is shot from FPS perspective and offered some good things but still can't be recommended. There are a lot of chase scenes which left me wondering "how'd they do that?" as we see Henry's (our) hands and feet jumping down buildings or through windows...can't fathom how they were able to keep a camera and a live actor's hands/feet in the picture with all this running around. Beginning with the opening credits you know this is all about guns and blood - that and the fast paced sequences never let up. There are a few open character questions that do eventually get wrapped up (his wife, the repeating and varying appearances by "Jimmy" to support him) but the boss is never really fully explained for what he is - that bothered me a bit. Overall, I'll give a nod of respect tot he FPS effort made in shooting the film, and can appreciate some of the humor and nudity layered in, but tbh, the FPS left me nauseous in the second half and the boss battle at the end with all the minions was a bit of "I don't care anymore" to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie keep pushing me being a stubborn tech critic only rather than getting into the story-telling. It's continuously tickling into my mind I'm watching nothing but a man running with a GoPro over his head (or chest). Making a movie completely from a different perspective (First person) is undoubtedly a new thing to Hollywood film-making. But yet, the plot is weak, story is weak, and not much acting as well. Completing the film was nothing but releasing a breath 'Okay! I completed it!' by running being a dumb man, mashing several heads/body parts and almost telling no-story. Possibly a film I do not want to watch again (because there's nothing left to watch again).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Completely from a FPV, this couldn't be more obvious that it is trying to emulate a video game. Everything from the masses of nameless bad guys that he mows down, to how the plot and story unfold. Being FPV, it puts you in the front row seat, and to some that will give the intended effect that you are the character. Because of this, though, the camera movements can be very disorienting. If you choose to see it, just go because you want a fast paced action thriller that feels like a video game. And like most games, you'll only need to see it once. I know I won't rewatch it.Apparently, that wasn't enough to satisfy IMDb for length of a review. Sooooooo...umm...hopefully this is enough now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crank: The Video Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: You MUST like video games, preferably like the movie: Crank and not have any signs of epilepsy to watch this "experience."And said "experience" really wears thin after a while.Personally, I am not into video games and I hated Crank (and worse, Crank 2,) but luckily, I don't have epilepsy so I could finish this film. I'm just not happy I did.All this movie is, is a live-action first-person video game. Plain and simple. You have the characters helping you, tricking you, guns and adrenaline laying around, ways to improve your health, guides to where to go next, a story unravelling so you can make it to the end and endless bad guys to easily shoot and advance. Truly, this took a lot of planning and there were a few moments of "ah-ha, that was clever," but for the most part, it's too much thrown at us to the point I actually found myself bored and my mind wandered to other important things in my life.Basically "YOU" as "Henry" wake up with almost zero memory, but there's your wife, some scientists and you're half-human, half-robocop. Bam, the clichd bad guy appears and you're on the run to solve who you are, who's helping you and to save your wife since the bad guy keeps kidnapping your "Princess."Since I am not a gamer, I'm uncertain if this would appeal to them since they cannot control the action. Maybe a for a bit this would be fun to experience since the graphics are, no doubt, 100x better than what they experience on their console. But this is 96 straight minutes of letting someone else be in control. Probably as a 5-10 YouTube video ? and believe me, you could fit all the real meat in under 10 minutes ? this might work, but it's just nauseating after a while. And frankly, repetitive boring crap.***Final thoughts: Though I didn't hate it, I did recognize it as original and did take some time to plan these shots, the over-exaggerated hand movements by Henry when trying to non-verbally reply to another character was, well, downright awful. If there was to be any realism to this alternative universe, those hand gestures completely shattered my suspension of disbelief. YES, I get the movie is on crack, but the cartoonish thumbs up, etc?just dumb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a beautiful movies with a lot of comedy and bloody fight scenes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of movies with comedy,action or even with a great story line. Well, This movie, Hardcore Henry, had all those genres. There was a lot of action involved in this movies, which is obvious if you look at the title, that was insanely well made; The fight scenes were really messy and, of course, there was a lot of blood and cutting pieces of a body involved. With making this movie they really looked close to every tiny little detail when it come to fighting; In a scene where Henry is fighting of a lot of soldiers, he shoots wildly around him to kill them. The makers of this movie thought: what if got blood on his face of killing those people? Sipmle, we just let Henry wipe of his face if he gets to much blood on his face. That's one example of those little details where the makers of this movie thought about.The story was well made for a movie where more people are enjoying the action scenes more than the story line behind it; First the story line is not that clearly, which makes total scenes because its a first-person movie and the main character does not have a clue what happened, because you start of with a few kids smashing a toy to the wall and a weird guy saying "you little p*ssy". But then , which is in line with what the main character knows, the story line comes clearer with every situation Henry gets in. And piece by piece you know what is going on. Until the end.... I'm not gonna tell you that of course.what about the comedy? The comedy is exactly well timed with the situations; When Henry finally arrives at the lab and they get surrounded,The scientist made a copy of himself as a old British soldier. When they are fighting for their lives to escape the lab, there is a few seconds of dead silence because the soldier has something to say. This soldier does not tell a lot in the movies but when he said something, it is always something funny about the situation. This is only the tip of the iceberg; there were a lot of hidden jokes in the movie that will make you laugh your ass of.The music they used in the movies were perfect; in every action scene they used a different song that pumped up the action, chasing people or even going guns blazing, etc..overall I really think that this movies could possibly be the best action movie made in 2016. Just because of the action, the well placed comedy and the story line for a movie like this. There were no bad choices made by making a first-person comedy action movie. the only thing that was not that great about the movie was the transition between a few places were not that smooth; once they were in a subway and then they are suddenly on a really crowded street.I really enjoyed watching this movies and I hope with this review you will have a blast about this awesome movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "convenient" plot + a great idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I was hyped for this movie from 2013 onward when I saw the first trailer scene of this. It looked promising and I was really stoked on the first person perspective movie since it's something that to the best of my knowledge hasn't been done before.The implementation of it is pretty nice, you sometimes have the weird shot with one eye being ripped out and having a whole different perspective then the other, but even those scenes are pretty neatly made.Now for the plot, it couldn't even be more convenient. It is so convenient that I went out of my way to google synonyms for "conventient" just to not make this review consist of a repeating series of the same word. If you don't know what I mean by convenience in that case, here is an example:"How is the audience supposed to relate to our main character? I know, let's make him silent! But we need an excuse as to why he doesn't talk, any idea? Oh, I know, his speech data just isn't loaded into the system yet and it's conveniently interrupted by the main villain!" This is a super-cheap shot, but at least they acknowledge it in some shape or form.Now the plot is basically about a guy named Henry, and Henry f*cks sh*t up big time. It's a classic clich action film, a ton of explosions, big guns, drugs, weirdos and even bigger guns and explosions. The first person ego perspective however makes this a lot more entertaining to watch as it sets a new tone of pace. Usually the pace in action movies is set by MASSIVE amounts of cuts during these scenes, in this however just through the mere fast paced movement of the camera you feel like you are part of the action, a very conducive thing for the directors again.Now the villain was the one REALLY BIG point of criticism that I have for this movie: I get that we are well into the future And I get that we need a villain that is somewhat of a match to Henry's super human strength. But for some weird reason some creative director of this film got super f'ing wasted one night and decided to give this villain some weird power to control gravity as he pleases for I don't know what bloody reason. This basically has "convenience" plastered all over it, it yells commodious to the top of it's lungs."Oh, Henry is in a situation in which he could easily end the movie before the actual average screen time runs out, but oh no, for some unexplained reason the main villain is bloody god and decides to not get killed". And why didn't he just kill Henry when he had more than one chance to do so? I mean, he can manipulate gravity, can't he just rip Henry apart? Do his powers suddenly not allow him to tear people apart but move tons of matter through space and time with no effort?But I feel like I need to explain why this bothered me so much: It would have been a WHOLE lot better if the villain was also just a Cyborg like Henry is and that he is simply more trained in combat skill sets. Would have made for less convenience and way less of an epic last scene though.Just to show you what I mean by "the convenient plot" without making this a spoiler-review: At one point Henry almost loses his battery-power pretty early in the movie, so he has to hurry to find a backup power. Like how the hell doesn't this scream "totally fitting for the directors of this movie" to the top of it's lungs? I immediately thought of Crank 2 when I saw this scene, it is just a writing tool to explain why Henry has to run to meet the next character in a series of characters he meets throughout the movie instead of just strolling through the park or just deciding not to bother with all the killing, fighting and the plot at all.Overall the WAY too convenient plot is complete garbage, it's a 3-4/10 max, there is NO notable difference from any other action movie with opportune action scenes that just come handy for the directors to blow some budget on. But just the idea and the mere problems of making this a movie with ego-perspective shots is a bit more difficult, so for the creativity and the implementation and focus on this feature I'd give it a 7-8/10. This, unfortunately, only averages out in about a 6/10. It's a cool idea and if that is enough for you to endure the most dull plot ever then go for it, but otherwise you should just not bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>live action video game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is done with a 1st person POV. This starts with scientist Estelle (Haley Bennett) installing cybernetic arm and leg. She tells him that she's his wife and his name is Henry. Before she can install the voice, they are attacked by Akan with telekinetic powers. Henry and Estelle escape the laboratory which is actually an airship. They land in the middle of Moscow. Mercenaries kidnap Estelle. Henry escapes and gets help from different copies of Jimmy (Sharlto Copley).This is mostly a live action video game which you don't get to control. The story is nothing compelling. Henry is a blank which the POV allows the viewer to pour into. The best action is the explosive car stunts. It gets a bit repetitive and also the camera is too shaky for me. It's an intriguing experiment but it doesn't really work in this form.</fullReview>

Seeing action film which was filmed in the first person , was pretty cool, I liked the idea a lot , it felt like I was playing Call of duty or any other action game , it seriously felt like a video game! This film is basically just a pure popcorn flick that you can take your friends to go see , the action is brilliant! The action is truly made to nearly a perfection , the storyline was really not that great and I couldn't really care much for the characters but end of the day what really made me just be like wow and mind blown was the action scenes , it literally didn't stop surpising me.. and that what i really liked about this movie , it was non stop insane crazy adrenaline rush movie , which was enjoyable but personally i don't think i would enjoy this second time , it not really an action movie that you can pop in your DVD box and just enjoy watching it , it wouldn't be as interesting second time in my opinion but overall I would recommend it , it has an amazing action scenes , it non stop action and it does have great stunt work , which I applause them for that! The storyline wasn't like the most horrible storyline I ever experienced but it wasn't like an amazing storyline either , it was an okay storyline and to be honest the storyline and the characters is the reason why this movie wouldn't be as enjoyable if you watched this movie a second time! it once in a lifetime movie , and i WOULD recommend you to go see it!7.0/10 RATING!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About the closest thing to a live action game you'll ever see...but you can't play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is entirely shot in POV and about the closest thing to a live action game I ever saw. Though I wouldn't want to have been on the first row in the cinemas coz the camera shake is a extreme as the action (which can be pretty graphic at times). Look, if you're going to see a movie like this you know what you're getting. The story is nothing original and seems like cheap combination/ripoff of F.E.A.R. and Duke Nukem 3D (both excellent first person PC shooters). The acting varies from okay to horrendous (the bad guy is irritating as hell). Music wise we get some pop/rock songs, some in horrible Russian but it's safe to say you wont rush to your local store to but the soundtrack. The best part of the films are the gunfights and parcour-like running and jumping action. It's quite impressive they were able to pull all this off for a lousy 2m$. The VFX were done in open source Blender and the filming was done with GoPro Hero 3 camera's. Hardcore Henry is a testament to what you can do with affordable digital technology these days. Is it a good film? No. But it's braindead fun. You could compare it to Crank which was better, funnier and more over the top (which a film like this really needs to be). But I can imagine some people getting sick (literarily) from the 96 min POV violence fest. And it can be a bit like watching someone else play a game, but sometimes it's more fun to play yourself ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so the POV thing was always going to make it a bit like watching over someone's shoulder while THEY played the game and you were a passive bystander, but as a movie it seemed to go out of its way to be exactly like a modern video game, with power up stages and weapon acquirements, and I guess that was probably the film makers knowing nod to the similarity to game play for the gamers in the audience, but, in doing so they exposed the big flaw in this 'game' in that the viewer has no input, we're passive, we're watchers, that's all we can be in this format and that makes the whole thing lightly boring for us. Yes there were many clever film moments in this movie, some excellent 'how did they do that' type things, but at the end of the experience it was all instantly forgettable, the story meant almost nothing and the emotional connect with any of the characters was less than an arcade game. If that's the intention then well played, but I could have done with something more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Poor excuse of a movie to satisfy and close in to first person shoot 'em up players. Futuristic Russian propaganda. What is the purpose with this? 90 minutes of non-stop running, jumping and killing. Like watching a video game.There is one of the most innovative deaths I have ever seen: 1 hour and 27 minutes into the movie.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Very well made...great production! The way Henry change is perception after the baseball bat hit is phenomenal. - The actors : Well. To get killed can be relatively easy to act. Danila Kozlovsky is rather good as a futuristic psychopath with power syndrome. Sharlto Copley is fantastic in his multiple personalities! - The story : People being awaken as digital humans kind of robots. - Entertainment : Shaky camera. Strong language. Blood. Brutality. Aggressive soundtrack. - Age : 184,4 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 5 Approved. 4 Failed. Lacking in character.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this film a nine because it deserves it just for the effort alone. It is absolutely original and it makes you smirk all the way thru. I have recently had a very hard time sitting thru films because they were just so predictable. Not this little fellow though. The acting is hilarious and very good for what was required. No Oscars for acting but the director and creator etc deserve one for sure. I am not sure whether they will ever be able to match this though. It is sort of a lone wolf, one time baby fantastic and done. The fact that it also had that Russian element was just perfect. This is a Pulp Fiction like breakthru in a genre that has not been named yet and will likely not get a name because I am almost positive no one will be able to copy it without being totally lame about it. As I said one time stuff. For those that need serious thought and such, romance and such and all that narrative stuff then this will not be for you but if you try it you may be very surprised by what hits you. Lots of totaLLY OVER THE TOP Violence AND THE STUNT WORK IS FIRST RATE. tHE SEQUENCES WERE PERFECTLY PLANNED AND EDITED. a MASTERPIECE OF FILM MAKING FOR SURE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glorious, violent and utterly fantastic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just finished watching the film.. and I am happy to report that this is exactly what I've been dreaming of, ever since the all too short first person action scene in the DOOM film. The actor who plays "Jimmy", Sharlto Copley, completely steals each and every scene he's in, and what range! The action, the cinematography.. everything is very well done and engaging.And, frankly, there's hardly any shaky cam going on, considering what the protagonist is being put through during this film. Obviously it being first person, the perspective is bound to get tossed around, but at least it makes sense when it's happening. It's different.. it's very much *not* Hollywood.. and it is deserving of at least some recognition for pulling all that off on a 2 million budget. Bravo, I say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry is great for gamers who really don't care about the plot or character development. From start to finish this Russian production is a wild action packed computer game.The trouble for old geezers like me, I couldn't see what was actually going on for much of the time...for one thing, you never really see and never hear Henry, just his hands and feet...moving through Russia with a gun in his hand shooting at everything that moves.He never utters a word.The plot, if there was one, evolved into a James Bond type scenario with an evil bad guy having strange unexplained powers. The action takes you into virtual reality where anything seems to be possible, except decent acting and a story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unwatchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This should have been called Unwatchable, because it is. It's basically a first person video game made into a movie, except you don't get to play the game. I can only imagine the audience for this rambling is people who really like to watch other people play video games. The other possible audience is someone so high on drugs they just need something to stare at while they come down. It does include everything I would never want to experience in a feature project. The entire film is from one perspective, lots of hand held, floating about, might even give you motion sickness, if you're lucky! To put it a better way, this film is an experiment, a test to see if it can garner a new way to make films, and that is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one. It's an art project. Unfortunately for everyone involved in this project, I'm not one to be experimented on. I want to watch awesome stories, well acted and directed with some great cinematography. This is not it. Another way to put it, how many times did you sit through The Blair Witch project? Yeah, once was more than enough. I'd suggest you skip it and watch something else, simply because there are tons of great choices out there and this is not one.</fullReview>

Its doom, its a FPS shooter with not a single word spoken from the leading character, yet, speaks so much more then many movies that you have seen recently.

		<fullReview>In a world where every action movie seems to be either a remake or based on a comic book, attempts to present its plot as being far more intelligent and worldly than it actually is, tries to squeeze in as many advertisements for the production company's other movies as it can through unnecessary subplots, and depends on CGI to make it somewhat exciting... an independent film called Hardcore Henry is made with less than 1/100 of the average Hollywood blockbuster budget and, unlike every other movie, delivers exactly what it promises: almost non-stop action from start to finish featuring the hero, a sidekick, a villain, and lots of weapons. This is one of the few action films you will have seen in at least the past 10 years that focuses on simply being entertaining as opposed to making a blatant attempt to be the next "epic". This movie was clearly made by people who love action films (and obviously action video games) and are in their way paying tribute to what they love, which results in a film that is much more enjoyable to like-minded people than critics (whose opinions on what a film should be are based on text-book criteria) could possibly comprehend. As a like-minded person, I had a great time watching it from start to finish, and the right people will too.To sum it up in one word: BANG!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie unfortunately didn't get a large audience on opening weekend. It was against Batman vs. Superman. I have to say I enjoyed this movie a ton more. It has an amazing soundtrack, likable silent protagonist (it may be silly but it is explained why he is) and most of all great comedic and high action moments. I'd recommend this to anyone. The guy from district 8 is hilarious. I almost don't understand how the movie is shot. The camera angles are insane.The story isn't too in depth but it is enough to have the plot move forward. As you all have seen in the trailers you start being rebuilt into some robot. The entire movie is fast paced but you never feel like you are lagging behind in terms of understanding what is going on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardcore is the way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This my review of Hardcore Henry (spoiler Free) Directed By: Ilya Naishuller Distributor: Entertainment in Video Cast: Sharlto Copley, Tim Roth, Haley Bennett.Plot: Henry is resurrected from death with no memory, and he must save his wife from a telekinetic warlord with a plan plan to bio-engineer soldiers.First person is a new genre introduced into film and this shows that it can be a good thing. Ilya Naishulle's insane action thriller is a balls out action comedy with blistering ultra-violence. Andrei Dementiev plays Henry a man who has just been resurrected from death and he remembers nothing. The film then turns into a chase and a balls out action flick.The action stops in a few places when Henry meets Jimmy (Copley, Chappie 2015), Jimmy is a man or in this clone who helps Henry it makes it seem like Jimmy has been in this situation before. From that it all starts to go a little bit mental what you expect from an action film.In terms of plot there is barely any there no character development the limitless starts to fall a little bit flat after a while which is a shame, even with a twist that you see coming it seems that the good thing about it is the ultra-violence.Let me go through one or two points why this is a pretty good action film: One obvious thing is the action: There are two ways to describe the action one is that it is very bold, and the other is that it is explosive and if I might add exhausting. The reason why it is exhausting is because it can get a little slow it's fun granted especially with some laugh out loud moments. Other than the action is fun, explosive and completely mental which makes this a film to watch.Shaky Camera: The shaky camera can be a good thing and it can also be a bad thing first I'll start with the good, because this movie is in first person it makes it look and feel real so you see all the action right in front of you. This isn't particularly a bad point it's just so much as much as an opinion, the camera shakes so much that it makes some of the action really hard to see in some points but again you get that with action movies.Other than the negative points this is actually a pretty entertaining balls out action thriller that I would gladly watch again and again until my brain turned into sludge.Verdict: A ball out insane actioner that makes your brain melt, a blood-filled and maniacal thrill ride. 7/10. Recommended (even with the ultra-violence).</fullReview>

The cinematography is amazing. Although cameraman guy (or Henry) has done tremendous work, I mean with parkour and all the stunt with some heavy equipment is tough job. This is very much violent movie and it should not be watched by sensitive people or kids.The coarse language and nudity is often observed in this movie.

		<shortDescription>Very interesting and unique idea, presented with relentless pace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First person perspective has been used multiple times in cinema, mainly to conjure a sense of involvement, but none had used it as ambitious as "Hardcore Henry". It's entirely done in first person view and an appreciated tribute to gamer. This is a full blown mayhem, the fans of fast pace action would certainly love it although there's a couple of flaws that hamper it ascension.The movie wants to put audience in the eye of Henry, the silent protagonist of typical action games. It's a fun ride through car chase, foot chase, shooting alley, shooting in the open space and everything else in between. Some minute details are incredibly effective to get the immersion right, these might happen a bit too over-the-top but the result is undeniable.As much as I want to praise it completely, those who want more flair in narrative might not be content, still one would know what to expect when seeing this movie. It also has a few odd transitions that otherwise would be more fluid if done in traditional fashion. Having viewed in first person while things explode nearby is inevitably hectic. The silent protagonist shtick might work for immersion but the characterization department takes a hit."Hardcore Henry" is an ambitious project, it doesn't reach utter greatness due to inherent limitations, and nevertheless it's one ridiculously amazingly enjoyable ride.</fullReview>

A breathtaking ride from a first person view with stunning sequences of martial arts, Parkour, mad car chases and so much more.

I enjoyed this in the same way I loved and still love "Shoot 'Em Up" and the "Kickass" movies. If you want a RomCom or philosophical meander then move on. If you enjoy mental action and feel love for your games console or cartoon level mayhem then this will please you greatly. Fantastic job, I hope there is more to follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie theater experience in recent memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a crazy fun feel-good movie, one that reminded me of the joys of going to the movie theater. The audience was cheering and laughing from start to finish. It's got action. It's got comedy. It's entertaining. People loved it. I loved it. You will too - unless you won't, in which case, go away, I can't be friends with you.It's not a normal movie experience. Indeed it's shot entirely from a first-person view, like you are seeing it from the main character's eyes the whole time. It feels like one of those theme park rides, one of those Disneyland attractions, where you sit down and it assaults all your senses with fun and excitement. This is that experience, but in R-rated action/comedy movie form.It's a movie that feels just like a video game - and I mean that in a good way. Video games, by their nature, immerse you into the experience in a way that movies usually can't, but as a movie that feels like a video game, this movie immerses you within its action like no other.Best actor: Sharlto Copley in this movie plays the funniest, most entertaining, and also most weird &amp; unique character I've seen in any movie in quite some time. I was honestly laughing every time he showed up. Without explaining why, he's essentially playing a different person, complete with a different personality, accent, and ridiculous new costume every subsequent time he appears, thus giving Sharlto a chance to show off his acting skills like no other role ever could. The guy's doing action, making us laugh, and playing multiple roles all at the same time. Forget the weepy dramas, Academy, this is the kind of acting performance that deserves an Oscar.Violence: Heads explode, blood bursts everywhere when guys get shot by shotgun blasts - and quite a few people get shot/blown up, the body count is through the roof - hearts even get ripped out, it's gruesome, but also ridiculous. It's pretty violent, but in a so over-the-top that it's actually hilarious kind of way.Motion sickness? I've heard some people expressing concern about potential motion sickness from the nonstop 1st person perspective, but I certainly didn't feel the slightest bit of discomfort from watching this on the big screen. There's no reason you should either, unless there's something wrong with you. If you can handle playing a video game, you should be able to watch this, no problem.Anyway, watch this movie if you want to have a good time. I did and you will too.</fullReview>

The first person view is done very well, from the action scenes to the slower parts. Sharlto Copley is great as the tour guide, assistant, and nursemaid. I felt a little giddy at some points due to the motion and I saw a warning at the counter for people susceptible to motion sickness, so be aware.Considering the graphic violence and weak story it is good at what it is: a real-life FPS with a lot of different environments and perspectives. If that sounds good to you, you'll enjoy the 90 minute joy ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fresh Perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry was a tour de force of action and sci-fi. Guns, gangs, and cyborgs set in a modern Russian landscape of despotic lunatics conveyed the desperation of intelligence. There was a quasi-human mind embedded in a nearly indestructible body where persecution of free will tested the limits of perseverance. Video game lovers would quickly adapt to the film's first person point of view originally found in games like Resident Evil and Doom. This first person perspective in cinematography was reminiscent of the 80's action-comedy movie "Innerspace". Hardcore Henry's tempo integrated with carnality, comedy, and irony boldly re-defined the boundaries for patrons of the robot movie genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you feel the need for every aspect of a film to be force-fed to you, do not watch this movie. I absolutely enjoyed this film and didn't have any qualms about certain elements not being explained, I can sit here and come up with a quick origin story for why the villain has those abilities, etc. But why? Some things in films thrown at you, without exposition, is OKAY, and at times, the mystery behind it make it that much more intriguing and thrilling - *SPOILERS* i'm absolutely okay with not knowing why the villain wants to create a team of robot soldiers or why he can levitate people. The movie was set out to do one thing, and it did that very well. Mad Max is one of the greatest films of last year, and most of it was a thrill ride, not much exposition or explanation for majority of the film. Yes I do enjoy dialogue (Tarantino is one of my favorite directors), but I don't need explanations in each and every film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceeded Expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly thought this movie was SO much fun, and worth spending the money to see it on a big screen. It's written very much like a typical first-person-shooter video game (vague plot, unbelievable premise, sexy scientists, an insane right-hand man, never-ending onslaught of murderous bad guys, a comic-book-style powerful evil villain, constant upgrades of military weaponry), yet somehow still stays imaginative and inventive throughout. The POV makes you feel like you are in the drivers seat, without removing personality from the main character, which is rather impressive considering you never actually see him; you are simply looking "through his eyes". I would recommend sitting in the rear center to avoid dizziness, but the POV never gets tiresome (like Cloverfield). It's extraordinarily violent, incredibly bloody with a high body count, completely action-packed to the teeth, and still has a wonderful sense of humor. Sharlto Copley brings nothing but excellence to the stage, playing a dynamic set of characters and wearing "several hats," so-to-speak. If you walk-in knowing that the plot is extremely loose, but know that is how it is supposed to be, and take the novelty of the entire film as it is, you will not be disappointed. In a cinematic world full of remakes right now, this is very original and creative. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best action movies in years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry is the first SUCCESSFUL FIRST-PERSON movie ever made. I say this because there have been first-person movies, but not very many. A few examples are Cloverfield, Doom, and The Blair Witch Project.SIDENOTE: Loved Cloverfield, never seen the other two.BACK TO THE REVIEW: Hardcore Henry is an indie film shot in Russia using GoPro Hero 3 cameras allowing you to see the film through Henry's eyes.Henry wakes up to find out he's been in some (unknown) accident and is missing an arm and a leg. His wife Estelle (a scientist) fits him with cybernetic replacements, but is soon kidnapped by the villain Akan.Akan is a telikinetic (basically has the force) who is making an army of cyborgs like Henry.*****Here is my one complaint to the movie: Akan is kind of a weak villain, but overall does a good job.*****Sharlto Copley is Henry's guide. He texts Henry each new mission (much like in a video game) and is a very diverse character (he has several clones of himself, so if he "dies" he can continue helping Henry.) This movie is VERY bloody, VERY violent and VERY over-the-top, and it's 96 minute run time flies by! I can best some this movie up as a FUN and NEW type of action movie that I hope to see more of (in moderation.) I highly recommend this movie to any/all action junkies (and non squeamish!) FINAL VERDICT: I give Hardcore Henry a 9/10 because it is a movie like no other. Sure there have been a few first-person movies, and several video-game movies, but this is something uniquely different that is truly it's own movie. Just when you think it's gonna get boring/ repetitive it throws you a curve ball.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No spoilers here! As a mixture of the movie Crank and the game Bioshock, Hardcore Henry triggers adrenaline and dopamine releases as you watch it from the couch. The point of view is the actual point of view of a human being, how our species actually experiences the movie of life. Another movie that has a similar point of view is Enter the Void. Hardcore Henry is one of the best action movies, it is high paced and action packed. The story is very similar to one from a video game. But the fact that it is predictable gives a relaxed approach when watching the movie. And despite this, the movie is highly satisfying. I strongly recommend it. But if you are looking for something more emotional, watch Hachi: A Dog's Tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thrilling ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an action movie. The plot is not relevant and the plot doesn't aim to be. The story is engaging and nothing more than the flimsy excuse for non stop violence. Which this movie delivers. In abundance. Nevertheless, the acting is spot on. The scenes are a single flow of explosions, blood and action. Purely for the manner in which the scenes are woven into a single shot, this is a master piece.I am not a fan of action movies. Personally, I prefer slow paced character development and story telling. I advice anyone with an open mind to watch this, because it is simply unbelievable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible Sci-Fi Action Film - First time director Naishuller explodes on the scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry is a complete adrenaline rush...a crazy Russian cocktail of a film like I've never seen before! First time writer/director Ilya Naishuller (with legendary producer Timur Bekmambetov) creates a first person shooter masterpiece! The film puts the viewer in the shoes of Henry as he battles against Akan, one of the coolest villains I've seen in quite a while. Akan and his forces are out for world domination, and only Henry can stop him. Hardcore Henry isn't afraid to mash up a film that feels part video game, part graphic novel and part James classic James Bond film. It also has a really slick script that keeps you wondering about certain things for hours after you watch the film. If would like to see a new form of sci-fi cinematic art featuring crazy action, a huge body count, incredible soundtrack and a story to match....check out Hardcore Henry ASAP!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>that was different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>where to begin... Hardcore Henry will not go down in history as a "great" movie. It will go down as the first - first person POV movie. I loved that part of it. I loved the plot and how it played out. I loved the twists and how it all worked out. I was amazed by the work of the actor. Cons? the whole movie needed some more refinement. Most of the camera work was tolerable. But some was just plain sloppy. The human brain edits out sweeping vision. So when you move your head left and right, your brain seamlessly cuts out the middle and just shows you the view where your head stops. This amount and type of editing would be a great addition to movies of this type and first person shooters as well. I didn't mind it as much as others. Second bad part: The gore. I don't mind gore, but the slow motion close up of a knife going through human skin was just plain gross and unnecessary. This is where we are now. As long as people pay for it, it will be there. But I don't like it, and it may turn me off movies all together if I keep seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Call Of ...Henry?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>W.O.W. I guess that about starts it off, Hardcore Henry written and directed by Ilya Naishuller. After seeing the preview for this film, it pumps you up to see that this is a non- stop action film that makes your heart race till the end, even if there is one. And yes, it completely lives up to its preview ten fold. The Film starts you out, you have to be ready for an entire FP experience, FP being First Person, or some might say P.O.V.(Point Of View). Now this honestly just plays out like a crazy, real life video game, but Ilya was able to pull out a story, a character, that literally never speaks once through the entire film, but in the end your rooting for him. You start out in a lab, being talked too by a beautiful blonde woman, she eases your nerves because you see that you have no left arm, or left leg. You soon realize that your a cyborg,machine,terminator, whatever, your not completely human anymore. Upon a breach in the facility your in, you and the blonde woman, who introduced herself to you as your "supposed" wife, Estelle, played by Haley Bennett, break out in true fashion, a drop pod because apparently your aboard a ship getting all this crazy work done, on yourself. I have to hand it to Ilya, and Will Stewart, this was a hell of a script, also the fact that I'm sure when putting this on paper, as a director you have to be scratching your head,"how are we gonna do that"?, trust me, they get it done. On the roller-coaster ride you embark on, you come across various characters , that already seem to know you and want to help you. Jimmy being the most significant of them all played by Sharlto Copley, absolutely superb job in this role, he ends up playing multiple characters and between the writing and directing this had to be an extremely fun film to be apart of. Haley is adorable and will be a household name very soon. Through all of it, it was over the top, he couldn't survive "That" happening, but you know what, this film was awesome from start to finish I'm even sure all the haters out there watched it all the way through because it kept you glued the whole time. Hardcore Henry might not be for everyone, if you a fan, like the trailer says, Of Call of Duty, your going to love this film. Hardcore Henry does have its moments, I wish the filming when the characters are talking to Henry, would've been looking more at they're faces, but it's a small gripe for all that this film had to offer, so if your looking for a crazy, action packed, never before seen kind of P.O.V. Film, Hardcore Henry is your meal ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild and fun, violent and satirical. It's a good one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First person POV in an energetic, kinetic thriller like Hardcore Henry is difficult enough to think about, much less sit through 96 minutes. Yet, this violent video-game-like journey, with a heavy dose of tongue-in-cheek, where we virtually live through titular Henry's frenetic attempt to extend his life and find his wife, Estelle (Haley Bennett), is not disorienting as the usual hand-held camera film is, but an absorbing vicarious race against time and very bad Russians.Henry is almost fully cyborg, having been resurrected with no memory and pieced together by his wife. You might even question whether Estelle is really his wife but rather a device of megalomaniac, telekinetic warlord Anka (Danila Kozlovsky) to capture valuable machine-man Henry.We witness first-hand the terror of being pursued by various assassins, including a steel-covered man with a flamethrower and scores of disinterested, by-standing Muscovites. In some ways, the sense of being propelled almost out of control by outside forces was captured similarly in Run Lola Run, but not as violently and helplessly as here.It doesn't seem too much of a stretch to assume that allegorically the tough guys, even Henry, are stand-ins for Moscow hoods emanating from the ultimate tough guy, V. Putin. At any rate, a recurring stranger is Jimmy (Sharlto Copley), who says Mother Russia is "too g--d hot." It is that in a tightly-directed (musician turned writer-director Ilya Naishuller) thriller using GoPro mobile cameras that will totally immerse you, all the while satisfying your inner need to control the world as if you were playing a video game. No control here except for the director.When the campy sequence with a group of Jimmy's clones sings Cole Porter's I've Got You Under My Skin, the crazy-quilt satire is in full swing, and you don't call for control any more."There are 52 baseball bats sold annually in Russia, and only 25 of them are used for sport. I think you can guess what the others are used for." (Akan) Yes, it's violent but highly amusing stuff for which you will not need Dramamine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like you are the hero of the game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you like dead naked Russian courtesans and shooting people in the head? Then you are going to love this movie. Hardcore Henry follows a video-game plot-line drawing on imagery and plot devices reminiscent of both Call of Duty and Final Fantasy, just to name a few. Action sequences get you feeling as if you are actually there, like one of those old film reels where you feel like you are riding in a roller-coaster. I started to feel a bit queasy during one of the chases. These are punctuated by dialog that is both disorienting and witty, giving a break from the incredibly violent action.The story is decent, though I take away a few stars primarily because the semi-sephorothic albino boss is pretty lame, more creepy than seriously threatening. He may appeal to millennials, though.And finally, the movie had a moral. Don't be a... Well, I guess I shouldn't say that in a review. To put it another way, the movie says implicitly that if you want to be a man, learn to trust your equipment and you'll be able to accomplish anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is perfect for anyone who loves action movies and first person video games. This movie is a non-stop ride start to finish. Action scenes are extremely violent and just amazing. And by extremely violent, I mean extrenely violent. This is one of the most violent movies I've ever seen in my life. Along with one of the most graphic movies. The only problem is the story. I felt like there wasn't really story at all. It was just this dude killing people on and on. But that didn't bother me, its such a fun film to watch. And surprisingly I didn't get dizzy, but people who can't handle First Person video games or the movie Cloverfield may get some motion sickness. Overall, 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining, gore is not too gruesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a thrill. Very high intensity. There is gore, as advertized, yet the gore isn't pornographic as in Saw and others. It isn't as disorienting and annoying as Blair witch project, nor claustrophobic. In some ways you might even see "Lola rennt" into it.The pace stays very high and your intelligence isn't insulted with long monologues explaining all the things. As you go along, things become clear which takes you more into the skin of the antagonist with memory loss who is discovering everything at the same time.There are moments the camera-work could be a bit improved; In high action sequences you sometimes get a blurry and shaky movie, without being provided with a reference point. The sequences where he runs this works, but where he flies around you'd "feel the motion" or have a sense of orientation but as a viewer you see just a blur. Filming it this way leaves you out for a second, or two. It's refreshing to see a movie that throws it all upside down, though.It was very funny to see how every Russian in the street were very helpful and kind. While every Russian inside any place was just very angry and violent. There are sequences with nudity, yet for me the biker girls were more sexy and could have gotten more attention.Overall it's a very fun ride. Think Duke Nukem, Doom or of the like. Just badass action. Unlike anything we've seen for years. It's a whole new model.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry, what an entertaining movie. I have to say I've never seen anything like it. I went into to this movie rather excited. I heard about how this movie was an underdog at the Toronto International Film Festival, but it gained a significant crowd reaction. After viewers reacted positively to the film many major corporations bid on the film to give it a wide release and a extended budget. STX entertainment gave this film a wide release and I am sure glad they did. It is quite amazing what they were able to do with Go-Pro during the filming of Hardcore. In a few scenes I was stunned and curious how they were able to pull off the stunts. As a long fan of shooting games and action movies Hardcore Henry was a brilliant surprise. Although it had a blotchy and predictable plot it didn't hurt the film, Hardcore Henry didn't rely on its story telling, it based its movie off incredible stunts, fantastic visuals, and slapstick violence. Hardcore may not be for the squeamish but all its blood and gore in its entirety are fantastic and extremely enjoyable. This film is an instant classic and favorite for me because of how different and revolutionary it was. I love watching movies that break boundaries and are entirely fresh to the film industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardcore Henry -- a roller-coaster ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry is quite an interesting and impacting film. The "first person shooter" is really effective. Initially I wasn't used to it - - it felt a little claustrophobic and honestly I wasn't sure I would make it through the whole thing seeing it on the big screen. Although I dislike disruptions when watching a movie in a theatre, I found it odd there was not a slightest in any kind of reaction coming from the people at the showing. It was rather a silent group. I would not have minded if there were some audience participation. I think it would have been appropriate for this film. Me on the other hand, I couldn't help but react to it a few times; it is intense. I understand that viewing a film through the first person's point of view isn't entirely an original concept, but in this day and age of movies, it's different and that I appreciate.The claustrophobia begins as I am seeing through the eyes of the cyborg as he awakens in a tank of water inside a laboratory on an airship. After the scientist replaces the missing limbs with cybernetic ones, the main villain makes an entrance. Afterwards, the cyborg (you, the viewer) and the scientist make a getaway by being sealed inside an escape pod. While falling through the sky, my heart was pounding, which was when my claustrophobia subsided.By the second half of it, I was used to the camera style. It is an exciting film and it's supposed to be. I don't feel that the entire movie was all a bang, bang, shoot 'em up; there were some slower moments. There was a good balance to the proceedings. I felt the running time was of the proper length. Although muddled at times, I didn't think there was much of a story or much in the way of character development but that's okay. Since the person viewing the movie is basically seeing through the eyes of the main character, you basically know what he knows. It isn't deep. However, while thinking about it, I began to wonder: why in the beginning did Estelle the scientist try to help Henry (the viewer) escape as they were going through that crawlspace, when it is revealed in the end that the whole time she was with the villain Akan? The cyborg could have escaped on his own. I also couldn't understand why they were implying that the guy Jimmy, who was basically helping Henry all that time, was possibly double crossing him towards the end. I didn't fully understand that. There are additional scary scenes especially the ones that take place on ledges or tops of buildings. The idea of it is an interesting way of living vicariously through someone on the big screen.Overall it is an intriguing chase film. It really is like being on a roller-coaster. I felt like I was on the edge of my seat for the entire time. After we stood up during the end credits, my legs felt wobbly and I still felt that adrenaline while driving us home. The curiosity certainly paid off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Much violence do you want...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title sequence of Hardcore Henry,and Henry is punched in the face, shot with pistol, has a baseball bat applied to head,shot again with a pistol, then shot by shotgun. Finally he is slashed in the stomach by a broken bottle, knifed by a serrated blade that goes completely through his neck and shot in the head. All filmed in slow motion, ultra-graphic realism with blood and bits of tissue, bone, and organs flying everywhere very slowly.The graphic destruction of human tissue for the film's never-ending murders could only be imagined by sadists and others who are not tousled by the experience of watching human suffering.This movie has no central idea, very little plot, no direction, only ceaseless pornographic violence. When any tiny parts of the plot peek out between the endless killing, they are swiftly brushed aside by new brace of homicides.Apparently there is humor in Hardcore Henry, according to one reviewer. He sneered cynically at those who found the violence too intense, or found the movie to be too similar to video games. "What did you expect?" he asked, implying that those who found this movie went a bit too far lacked sophistication. He then went on to lecture and say that he found much humor and laughed often throughout this movie.We have been conditioned to increasingly accept more and more graphic violence on TV and the Big Screen.But when does the violence become too intense? And what happens when and if, it does? Hardcore Henry may inspire some debate on these matters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning -- DOES cause motion sickness!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to watch Hardcore Henry because of the novel first-person point of view. I also enjoy action movies and the trailer showed that it had some potential. I also seem to have missed out on other movies where the camera-work was shaky and had no idea what to expect.So, it came as a real surprise, after about 30 minutes, when I starting feeling hot and my tummy started to churn. Fortunately, I recognized it as motion sickness and left the cinema - first time I've ever walked out of a movie, and because it made me physically ill.Later, upon reading up on the movie, I discovered that the movie creators went to great lengths to prevent motion sickness, but I'm not sure about the success of their methods.So, in summary, despite what the creators say, this movie does cause motion sickness.P.S. I'm giving it 5 because I did enjoy what I was able to watch and I loved the first-person aspect. Also, the knowledge that there was only one camera in any scene adds something special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardcore Henry, hardcore fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite possibly one of the most original films I've ever seen!Those of a delicate disposition with an objection to bad language and over the top violence stay away. There are both in HUGE amounts from the get go!Saw this on the back of a single trailer and no reviews and I'm so glad I did. The trailer doesn't do the 100% first person perspective justice, I was expecting reality film shaky cam throughout a-la Blair Witch type films, there wasn't. Yes the action is absurdly fast and the editing break neck but you don't notice the shaking, the film wont allow the diversion from the screen.Throughout the film you never see the "star" Henry, just hand gestures in the shot franticly miming what he's trying to say as not only do you never see Henry, you don't hear him, he's mute! Strangely this causes a great deal of empathy to the character, you really want him to get to the end, get the girl and beat the bad guys. With no hero on screen the rest of the cast have a big job to make the film stay interesting and they do and it's a joy.Sharlto Copley plays a huge part as Jimmy, the helper in the film to keep the action going and to tell the story of what's happening and what's next, he's like the end of level boss in computer shoot em ups which this film almost is. Copley plays sooooo many different characters in this film, at the end of each "level" he's there to introduce the next mission in the game / film, then he dies! And he's back at the next level end as a total different character, Jimmy goes from mad scientist to drug crazed sex fiend with so many different characters between, punk, professor, homeless dude and more! An absolutely breathtaking and breakneck performance.Danila Kozlovsky as the scary evil albino bad guy is almost pantomime bad guy over the top in this, it is absolutely spot on for this film, a subdued, calm bad guy would be lost and out of place in this riot of a film.Yes there are a few questions in the film, where did the leather clad, sword welding, biker, samurai dominatrices come from or go to (yes you read that right); also why is evil albino guy telekinetic!?!Don't know either answer, guess what, don't care. You just accept they're there, they're gone and he is, weird but true.The twist at the end is less a twist and more a corkscrew of a shocker, didn't see it coming and a real shock when it arrived, a real wow moment.</fullReview>

Every actor did their job very well. Sharlto Copley was really entertaining as ''Jimmy'' and main villain ''Akan'' (Danila Kozlovsky) became my most favourite movie villain of all time. :)Hardcore can easily become a new cult classic.

But this movie is not for everyone there is a lot of gore,nudity,and swearing,also shaky cam almost all the time so motion sickness might be an issue, The few main characters are interesting from the start such as Jimmy and how he keeps showing up everywhere, and Akan the villain. Unfortunately not much is explained about Akan but there is a comic that was handed to me before the movie that sheds light on the subject. Anyway just go see it it will by far best be experienced in theatres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest movie I've seen in a long time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry was a brilliant piece of filmography that I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. Its target audience is not nearly as broad as most movies tend to be but I feel that that is to its credit; Hardcore Henry embraces the first person shooter genre completely and doesn't look back! It is non-stop action all the way through with pockets of humor not normally seen in today's films. If you habitually play first person shooters or are intrigued by the world of virtual reality which is becoming more and more of a talking point you may appreciate this movie; that being said, the vast majority of you would probably not enjoy it for one or more of several reasons. Gratuitous violence throughout?in the opening credits several gruesome combat wounds are demonstrated in slow- motion, and it actually gets worse as the movie progresses; nothing is spared in special effects and the combat is bloody and brutal. Language in this movie is far from the worst but you definitely hear some colorful expressions of disdain. Sexual content is present and even a focal point at certain times; and drug use is also present. If you struggle from vertigo then you should definitely take some motion sickness pills should you decide to go, but even with all this concerning subject material if you go with an open mind and a friend who can appreciate it you may have the greatest cinema experience of your life!</fullReview>

A lot has been written about the actual film in the other reviews so I will not bother. But this has a new way of doing film. This is the FIRST one doing it from this audience's point of view. And that will revolutionize the way we will see many and many more films in the future. And I can see everyone looking retrospective and say why they did not do movies like this back in the day.I give it 17 for action, 10 for shooting style (pun not intended), 9 for acting and 7 for plot, so in my book that evens out at perfect 10/10.</fullReview>

HARDCORE HENRY IS F***ING HARDCORE, SELF AWARE AND BADASS! Its 51 percent on RT and Metacritic is B.S. Here's why. The RT Critics Consences are: Hardcore Henry seems poised to reinvent the action flick, but without a story or characters worth caring about, its first-person gimmick quickly loses its thrill. Yeah, if i can recall the movie was never trying to have a character and story oriented movie. Thats because it is self aware and doesn't take itself seriously, its only worried about its inspiration and action - which I have a lot of respect for. It is basically Crank, Mirrors Edge, and Just Cause series. Its stunt choreography was fantastic and put the characters in actual danger. Such as the bridge chase scene with Dmitri. When the film becomes so confusing its hard to follow, you can accept it because the film isn't begging you to understand. It was just a film that wanted to be epic and adrenaline filled. Oh, and no headaches were induced by the movie.This was amazingly HARDOCORE.

		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry certainly isn't a movie for everyone. If you're prone to motion sickness, or don't like the idea of a consistent POV, then stay at home! Same thing if you demand an intelligent story with complex characters, which many critics foolishly did.Hardcore Henry is insane and ridiculous. It's over-the-top non-stop action and twisted offensive humor. It's not so much about story-telling, but more about providing an amusement park ride. It won't give you a calm moment, I spent almost every second either laughing or gasping. I can't remember the last time I was so entertained for the duration of a feature film.Hardcore Henry is the very essence of explosive slasher craziness, and will literally let you experience it through the protagonist's eyes. It will go down in history, disputed forever if it's great or awful. I have taken a side for sure.This might just be the future of cinema. Go and see it, but only if you think you can handle it! Don't come crying to me if you puked, you have been warned.</fullReview>

State of the art in animation, special effects and script. Go see it, you can't stop watching the same way you can't stop playing., Character development, script, acting, etc etc . The movie takes place in Moscow and outskirts but it could be anywhere... Sharlto Copley almost steals the movie from Henry... There are scenes so complex you will wonder for days how they were done.... Amazing cinematography...Kubrick would be impressed. A movie like this only comes out once every few decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Grand and Insane Action Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a balls to the walls insane action flick that is very self aware and satirical. It does not take itself seriously which is what makes it so clever and brilliant. The script... well there is no script, they basically said screw it. The movie does not really have a story or a plot, which is why it works for this film because the whole movie is full adrenaline. It never stops, there are insane numbers of jump cuts and non-stop action. This is truly an action spectacle and a must see in a theater.This film is not for everyone: If you are truly craving for a fun action movie, this is the movie for you. If you are hoping for more substance, then you are going to be left disappointed.Some cons: -Some shaky cam in some scenes are too much. -Some music choices aren't very fitting. -The movie at times goes too fast. -One scene had really bad CGI. -GoPro quality isn't as good. -There are some scenes where you could see the stunt crew or stuntman in reflections.Overall a fun time - 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more Stupid VIOLENCE . TEACHING FOOLS how to kill without motive ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen action like this. It's not just regular action scenes filmed in first person. It's superheroic parkour, fantastical fights, and video game gunplay all presented in first person. Seen from a regular angle, the action would likely be too cartoonish. The POV helps ground everything, making it more believable. Added Bonus: During many scenes you'll wonder how the POV camerman didn't get killed.Hardcore is incredibly violent, but rarely nasty. People who play modern FPS's will not bat an eye, others will be shocked and appalled. Expect a lot of controversy when the older crowd expresses grave concern about this film, while the younger crowd rallies behind it. Expect marketing to exploit this generation gap.Action aside, the movie has an unexpected sense of humour. Some driven by situations, some driven by characters, some thanks to the POV. There's not a lot, but what is there is gold - and a relief during all that action.The main character, despite never appearing, is able to communicate a personality. I believe FPSs will steal the ideas presented here. The circle is complete.Which brings me to Jimmy (Sharlto Copley)... Can't say much but he's easily as compelling as the action. His interactions with our hero (the POV) are not straightforward, and always intriguing. Somehow they form a bond, which winds up unexpectedly touching. Before the movie Sharlto said it was the craziest, hardest role he's ever done and it's easy to see why.The bad? The overall plot is good but not great. The bad guy, beyond being powerful and evil, has less character than the POV. Despite some attempts, women are relegated to lesser roles. (I believe the good far FAR outweighs the bad)Russian Hollywood has created the best first person shooter ever made. When POV becomes the new bullet time, you can thank Hardcore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Herky-Jerky first person shooter - non-stop violence ... not much else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really thought this would be a fascinating GoPro type movie with exciting visuals and great action scenes. It really isn't. The video quality does not hold up, going from GoPro to big screen. Only the relatively still shots are decently HD quality. Lots of the movie is low quality video. Almost ALL the movie is jerky, bouncy, crude. This was a full length experiment done for the first time this way. We don't need any more such experiments unless they can be done far better. It fell well short of my expectations, mainly due to the unsteadiness of almost the entire movie. Film makers have spent decades perfecting steady-cams and such for a darn good reason. So this experiment is a large step back from state of the art.The idea of this movie was to make the viewer truly feel like they were in the scene. Unfortunately, that idea was not realized. If one envisions any number of crude FPS games and how they don't really "feel" like you are the protagonist, this movie fails in exactly the same way. It tries really hard again and again and again and again. But it just doesn't pull it off, I'd say. Try again? Maybe not.As a note, one must say that almost all the GoPro videos I've seen on Youtube are much better, much cleaner, much more dramatic (believe it or not) than this big screen rendering, which used GoPros or modified versions of that type camera.As for plot and acting and dialog, this is a total bust. The movie really is almost exactly like a FPS video game only lots more repetitive, believe it or not. There was more blood, gore, and mayhem in this than in a dozen normal action films. And the endless violence serves no purpose to speak of. The plot, such as it is, is obscure and primitive and weakly developed. The acting in boring. Not much to recommend here.In a word, a waste of money to see. A waste of time to view at home as well, except for maybe just out of curiosity to see what the fuss is about (be sure not to pay for it though!).There was a bunch of gratuitous tits and ass in one long sequence but even that was messed up a bit by the jerkiness and poor lighting.</fullReview>

This is suppose to be a movie, we expect better writing at this level. The camera work is awful. Can we say way to shaky. Half the shots look like a bad video game replay where the person is looking at the ground and you can't see what the hell is going on. They cut off people's face, who looks at people directly in the chest??? No one.Just all in all, a really really bad movie. 3 for acting, 3 for script, 3 for camera work while the production quality is decent it simply doesn't make up for the rest.3/10 don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>holocaust cannibal + GTA+ Doom= Hardcore Henry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw an early preview of Hardcore Henry and title pretty much sums it up. This movie is hardcore action and gore, so if you are not into that sort of thing than bye bye. I gotta say, I wonder if the director was inspired by Holocaust Hannibal because he sure brought the genre justice, unlike "The Green Inferno" which was a let down. The movie is shot in a first person perspective, and the technique really makes you feel as if you are in the movie. Keeping in mind this, Hardcore Henry will be the Godfather of this first person genre if a trend develops. Do not confuse this with shaky cam movies like Paranormal Activities or Blair Witch, this is beyond to another level. So in conclusion, if you don't mind fictional gore, love action and shooter video games, than you are in for a treat. 10/10this has been another review by Dusty Webb. Peace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardcore? Yes. Fun? No.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For 96 Minutes in Hardcore Henry, you think the main silent character of Henry is having a seizure he cannot die from. But you wish he would because he has absolutely no personality whatsoever. I was following the movie titled 'Hardcore' back when a 6 minute scene hit Youtube in 2014. I was absolutely stunned by the premise. It looked like it could actually work. As I kept my eyes open for this movie, a trailer was released with a new title 'Hardcore Henry' and it looked bloody awesome. So when I saw it today after seeing the reviews, I hoped it would exceed my expectations and be my favorite film of the year so far.Unfortunately, with movies like these, you need your expectations set very low.What's the Plot of Hardcore Henry? Hell if I know. From what I understand, the plot involves robots, multiple Sharlto Copley characters, a villain reminiscent of Tommy Wiseau, extreme gore and violence... that's about it.I could say there is no plot in this film, but to my surprise, there is too much plot. The plot is extremely complicated to follow. Henry gets resurrected as a robot, turns into an absolute killing machine, finds out that Jimmy (Sharlto Copley) is a handicapped person who has multiple versions of himself that he can exit from at any time, also finds out the villain has his memories implanted into other robots for them to fight him which makes absolutely no freaking sense. Why did they make a movie that is suppose to have very little plot have too much plot?! It's ridiculous.As much as I love Sharlto Copley, his performance(s) cannot save this movie from being over the top crazy and unnecessarily stupid. I couldn't follow his back-story at all.The main problem I have with this movie is the camera work. It is actually interesting on how it works. They had three people film it. They put a camera headset over their head and when filming started they start doing whatever they need to do. It's actually quite revolutionary in technological advancements for film. But although it's an original idea (Kind of, I mean the Doom movie did the first person shooter thing too) it is horribly done. The camera always shakes violently and never ever stops to get in focus of where the action is. People complain about found footage movies having too much shaky cam, but this goes to a whole new level of obnoxious. You cannot see the violence or action going on because the camera seems to be having a seizure. Also, the static like effects of the camera are bad also and very annoying. I felt like I was going to fall out of my seat and roll down the theater stairs breaking my legs. That's how bad the camera work is.The villain. Oh my god the villain is just hilarious. He is the Tommy Wiseau of this generation. I forgot his name (It's some Russian name so I don't know) but his performance is so funny. I could not stop grinning every single time he came on. Did I like anything? Yeah. I liked the music. The music actually wasn't that bad. Although I feel like the movie could have been done without music, the score is pretty good. With the exception of Queen's Don't Stop Me Now which plays when Henry injects himself with two syringes full of adrenaline. That was probably it though.It was disappointing to know that something this groundbreaking could go this south of the border. If the camera-work was done better, if there was anyone likable to route for, if the violence and action could be seen, this would have gotten a 90/100 or better. But unfortunately, Hardcore Henry is not the film I hoped for. Also, I didn't know robots had flesh that was made out of paper. Seriously, robots can just rip their own hearts out with no problem.39/100 D+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry isn't really that hardcore. From a first person shooter standpoint that is derived from plenty of video games, you get to experience that POV with live actors and in a nutshell, it's over-hyped and pedestrian in the killings. I found that my senses were becoming numb with the onslaught of slaughter. At some point, you want to find any redemption in the character as there is none since he never speaks throughout the entire run of the film. I assume that was purposely done in order for the teens in the audience to be the shooter in this instance. For those of us who aren't teens, this was just buckets of blood and bullets and mild gore. The slaughter wasn't particularly fascinating and the club scene nudity was Meh! You never get that roller coaster feeling when its wall to wall bashing skulls and blowing out somebody's brain. The single plot element seriously missed a lot.</fullReview>

If this is what you really want, ask to watch someone play a video game. It's free, and lasts longer. And, to be honest, the video quality will be better than that of a trash camera strapped to a guy's head who runs around beating people up.In conclusion, I am happier sitting in the theater lobby then watching this movie.</fullReview>

I can see why all the perfect 10 scores (seriously though?) probably from all the gamers, but as a movie, I only give it a 5, which should have been less, but this movie also did not deserve all the 1's.The FPS POV is nothing new, shocked it took this long to get it on the big screen (closest was Crank and I loved that one!) but the problem with this movie is that they over did it. Way too shaky and they should have had some breaks from the POV throughout the movie. I seriously had to take a Tylenol for my headache right after! Action was non stop, although some of it was cheesy and overboard.Had they made this less FPS POV and had a better, more serious story line and character development, I would have enjoyed it more.</fullReview>

Why they chased him I don't know but it was a abandon building were they usually do stunts that you see on YouTube with jumping up and down so it should look cool they filmed it and he jumped up and then down with same character coming up all the time with different cloth on that should been robots as the one we follow also is with the arm and leg getting connected at the beginning off the movie. If you try to do this again first get a manuscript, 2 get more actors / stuntmen 3 don't film everything from first person view just film some parts from it, 4 talk have a dialog between actors so you get a story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry is a first person action film, and that is about it. This film is very entertaining in terms of an insane, mindless action film. There are both good and bad points about this film, but the major issue people will have with it, would be its edgy, bizarre, shaky-cam. The bad points about this film is its characters, they are bland and boring, with the exception of Sharlto Copley, who is as he is in every film, fantastic. He plays several different characters in the film, with their own unique personalities, which really keeps the film going in some parts. The story is also very poor and not very well thought-out. It is basic, mindless and has little to go on it. But the major issue is the film's effort to look like a video-game. Even some points in the film, I found myself thinking, this reminds me of Call of Duty, or another first-person shooter, such as boss levels.Now the good parts about this film, is the roller-coaster like adventure it takes you on. This is action at its core, and it is directed very well. Because of its first-person story, the fight scenes seem very real in parts, and I found myself scratching my head in wonder how they managed to pull some of the stunts off. There is next to none CGI in this film, and it makes it very realistic. This is a great entertaining movie, but if you are wanting a story, strong characters and the next great action movie, this is not for you. However if you want to sit down in a rainy night, with your friends and want a mindless action film to dazzle yourself with, this film is perfect. Although I would advise not to drink while watching this film, unless you have a mop sitting by. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ill give it a 4 or 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ill give Hardcore Henry a 4/5 out of 10. This is around half of 10 as they provided us with half a film.The half they gave us :-Excellent action and visuals, the first person visual worked well. The action was brilliantly done and left you feeling like you were part of it all. A few times I lurched when he was at a height or falling as Im not keen on heights ( or falling ) The cuts were done really well and tied together in a seamless manner. Having said that if you get nauseous with shaky cam then definitely avoid.Music was also good and kept you in the moment of the film.A crazy character who provided some excellent moments played brilliantly by Sharlto Copley of Chappy, District 9 fame.The half they didn't give us :-A proper insight into the main character Henry, there is a childhood scene that seems like an after thought and a tiny amount of exposition between characters giving you the vaguest understanding of who our hero actually is.A plot - This is non existent, there is a vague premise which is confusing and disjointed. By the end of it all your left asking what happened and why.Characters - Apart from the one character everyone else is a waste of time. The performances are terrible ( worst of all is the bad guy ) and on top of that they don't provide anything.The wife doesn't provide feeling the bad guy doesn't provide danger and everyone else provides little of anything.Sharlto Copley does provide us with humour and laughs and a vague buddy element.By the time it had ended I spent about 5 mins wondering what the point was and realised the point was to provide some action packed eye candy for a certain generation or demographic.Now if they could produce a similar concept that had a point to it you might get a film with a higher score.I think the IMDb score of 7/10 for an action film is about right but for an overall movie it is around 4.5Its worth checking out but don't expect anything other than some cool action sequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry (2016): Dir: Ilya Naishuller / Cast: Sharlto Copley, Danila Kozlovsky, Haley Bennett, Tim Roth, Andrei Dementiev: Video game first person perspective action film about the unexpected that Henry is thrust into after an opening credits that present his brutal mutilation. He is revived only to be equipped with a mechanical left arm and leg. Haley Bennett plays Estelle, a scientist who introduces herself as his wife. The bulk of the film has Henry on the run from foot soldiers. His wife is abducted and he is constantly connected with a guy who calls himself Jimmy. Sharlto Copley has fun as Jimmy who seems to have more lives than a cat. He is constantly killed off while in the midst of helping Henry propel forward. He provides a lot of humour with a raspy voice that sounds similar to Jason Statham. He is featured as Jimmy in several different looks that only render this more bizarre. Bennett is the kidnap victim and source of emotion for Henry and that role has a surprise turn. Danila Kozlovsky plays the villain Akan who has a sort of telekinetic power that combats Henry. He is seeking an android army of sorts to gain world power. Tim Roth is featured briefly as Henry's father who witnessed his son's loss to bullies and offers a less than friendly response to his son's pain. Andrei Dementiev plays one of the soldiers of sorts whom Henry must retrieve life force from. This is an extremely violent film done with stylish editing and cuts by Ilya Naishuller with a killer soundtrack to high light its lighter tone. It is a cross between Crank and Deadpool with a hero whose face we do not see, and a mission that is way hard core. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry shows audiences a new genre of cinematic filming. The entire movie is action scene after action scene with some plot twists. The movie, which is entirely filmed with a GoPro camera, gives viewers a first person shooter view throughout the entire movie. Hardcore Henry packs so much intense action that has you at the edge of your seat. It gives people the view through the eyes of the main character Henry which helps further visualize viewers in his position. Given that it is made up of mostly action scenes (which stands up to the name "Hardcore Henry"), the plot is stale since most of the plot is really happening in the beginning and the end where everything is introduced and explained leaving the large middle part just a huge action fest. For those who have an inner 9 year old, you will love this movie, if it is the plot you came for you were probably disappointed, if you have a light stomach and can't handle gore I can tell there's plenty of blood and gore so in which case avoid the movie. They'll also add a few humorous scenes to keep viewers entertained. So in conclusion if you want to just watch a bunch of cool action scenes and explosions this movie is just for you!</fullReview>

Keep your eyes focused at the upper two thirds of the screen, and it will be more or less like the FPS experience of a computer game. Awesome sh*t! Sharlto Copley shows how bad-ass of an actor he can be. Impressive.Love to see a part two, they left the ending pretty open there. And with a bigger budget and people like Robert Rodriguez and or Quentin Tarantino on board... who knows how good the sequel can be?The story was pretty good, the soundtrack rocked; the pace was like a bat out of hell... It's a First Person Shooter turned into a movie - from the perspective of the game character. So, disregard all sense of logic, preconceived notions, squareness, and watch Henry: All Out Balls To The Wall - Hardcore!!!Go see the thing already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An over the top, insane, fun action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is insane. First person shooter mixed with deafening techno music, combined with over the top meaningless gore and violence, with just a sprinkle of drugs and a dusting of sex. It's as insane as it sounds and looks, and I loved every freaking second of it. Within ten minutes the movie starts with a bang, shoving you head first into action filled insanity. The action happening is very fast paced, and some of the moves Henry performs you can't help but laugh while your jaw hangs open, mentally telling yourself "Holy crap, did he just do that?"The gore is just as over the top as the action is. A big part of what I loved about the gore is that it wasn't comical. No fountains of blood spraying from a recently severed necks. Instead, the gore is on a real level, where if someone were to actually perform some of the sick things that happen, the outcome would most likely be what we saw. The first person shooter POV is not the only thing that reminded me of a video game. The villain reminded me of villains I've fought in video games, more specifically Metal Gear Solid, and Final Fantasy.The acting was actually pretty great. It felt like I was watching people cosplay/roleplay to the extreme, and it totally worked for the movie. The shaky cam was a little nauseating at times, but not enough to take me out of the movie. It came and went in just seconds. The graphics were awesome throughout except for a brief scene towards the end that just looked like they got a little sloppy or lazy. This movie is no masterpiece, but it's fun. It's exactly what I expected, and exactly what I wanted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry is an action movie unlike anything you've ever seen before. Its clearly an homage to FPS games but don't let that fool you, this movie is a first class action flick by it's own right. The story is as crazy as it is simple with a major twist at the end. We have the protagonist who's a cyborg, a crazy and insanely funny sidekick, we have the damsel in distress who's in need of immediate saving, an archetypal villain and of course hundreds of henchmen primed and ready to be killed in all kinds of gruesome manner. We get about five minutes of calm character introduction, what follows after is insane action that doesn't let up for a single second till the credits role.Henry, even though never shown or heard is built as a real personality from the very start of the movie and I was instantly invested in him. The story is smartly built, all the odd secrets and twists are dripped at just the right pace, by the end few questions are left unanswered, and the ones that are can be easily dismissed by invoking the rule of cool.Hardcore Henry is filled with TV tropes and video game references, most of which will sadly be lost on viewers who don't appreciate video games, but will give even more to those who do -this by the way is a reference in itself since most games (well the good ones anyway) tend to have pop culture references in them.The ingenuity that was necessary to pull of this movie technically speaking deserve my praise, but what's even more amazing is the actual cinematic quality of the shots and scenes. This move despite it's unconventional technical solutions (possibly because of them) is far better looking than other action titles of the decade so far. The score is also great and I loved the little games and jokes that relied purely on sound effects. Despite being a newbie at film making the director really put together a masterpiece here.I highly recommend watching this movie, if you enjoy it just half as much as I did, you'll still end up having the best time of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bat-s*** crazy, and the best video game film EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even with film being over a century old, it is amazing that we can still create brand new ways of presenting a film. In the case of Hardcore Henry, it is showing an entire feature film from a first person point of view.I decided not to watch the trailer as the concept and some of the people was enough to give me confidence that this in safe hands and that I will get a lot of enjoyment without the needs of a trailer viewing.It is quite simply one of the craziest films I have ever seen. From the great opening credits to the intense finale, the action is so constant. At times, it does go over-the-top and at times throws the laws of physics out of the window. But on the whole, it is really well developed and choreographed and gradually ups the ante on the action set-pieces.The first part of the film slowly gets you used to the unique style of camera-work whilst explaining the main premise of the film. Then once its give you that introduction, you hit the ground running in such an impactful way. It never stops and the camera-work just gives that difference, because if it was done with conventional cinematography then this would probably just a solid action flick.What I liked about it the most was the cool twists used, especially in the second half. I liked it, because on paper it sounds like a film with a cheap gimmick just to be different. But they also manage to give us a story with interesting use of sci-fi technology that managed to be part of my what could well be one of my favourite scenes from a movie this year.The only role that is worth mentioning is Sharlto Copley's. The South African is well known for being part of gruesome sci-fi's District 9 and Elysium. I can definitely tell that these are the type of films that he likes being part of. He is given a character that actors love to do. It really expands his repertoire and was intrigued by where it was going.A few gripes I had with the film. The amount of violence felt exhausting at times. There were moments where you could digest so much violence that I just could not take it all it and was on the verge of becoming over-blown. As for the unique camera-work. It is impressive to see something completely new and props to that. But there were times my head was hurting at times. It is not quite motion-sickness, but it just gave me a headache. I hope I am not sounding like an old man.Even though I enjoyed it a lot. In the end, it felt more like a trial for this camera format rather than giving us an interesting film whilst also giving us something new. It may sound harsh, but that's what was my main feeling afterwards.There is a lot to like though. Copley is great as the main character we see from Henry's point of view. The one scene I have mentioned earlier will be on my mind for some time. The intense action kept my eyes fixed as it is incredibly fast-paced and it makes you wanting to see every bit of action to see how mad this could get.I love the idea and I am really happy to see new grounds still being broken within an industry that is over a century old. This could well be the best film for gamers even though it is based off one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'HARDCORE HENRY': Four Stars (Out of Five)An experimental sci-fi action flick, shot entirely in the first- person format. The movie was directed and written by first time feature filmmaker Ilya Naishuller (with additional writing by Will Stewart). It was co-produced by Timur Bekmambetov (a popular Russian-Kazakh filmmaker) and executive produced by actor Sharlto Copley (who also stars in the movie, playing multiple roles). The film also costars Danila Kozlovsky, Haley Bennett and Tim Roth. It tells the story of an amnesiac, resurrected as a cybernetic soldier, who must do battle with a telekinetic warlord, and his army of mercenaries, in order to rescue his wife and save the world. The movie is completely crazy, and like nothing you've ever seen before, but it still feels like a missed opportunity (in many ways).Henry (played by many different cameramen, stuntmen, and the director himself) wakes up in a laboratory, on an airship, missing his left leg and left arm. His limbs are immediately replaced, with cybernetic ones, by the woman who brought him back from the dead; his wife Estelle (Bennett). Estelle quickly tries to bring Henry up to speed, on what's going on, but before he has any idea who he is, they're both attacked by a powerful warlord, named Akan (Kozlovsky), and his mercenaries. Henry manages to escape, but Estelle is kidnapped. He spends the rest of the film trying to survive many attackers, at every turn, regain his memory, and rescue Estelle. Henry finds aid, from a mysterious stranger named Jimmy (Copley); and others, who look just like him.The film is brutally violent, and it has an extremely large body count as well; I think it's among the most violent movies I've ever seen (probably). The first-person perspective is interesting, and it provides a very unique filmgoing experience, but the movie's originality doesn't end there. The film is set in a very bizarre world, full of lots of crazy characters. It's definitely like no other movie that I've ever seen before (and I've seen a hell of a lot of movies). Still I wish the filmmakers would have done even more, with their awesome concept. It just didn't meet my very high expectations.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/n2qWxeZ0Tck</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry is essentially an intense action movie with a lot of shoot-outs, in FIRST PERSON!The story to Hardcore Henry left me scratching my head at times, trying to figure out why certain characters did certain things, and how some of it all fit together, but to be fair, the experience isn't as much about the story as it is the intensity.The idea of a first person action movie is certainly a new and interesting one, which may be a problem for some people; a very shaky camera. Personally, I think the shaky camera added to the experience because it made me feel like I was actually there, and seeing things from Henry's perspective, like the movie was meant to be seen.</fullReview>

Even though you can sea the CGI here and there and the movie definitely sets new limits in regard to on screen brutality.The plot wasn't very elaborate, but it was enough. if you take some things just as given and don't ask yourself why and how you will be very pleased.The best comparison to this movie is indeed a first person shooter. Here as well some things are just given.I felt very entertained and it was for sure something new on the big screen!</fullReview>

Not by a half, but it is a lot of fun.If you have ever played doom, quake, or duke nukem, you will enjoy this film. If you haven't, it may not be the movie for you on Saturday afternoon and perhaps you would be better served with a nice drama. Make no mistake, this film is a wee bit of the ultra-violence, full of head shots, shotguns, grenades, amputations and deaths measured by the metric ton.I honestly can't wait to play the video game that is inevitable.

		<fullReview>From seeing trailers of this film I just knew the next in thing was coming! And to say the least, I was right!The film is about a solider who wakes up from a coma to a female nurse who is also his wife &amp; he is an android/human. Then a breach occurs in the air facility &amp; Henry must fight &amp; kill anyone who gets in his way in order to save his kidnapped wife!This film was just epic! From start to finish was just bare knuckle violence &amp; gore &amp; not stop FPS action throughout! It didn't disappoint even for a second! It was just awesome!The FPS reminded me of COD quite a lot (even though I myself haven't played the game series) &amp; mostly the GTA series (Which I HAVE played &amp; can say it related so well to this film!)Never knew this film was an 18 till I looked online, must've missed it here as the rating didn't stand out. But it was a bloody great bonus the film being an 18 as it delivered in such an epic unforgettable manner! The gore effects were epic! Along with the slashing/stabbing/shooting scenes they were simply perfectly executed! I just couldn't get over how great the FPS was it was like a new Genre in film making has been born &amp; hope to see more films like this in later years!I overall felt this was one of the best films I have seen in all my days if not one of the best films of 2016 it was an epic showdown from start to finish! 10/10 Epic!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It gave me a headache but it was worth it. Fast, violent, clever and funny.Some reviewers are whining about characterisation. Henry isn't supposed to be a character, he is purposefully left blank for you to inhabit. Sharlto Copley doesn't play a character, he plays about a dozen, all brilliant, and he makes the film's most amazing non-violent scene. Henry's wife Estelle isn't supposed to be much of a character, she is just the McGuffin that motivates Henry. There aren't any good female characters (apart from, briefly, a couple of hilarious kick-ass whores) because this isn't a woman's film. The villain is superb, Danila Kozlovsky is unforgettable as the smug, smirking albino Akan. I wanted to be him.The plot made perfect sense to me. The soundtrack is pounding. The action is totally immersive. Technically this film IS ground breaking.If you can tolerate shaky-cam and you like action this film will knock your socks off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting gimmick that makes for a fun action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first person shooter film Hardcore Henry takes a very new approach to action. The movie begins with a memory then wakes up with Henry being revived by his wife Estelle played by Haley Bennett. Viewers quickly learn that Henry is not totally human but mostly a robot. He is almost immediately pursued by a warlord played by Danila Kozlovsky. Akan the warlord has the power to lift people and throw objects around, which is never really explained.All sorts of weird science stuff goes on without much of an explanation like Sharlto Copley's character who keeps mysteriously giving Henry instruction that he follows without question. These instructions lead Henry all over Russia where he almost always encounters crazy guys with guns. Copley's characters were definitely a highlight of the film and added humor to the dialogue.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Outlandish Fast-Paced Science Fiction Saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moscow-born writer &amp; director Ilya Naishuller makes his cinematic debut with an above-average but implausible, science fiction saga, "Hardcore Henry," that resembles a video game masquerading as a feature-length film. Virtually everything is depicted from the protagonist's perspective after he is resurrected and then struggles with a thoroughly repellent villain in a series of cliffhanger showdowns. Basically, "Hardcore Henry" delivers maximum action with minimal plot. An eccentric mad scientist who has already clashed with the villain supervises our amnesiac hero as he fights their shared enemy. At the same time, Henry dedicates himself to rescuing his damsel-in-distress wife after this same dastardly evildoer has abducted her. Sadly, few genuine surprises occur in the aftermath of this abduction that endows this agitated, high-octane actioneer with greater depth. Lacking a shred of subtlety, these characters are straightforward, one-dimensional, stereotypes. The misadventures that they embark on, however, generate anticipation and hysteria. Clocking in at 96 berserk minutes with more than enough slam-bang conflict, this rambunctious Russian &amp; American co-production gives Naishuller scant time to develop his superficial heroes and villains beyond their formulaic origins. This isn't the first time we've seen this kind of trigger-happy nonsense with a sci-fi twist. The premise recalls movies such as "Universal Soldier," "Terminator," and "Crank 2," but "Hardcore Henry" isn't as conventional in its storytelling. Naishuller collaborated with 'Training Day" scenarist Will Stewart, but the revelations that take place are largely standard-issue. Nevertheless, the greatest asset that "Hardcore Henry" deploys is the use of several GoPro Hero3 Black Edition cameras. The adrenalin-fueled action scenes that pile up triple digit body counts are engrossing because of the GoPro. Since everything is lensed from our view, we feel like a rampaging gamer blasting away at everything in sight as hordes of henchmen challenge us. Occasionally, we absorb a blow or two that knocks us sideways. Appropriately enough, Naishuller never identifies the actor from whose point of view the action unfolds. Since Naishuller and ten others who shared camera operator duties played the role, "Hardcore Henry" doesn't have a celebrity name actor in the role. Typically, we are inclined to identify with the lead actor and imagine all the risks that he is facing. Shrewdly, Naishbuller converts the audience into the hero and plunges us into a whirlpool of mayhem so we gain first-hand experience of the ordeal. Tim Roth of "Reservoir Dogs" and "District 9's" Sharlto Copley rank as the biggest stars in "Hardcore Henry," but both appear in strictly supporting roles. Cast as the hero's father, Roth appears in two scenes, and we learn little about him. The rest of the cast is either unknown or up-and-coming.After an enigmatic opening scene that involves a teenager smashing a small robotic toy against a wall, "Hardcore Henry" begins with a gorgeous, blond, scientist named Estelle (Jennifer Lawrence look-alike Haley Bennett of "The Equalizer"), who bringing a dead soldier back to life. She calls him Henry, and what follows is reminiscent the original "Robocop" movie when he was modified. Not only is Henry missing a left forearm, but he also has no leg from the knee down. Estelle outfits our hero with a new, state-of-the-art forearm, wields a torch-like implement to solder the mechanical appendage onto Henry's elbow so that the limb looks genuine. Next, she screws a new left calf and foot onto his left leg. The last thing Estelle does is hand Henry a brass wedding band and inform him that she is his wife. Initially, Henry is mute, but he can nod as well as shake his head. Eventually, he will recover his power of speech. Estelle escorts him out of the laboratory to meet two male scientists. Before they have a chance to perform an analysis on their rebuilt cybernetic super-soldier, a wailing security alarm notifies them about a breach in their system. Soldiers pour into the room, and Henry hustles Estelle off to an escape pod. As they are plummeting to Earth, Henry looks up and we see that the laboratory was in some kind of aircraft hovering in the atmosphere. Up to this point, aside from Estelle assuring him she is his wife, Henry knows no more about himself than Jason Bourne did about himself in "The Bourne Identity." The trials and tribulations that ensue find Henry tangling against an army with a villain so smarmy that you will relish his demise.Trust me; you've never seen anything like this audacious, hyperbolic, sci-fi thriller about armies of androids. You're going to either rhapsodize about this extreme, overwrought, parody of action movies or you're going to revile it as mindless melodramatic mayhem. Some might even consider gobbling Dramamine tablets to tolerate this frenzied film. Rookie director Ilya Naishuller keeps the action moving at such breakneck pace that it can induce headaches. Part of the problem with "Hardcore Henry" is its hopelessly incomprehensible plot. As the goofy scientist who pitches in to help our hero, Jimmy (Sharlto Copley) has already run afoul of the chief villain, Akan (Danila Kozlovsky of "Vampire Academy"), when he failed to supply him with an army of androids. Poor Jimmy suffered Akan's wrath and wound up permanently confined to a wheel chair with a broken back. Not one to take adversity lightly, Jim has created avatars of himself, and this oddball army of clones accompany out hero throughout this first-person fracas. The evil white-haired villain reminded me of Javier Barden from the Coen brother's classic "No Country for Old Men." Furthermore, Akan possesses telekinetic powers that enable him to gain the upper hand over our hero. Issues of incomprehensibility aside, "Hardcore Henry" bristles with some of the most dynamic action scenes that you will ever see. The stunt work is nothing short of spectacular, and Naishuller displays flair to spare, especially in a road chase that compares favorably to anything in the "Mad Max" movies. Had Naishuller grafted a smarter plot onto those incredible stunts and gunplay, "Hardcore Henry" would have been a devastating movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vulgar video game brought to life: fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After focusing on directing a few music videos in a similar style, first time feature film director Ilya Naishuller brings to life what is essentially a live-action first-person shooter video game in Hardcore Henry. It starts with a tutorial section, giving you the layout of what kind of film this will be and a little bit of what's going on. From there, it's balls to the wall action played out just like familiar game missions. From fighting hordes of enemies while protecting a moving object to looting downed enemies after defeat, you'll feel like you should be holding a game controller while watching this film. Of course, save points, er, I mean short breaks are taken as the mission givers explain what's to happen next and what location you're off to. Henry himself also does a sort of leveling up, learning more about the situation at hand after each stage or encounter before squaring off in the next round.Not only does the film play out like a video game storywise, but even more blatantly in its visual style. It's a bit unfortunate, though, that the film's best feature, watching from the protagonist's first-person point of view through the entire movie, is also one of its faults. Hardcore Henry focuses on a cool gimmick that is unfortunately not mastered enough here for a feature length film. Other films, like Strange Days and Being John Malkovich, have used this point of view sparingly to great effect. To see a full feature film set in this frame, literally transporting it's viewer into the mind of our protagonist, excited me. This is a great way to feel involved and indeed the film does feel interactive. More than just an adrenaline fueled action film, it's an experience. It feels almost like a theme park attraction in many ways. Just imagine the surreal feeling one would get watching a film like this in a virtual reality headset or moving seats whose choreography matches the movements of Henry. But, really, it's a visual overload, and the editing and pacing here don't quite work for this style of feature. Everything moves so quickly that it's sometimes hard to appreciate some of the great shots that actually are being set up, which is upsetting. While I didn't feel any nausea as I've heard other viewers have, a lot more planning and focus would have had better results in the film overall.The film's greatest fault, though, is its very flimsy storyline that falls apart at the drop of a hat and leaves all kinds of questions unanswered. It seems to inject confusion into the plot just for the sake of confusion. We're learning just as Henry is learning, so that's fine, but this is a literal slice of life film. It starts, and we travel with our character until it's anticlimactic stop. And that's just the end, with no tidying up afterwards. The story also suffers from what many video game story lines suffer from: repetition. Sharlto Copley is the actor seen most in the film, taking up a majority of the roles. While he does a fine job pulling off what needs to be pulled off, it gets a bit repetitive to see and hear the same mission giver, as well as seeing and hearing many similar missions over and over.But that's not really the point of this type of film is it? This is a brawler. Living up to its name, this is a hardcore, brutal, bloody film and its audience doesn't need a sensible story as much as it wants dramatic shoot 'em ups, swinging baseball bats and metallic knuckles. Seeing the events of such a video game type of project played out by real actors really makes you far more aware of just how violent today's games are. Still, even with its faults, I'm glad that the risk for such an avant garde feature film was taken. Perhaps even because of its faults, Hardcore Henry is indeed enjoyable in a rather vulgar way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not going to sugarcoat this at all. This film was INSANE. From literally beginning to end it was non-stop adrenaline filled action all in a first-person experience witnessed like never before. From the pulse-pounding gunshots and action scenes, to the quick scenes of comedic inserts, to the sheer "WTF" moments brought upon by the shock of what is happening or simply by the wild stunt scenes and/or effects. This film is an EXPERIENCE rather than a viewing. I read reviews of people saying that they would lose themselves into feeling like they were in the film themselves but I can fully vouch for this as I felt the same thing. I had many times where I was squinting and shaking my head because I was so focused in on the scenes forgetting that it was a film on its own. 'Hardcore Henry' is a film that is going to be remembered either due to pure enjoyment and entertainment or as a cult-classic. It is like none-other and is a wild ride. Not for the feint of heart or the motion sickness prone but if you are not either one of those and love action movies, gore, and oddball comedic moments: This is your movie. This is the start of something great for Ilya, I feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardcore Henry is somewhat entertaining, but it's also hard to watch, at times. I got a headache, because of it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry is an action film told from a 1st person perspective in which, the viewer see the events around through the protagonist's Henry eyes. Just to note: there's no single actor who played the main character, Henry. His role was performed by more than 10 different cameramen and stuntmen, including director Ilya Naishuller. IIya Naishuller is probably best known for being a frontman of the Russian indie rock band, Biting Elbows whom music videos for the songs 'The Stampede' and 'Bad Motherf**ker', went viral because of their great use of first person perspective, special effects, and violence. Because of this, Naishuller was able to get producers, to fund his first full-length first-person action/sci-fi/adventure film, which also written by himself. Hardcore Henry tells the story of Henry, a man half cyborg soldier with no memory, whom just been brought back alive from the dead by his wife, Estelle (Haley Bennett); only to soon find out, that a warlord named Akan (Danila Kozlovsky)) is out to get him. With some help from his wife, Estelle and mysterious stranger named Jimmy (Sharlto Copley), Henry must stop this madman from capturing him, and creating a large army of mercenaries with his technology parts; while also search the truth about your identity. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I see the style in which, this first-person action film was going for. Konami's 'Metal Gear Solid' video game franchise mixed with Activision's 'Call of Duty' series seem to be, it's game. However, the video game style wasn't that well-delivered here. Movies like this, fails because they will never have the freedom that Video Games provide for its audiences. Video Games works, because you are not just passively watching a character, you are the character. You make the choices. You're the one who interacts with the environment on screen. While, the recent product, of a GoPro, a lightweight, wearable camera makes films like this, easily to make. There is still a psychological disconnect between, the viewer and a character, and that barrier is free-will. Films don't give you that. You just have to follow whatever, the artist feeds you. It's a control-environment. Because of that, Hardcore Henry feels more like voyeurism than open gameplay. It's not that ground-breaking since horror found footage films been doing this for years. It would seem filmmakers today are so ingrained with the unique use of game-like POV for our collective cultural psyche that they forget that. It's reason why like that, people love playing video games, rather than watching them. It's one of the reason, why video games movies, normally don't works. Meanwhile, while, the set pieces are brilliantly designed to look like video game stages. I had the deep feeling in me, wanting to play it, rather than watching some unknown avatar named Henry quickly do it. I wanted to take my time with it. Just because the movie has good non-stop action scenes doesn't make it, a well-made movie. Good films works, because they allow, some screen time, for the audience members to rest and take in, what they just saw. It also allow the plot to develop, through a well-timed story structure. This film doesn't have that, due to the extreme frenetic paced. It's a series of action set pieces, barely connected with each other, by a small thread. Because of that, this movie's plot carry, little emotional weight or depth. I wish I can forgive this film, for a lot of the flaws with the film's plot, but, there are a couple of dangling plot-holes that I'm can't ignored. A good example is why does Akan has psychic powers? Another is why are his super soldiers are not avatar clones like Jimmy? Even the twist toward the end, doesn't make sense if you think, deep about it. While, I didn't have a problem with the over the top gory violence &amp; outlandish humor. I do see it, being somewhat of a problem. There is nothing sophistical with the story. It felt like mindless violence for violence sakes. Still, I did somewhat enjoy the variety of ways, Henry murder people. Some people felt this is the closest we'll get to a third Crank film. With that, it's also an endurance test for the stomach and the brain. All of the shaking cam mixed with frenetic style of video editing makes this movie, nauseating to watch. It can make you, vomit, if you're not ready for it. It felt like a roller-coaster that went too long. It was too fast-paced, to understand what is all, happening in the screen. Some of the scenes were really jarring, due to the amount of grainy blurs of the film's exposure. A good example of this, was any of the parkour, or car chase stunts. I still don't know, how Henry honestly escape out of some of the places like the brothel. The shutter speed combined with panning the camera really makes it, hard to see. Then, there was the awkward, non-hidden cuts that somewhat ruins the idea of first-person perspective. It was weird to see, Henry jump from place to place, having little to no clue, how he got there. Despite that, the acting in this movie was meh. Henry is somewhat bland, since, he barely a character. The love-interest is somewhat wasted and the villain was a bit over the top and hammy. In the end, Copley, by far is the best. He kinda shine, playing several characters with different personas and accents. The others, were nothing too special. Overall: This film has generally evoked mixed feelings from me. It's not the worst video game style movie, I seem, however, it's not the best. Honestly, if you like first person shooters games or watching them, then you'll probably love this movie, but if you want to play them with strong story depth, character development, and great dialogue, then stay away from films like this. You will not have much fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hardcore Henry" is wild to its core - and ushers in a new action sub-genre: Perpetual POV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After over 100 years of feature filmmaking, and with hundreds produced in the U.S. every year (and thousands worldwide), it's not easy to invent a new subgenre. Yet sometimes people still do it ? with the help of technology or simply a very original idea ? and with at least some influence from filmmakers who have gone before. For example, experts trace the "found footage" filmmaking format to the early 1980s, but it was the originality of "The Blair Witch Project" in 1999 which made found footage into a viable horror sub-genre. Russian rock musician and music video producer Ilya Naishuller wrote and directed 2016's "Hardcore Henry" (R, 1:36), creating a new action sub-genre. You could call it "perpetual POV".The entire film is shot as seen through Henry's eyes. After a short scene portraying a memory from his childhood, we see him wake up in a lab, missing most of his left leg and arm, unable to speak and with almost no memory. A beautiful woman named Estelle (Haley Bennett) reassures him, as she attaches robotic appendages in place of what Henry is missing. She explains that she's his wife, that he's been in a terrible accident and her work (of which he had voiced disapproval) is now what's putting him back together. She takes him into the next room and her assistants are just about to install a computerized voice box when a colorful and violent villain called Akan (Danila Kozlovsky) breaks in and starts killing people, but has something bigger in mind. (Think Samuel L. Jackson's Jules Winnfield from "Pulp Fiction" meets Heath Ledger's Joker from "The Dark Knight".) Henry doesn't know who he is, where he is, how he got there or what's happening, but it's clear he has to get away from this maniac ? and save Estelle.Henry may not have much of a memory (or even the ability to shout vulgarities or threats at his enemies), but he does seem to have a particularly impressive set of skills ? and a remarkable lack of fear. He helps Estelle escape from the lab complex (in a very unusual location), fights off more bad guys, gets thrown off a bridge, somehow survives and is saved by a cop named Jimmy (Sharlto Copley). And the movie is just getting started! Henry is helped by a series of colorful characters (all played by Copley) as Akan (who also some impressive skills ? including telekinesis) and his henchmen continue to pursue Henry and try to kill him with knives, guns, flamethrowers? and heavier weaponry. Henry doesn't have time to think about why all these guys in the black vans with the red "Akan Inc." logo want him dead because he's just trying to survive ? and that means a lot of fighting and a lot of running ? through the city of Moscow, through the woods, through a brothel, etc. The whole time, we see exactly what Henry sees, in all its action-packed, over-the-top glory. Unfortunately, it's difficult to adequately describe a movie as groundbreaking as this one, but maybe the next paragraph will help.As original as his film is, Naishuller and "Hardcore Henry" definitely stand on the shoulders of others. To start with, it's the GoPro-type of wearable camera technology that makes this film possible, and almost all of it was shot with the GoPro HERO3 Black. Earlier music videos that Naishuller produced for his band "Biting Elbows" inspired this, his first feature. It could also be said that the film's distant cousins include both the found footage horror sub-genre and modern first-person player video games. In fact, the video game "Payday 2" engaged in a cross-promotion with this film. As for still other cinematic influences, "Hardcore Henry" has led some to favorably compare Naishuller to Quentin Tarantino, and the movie itself calls to mind several others. At various moments, "Hardcore Henry" may make a Movie Fan think of "Robocop", "I, Robot", "The Bourne Identity", "Crank", "Shoot 'Em Up", "Deadpool" or the "Fast and Furious" films. That's not to imply that "Hardcore Henry" copies those others, just that referencing them makes this one easier to describe. The point is, if you like those movies, you'll probably like this one."Hardcore Henry" is wild and crazy to its core. Going in, I was skeptical of the movie's ability to maintain the single POV conceit for its entire running time and still be entertaining. I needn't have worried. The action is easier to follow than I expected and Naishuller is smart enough to let the movie breathe, rather than let Movie Fans feel like they're in a 96-minute free fall. The cinematography is impressive and the set pieces are original and fun, but it's the actors who sell it. Copley shows impressive range in his many characters and makes them interesting to watch. Kozlovsky is underused, but pitch-perfect in all his creepy mania, while Bennett's performance is a bit shallow, but serviceable. The villains are consistently menacing, but almost universally one-dimensional. Of course, there's not much time for character development when your first moment on screen is your last? which brings me to my main criticism. The movie's premise and style are original enough that it didn't need such a high body count or so much graphic violence to be entertaining. Yet, if the film's biggest sin is? overkill, then successfully launching the "perpetual POV" sub-genre makes it worthwhile, especially for the action movie-minded. "B+"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardcore Indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was the best video game I never played.going into it, I was very unsure about this new concept of making a movie that looks and feels like a first person shooter, which was exactly what happen. I thought I would end up disliking the movie because the trailer made it seem like something I would love to play not just watch.But Hardcore Henry was extremely enjoyable. It's like the movie Crank with Jason Statham, but this movie runs at eleven.Henry is a dude who wakes up in a lab more machine than man, and when the lab gets attacked by a villain with cool telekinetic powers, Henry is forced into a quest to save his wife from the bad guys (in total video game fashion) with his only aid being Jimmy, played brilliantly by Sharlto Copley, who basically gives him missions to go on as Henry levels up.The whole thing was conceptualized brilliantly. It was a basic action movie story which allowed the filmmakers to revolutionize the film going experience. You were right there as Henry, man.All of the action scenes were absolutely amazing. There was this one on foot chase scene as Henry chases a Final boss type through a Russian city that was pure thrilling excitement.The fight scenes were kick ass. that's hard to do when you can't see what the protagonist is doing but Henry made it work.The movie moves slick and fast. A lot of critic will call a movie a thrill ride, but Hardcore Henry truly is</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nonstop action movie intent on redefining the use of the adjective "nonstop" to describe action movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hardcore Henry" may function fundamentally on an outright gimmick, but, as with most gimmicks, the first time around it's still a novelty. Therefore, it exudes a freshness and a level of amusement that other projects have not yet had the opportunity to destroy by dragging the technique into exhaustion. Fortunately, the filmmakers here (led by writer/director Ilya Naishuller) were also wise enough to include far more material and creativity than could have been expected from the very first movie shot entirely in the first-person perspective.Henry awakens in a robotics workshop with no memory of who he is or how he got there. A young scientist appears and identifies herself as Estelle (Haley Bennett), explaining that she is Henry's wife. After outfitting the groggy man with a cybernetic hand and foot, Estelle informs Henry that she loves him and will assist in his recovery. When the lab is attacked by maniacal competitor Akan (Danila Kozlovsky), Henry and Estelle narrowly escape, only to be apprehended shortly after by an arsenal of the madman's mercenaries. Henry manages to flee with the aid of a churlish hooligan calling himself "Uncle Jimmy" (Sharlto Copley), paving the way for the two to devise a plot to recharge Henry's faltering cyborg implants and rescue Estelle from Akan's diabolical clutches.From the opening credits sequence, featuring a slow-motion brick to the head, knife to the throat, and bullet to the eye (a 21st century take, perhaps, on the eyeball-slicing affront of "Un chien andalou"), it's clear that "Hardcore Henry" will honor its title ardently. What is not as apparent is the effect of the camera-work, which tries to ease the audience into the dizzying frenzy of the unique viewpoint soon to be experienced. Once it takes hold, however, the look crisscrosses from nauseating to disorienting to downright confusing - and altogether singular.There are essentially no slow points; this is a nonstop action movie intent on redefining the use of the adjective "nonstop" to describe action movies. But instead of embracing the breakneck pacing and the relentless violence alone, the film recognizes another powerful additive: humor. Transcending the mere innovation of the main photographing method, "Hardcore Henry" generates plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. Many are due to the extremeness of the bloodshed, but a large amount can be attributed to Copley, who provides comic relief in his dialogue as well as in his character's actions, which are far more inspired than anyone might have guessed. There's a twisted genius at work in the screenplay, shaping the boilerplate elements of shoot-'em-up video games into wholly cinematic hilariousness.It's impossible not to make a comparison to first-person stealth/shooter video games and the story lines and components that frequent them - especially with the sexy scientist in a short skirt and lab coat, the heavy sci-fi themes that aren't usually found anywhere but in "Metal Gear Solid"-type actioners, the behind-the-scenes agent always ready to govern (through voice-over) the next mission, the shift in music to initiate a fight sequence, or the continual upgrading of weapons to fend off waves of enemy troops. The irony here is that, while video games attempt more and more to emulate movies (through music, scripts, voice actors, opening and closing credits, graphics, and general realism, to name a few), this movie can't help but look and feel like someone else is playing a video game while viewers sit back and watch. But the entertainment level is extraordinarily high, injecting a bit of everything from both the video game world and the action movie world, with outrageous stunts (and/or computer graphics, considering the approximately eight stunt people credited for "Hardcore Henry," versus the 150 for "Mad Max: Fury Road," to which a likening can be drawn based on unexpected inventiveness) and camera-work, for which the choreography and logistics are utterly mind-boggling. "Hardcore Henry" possesses a distinct, alternately facetious and clever attitude (reminiscent at times of the "Crank" movies) that hasn't been seen in quite a while. The shame is that, if it's successful at the box office, the first-person device might be repeated until the brilliance of this initial use is all but forgotten.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i watch a movie, there has to be something in it to make me keep watching. That stands true for the most of us. This one, however, fails miserably on every level. There was no great story-line to keep me interested. The action was just plain boring, nothing special, except a few mediocre shots here and there. Some viewers like the gore or the blood, this one did not have anything creative in that department either (we have already seen heads exploding and people maimed plenty of times). A 2 hour autopsy would be more interesting than this garbage. The screenplay was virtually non existent and the dialogue annoying. I'm not even going to comment on the acting because no one goes to watch a movie called Hardcore Henry for the acting. The sound was also annoying most of the time. I couldn't make past the 35 min mark, and that too tested a lot of my patience. Not that i have low patience, i love watching a lot of art house cinema and also a lot of bloody and gory films as well, this was just crap. 1st star for the effort to make a film from a first person view. 2nd star, well just because i feel generous.</fullReview>

Maybe only those that liked it wanted to review it.

The difference being you might care about a character in a poor slasher movie.If you are one to spend hours on end playing FPS games, you might enjoy this. No wonder it had a short stay at the theaters.By the ratings here, those likely to have bothered seeing it (few in number by the short viewing) really liked it.

		<shortDescription>An amalgam of every first-person YouTube skit you've ever seen, albeit on a chunky budget.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amalgam of every first-person YouTube skit you've ever seen, albeit on a chunky budget. Hardcore Henry is helped by its impressive physicality and unique perspective, but hindered by its juvenile humour, over the top bloodshed and child-like writing. In true video game fashion, Henry is mute; the silent protagonist shtick grows old, fast - most of the slack is picked up by a plucky British side piece providing occasional comic relief. A hyperactive electronic soundtrack, with some periodic licensed tangents, accompanies a string of loosely related scenes and set pieces littered with abrupt jump cuts. Later scenes, and particularly fight scenes, quickly become cluttered and difficult to follow - not to mention nausea inducing for those that may suffer from motion sickness.You want gore? It's in. Female nudity? In. Lavatorial humour? Hardcore Henry decides early on that homosexuality is a pejorative; even the evil villain kisses men! Set in Moscow, the Slavic influence runs deep - it feels cheap, and not just because it looks like it has been shot on a GoPro.In summary: 15 year-old me would've had a hoot - and this isn't to say I didn't have fun. On the whole, production values are relatively high throughout and, at times, it can even feel fresh - some moments even made me question, how did they do this? (Especially in the Parkour scenes.) Having said that and on balance this film hasn't supplanted its internet hobbyist origins and for that it pays the price. Fancy a 90 minutes of a fairly brainless gimmick? This might be for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Hardcore Henry was announced for a release I was overly excited to check it out. I am all about pushing the boundaries of filmaking and finding new and original ways to tell a story, so of course this fit perfectly for me. There is always something really exciting to me about seeing new ways in which filmmakers go crazy with imagination and find new places to put that camera or enhance the frame. Whilst Hardcore Henry can certainly boast a remarkable technical achievement, it doesn't end up being the quality film I wished for.There is no question on the triumph of the first person shot on the practical side. It flows perfectly, it rarely ever gets bothering or sickening and even better, you can always tell what is going on for the most part. Thanks also to a brilliant sound design, which is just as vital as the camera work in making the ordeal successful, you definitely get to feel deeply immersed in some points of the film. Especially early on there is a sky sequence that was breathtaking, you really got a sense of vertigo there and the adrenaline that it induced was exhilarating. There are repeated sequences of this and they are all, for my money, the best part of the film. Making this look so good on such a tight budget must have been a real challenge and the filmmakers deserve praise for their technical abilities.The action too is just as impressive. Its storytelling heft will be discussed later, but on a pure technical level it is balls to the wall, batsh*t crazy stuff that will most certainly shock even the toughest viewers. The stunt team does a magnificent job, there clearly isn't too much CGI involved and wherever it is, it is masked brilliantly; there were just a couple of explosions that felt like it, for the rest it was seamless. You felt every shot and punch as if you were there. As I said the violence might be a little too much for some people, it did not bother me and it was definitely an integral part of the distinctive tone and style of the film. That is something it nails through, without having any bothering shifts in it. Its classic violence + dark humor combination, brought to what might be a very extreme but coherent level.Moreover, I have to say that I have not been a fan of Sharlto Copley's acting in the past, but I found nothing to lament here. On the contrary he ends up being the best part of the film. His character must have been a real challenge to pull off and Copley rises to it, brining to life a performance that is as funny as it is crazy.Where this whole movie collapses is in its story and plot. It is really poor. The first person shot unfortunately becomes a gimmick after the first twenty minutes or so and you don't recover from that ever again. I was talking about storytelling and action before, what starts out as a film with integral and thrilling action slowly escalates to a style over substance extravaganza, that being clearly due to absolutely no story or connection picking up. Other than the fact that the plot is as unsubstantial as an action movie plot can get, the characters' motivations are incredibly under-looked and after a good opening you are just left with a less and less interesting movie.I think the focus was just too much on the gimmick and the filmmakers lost the story on the way, ending up with a film that manages to impress for sure, but does not leave the viewer with any satisfaction. I am sure excited to see where Ilya Naishuller goes next, because he clearly has talent, but I don't think I'll ever check this one again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't written a review on IMDb in years, but this was the best movie experience I've had in ages - I was screaming and laughing the entire time. While it's exactly in the format of a video game - a specific goal or "level", a "Boss" to kill to overcome the level, and a main "boss" to ultimately reach, but that's where the similarities end. I wish video games were like this, I wouldn't find them so boring then. The writing is smart and surprising at every turn, there's twists and jokes and a range of scenes, and the ending is everything I was hoping for and more. While there are a ton of special effects that look fantastic, there are also no shortage of real stunts and amazing daring acts that people clearly were really doing with a go-pro strapped to their head. Doing the parkour and running across the top of bridges would look staged and safe filmed traditionally, but being the guy doing it was a different level of suspension of disbelief.GO SEE THIS IN THE THEATERS!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardcore Henry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some years ago, the video-clip Bad Motherf****r, from the group Biting Elbows, earned viral fame due to the frantic first-person perspective which made the action of video-games such as Mirror's Edge and Call of Duty reality. And now, Ilya Naishuller, the director of that video, took the concept to the big screen with an ambitious film which, despite its unavoidable narrative limitations, offers enough visual innovation to bring something different to Hollywood formulas. For better or for worse, Hardcore Henry is as deep as the video-games it imitates. The screenplay is generic but functional, justifying the furious avalanche of violence, and slowing down every once in a while in order to add another piece to the narrative puzzle. But, like it happens with many video-games, the story progresses by jumps and jostle, and it's more interested in finding "cool" scenes than establishing a solid dramatic endorsement to the unconscionable action. Besides, the first-person technique gets a bit monotonous occasionally, and the screenplay is stretched too much without finding a concrete theme. Sure, the film never stops, but it never gets particularly compelling, despite incorporating some unusual science fiction concepts which extend the premise without making it too improbable. However, the film improves during the third act, when the film focuses on the great Sharlto Copley, who plays... "Jimmy". I'm not even going to try to describe that character; I will just say that Copley's performance adds all the charisma and humanity that the mute Henry is incapable of transmitting. I think that, independently from its pros and cons, Hardcore Henry would be an interesting case of analysis in film schools, because it highlights the consequences of employing an anonymous and empty main character. In the video-games, that works because we project the hero's "personality"; but in this film, there isn't such identification, and that reduces the emotional impact of everything we watch on the screen. Oh, and speaking of emotions, I didn't like the inconsistent use of songs as the accompaniment of many action scenes either. I know that all the movies do the same, but in Hardcore Henry, it feels... I don't know... weak and badly implemented (exception: Don't Stop Me Now, by Queen). In conclusion, Harcore Henry deserves a moderate recommendation because of Copley's performance, its technical virtuosism and the complex choreographs required by the first-person format. And even though it didn't leave me completely satisfied, I respect the existence of something which is simultaneously so frivolous and experimental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You Surrender To The Madness, Hardcore Henry Can Be A Lot Of Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I probably wouldn't have known about this movie if I hadn't kept up to date with what in theatres on a weekly basis. If you're a fan of action movies, it's hard not to be interested about the concept. You usually get first person action from video games but to see it in a feature film could be cool. A lot of great video games feel like they are interactive movies (If you're looking for something like that, check out Heavy Rain) so watching what looked like an extra gritty and violent first-person-shooter caught my eye. What I was going to get though was a completely deranged action movie that was flawed but featured some really standout bits.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After a really violent opening credit scene beginning with Henry as a kid (Tim Roth has a really brief cameo as Henry's father), we then go to a separate place where people are shot, explode and are stabbed up close. We are then transported into Henry. He wakes up from some kind of stasis and he is not well. He's missing an arm and leg and his eyes, all of which have been replaced by cybernetic parts. The woman helping attach these parts and run tests on them introduces herself as Estelle (Haley Bennett). She tells Henry that he has been reanimated and that it will take time to get used to his new limbs. She also tells him that she is his wife and that they were very much in love.When they are trying to re-calibrate his voice, in bursts a strike team killing the other scientists present. An albino super human leads them named Akan (Danila Kozlovsky). He is after the technology that has been put into Henry. Before that happens, Estelle and Henry escape into the vents and get out of the laboratory which happens to be on an airplane. They take an escape pod but when they get to ground level, Estelle is taken by this mysterious force. Henry tries to fight for her but he's beaten pretty quickly. After a firefight, a man named Jimmy (Sharlto Copley) shows up claiming he can help him get his wife back.What you need to know going into Hardcore Henry is that it is like the most crazy and blood soaked video game to come along in some time. Very little of the action is realistic or believable. Someone drops a grenade into an SUV via the sunroof, the vehicle explodes and the person uses the residual blast to land on a motorcycle riding behind it. That's just the first thing that comes to mind too. People fall off buildings with barely a scratch, all you need is a couple of shots of adrenaline and you're back in the game. That's either going to sound awesome to you or you're cringing already. I found some of the action to be really cool and even funny. But it can be hard to follow with all the quick motion and it was even a little nauseating at times. It jumped back and forth between cool and irritating throughout the movie, I would describe it as a mixed bag.As much as this movie was a trip, there were some things that annoyed me. There's very little background on Akan or his organization other than the continual speeches in his many brief appearances (where did he get the super powers from? I don't think it was even mentioned in passing). The plot is very simple in it being a man on a mission (it has funny subplots and supporting characters to fill in but the broad outline is just that). I also thought the twist at the end was kind of unnecessary. It's not the fault of the actors it didn't sell, to me it felt just kinda tossed in after the fact. The action scene at the end also follows the typical action movie clich where these people who are these unbeatable henchmen at the start of the film are just mowed down by Henry at the end.I've mentioned a bunch of complaints but this movie has one awesome thing going for it. Sharlto Copley is super funny as Jimmy. I was crying at points because I was laughing so hard. He plays several characters all named Jimmy (I don't want to spoil how). These guys are completely different from one another and Sharlto is hilarious as every single one of them. Sharlto is a multi-talented actor, shining in dramatic roles (District 9) and comedic ones alike (he's also great in the A-Team Movie). Even though Hardcore Henry is going to be gone quickly, other than the action, he's what makes this movie worth watching. I liked the other actors but Danila lays it on a little thick and Hayley isn't in the movie very long.I saw this movie with a couple of friends, one of them hated it with a passion and the other was more or less indifferent towards it. I can't argue it's an excellent film, it's pretty reliant on the first person gimmick and outside of the action and a great comedic turn from Sharlto, there's not a lot otherwise. But I had a good time either way even though I think it's best watched with low expectations, probably in the comfort of your own home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shot almost entirely with a Go Pro camera, Hardcore Henry has been named as the first action movie to be filmed from a first person perspective. The viewpoint we get is that of our title hero, and yes Henry is indeed hardcore. Henry is an impressive fighting and shooting machine thanks to his robotic improvements. The film is without doubt reminiscent of FPS video games such as Call of Duty, and is also similarly stylised from the likes of Grand Theft Auto, especially with its level of brutality.Why has this film been given an 18 certificate? Cue a slow motion shot of a knife going all the way through someone's neck. That's why, and that was just the opening credits! From start to finish, Hardcore Henry is without a doubt a nonstop, over-the-top, hyper- violent hour and a half. If that sounds like your cup of tea, then you will surely get a high caffeine kick out of this film. I just happen to like more depth in my action films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilarious and violent extravaganza. (No spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin I like many reviews here need to clarify what this film is so you are not mistaken. This film is exactly what the trailers show, a shaky, violent and very motion jarring film. The trailers aren't just exaggerated it is how the movie was actually filmed, by literally strapping a camera mount to a stunt actors face. Being a avid movie-goer and gamer I had no problems with the fast motion nature BUT I have heard it does give people motion sickness and headaches so make sure before you watch!Now the actual review can begin, where on Earth to start? This film goes from 0 up to 11 pretty fast, it doesn't gradually introduce violence and motion filled action, it does it pretty immediately. As for the films story it is as advertised, a clich and cheesy damsel in distress type deal so if you are going for the story aspect of the film which I myself usually fixate on, you will probably be disappointed.If you are going for the action on the other hand, and don't mind up close and personal footage then this was an absolute blast of a film. I am a big fan of violence whether done realistically or as this film does on occasion, hilariously like getting minced up by a fan or even seeing someone's balls being crushed (which even made me wince). Every punch, shot or stab feels gritty and real and the majority of effects and stunts are REAL. I was surprised by Russia's movie health and safety laws because some of the stunts are spectacular and highly dangerous so respect to their stunt men and women.Ilya Naishuller (the director) has a great eye for what makes an action sequence so great, whether it is actually seeing our hero reloading or having explosions and debris thrown all over the place. Combined with very clever editing/transitions in a lot of scenes and you get to experience Henry's story exactly from where he is seeing it.As to the cast of the film, it is a foreign film so for a lot of us it will be the first time seeing a lot of these actors but there are some big names like Tim Roth and the absolutely amazing Sharlto Copley who did as always a brilliant job at bringing his character to life. This film wouldn't have been the same without him, he put such great character and humour into his role and definitely made the movie even more enjoyable.(Non-story spoiler!) Watching Sharlto Copley perform a musical by himself has to be the greatest thing I've ever seen in a movie.The reason I've only given an 8/10 is primarily because in some scenes and situations it is hard for even a gamer like me to properly see what is going on because it's so fast and motiony, and this is to be expected by filming the way it was filmed. Also some action sequences had some odd cuts whether it was for pacing sake or to meet the theatrical time which I hope get put back in for the DVD release.A VERY enjoyable movie that had me and my friends laughing and cheering all the way through! Hat's off to you Ilya Naishuller you made Hardcore Henry everything I hoped it would be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Watching Someone Play a Video Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Hardcore Henry", starring Sharlto Copley-Maleficent, District 9; Haley Bennett-The Equalizer, Marley &amp; Me; Danila Kozlovsky-Vampire Academy, Target and Tim Roth-The Hateful Eight, The Incredible Hulk.This is an action movie, with enfaces on the action part. It is also filmed in Moscow and shot entirely from the title character's point of view. It is almost as if you are watching someone play a video game for the entire movie. The opening credits is chocked full of people being shot, stabbed or blown up, some in pretty gruesome ways. This is not a movie to take the little kiddies to see, and I saw several people with little ones in hand. Anyway, the Henry character-no actor was listed as playing Henry, since it is shown from his view point-wakes up in a vat of liquid and Haley is telling him that she is his wife. He is a cyborg- you can tell because Haley is attaching an arm &amp; a leg to his body as she is talking to him-and Haley tells him that Danila is on his way there because he wants Henry for a super-soldier program. Haley helps Henry to escape and then things kick into high gear. It seems like everyone wants Henry-dead or alive-including Sharlto, who pops up and helps Henry on several occasions. Oh yeah, Sharlto is killed more than once through out the movie but there is a logical explanation given- Remember the old T.H.U.N.D.E.R comics by Wally Wood? There was a character in them that did the same thing that Sharlto does here. Danila has some type of telekinetic powers but it is never explained as to how he got them-mutant maybe? Tim plays Henry's father. I myself do not care for the shaky camera point of view shooting-Think 'Blair Witch' on steroids- but if you are a video gamer, you may like it more than I did. It's rated "R" for bloody violence, drug use and sexual content- including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 36 minutes. I liked it enough that I would buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hardcore Movie That Feels Like A FPS Video Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always say I'm looking for something new to come to the theaters, something to spice up the pot when Hollywood cooks with mediocre materials. Today I got a chance to see that spice in the movie titled HARDCORE HENRY, a movie that looks to be an amped up action thriller for the modern times. But when testing new waters, one never knows what they will get in the movie. Hi Robbie K coming at you with another review and hopefully giving some insight into the film. Let's get started. For those who haven't seen the trailer, the entire movie takes place in the first person perspective. Now this concept isn't that new to gamers who play FPS titles (Halo, Doom, Call of Duty), but for those who don't visit that land the movie is indeed a new experience. Nearly the entire 96 minutes is high adrenaline action that takes place on multiple fronts and brings you face on with the army of nameless extras. Parts of the film were really good to have in this perspectives, but other times?well the camera work got a little too chaotic for me. Seeing the camera go into convulsions and spins got annoying at times especially when it transitioned into bouts of dizzying spins and twists. Those who get motion sickness or dizzy from erratic camera work are going to want to stay away from this one (in case you haven't guessed). Despite these dizzying moments though, the camera still gives you all the glorious detail of the action in this movie. Speaking of which?Hardcore Henry is another one of those high octane, special effect heavy thrillers that throws every punch it can take. Guns, punches, grenades, even swords are all in this movie as Henry crosses all avenues of Russia to accomplish his vague goals. Many of the scenes are, as I stated earlier, homage to FPS video games including some of the more convenient aspects of video games like finding a random gun on the street or firing a ridiculously powerful weapon. Other times the action feels like one of those 3-D motion theme park rides where Henry is running or riding through some fast paced chase. Even the fist fights brought some thrills to the screen, though these moments sometimes got a bit too intense at times to really enjoy. While the visuals certainly brought the excitement, it was the incredible soundtrack that brought the edge it needed. All types of musical genres made their mark, each one fitting the adventure perfectly to mirror the emotions of the moment (and yes much of it was metal rock to go with anger). But with action there often comes violence and Hardcore Henry does not shy away from that aspect one bit. This movie is certainly deserving of the R rating, the opening credits along paying homage to graphic kills and torture you are about to see. You should expect lots of artificial blood to paint the screen as heads explode, knives penetrate, and characters erupt in geysers of red. Those who love that stuff will worship this movie, but for me the excessiveness got stale after a while. I can't give you too many details without providing spoilers, but those who can't stand dismemberment need to think this one through before paying the hefty ticket price. Outside of gore and violence, Henry's adventure also has strong language, a sea of female genitalia references, and plenty of nudity to go around. Now if you haven't guessed yet from this review, Hardcore Henry is indeed a ridiculous movie (which you hopefully picked up from the trailer). So I can't necessarily dock points off its score for that. However, I can still pick at some things of that ridiculousness that I didn't enjoy. For one thing the story was very simple and quite stupid at times. It took me a while to understand what the whole purpose of the fighting was and just what Henry's role in all of this was. In addition the main bad guy Akan (Danila Kozlovsky) was left unexplained and was more annoying than respectful. Some parts of Henry's quest were from left field, with only a small, small line of relevance to tether it to the story. Some of these parts, while certainly thrilling, could have been edited out because there was little points to them other than let's just bring more action. Fortunately, the ridiculous did bring lots of humor to the movie, having me laughing or chuckling at times with some of the crazy stuff Jimmy (Sharlto Copley) did. In addition they added some clever moments to the film that poked fun at Hollywood that brought extra laughs and relieved the intensity. Henry's own ridiculous moves earned a chuckle or too from me, especially when they jabbed at how ridiculous games can be sometimes. To sum it all up, Hardcore Henry is indeed a movie that represents its name. It is a sheer adrenaline rush that action junkies will drink up and find very little fault in. This film certainly is one of the more exciting films, with over the top stunts, fantastic special effects, and a killer soundtrack that is used well. However, the over the top violence, bathing the screen in gore, and the stupid vague plot are aspects I just didn't get. Once again the camera work was pretty decent for me, but certainly expect some erratic moments to occur that could spur up some nausea. Fans of Crank, the Expendables, or Death Race are target audiences for this movie, and aside from the special effects I can't recommend this one for a theater visit for most. My scores: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely do film reviews but I feel compelled to write something about "Hardcore Henry" as it's definitely going to split people down the middle, very much a "Marmite" film - you will love it, or hate it. Well I loved it, my friend loved it... yet to my surprise someone did walk out (to the toilet I thought!) and didn't come back. Whether or not this was motion sickness (didn't affect me), the level of violence and gore or maybe they were expecting something completely different? I don't know... I knew what I was going in there for and it certainly didn't disappoint. From the opening credits which really do set the tone for the rest of the movie, to the moment you realize how tightly you're holding onto the armrests and you finally let out a full breath, look at your friend and say "what... the...hell did I just watch?" This is a film for the hardened movie goer and you have to go into it with a completely open mind and remember that it's not going to be getting an Oscar any time soon. The film grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go from start to finish. If you love violent video games then you will enjoy this even more and I really can't say much without giving away any spoilers but the pace is perfect and I think the run-time fits this well. I love the character of "Jimmy" (Sharlto Copley), his acting is superb and every scene with him adds a completely new element to the film and he is also hilarious. I was really impressed with how good the action scenes were considering what they had to work with and some parts were so "real" I have no idea how they did it. It HAD to be over the top to give it a comic element as some parts made me chuckle so much with my hand covering my mouth in awe of what the hell I just witnessed. Its a violent, funny and completely over the top action film that sets a completely new standard and is unlike anything I have seen before. After watching the film I could only compare the violence and gore to one other film - Braindead (Peter Jackson).Don't think about it, just go and see it! I give it a solid 8/10 as it was the best time I have had in the cinema since Deadpool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all - for all of those who were looking for some high quality, thrilling, teeth grinding plot - SERIOUSLY?! No one ever said that this movie will be a best ever, it was always announced as something new and different... and boy, it's different. Hardcore Henry brings an all new perspective to adrenaline rushed action genre. Sure, it has its issues and it's not all that good, but in general it is really fun and I would highly recommend it to everyone who's not seeking for some so called masterpiece.It's magnificently different, thrilling, gory and incredibly fun - a refresher compared to various failed action movies. It has everything you would ever expect and look for from a First Person Shooter, it doesn't matter whether it's a movie or a game - which I would buy and play if they ever made it, by the way. Good job to anyone involved in creating this amazing movie. It's a 10 for me and I would like to see a sequel, even if it's not likely due to unfortunate fail at the box office.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you saw the trailer for Hardcore Henry, your reaction was most likely "Oh Hell no," and, indeed, you're going to hate this movie. If your reaction was more like mine, i.e., "eh, that sounds kind of interesting" you might enjoy yourself. This gimmicky action flick is shot entirely in first person, the camera inhabiting the brain of a RoboCopped dude named Henry. Stuff happens, people are after him, and a lot of people get shot. It's all very video game inspired and the plot is both incoherent and nonsensical, but it delivers in the goofy, visceral action department. Sharlto Copley is the most recognizable actor - he pops up constantly and gets horribly killed a number of times. Tim Roth appears a couple of times in flashbacks. Jennifer Lawrence's body double Haley Bennett plays Henry's scientist wife and Danila Kozlovsky has a lot of fun hamming it up as the albino villain. I enjoyed myself. If you think you might, you might want to see it on the big screen. I don't think it would work at all on TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hardcore Henry trailer promises a new cinematic experience; something to be experienced; best action movie you'll ever see." While the movie did offer some fun in those areas, there is nothing new here. My biggest concern going in was that the first person camera would wreck the movie and give me a headache. Not to worry! The way this was filmed did indeed put you into the action in such a way that kept you looking at the screen instead of away from it. Let's just cut to the core: The story is a typical, predictable action plot. The characters bring nothing exceptional to the screen. The main villain has some amazing powers that you are forced to accept because they are never explained. The best parts of this movie are the action/gore scenes. So over the top that it was often fun. With that being said: If you like stupid, over the top action movies, you'll like this - but save a few bucks and go to the matine, or better yet, play a good video game on an HD TV. For everyone else, stay home and watch the first Die Hard for you fill of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Not a First-Shooter Game, It's a Trip to the ER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever seen anything like this? I sure haven't. A movie all shot through the perspective of the main character? How original! This looks like the one quality piece of art cinema that mainstream audiences have been waiting for! Oh, nope. Looks like I was wrong. This is just another sick attempt from a man-child to create a first-shooter game on screen that matches Kill Bill with its level of decapitating gore. It may not be a necessarily bad thing but let me tell you, for this specific circumstance, it most definitely is. &#x200b; It may appear from the trailer like Hardcore Henry would become a phenomenal action movie that will leave an impression for once, and it may still seem like that after the red-tinted opening credits of slow-motion bullet and knife imagery. It may even then still feel promising as you are put into Henry's perspective as he wakes up in a bed encased with liquid. Right from there, you look up to see an attractive lady saying that she is your wife even though you remember nothing. She proceeds to place robot limbs in place of your lost arms and legs. Much like your player in any video game, Henry cannot speak. Still sounds intriguing? Think again. From there, it stoops into a predictable science fiction plot even by the standards of some teenager's overnight fan-fiction: the corporation that resurrected Henry plans to create an army of cybersoldiers for, you guessed it, world domination.The director responsible for this, Ilya Naishuller, had already directed a highly similar five-minute project, a music video that received 32 million YouTube hits called, "Bad Motherf*****." It composes of exactly what it sounds like, a first-person perspective of a man killing anyone who gets in his way. From there, Naishuller felt like creating Hardcore Henry as a love letter to music, film, and video games, mixed with campy elements to prove how he can be a serious filmmaker. Did he succeed?Well, let's take a look at the way the first-person feel was created. The camera operators would wear GoPros on their foreheads to stimulate that perspective, an effect that is impossible to look past and even harder to watch without nitpicking what was done wrong. I don't often play first-person shooter games, but I can still appreciate this gimmick if it's done right. There are still edit cuts to make this feel like a traditional movie, so that feel of entering the protagonist's mind is nonexistent. Also considering the fish-eye lens that this was shot on, all I felt while watching this was nausea, motion sickness, weakness in my legs, and I was almost certain I was going to vomit at some point. I seriously thought about walking out of the theater?it was terrible. Since I am not the one controlling the actions of my character or mentally moving along with the screen, I did not feel like the initiator of the action, but the victim. It's also less impressive when you even consider at all that GoPros were used to achieve this, something that literally anybody could have done on a Saturday afternoon.On top of that, the action is simply not well choreographed. All the best stunts are done by Henry himself, and they would have made awesome spectacles if we could see them. While there were some that proved effective, such as when we're looking down, falling, chasing someone on top of a bridge, or tracking bad guys with a gun, most of the action just all felt the same, carrying the same energy throughout that the climax alone should've delivered.The acting didn't help either in making me want to care about this practically nonexistent story. The Equalizer's Haley Bennett plays Henry's wife Estelle, and she is as boring, monotonous, and unchanging as you'd think any love interest in a movie like this one would be. Danila Kozlovsky plays the main villain of this movie, and he doesn't even try, making the already bleak yellow-eyed baddie even more forgettable. The only interesting character is Henry's supervisor, Jimmy, who Sharlto Copley (District 9, Elysium) actually puts some real effort into. It's not enough to make the film as a whole any more bearable, though.I don't recall a single movie inspired by the video game epidemic that has ever passed as high quality art while teaching good morals. Especially with the Warcraft movie coming up, I don't see this unhealthy attachment leaving the screen anytime soon. The problem with turning video games into movies, or trying to make movies feel like video games, is that they lose that sense of immersive control that you feel when you're behind the controller. But really, after judging the way Hardcore Henry flaunts action merely for the sake of it, these video game movies, and first-shooter games in general, are hurting our sense of morality and art. Please take a look at the works of Kathryn Bigelow or Martin Scorsese to see movie violence done properly. To see the first-person perspective done right, look at the works of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. These artists know how to put a message into their gritty nature, throwing gimmicky products of fanboy angst like this one into the dark.Overall Grade: F+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Video games don't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another movie, unsuccessfully adapted from a video game, from a POV that just doesn't work, and just comes off stupid. I'm not really going into the plot, that involves a soon to be guinea pig of a robot, Henry a wuzz, which in the first scene, where as a kid, we see by example, the next having Henry's father, (Roth, who from his stand, a his half low body low shot, I made the actor straight away) giving his son a beneficial talk, about taking it lying down. Before becoming another robotic slave, he's let loose by his girlfriend, who works as an assisting in this underground corporation. She provides a sting in the tail twist later on. Henry, well our racing, frenetic POV of Henry (where you might feel certain points of your head hurt slightly, but two hours after seeing it, and writing this review, I kind of feel a bit of a headache coming on) we two are pursued by baddies, and come into contact with some goodies, out to assist and save Henry. Most come in a collection of characters, one bearded ruffian, camouflaging himself with bushes, a crisp spoken aviator. Classics. They provide a lot of laughs, and there are a couple a smart comedic lines. You get this, more than thrills in this one. Our lead baddie who runs the corporation of guinea pigs, sports a bad sandy white hairdo (wig probably) and looks like Australia's Chris while Henry's girl especially in some scenes looks bloody like Jennifer Lawrence, it's almost not funny, but this film is, as I was letting off quite a few guffaws with my mate, while some scenes were just trash or insane. Much blood is spilled, as I gather the game is the same, the blowing off head scene, the in thing in violence today. We even see a face being pared in the middle, and each side, the whole underneath pulled back. A yucky repellent sight. The movie ends abruptly where some of you indeed thankful. Honestly the best thing about this movie, is the opening song itself, where it plays over a 360 degree computerized shot of Henry's skull where at certain points, fired bullets riddle different face parts. I liked this too, where the opening credits appear over it. Yeah I was disappointed overall, where throughout, there were action bits, you see in other video games, and I've never played this video game. But this shows you, movies adapted from video games don't work. I don't care whether you Super Mario, whatever. This is truly why this movie doesn't work, where we had three, an audience leave half way. Go into it, as if a comedy. You might enjoy it more, that's if you like a lot of blood, and you're not in short supply here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dis-regarding Henry.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry, a newly resurrected cyborg must save his wife/creator from the clutches of a psychotic tyrant with telekinetic powers, and his army of mercenaries. Fighting alongside Henry is Jimmy, who is Henry's only hope to make it through the day........What seemed like a good idea at the time, quickly turns into one of the most mundane, banal ordeals ever to grace the cinema screens.Yes the FPS point of view was a novel idea back in 2005 when the movie Adaptation of Doom did it for five minutes, and although it was the best part of the film, that's not really saying much, if you've sat through that.So the film consists of us as Henry running around and shooting, stabbing, jumping, fighting, hiding, and other things from some guy who thinks he's a Jedi.He has a flashback every now and again about Tim Roth, and Sharlto Copley pops up every five minutes as a different character doing nothing more than giving Basil Exposition and making his scenes fell like cut scenes from a FPS game.There is only so much of this you can stand, before your attention span gets all the more shorter and your mind starts to wander elsewhere.It's the cinematic equivalent of watching a friend play a FPS, but looking for all the hidden awards as they are playing.It's frankly, quite terrible, and if it's not in my top 5 worst of the year, it'll be a dark year for film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An All-Out Attack on the Senses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With such a focus on originality today, many filmmakers feel pressured to go out and find the next big thing. Unfortunately, the POV first person camera may be the next big fad in Hollywood, and that's not good. Hardcore Henry is very original, but has no real story, and contains a lot of nauseating camera work. The biggest problem, is us, we've encouraged things like this film to happen, and now we have it.Today's critics seem to latch onto one critique more than any other, and that is the originality argument. Many people will tell you no film today is really original, but then a film like this comes along. Shot like a video game this film is original in both look and narrative, however, the focus on creating this video game like look lead to a weak storyline. It seems sad that our generation just craves things that are original, so much so that when we get it, we don't care about quality.The greatest flaw of the film is the narrative, or serious lack thereof. Many, if not all, characters are grossly underdeveloped, especially the villain who is goofy and weak. The story is more of a incoherent assembly of scenes, that does little more than further the confusion. It seems that from the outset, Hardcore Henry was always about the POV feel and look. It is ironic, because the film is plot less, and the action doesn't really look good either.The gimmick of this film is for the audience to feel like they are in the shoes of the main character. The problem is the main character bobs and weaves so much the film is more on a nauseating set of fight scenes. On top of the terribly shaky action sequences, where very little is visible, the film is poorly edited, furthering the confusing story by jumping around randomly. On top of that, the way the characters and story are presented, time in the film is totally jumbled, and nothing seems to make sense until the end of the film, at which time it's too late.In conclusion Hardcore Henry, is an all-out attack on it's viewers senses, as they are put through a non stop set of nauseating action sequences. The film has no real story, and throws characters in and out of the film, creating a confusing mess of a story. So yes the film is original, but that doesn't make it good or worth watching, because there's a gross lack of craft in this film. I suggest you don't watch this film because the only selling point is the new POV shooting style, which alone is not enough to make a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting idea, puzzling trailer, terrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was puzzled to see execution of a movie that looked like a first person shooter. What a mistake. I left theater after 40 minutes and only regret I have is not walking out earlier.First and unfortunately positive sign that you're going to watch something bad is opening scene which shows close-ups of gunshot and knife wounds, without any point, just showing how far prognostics went. Sad reminder that single nice shot does not make a movie. Story? Henry is a man who wakes up with super power in secret lab where nice looking female scientist claims to be his wife. Not long after that lab gets attacked by Russian mobster. Henry goes to find out his past and something else we do not understand by killing dozens of enemies...Movie used the worst of what movie and games have to offer. You do not participate (play) in action, which looks attractive first 10 minutes, until it all goes in the loop. Story is 2nd rate, even for game industry amnesia story. There definitely is effort put into story-boarding scenes and filming and editing movie shot in such specific way, but there is also big waste of time creating concept that does not work and leaves you with nothing more then a headache.Characters are bad clichs with bad acting for which you don't care since there is not emotional involvement due to poor story. Even action flicks get boring since there is only one perspective and few WOOOO moments (eg falling down the building from Henry's point of view) can't make up for repetitiveness.I'm trying to find positive characteristic of HC Henry but cannot see even one. If you're going to see it for action scenes after first excitement you will be bored, and there are plenty of good short action videos on YouTube.As far as Henry, I didn't stick around long enough to find if nice looking scientist is his real wife, did he find what he was looking for, and who the heck Henry really is. And to be honest I couldn't care less.Save you're money and precious time and avoid Henry at any price.</fullReview>

No storyline at all.To the producers: I have seen other reviews and posts that compare this movie to Tarantino's work. I like Tarantino. HH is not even in Tarantino's shadow. The violence in Tarantino's movies are usually to the extreme, but the story lines are too. But HH misses the mark.If you have time in your life to waste? Go see this movie. I don't walk out of movies..until this one. I went to the box office to pull my dollars back from HH, just on principle.I understand why this movie has decent reviews after sitting amongst the patrons that would like HH.

		<fullReview>Hi guys!This movie is about a guy and his revenge. I don't like to spoil in my reviews, because the less you know, the better! I will talk about every aspect and rate it. Action: It's very cool action. Like you may or may not have seen in the trailer, the action is good. Not the most inventive action, but it corresponds well with the way it's filmed. 7/10Acting: It's functionally acted! You won't see any Oscar nominees in 2017 with any of the cast's names, but they played their part well and it wasn't bad. 7/10Cinematography: Now this is where the film shines. It shows you something completely different and it does it well. They used the shots well and it was thrilling to see the guy, who probably had a go-pro attached to his head, get into the action and kick some *ss Under no circumstances are you annoyed but the way it is filmed, but for some it may cause a bit of dizziness. It did with the person i went with, though i didn't endure anything. For me it was a great experience in general! 10/10Story: and here is where the movie flaws. It is another revenge movie and we already seen one 2 months ago called "the box office hit" dead-pool! The editing combined with the story was way better and though dead-pool had the advantage of pulling story lines out of a comic book and this was just an experience, it shows that they really made this movie just because of the first person shooter kind of feel. 5/10Overall, the movie is an interesting and fun cinematic experience that for me was a one time deal. I would recommend seeing this movie in the cinemas, because I feel like if you watch this movie at home, you'd feel less impressed by the way it is filmed! 7 out of 10 for the movie overall! - Im Vinay from "The Entertain Train" on Youtube</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Just wow. I've seen some crazy actions films in my time, but never one filmed entirely from a first-person perspective. This movie, a very formulaic revenge story to do with a cyber assassin getting revenge on some generic super villain and trying to save his wife is completely insane. Hardcore Henry is filled to the brim with extremely gory violence, over-the-top acting, breath-taking stunts and one brutal, hard-hitting, punchy action sequence after another. I don't know what the body count of this movie is but it's big, that I do know. HH feels positive in some ways. It's an action movie that's innovative in its technique, not just full of CGI and does some amazing stuff with quite a small budget. I don't know how they made this, but the makers of this movie deserve a lot of credit. This is not a plot driven movie in any way, but Sharlto Copley and his character are a major asset. Frequently the action is enjoyable. And fairly regularly it isn't. HH does become very exhausting, its plot is completely bland and ultimately it's all just too much. This is definitely a case of 'Too much of a good thing' here. HH is also soulless and drained, and doesn't give its audience anyone to root for or anything to care about. Nevertheless, as a technical showcase it's a marvel, and at times the action is great fun. Still, given the potential, it's a bit of a let-down.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All out video game homage train wreck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember Condemned and Condemned 2 on the XB360? I bet the makers of this film do! These are visceral, insane, violent first person video games from about ten years ago. Add in story elements from Half Life 2, F.E.A.R, and some parkour from Mirror's Edge - turn it all into a first person, Go Pro mounted camera, live action film with a blaring soundtrack: enter Hardcore Henry.Absurdly violent approach is admirable and worth watching for any die hard FPS gamer, but for the average movie goer this may prove too claustrophobic an experience with a very real chance of motion sickness.The video game story lifts range from brilliant to idiotic. Sharlto Copley is astonishing (as usual), and this is a great movie for him. He gets to be over the top, diverse, and truly makes the movie with his presence. This has to be a rare occasion where the movies main character isn't the main character - Shartlo is this movie, but he isn't the character behind the camera. The villain pales in comparison to Copley's complex role, almost to the point of being a footnote as a stereotypical over powered end boss. The antagonist is offered no back story, no explanation for his abilities, and his two dimensional dialog is blatantly bad video game tripe. Intentional? Maybe, but villains are often the best characters in great action movies, and though the actor does an admirable job with what he is given, this character is completely squandered to my eye. Also ghastly is the portrayal of women, which again can be written off as video game'esque, but I got the sense of unadulterated misogyny. Objectification, brutalized bystander, and stereotyped noir leading lady are all in full effect, and to me were all tasteless exploited props in a live action movie.But the same could be said about the mindless violence with wave after wave of masked or blank faced enemies slaughtered without mercy. And I had absolutely no problem with this...I conditionally hated the insert song soundtrack that just added to the blaring cacophony of jarring sounds - perhaps it fits with the jagged go-pro style camera work (and many of the songs are good songs), but put it all together, and at times this movie is an unwatchable mess of indecipherable visuals, and equally unbearable sound mixing. This movie deserved a background original soundtrack that fit the action, and not copy and paste, music video laziness. Too much work clearly went into the visuals for this cheap approach (that probably wasn't cheap, knowing how insane music copyright is!).In many ways admirable and fun, in some ways repulsive - I ultimately respect the unflinching, all out approach. Glad I saw it, but I can't call it great.impressed and dizzied 6 out of 10I do think a movie like this can work for a general movie-going audience, but the camera work has to be way cleaner, and more of an emphasis on harrowing parkour insanity as opposed to mindless violence. Oh, and real soundtracking...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The poor man's Crank, done shaky-cam style. Wants to be District 9 but ends up closer to Plan 9. Unwatchable. "Star" Tim Roth has about 1-2 minutes total screen time. If you liked Kingsman, you may like this. First person shooter, shooting blanks. Obviously inspired by RoboCop but ends up RoboCrap. Had to fast-forward through most of this. If you're going to ask ME to be the main character, I should at least get paid a star salary! Tries to be Terminator but turned out Terminated. IMDb reviews require 10 lines of text.

		<shortDescription>A litany against growing up and women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>he trailer for this film doesn't spoil anything: it tells almost everything about this film, which (surprise) doesn't pass the Bechdel test. In fact, women aren't merely used as objects in this film, but as pins designed to strike down. When you see women who stand up for themselves, they're denigrated into stereotypes, e.g. whiny, hen-like smithereens of the True Heroes, which, of course, are The Men. The Strong Men with Big Muscles and Bits Of Robot Inside, but with Some Kind Of...Pathos? There's no pathos. There's nothing veiling the fact that this is a film which seeks to emulate Neil Blomkamp's films, going as far as casting the very limited actor Sharlto Copley in a slew of rles designed to be funny and show his breadth, which is wide enough to require a microscopic lens that only scientists at CERN have access to.I can't stop coming back to how this film views women. How the director and writer, and, indeed, every single being who has been involved with this muck, must see women. Sexy things, or disparaging must-haves? Both? When two women actually speak at the same time in this film, the man who is speaking with them just says something to sedate them and then, to another man, says "Sometimes it's just easier to say yes".Please.There's one attempt at psychology in the film, apart from one scene where, naturally, a woman is displayed as highly deceptive and deserves to die. Some kind of recurring psychological theme in this film, is invoked as the lead character remembers being bullied in his childhood. A slow-motion shot of his robot being thrown into a brick wall. Actually, that scene is kind of the leitmotif for this film: something shiny being destroyed.Oh! There's even time for a homophobic two-line rant in this film! As one of Copley's charades is vented towards the viewer, he says something akin to "There's a certain stigma attached to blokes who like musicals. I just wanna get it out there that I'm as straight as an arrow, get it?" and then he kills people. Thanks for letting us know.Then some scenes of women being prostitutes. These women are in the middle of a group sex scene with another of Copley's characters, but the lead character's entrance doesn't disturb them in the least. Neither does his apparent dying, which only entices them to feeling him up and suggesting sex. Naturally, as they're women, the plaything for Man. The Man. The Big, Strong Man.The first-person-shooter point of view in this film was quite enthralling at times, but that's about it that made me like the film. I'd rather spend time hanging out between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump and watch fireworks go off in the sky, than see this film again; it'd be quite the same experience, I'm sure.The violence is another thing. I have nothing against the showing of violence, if it serves a purpose. This is merely here to look cool, and give people kicks. Well, if watching people dying to bad music - apart from Devendra Banhart's music, which somehow has crept into the soundtrack in the form of two very good songs - is your thing, good luck with staying human. That's it. Oh, and if you think I'm spoiling this film through this review, don't play "Max Payne", as that will basically have ruined this entire film for you (apart from the fact that the game is far better than this film).The people who have made this film - yes, including your one-minute join, Tim Roth - should have seen "Mad Max: Fury Road". By all accounts, they probably have, but deflected everything beauteous and fair about it.I'll let the very last line spoken in the film ring out as a kind of air around this sycophantic, anti-feministic clownboat of a film: "Listen to your heart." Do not see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst. Movie. Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my life I have walked out of a cinema during a movie just three times. Hardcore Henry has the unenviable record of driving me away in the shortest time.First and foremost it is totally unwatchable. I like video games. I like FPS. This is not that. Both I and my partner had migraine headaches after 15 minutes of watching. After 20 we left.Plot? If non-stop ultra-violence constitutes a plot, then the viewers who rate this a 10 are a sad statement of modern values and taste.If you want to watch a 96 minute advertisement for GoPro, or if your idea of fun is being a spectator in Call Of Duty without being able to touch the controls; then this is for you. For me, a waste of money, a waste of a rare night out, a physical assault and a sense of despair that there exist humans who not only can sit through this rubbish but actually enjoyed it.They call this film experimental. It failed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a lot of pressure for being the first big screen FPS movie. I'm a huge gamer and movie goer so this was a new experience I was excited to see but seriously? It isn't that good. It has two really fun sequences and the FPS is cool for about 15 min. The whole film is poorly paced, when there's no action it is boring, some of the other action scenes are filled with jump cuts with bad editing, and the characters weren't good in the movie. I wasn't a fan of this film but I really wanted to recommend it and tell everyone I could to go see it. If you want to give money to this movie cause you want to see more FPS films go ahead but as a legit movie how does it rank? Pretty poorly.

		<fullReview>I thought Dead Pool was the worst Marvel movie of the year but this movie is even worse than that.First, most of the movie is in Russian and accent is too dumb to understand.First person is the WORST idea - I thought of walking out of the theater in the first 5 minutes but watched it anyway to write a negative review. Whenever we cannot see a character's face, it ruins the whole thing. In this you won't even see the hero - just his legs and hands (sometimes) and he NEVER speaks - all for NO reason. Unless it is a robot/alien movie, there is no reason for this crap. Can you imagine a movie like that?? The story is too hard to understand.Graphics are way too many that make it look like a video game and effing retarded. Camera is kind of like panoramic everywhere, where everything is silly rounded - roads, buildings, bridges, etc are all rounded.The advanced technology they show in this movie does not exist even in the stupidest movies.Stay away from this movie unless you want to waste 2 hours of your life you will never get back. Go watch Kung Fu Panda 3, Zootopia or Allegiant instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever paid $5 at the fair to see some show of a three eyed pig and after you get in the tent it's a glass jar of a dead pig and an extra eye has been glued to its head. That's how I feel about this movie. The previews made it seem like a worthwhile different genre show. It's far from that. I can't remember the last time I walked out of a show but I walked out on this one. I would rather watch someone play a video game, at least in a game you don't have the jerky motion of the camera. I didn't think anything could be worse than The Blair Witch Project. Let's admit watching someone else play a video game isn't the most fun thing in the world. This movie was worse than a 'B' movie with a nonexistent plot. I feel ashamed that I actually spent money to see this movie. I don't usually write reviews about movies but if I could save someone the time and money that they shouldn't waste on this garbage then maybe I didn't totally lose out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie Experience I Have Ever Had</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The shaky-cam in this was horrible. I was able to sit through the Blair Witch Project and its shaky-cam, no problem. But this was just terrible. Shaky and even blurry sometimes during fast motion. I actually had to close my eyes at parts because my head was swimming. So with my head swimming and a non-stop slaughter of good guys and bad guys, none of whom I cared about, it was an awful experience. I would have left the movie (which would be the first movie I would have ever left in the middle of), but I was there with my son and didn't want to abandon him.Overall, this movie was no better than playing a video game, except you didn't control the action. Hardly any plot, just non-stop killing. And you don't feel bad when anybody dies, because no one is around long enough to care. And it isn't even scary. Just a blood bath. That may be enough for a video game, but I expect more from a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Henry (re)gains consciousness as an attractive lady scientist is screwing a new leg on. In short order, he falls out of an airship and starts feeling through a Russian city, pursued by 43,000 anonymous machine-gun-wielding cannon-fodder, and occasionally helped by a series of individuals who all turn out to be Sharlto Copley doing funny voices while wearing funny disguises. Gradually a sort of story emerges.This film, shot exclusively in POV mode, would be a video game adaptation had it been preceded by a video game. As it is, it is exactly like watching someone play a shoot 'em up, with occasional pauses for Copley to deliver a bit of cut-scene exposition. It is otherwise non-stop action, with Henry (who never speaks due to his speech chip not being configured, or some such twaddle) avoiding injury despite the entire population of Russia (apart from a couple of dozen hookers) trying to kill him.The good news is that there is some phenomenal stunt work from free runners. The bad news is that the minimal story is a) almost incomprehensible and b) risible nonsense, Copley is simply awful in every one of the many parts he plays, and the non-stop action and subjective camera-work mean that this is possibly the most wearying film I have ever seen. I felt exhausted when it finished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film redefines the action,but at the cost of being plot less.Still a thrilling watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hardcore Henry redefines the action film genre, and one doesn't have to go into detail to talk about the film, because the film has no real story, and acting/ emoting take a huge back seat in this film, because the whole film is about explosions,gory violence, and intense gun play. There is even harry potterisque magical action involved. The action just never stops, the film is a adrenaline filled roller coaster. The film is like a video game, its the first film to be filmed in first person. Its like playing call of duty, except everything is unpredictable and one is at the edge of there seat because of constant thrilling action . The action is truly awe inspiring, the film has some best stunts I have ever seen on the screen. Hardcore Henry's only downfalls are that the camera angles for the first person filming makes one pretty dizzy at first, it takes at least half an hour of the hour and thirty min runtime to get used to the crazy camera angles. Its almost seizure inducing at times. And the films biggest flaw is that there is no real story at all in the film. Its just mindless action pretty much. However overall I recommend Hardcore Henry to be watched by action film lovers at least once because the film is truly a new cinematic experience.3.5/5* Grade: 73% B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a brand new kind of bad. Psychologically disturbing, with no redeeming qualities. There is no good guy to root for, no one to sympathize with. By the time it was over, I wanted to lay my head on a railroad track. Just horrible. The gore was pointless. Without the special effects, it was a very bad student film, well-deserving of an F. It was an apocalyptic version of Call of Duty. Hated the POV thing, and having a lead character that never spoke and we never saw. The plot was flat with no layers whatsoever. Ten minutes into it, I had to put my popcorn down. I left the theater consumed by a dark cloud of hopelessness and despair. Unless you love movies that make you feel bad just to be alive, you need to avoid this film like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The filmmakers deserve credit for going for an R-rating (and it's a hard R-rating, too) rather than water it down for a PG13 rating, but that's all the credit I can give them for this headache-inducing endurance test. Film quickly becomes boring, tiresome, and makes little sense. There is little plot to speak of, it's more like a series of random events being sloppily filmed in first person perspective. The non-stop action, and bloody shootouts never look real, like we're really just watching a boring video game. The few bits of inspired camera work and stunts (like falling backward off a bridge) were shown in the trailer, so their effect is lost. At no time does this ever feel cinematic or *big*, nothing makes this feel like it should be seen on the big screen, rather than a computer monitor.After a while, I found myself looking at the dwindling audience more than I watched the movie. There were only eight people at the start, but only five remained by the time the film ended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Half human and half machine, Henry wakes only to witness the kidnapping of his wife Estelle, by a group of mercenaries. From this moment onward Henry searches and fights for Estelle with every ounce of energy he possesses. He kills and risks being killed himself, by every weapon imaginable. The viewer, through the use of a special camera attached to someone's head, is about as face to face with the violence as anyone can get. Each move that is made by Henry is followed by the viewer. Every throat that is cut seems as if it is done by our own hands. We figure out what is happening only in so much as Henry does, for both viewer and character are in the same shoes. The film is kinetic, bloody and non-stop action. While worn down by the shaky camera work and bad acting, I also appreciated all the zany twists, gore, rawness and laughs to the story. Ann of Green Gables and Little House on the Prairie the film is not, and this is usually a good thing. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival 2015.</fullReview>

You will be able to see everything I see, including all the jerking, falling, and dizziness I experience. IF that sounds like your type of movie, go for it. Unfortunately, it wasn't mine, or the other dozen people that walked out during the movie like I did. A movie has to be pretty bad to have that many people walk out in the first 15 minutes. Watch the trailer, this is what you get for almost 2 hours. So if you are OK with only seeing the hands and feet of the main character and watching a movie in First Person, this is your movie. Otherwise, opt for one of the other new releases this week like the boss and laugh your butt off.</fullReview>
