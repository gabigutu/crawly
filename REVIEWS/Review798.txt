		<shortDescription>I'm Lucky to be Alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a survivor of playing on high school concussions. I finally quit playing by so many positive family influences in my life. I grew up playing Texas football, the "American Dream". I received my final football concussion in 2000 and discontinued playing football. Troy Aikman was the only one anyone talked about at this time regarding concussions and everyone thought he was fine. What they didn't talk about which this movie does a great job is pointing out all the players that died or had violent disruptive behavior due to post conclusion syndrome. I rated this movie a 10 because there will be millions of dollars spent to make the movie go away. It's important for every parent in America to understand what football can do to your kids. Football is a great sport but their can be serious life consequences that can come from it. Football 2000 years later will be looked at as Roman Gladiators once were. I loved every minute of my experience with football growing up. But the reality is the overwhelming effects this sport causes to our brains. It was once said to me that if the brain injury could be seen on the outside of your body it wouldn't even be a question if football would still be a sport. However, it's not and that's why it's unspoken. I very much support this movie and I am glad that Sony Pictures (only non nfl contract) took the liberty to show people what this sport's health effects can have on young kids and adults. Hope you enjoy my real-life review. I feel lucky to be alive. Lucky that I was surrounded by people that could think there was more to life then the "American Dream". God Bless</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie shows it is Time for Change, MUST SEE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've played football at every level and nearly every professional football league possible for the last 20 years of my life and trust me when I say this movie is a MUST SEE!! After watching "Concussion" with my son on Christmas day I had an epic awakening of common sense. The movie hit home so hard for me that I will no longer support the game of football. I will not play, coach, or watch it again until overall awareness and change is set in place for the affects of playing the game to be accounted for in some kind of way on a large scale. I have played this game for the last 20 years of my life and have physically felt the affects of it more and more each year. If you have played this game you know the "SuperMan" like culture that comes with it. How it is a sin to get hurt or say "I have a headache". I will no longer turn a blind eye to the long term affects of ignoring the phrase. What the normal fan or anyone who hasn't played the game at a high level doesn't know is the stress and depression that comes with leaving the game. I'd equate it to being the same as losing a spouse of 30+ years but add 100 blows to the head every day of each year. You already feel lost and meaningless but you also have years of brain damage which inflates the process. I grew up with a love for football because of its culture, all the great things it taught me, and the qualities it brought out of me and my "brothers", my teammates. BUT all of that is not worth my life after football. The fact of the matter is we as a society have turned a blind eye to the long term affects of playing football and I refuse to be a part of the problem any longer. This movie is not as visually gripping as it could have been and it also doesn't expand anywhere near as far as it could have on the obvious occurrence of brain injuries throughout every level of the sport but it gets right to the point and it shines light on the facts. The sport isn't going anywhere safe until the NFL does and the NFL has not and probably will not because of money. If change in the sport is going to occur it has to start at the top. After watching this movie every parent has to question if they want their child to participate in this sport. For me and my children, it's a definite "No-Brainer".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting was Oscar worthy, the science behind the discovery was fascinating, and the fact that it's based on a true story is incredible. It's proof that one person can make a difference. What is more impressive is after watching the film I discovered that this movie was a watered-down version of the original script. Even though Sony tried to avoid legal issues with the NFL by softening the script, I still found it spellbinding.I will say that I think it's ironic Sony made a movie about a man taking a stand against the NFL yet Sony pictures, with all their resources, are too afraid to do the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Concussion is a biographical picture that takes place in the early 2000's. The movie starts out by showing these players who freak out and start getting dimentia. Will Smith is a pathologist who starts doing autopsies on these players and discovers that there is a common theme, being repeated head trauma to the brain. The NFL knew about what was going on, but didn't say anything. Will Smith tries to shine light on the situation but the NFL does what it can so that the story does not leak. This movie was a movie I had been looking forward to for a long time because I thought it was very courageous for a movie to tackle this (pun intended) especially with the NFL playoffs right around the corner. This movie certainly makes a statement, but doesn't pack the punch I was hoping to see. Now this movie is not all bad. Will Smith delivers his best performance to date, which he is already being acknowledged for a golden globes (as he should be). He is phenomenal in his role and is committed. Smith does have an accent, but after a couple minutes, you forget that there even is an accent, and you truly believe he talks the way he does. As for the other performances, they were top notch as well. Besides the performances "Concussion" is a let down. By the end you will find yourself wanting more. There is so much more you wanted to learn about the matter at hand, that the movie drifts away from. The movie ends up being more about Will Smiths character than the football itself, which is fine, but not the movie I thought I was going to see. But it did take away from the balance of the movie. In the end, As a quarterback I wanted Concussion to go for the endzone, but it ends up doing more of a button hook.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Performance by Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Concussion describes the amazing journey by Nigerian Dr. Bennet Omalu (wonderfully played by Will Smith) whom uncovered a shocking revelation about the damaging effects football collisions have on its players. More specifically, players whom often went misdiagnosed (e.g. Alzheimer's disease). Dr. Omalu was the first to bring the issue of head-to-head collisions to light, addressing it as a very real issue in need of being fixed by the powerful football organizations.This story of one mans remarkable strength and fortitude, sticking to what is right pushed the Nigerian doctor never to give up in the face of relentless attempts by the NFL to stifle such findings. What Dr. Omalu was able to do will undoubtedly go down in history books, to be read by training clinicians, aspiring lawyers, and many other professionals. A look deep into ethics, and how the "good guy" can also be the one to come out on top.If there was ever debate over Smith's talent, it surely can be disregarded after this performance. Many an actor/actress have accepted the daunting task of a role requiring use of a foreign accent? and very, VERY few are able to do so successfully. Will Smith will undoubtedly turn heads as this film continues to roll out across the nation.It is only a shame that the films release coincides with that of renowned director Quentin Tarentino's "The Hateful 8" which will likely make this particular motion picture pass by unnoticed for many a mainstream viewer.Without giving much consideration to the other performances (Luke Wilson, Alec Baldwin), the lead by Will Smith alone carries Concussion. Don't miss an opportunity to watch something beautiful on screen: an extremely talented African American actor achieving something which is beyond impressive. To encapsulate a Nigerian immigrant in such a way that comes across as so raw and valid... that is what made this film the powerhouse that it is to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing treatment of a serious issue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched with interest the wave of change moving through the world after CTE (Chronic traumatic encephalopathy) was revealed to be occurring in young football players and not just boxers. A PBS doco from a few years ago was enlightening and described how the American football industry fought against the science. While this film tells the story more or less accurately (as I understand it) it does so in such a clichéd and insulting manner it is barely watchable. OK so it's got Will Smith in it, enough said. I think he is a good actor, but he tends to make awful films (Six digress was clearly an anomaly). I never found him believable as Dr Bennet Omalu, the radically religious pathologist from Nigeria who stumbles upon the first ever documented CTE case. Maybe it was the accent, maybe it was the performance. But he just seemed like a mellowed out Will Smith talking in a funny accent rather than a real person who I felt was worth investing 2 hours in.The film-makers were obliged to tack on a romantic sub-plot to give Smith something other to do than cut up the brains of dead footballers. The long list of not nice things which happen to the devout doctor are peppered with your typical Hollywood mechanisms, trying to force you to feel empathy and join the cast on an emotional journey. It just doesn't work... we've seen it all before: Sport as a form of patriotism, the tragedy, the unrealistic soundtrack (turns out Nigerian doctors enjoy listening to nice accessible 70's soul music when they are working, none of that weird African stuff you might expect them to listen to). I knew the story and I still wasn't able to care about what was happening to these people. What this comes down to is Hollywood trying to take a collision between sport and science to the lowest common denominator. American football gets a mention in this film, therefore football fans might be part of the audience, therefore they need to dumb this down as much as possible for them. They actually refrain from even naming the types of proteins causing the brain damage, instead having smith refer to them as "bad proteins". What films like this do is remind me how the film-makers don't actually care about the story, they are creating a product and ultimately want to sell their product to as many people as possible using as little creativity as possible. They even end the film with a nice feel good dollop of sickening patriotism, revealing that Dr Omalu has become an American citizen. They chose to finish with that detail but ignore the fact that as a result of Omalu's determination to have the issue placed under the spotlight, sporting codes all around the world are reassessing how contact sports are trained and played, with concussion assessments being implemented on game day in soccer, rugby, Australian rules etc. But why would the film-makers care about that? They have awards to win...</fullReview>

Truth always come true, it is just a mere of time and this movie shows that by telling us what it is to be a pioneer and a messenger of truth. This is a must-see movie.Also, I identified myself with main character. I immigrant doctor with so much respect and aspirations for the USA, that slowly discoveries the dark side of big corporation. In fact, this is not only America problem, it is human nature and can be find anywhere in this planet. Finally, I think Will Smith should be nominated for best actor - Oscar. He pulled out a very good role in playing the Nigerian pathology doctor... wanna know more? go and watch the movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>#Concussion has made me see what athletes go through from a different angle and I'm saying that as a man who didn't grow up a fan of American football. CONCUSSION is a compelling David Vs. Goliath story, it's a true great American story, and it's Will Smith's best performance since 2006's "The Pursuit Of Happiness" Written and directed by Peter Landesman, based on the GQ article "Game Brain," you've all seen the trailer for CONCUSSION which has Will Smith playing real life accomplished forensic neuropathologist, Dr. Bennet Omalu, who discovered a disease called Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) which a progressive degenerative disease found in people with a history of repetitive brain trauma, and it's commonly found nowadays in pro-football player because they get repeated bows to the head every time they play, this is a heavy contact sport, as we all know.So the film is about this immigrant doctor with high ethical standards and he truly loves America and yet the America he loves seems to be trying to shut him up because he's basically going up against the sport Americans live and breath for and one of the biggest most capitalistic organizations in the country. When you're messing with a giant business because you've discovered a truth about them that they don't like or a truth that might hurt their profit-making, you're bound to get bullied by the giant.I had my worries at first, I thought Will Smith's attempt on Nigerian accent may distract or it may make him into a caricature instead of an embodiment but fortunately, that's not what happened. Will Smith's performance in this film really burns with convictions, he will have you take his side in a heartbeat. There's a bit of "A Few Good Men" 'tell me the truth you can't handle the truth' sorta moment mixed with Denzel Washington's 'love's gonna bust me out' moment in "Hurricane" so it's clear that over the years, Will has learned from his fellow masters and honed his skills or his artistry to perfection. Somebody told me once that Will is a big fan of the Philadelphia Eagles team, so it's interesting to see him play the role of a man who takes on the NFL.The film itself is set in a way that makes you feel like you're going on an uphill battle. I think writer/director Peter Landesman approached it in a way that doesn't demonize American football, but sheds a light on the truth about it, just like what the real Dr. Omalu did. It is also a story about immigrants, a fact which sadly a lot of Americans today seem to forget, that we are a nation of immigrants.CONCUSSION will surely give rise to discussions not just among NFL players and team owners but also among audiences and football fans. But will the discussion only last a dinner table's length and then be forgotten once Sunday game comes around again? I read up after watching the movie and found that the NFL still makes excuses in admitting the impact CTE has on their players. They've done settlements, they've paid millions of dollars to families, they've changed some things about the way the game is played but keep in mind that this is a big money-making business, so when money is at stake, unfortunately human lives get negotiated over.The way the NFL handles this reminds me of how right wing politicians try to repudiate climate change, by hiring their own scientists, some of whom may not even be experts on the field study, because those politicians have been bought by fossil fuel businesses. So point being, change in America can happen but it does not happen overnight, it's a slow and painful process as long as there's money involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awfully constructed and largely boring, though Smith tries his hardest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Concussion has to be the worst edited film I've ever seen. In the first scene, Will Smith's lines of dialogue cut awkwardly across each other just as the camera inexplicably jumps from different angles. Much of the story is very hard to follow, such as showing the death of one NFL player and then discussing another, not approaching the on-screen death until about 20 minutes later. The death of Mike Webster is very confusing, as it shows him tasering himself (which Webster used as his only method of achieving sleep) and then cuts to his body on the operating table, implying heavily that the taser caused his death and contradicting the entire movie. Not to mention that the 2 hour movie feels more like 3, courtesy of sluggish pacing and unnecessary scenes. The story would have been better off having Omalu and his wife already married at the start, allowing for almost 10 minutes to cut footage right there.Will Smith is the only reason to watch this movie. His accept is a large part of why he is able to disappear into Bennet Omalu, because you will watch him on screen and yet not see the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Sometimes you want to just say "yes Will, good acting, well done" such as an overdone scene where he smashes the wall and rocks back and forth like a child. Surprisingly, it is the subtle nuances that make Smith's performances, and its the wannabe Oscar scenes that leave a foul taste.In the supporting cast, Albert Brooks and Alec Baldwin cancel each other out as they both clamour for screen time. Were one to lose, it should have been Brooks who comes across as a very inconsistent character and contributes very little. Alec Baldwin has a few nice moments but nothing to stand out, as does the infinitely under-appreciated Adewale Akkinouye-Agbaje. David Morse is the one who really stands out in his few scenes as Mike Webster. Mike O'Malley's caricature Daniel exists only to fluff up conflict and comes across as the embodiment of evil rather than having any legitimate protest.There's nothing subtle about the way the story is seeking to be shut down. Peter Landesman scripted Kill the Messenger, and it should never have surprised me that he's using so many of the same elements here. FBI agents show up, ostensibly in cahoots with the NFL (which never happened in real life). The main character's wife is stalked. They dig up dirt on main characters to discredit them. And then there's the final redemption, involving a speech to a quiet audience. He did them better in Kill the Messenger, whereas here (especially because they are largely fictitious) they come across as silly.Concussion tells an interesting story, but there's nothing gripping about it. Put it on in the background, but don't rush out to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>6 corporations control 90% of all media in the US. So, of course, the same people that made this movie are the same people that own sports teams and suppressed the truth about concussions. So, while they may have temporarily lost money due to the expose, they are making some of it back selling this tearjerker back to you! Are the facts about concussions true? Of course! Even a layman should be able to figure out that literally thousands of hits to the brain are not a good thing. It's likely that it wasn't figured out for so long as most of the winners that choose to play sports don't have a lot of brainpower when they start the sport, so the effects weren't immediately apparent. And it's no secret that a full / real education is not exactly a priority for these apes.The movie? Well, the simple title is a spoiler for this slow (no pun intended) burner. The editing was awful, as the viewer is forced to suffer through a bunch of boring montages. Will Smith was pretty good, as always. The good Albert Brooks and great Alec Baldwin did as well as they could do, given the bland characters they were written.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you are going to make a film about a sensitive subject, the number one rule is you have to make sure its a dam good one! Peter Landsman i take my hat off to you as you have delivered a brilliant film in concussion, the story of Dr Bennett Omalu who uncovers the dark truth about brain injury sustained in American football and how Dr Bennett was persecuted and branded a liar by the NFL and its teams. It is a beautiful David vs goliath true story how a doctor will do whatever it takes for the truth he discovered the condition known as CTE to be taken seriously and to try save lives. Will Smith is inspirational and shows why he is one of the best actors around and when you have a supporting cast of Alec Baldwin and Albert Brooks you have to be on top of your game and Will Smith nails it. I highly advise you to watch the gripping true story as not only will you learn something new but also have a new found respect for American football.</fullReview>

There were many missed opportunities for making it even more dramatic without taking overdramatizing. Some of the scenes with one Dr. explaining the medical condition another Dr.in the most simplistic terms - clearly the writer chose this format for explaining the condition to the audience, but it just seemed strange.Will Smith's acting was top notch.The writing was not. Landesman is probably a very good investigative journalist, but needs to hone his chops as a dramatic writer.I found Alec Baldwin unconvincing as his character - this could have been either a deficit in directing or acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Concussion" Fumbles An Important Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith delivers an Oscar worthy performance as crusading pathologist Dr. Dr. Bennet Omalu in "Parkland" writer &amp; director Peter Landesman's "Concussion," a mediocre but true-life medical expose about the perils of playing professional football. Although the timely subject matter about brain-damaged NFL players is definitely the stuff of which concussions are made, the straightforward saga lacks the devastating impact of its message. When you consider what the NFL has gotten away with in its greed, you'd think "Concussion" would have conjured up more clout. Little of what happens in "Concussion" is remotely compelling. Occasionally, "Concussion" conjures up suspense. Were it not for Smith's subdued presence, this anti-pigskin parade would never played movie theaters and quietly have passed away on home video. Landesman surrounds Smith with an impeccable cast, including Alec Baldwin, Albert Brooks, David Morse, Richard T. Jones, Eddie Marsan, and Arliss Howard. Landesman did a good job with his JFK thriller "Parkland," but he drops the ball completely here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lack of a central antagonist and suspense relegates tale of eccentric forensic pathologist to the realm of standard fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, Concussion has a promising premise: Dr. Bennett Omalu, an eccentric Nigerian forensic pathologist, takes on the orthodox medical establishment and the NFL after discovering chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease caused by repeated blows to the head, experienced daily by professional football players. But as the Times critic, Mahnola Dargis, adroitly points out, Concussion is basically done in by a lack of a central antagonist.In fact, what director/writer Peter Landesmann ends up doing is creating a series of antagonists (some real, some completely fictional) who collectively attempt to take Omalu down. Omalu is depicted as outside of the mainstream, talking to cadavers as he works on them and defending his practice of disposing of new surgical instruments (despite orders from his boss, chief coroner Cyril Wecht, not to do that). One of Omalu's co-workers takes exception to his unorthodox style of working and is constantly threatening him. It's a good way of suggesting that the eccentrics of society often are the subject of bullying?the only problem is that the co-worker is a completely fictional character, and Omalu was never subject to that level of persecution.Much more egregious in regards to overstepping dramatic license, is the implication that the FBI, prodded by the NFL, went after Omalu's boss, Dr. Wecht, as a warning to Omalu. While it was true at one point Dr. Wecht was arrested for corruption (the charges were later dropped), this occurred before Omalu published his findings about CTE. The arrest had nothing to do with Omalu's beef with the NFL, but Landesmann is intent on making us believe that Omalu was perennially threatened.The theme of victimization is emphasized further in Landesmann's suggestion that Omalu's wife Prema suffered a miscarriage after being followed by a mysterious car while driving home. Again, this is a complete fabrication, undoubtedly designed to suggest that Omalu's opponents were far worse than they actually were.More troubling is the widely accepted view that Dr. Omalu's findings are actually true. He based his conclusions on a small group of football players who apparently suffered brain trauma during their football careers. But Daniel Enber, writing in Slate Magazine, cites a 2012 study that "several thousand NFL retirees, conducted by researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, found that the former football players lived significantly longer than race- and age-matched controls." Enber went further by arguing that "CTE is indeed a widespread epidemic among former contact-athletes but?its clinical effects are pretty modest, since most men who have it are not depressed or otherwise impaired." In the sport of boxing, it's been said Muhammed Ali actually suffered from brain trauma and not Parkinson's Disease, due to repeated blows to the head. But George Foreman, who fought during roughly the same time period, appears healthy to this day?despite also sustaining the same kind of trauma to which Ali was subjected to.It's also difficult to conclude that, for those football players who exhibit symptoms related to years of concussion, CTE is the only cause of their symptoms. Indeed, Dr. Omalu's first patient, the former star football player, Mike Webster, had a history of both steroid use as well as mental illness in his family. Webster was also hooked on painkillers due to chronic back pain. Was his suicide primarily due to CTE and not those other factors? Quite possibly, but one cannot say for sure.Dr. Omalu did indeed suffer from being ostracized, particularly by his peers. Perhaps one of the strongest scenes in the film is when one of the NFL's hand-picked physicians attempts to berate Omalu and defend the NFL's policies. This is where Will Smith does a fine job of depicting Omalu's righteous indignation against an orthodox medical establishment.In the end, Concussion lacks suspense and tension. Omalu is depicted for the most part as a saint, supported by Prema, who is nothing more than a glorified cheerleader. Ironically, it was the players themselves who finally realized they could band together and take on their NFL bosses by instituting a lawsuit. It seems now that the NFL has become much more "sensitive" to the issue of traumatic brain injury as a result of CTE. It's also probably true this was as much about money? the players having probably made out more than "okay" after their lawsuit was settled in a court of law.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tell the truth! A provocative and compelling drama that discovers a medical problem and it asks how will the biggest sports corporation contend with it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone is a die hard NFL fan like me and follows the game and the sports world and the news, you know that over the years the league has been facing the problem of how to deal with player concussions and how to protect them better, and what to do when the players retire. The film "Concussion" deals with that on going drama just fine as it follows the research and work of one real life pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu(played in a tough strong performance manner from Will Smith). Set in Pittsburgh after the deaths of several star former Steeler players most notable that being hall of fame center Mike Webster(in a gritty performance from David Morse)who due to many hits to the head developed all kinds of problems like hearing voices, and loss of reality as he even had to live away from his family taking shelter in his own truck before falling to suicide by a head gunshot wound. The film is somewhat sad and emotional as you see the broken down players and hear the stories of their problems and passing. Dr. Omalu is one pathologist who's eager and willing to find out more and why and what drove these former players to young deaths by suicide, so thru his work he finds brain damage in these former players who suffered concussions and all would develop a new disease CTE. At first his medical news is doubted by others doctor's(played well by Alec Baldwin and Albert Brooks)yet they are slowly broken in to believe yet the challenge to face the NFL with the news is the toughest, as the film states you are going to war with a corporation that owns a day of the week even over the church and of course that's Sunday as the NFL has risen to sports entertainment that's at the top of the mountain. Finally Dr. Omalu's voice and discovery does get the league's attention and many former players and current ones take the issue to capital hill and congress. Overall "Concussion" is one film that's an emotional drama of discovery and it searches for the truth wanting answers to a new NFL problem that has expanded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So slow. This movie hardly moves. It takes half the run-time just to get to the point you already know from the title of the movie.Actors are OK in their roles. I think it's the first time I actually see Will Smith playing - or at least his foreign accent is pretty good for the character - although it's not entirely consistent - but there isn't much more than that and nothing interesting about the character itself. Is it worth an Oscar nomination? The movie is obviously made like an "Oscar material": It's an "important issue" with an "important character". But the movie is extremely weak. Pacing is terrible and you get the point in 5 minutes. It goes on and on and I finally gave up around the midpoint. I'm not impressed.</fullReview>

It's incredible that they would hire Will to play this role, when there are far better actors trained in the art. Chiwetel Ejiofor or Idris Elba, for example, I think, could pull off the accent and performance much better. Story aside, come on, we all know the story and the ending. It's not a very interesting topic (only 31M so far), but of course since I chose the movie last weekend, I was subject to my GFs choice this weekend. Her choice, strictly because of the Oscar controversy I should say! A very flat line story, with a star, when put in roles which are character studies and ones which he has to change his voice or appearance drastically (Ali, this role) he continuously acts as if he is impersonating the character. I would say the good ones impersonate without you noticing. I sat there looking at Will Smith impersonate a Nigerian not actually act like a Nigerian. I can't recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Either a bad movie or poor documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I love football, baseball, hockey, as well as other sports and enjoy the performance of good athletes which includes collisions. Also, I think that the NFL was very wrong for disallowing the possibility that concussions were prevalent and damaging far worse than they let on to be. Now, for the movie part, I didn't like the movie much. It was likely Will Smith's finest performance, but the movie seemed to me to be "a black doctor against white man's science." The movie centered around him and his wife and showed little happening outside of Pittsburg. The husband/wife thing was done poorly with no romance, just affection of some kind and a miscarriage. Details that occurred to make CTE apparent to everyone, including the NFL, were just left out. The story had holes, wasn't fun to watch, and I was slightly relieved when the 2 hours were over. That sounds contradictory to the fact I stated Smith did a very good job, but the movie shouldn't have been about a doctor in Pittsburg. It should have been about the players.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Concussion' is one of those movies that you watch once and never even think about again. It's a film that seems to stand solely on the principle of getting Will Smith an Oscar nomination. Because virtually nothing else in the film even compares to his dedication. Even writer/director Peter Landesman seems to not care about this film as much as Smith does. It's one of those films that you would call "Oscar Bait". A movie that has next to no substance aside from an all star actor acting their tail off. The other "Oscar Bait" film I saw this year was 'Black Mass'. It's unfortunate that this is becoming more and more popular these days. Each time I see one of these films I can't help but feel like we missed out on a superb story. A story that, in a talented directors hands, could be a legitimately good film. But I'm not saying that this film is terrible. It's not. It's more mediocre than anything. Of course the standout here is Will Smith. Again, he seems to be the only person on this entire project that actually cares. He does the very best with the material he has and what results is his best performance for some time. Aside from him, the film harbors a fairly interesting story. A story that should've been put to better use. The fact this film seems to only exist to help Smith snag one of those golden trophies makes this story feel neutered. The lack of dedication and vision makes this miraculous, real life story boring. It fails to bring attention to the dangers of concussions and simultaneously fails to communicate how great this man is. Instead of watching a war between one man and a giant corporation unfold we get endless, blank faced conversations. While we certainly see how much this man did the film fails to show what he had to go through.The film gets off to a hot start explaining how educated Omalu is and how he approaches his craft in an artistic way. We see him discover what repetitive head trauma can do to human beings and suddenly the film becomes an incomprehensible mess. What should've been the best parts of the film turn into mindless nonsense. It has such a hard time deciding what storyline to follow that it just follows them all.This derailing is only made worse by extremely distracting directorial mistakes. The editing in some dialogue scenes is so awkward it's hard not to get thrown from the movie and back into your seat. There are cuts in the middle of sentences so many times that I found my self in awe of how little effort was put into making the film flow. There is literally a scene where, I swear, the camera man feel asleep and they kept the shot in the movie. Will Smith leans forward while he is talking and the camera doesn't move with him. So, we watch his eyes and forehead while he continues to talk, half out of frame until the camera bumbles its way into the correct position.This is one of those movies that knows it doesn't really have to try. It knows that it is only being made as a vessel to propel someone to the award show stage. So, it doesn't try. It's uneven, forced, and poorly directed. The only person who seems to be fully invested is Will Smith. Who gives his best performance in quite some time. To bad it's in a movie that no one will remember within a week.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Concussion" is the cinematic equivalent of a stand-up who laughs at his own jokes. Each revelation, each tragedy, each teary-eyed silence is followed by either a line or a musical cue referencing what's already been well enough established. This malady is not unique to "Concussion," but that doesn't make it okay.King charisma himself, Will Smith, plays Dr. Bennet Omalu, a pious pathologist from Nigeria, blissfully ignorant to the side effects of uninvited goodwill. Due to his findings, Omalu's life is made a Job- like living hell; his faith--in God and in humanity--is tested, and there's our movie.The film borders on Lifetime/Hallmark levels of heavy-handedness, and never really questions Omalu's conviction or will; you may as well have put a white hat on him, and a big, wide-brimmed black hat on his detractors. There are ways to get the audience on a character's side without forcing he or she's morality on us; it's like if you want to get someone to pick up an apple, you don't shove it in his hand and close his fist, for the first thing he'll do when you let go is drop the apple. You place the apple in front of him and a little to the side, talk it up a bit, then move on. Eventually, he will pick up the apple--he may put it back down, but at least he tried. Having the main character be so free of fault makes the movie just another humdrum "little guy vs. big guy" story. I realize this is a true story, but lie to me; I don't mind.Smith is good, as he usually is. Albert Brooks reminds the audience of gravity's effect on testicles. Alec Baldwin has one of the more interesting characters in the movie, but is sidelined. Luke Wilson is Roger Goodell for two minutes of screen time, which would have taken me out of the movie if wasn't already. David Morse plays the incitement of the story; he's got one note to hit, but makes an impression nonetheless.Like watching a bad comic, I just wanted it to end. I wanted the comically large walking cane to come out from the side of the frame and yank everyone off. To add insult to injury, the movie runs out of steam towards the end but keeps going, like a radio DJ who can't hit the post and talks over the whole song. I've run out of analogies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is an emotional poignant look at a subject that touches all America. Wow! 1st -let me saw that after Will in "Ali", I realize that he can really tap into real people. He can get there, transform and leave you speechless in his portrayals. He is a Master of the Craft and can reach in and touch the soul of the Source Reference while astounding you with minor characterizations (rubbing of his hands and the other " oddities" that make all is us human). He gets it. Humanity is humanity. He us the Epitome of Shakespeare's writing about Humanity. Will is no fore a Shakespearean Actor as Shakespeare's was a real Psychologist. Neither of them profess to be the latter thing but both get there and command our attention and demand our respect not because they are so talented (both are) but because they are both undeniably right.I was in awe of Will Smith working his magic in " Concussions". A story about an accomplished man wanting to do the right thing because it was right. That's the crux of Dr. Omalu Bennett. He just wanted to tell the truth and idealistically hold onto his Hippocratic Oath with a iron fist and White Knuckles. Because if this film, I will read the Source Material-" Game Brain". Will showed us everything about Dr. Bennett to include his motive behind his research. I loved it! Wow! Dr. Bennett should be proud that he was portrayed as what he is-An Anerican Hero ( and I like Football). In fact, I cried like a baby when I got cut from my High School Football team after tryouts. BTW-I'm 51 now and the pain still makes me pause for a moment. Of course, I found Lacrosse (America's 1st Team Sport) and carry that torch even today. Can you imagine the torch that the players that died carried. BTW-I remember Junior Seau. Nuf Sed on that.This film was for parents. This film was to show that "..you can fight City Hall and win..." This film is tell and/or remind Coroprations like Big Tobacco and Exxon-Valdez that sometimes things hurt people. This film helped ease my mind because my 10-year-old wants to play contact football and my 9-year-old talks about being an Atlanta Falcon because if what he sees on the TV screen. This film is for every Sports enthusiast and fan to let them know there is more to the game than what they see. This film says "Hey, the greatest enemy to this game is nit what you can see but it's what's you can't see"This film may have just out on the blast the work of a man that wanted to help a Sport that he didn't know and didn't even love. This film may have saved my kids life...and I'm OK with that. I'm okay because now I got into helping my son with eyes wide open instead of eyes wide shut. Will Smith, thank you for this film. Dr. Omalu Bennett , thank you for your work . I will tell you that every tear you cried is a tear that I don't have to cry....neither do the 82% of Football Fanatiks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith Delivers an Oscar Worthy Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to be honest. I haven't been a huge fan of Will Smith the actor. He always seems to be doing not much more than playing himself in his roles. Even in The Pursuit of Happiness it was hard for me to forget that the character I was watching was Will Smith instead of who it was suppose to be. This works well for him when he's doing comedy or action such as Men in Black or Bad Boys, but not so much when he's taking on something dramatic that requires a transformation into an actual role. (To be fair, I can't seem to remember ever watching Ali and I suppose I should do that.) Finally, though, after 25 years of trying, he's done it for me with Concussion. He truly captures the role of a Nigerian brain specialists and I almost immediately forget that he's Will Smith and I relate instead to the character he's playing. And he pulls it off with such grace that I do believe he deserves at least his third nomination for best actor if not the award itself.As for the film, I liked it a lot. The first half plays like a very taught thriller and had me on the edge of my seat. The second half gets a bit too melodramatic for my taste but not so much that I started squirming (well, maybe just a little). I think if the second half was given a bit more editing, speeding it up, this could have been a ten star film but eight stars, which is what I give it, isn't anything to shake a stick at either.So there you have it--my take on Concussion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith Steps Up to the Plate, Script Falters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)An inspiring, academic by the name of Dr. Bennet Omalu takes on the titan of Sundays, the NFL, in order to prove a direct link from head trauma during football games to CTE, a football related injury that occurs. Writer/director Peter Landesman takes on the very detailed, and dramatic thriller "Concussion," with an insightful amount of control in direction, mostly thanks to Academy Award winning editor William Goldenberg, who keeps most of the film at a decent pace. However, with a clichéd script that brings the eye-rolling effect to a fever pitch, you can't help but wish that the material was more rendered and secure in its delivery. Surely to bring on an inner rage as we watch these men, so revered by Americans on a weekly basis, beg for absolution as they lose sight of themselves as time progresses. What doesn't work in "Concussion's" favor is the glossing over the real human condition that is so desperately apparent in each frame the film attempts to show.Starring two-time Academy Award nominee Will Smith as Omalu, he delivers one of his strongest performances ever. An impeccable capture of a man from Africa, soulfully searching for acceptance in America, Smith brings a visible intensity in each line spoken. Settling into a role that calls for the best parts of Smith's charisma, which he has demonstrated effortlessly throughout his career, he handles it with an equally emotional heft that garners most of the film's best moments. This is a performance that deserves to be considered for the Academy Award for Best Actor.Landesman also constructs a decent cast with Alec Baldwin (not totally owning his own southern-ish accent in his exchanges), Gugu Mbatha- Raw (beautiful but utterly wasted in under developed scenes), and David Morse (who deserves much more roles and is quite effective in his limited screen time). Of all the supporting players, Albert Brooks delivers as the vulgar Dr. Cyril Wecht. It'll call back to his beloved turn in "Drive" just a few years back (minus villainous murders). As a distracting entity, Luke Wilson cast as Roger Goodell is a poor choice by the filmmakers, serving nothing more as celebrity wallpaper.Composer James Newton Howard puts his horns on overload, sweeping into scenes that work well in films like "The Village" but with a film such as "Concussion," it begins to grate on the ears at times.At 123 minutes, the film bloats like you over indulged at dinner time. In some bizarre, and almost "too try hard" choices, Landesman attempts to focus on some of the more "human" and "natural" elements of Dr. Omalu's life. As we find ourselves more interested in the case at hand, the writer/director almost sets out to make his version of "The Insider," which would be fine if he got a better grasp on which elements he should focus on."Concussion" isn't a complete failure, delivering at times with a grandiose turn from Will Smith. If anything, he's more than worth the admission ticket but I believe most of all, the film does successfully place a spotlight on an issue that is in desperate need of change. The final title cards will prove the NFL's power, and even deepen your frustration and anger. I think that it'll at least offer up a discussion point. That's success on its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review: I first watched this movie on an aeroplane and I must admit, I did find it quite boring and it made the flight to America seem longer than it was, and now that I've watched it again, I still found it quite dull. The subject matter was quite interesting and the bonus material on the DVD was intriguing but I personally don't think that Will Smith was the right choice to play Dr. Omalu. He did bring emotion to the role and and he made the film seem realistic, alongside Baldwin (Dr. Julian Bailes), Albert Brooks (Dr. Cyril Wecht) and David Morse (Mike Webster) but for a two hour movie, the tone that was set from the beginning, didn't switch throughout the movie. Don't get me wrong, Dr. Omalu was a truly remarkable neuropathologist whose determination to discover the truth, was a stroke of genius but from an entertainment point of view, it just didn't do it for me. On the plus side, the chemistry between the actors, who were all top class, did work and when the brain damaged football players were on screen, it did make it slightly watchable but there wasn't any memorable scenes which left me thinking that it was a great film. Anyway, although the movie was interesting, I did find it boring, and it was lucky to make a profit at the box office. Average!Round-Up: This movie was written and directed by Peter Landesman, who also brought you Parkland in 2013. He also wrote Kill The Messenger in 2014, starring Jeremy Renner, so he hasn't had that much experience in the movie world. As this movie was about such a delicate subject, I personally think that it should have gone to an experienced director who could have got the most out of top actors. I have to give him top marks for bringing an untold story to the public domain but I really don't know how much Dr. Omalu's foundings have changed the game today. Anyway, I'm glad that Smith has gone back to his original acting style, by returning in the movie Suicide Squad, and with a couple of Bad Boys movies in the pipeline, so I'm sure he will bring the dollars back to the box office.Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $49millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/sport/dramas starring Will Smith, Alec Baldwin, Albert Brooks, David Morse, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Richard T. Jones, Paul Reiser, Luke Wilson and Arliss Howard. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a biographical story and now we know who Dr. Bennet Omalu is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a lot of hype about the film release Concussion including many advocates wanting to see the film nominated for a whole bunch of Academy Award nominations and subsequent Academy Award night wins. That just did not happen and there are a number of reasons as to why.1. The film is good, but it is simply a biographical account of Dr. Bennet Omalu, a man who grew up in Nigeria and came to the United States for a better life. He acquired several degrees while continuing his medical studies in the U.S. He met his wife in the U.S. and they had two children. 2. The film is focused on Dr. Bennet Omalu as one of the city of Pittsburgh's pathologists and in the course of his duties he determines that the great Pittsburgh Steeler's Hall of Fame center, Mike Webster, death from a heart attack was actually brought on by how he suffered for years from CTE (Chronic traumatic encephalopathy).3. If you are an NFL football fan as I am, you may be disappointed since the films' story is surrounding the struggle by Dr. Bennet Omalu (played by Will Smith) to bring to the forefront the real violence of the NFL game of football which is every child's dream to not only be a player and part of the game of football, but to get to the top of the Monday Night Football game of the week, most of these children will suffer brain damage as a result of multiple blows to the head caused by CTE (Chronic traumatic encephalopathy).4. Dr. Omalu wins over a former doctor of the Pittsburgh Steelers organization whose name is Dr. Julian Bailes (played by Alec Baldwin). Since 1994, he has been a neurological consultant to the NFL Players' Association (NFLPA), which has supported research on the effects of head injuries on professional athletes. He recognizes that Dr. Omalu is correct in his findings which is causing some retired NFL players to commit suicide to avoid any further pain and suffering not only to themselves, but the pain and suffering extended to their families. Between the two doctors they become very vocal in making the world aware (And especially the NFL players association) that NFL players are subjected to CTE.5. Obviously the NFL owners do not want this type of negative medical information to become the focal point of how dangerous the game of football is right from the grassroots of kiddy football, through to high school, to NCAA football, to the pinnacle of NFL football. So there is a tidbit of information in Dr. Bennet Omalu's life story that with a cheering musical score sounding in the background, we envision a David versus Goliath themed film. Unfortunately there are very few factual pieces of information provided through the film such as the stream of high paid lawyers that the NFL hired to get rid of this nuisance to their great game of NFL football and the billions of dollars of revenue gained by the NFL owners through the gate receipts, merchandise sales and especially the television rights revenue. I guess the producers were fully aware that the NFL owners and their lawyers had advised the producers to be very, very cautious about any and all information they included in the film or be prepared for a litigation battle between the NFL owners deep pockets and the films producers.The film's closing scene is the announcement that in 2015 Dr. Bennet Omalu received his U.S. citizenship. Not exactly an Academy award winning storyline. To summarize, the film did not do great at the box office and barely recovered the 35 million dollar budget at the gate. Fans do not care about film critics likes or dislikes, Academy Award nominations or not. Fans want to be entertained and simply put this biographical story on the cause and effect of CTE (Chronic traumatic encephalopathy) that was brought to the publics' attention by Dr. Bennet Omalu did not resonate into box office dollars, nor into any Academy Award nominations. What it did bring to light though was an offer of one billion dollars by the NFL owners to the NFL Players Association to resolve the matter in the courts. The NFL Players Association owe a great deal of gratitude to Dr. Bennet Omalu, but the film itself, is worth a watch for historical purposes, but not for any particular superb acting or storyline since this is a biography and Dr. Bennet Omalu's story is his own.I give the film a 6 out of 10 rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Landesman wrote (with Jeanne Marie Laskas) and directed this very important film about withholding public awareness of a devastating associated after effect of the game of football. It is surprising that it did not earn academy awards ? especially for star Will Smith. But that fact may be tied to the desire to remain uninformed about adverse effects of the country's national sport ? and all the money and crowds and media coverage that accompany the sport.CONCUSSION is a dramatic near documentary based on the incredible true David vs. Goliath story of American immigrant Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith), the brilliant forensic neuropathologist who made the first discovery of CTE, a football-related brain trauma, in a pro player and fought for the truth to be known. Omalu's emotional quest puts him at dangerous odds with one of the most powerful institutions in the world ? America's form of Roman gladiators, Football. The supporting cast is excellent - Alec Baldwin as the ex- Pittsburg Steelers' team physician turned compatriot Dr. Julian Bailes, Albert Brooks as Dr Cyril Wecht who supports Dr Omalu's research, Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Dr Omalu's devoted wife, David Morse as Mike Webster whose autopsy at his death provides the initial brain material for Dr Omalu's discovery of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, in addition to major players Eddie Marsan, Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje, Paul Reiser and Luke Wilson.The film is extraordinarily well done, factual without being sensational, and places before the public a very serious problem intimately connected to the country's national sport. The NFL will not be happy but the audience will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To answer the above question let us dive right into the movie. The opening scene was a bummer. The air of boredom starts to fill in for the first few minutes as they start to introduce Mike Webster. I am not a big fan of NFL so yeah that's why i think that the initial part didn't have much of an initiation. Much to my delight,after a few minutes i felt this powerful screen presence and charisma-It was Will Smith ladies and gentlemen! He was outstanding throughout the story-line and carried the movie with such ease.Co-actors Alec Baldwin ,Gugu Mbatha-Raw did justice to their roles.Dr. Bennet Omalu(Will Smith) was an adept pathologist and specialized in neurology and other multiple areas. Famous Football Star- Mike Webster passes away under mysterious circumstances and doctors declare that it was a cardiac arrest that had caused it. Doctor Bennet was the coroner and he had his own suspicions about the issue. He does a full autopsy on the body,checks ct scan for brain damage and a lot more. He then comes to a conclusion there is much more than what meets the eye. The story then moves on to his findings about the reasons for multiple deaths of football players following that year and the cause. He then successful manages to find the reasons behind the mysterious deaths and takes action to let the world know the harm that comes out of that sport against the corporate guns of NFL who would do anything to make this go away.</fullReview>

Will Smith, portraying Dr. Omalu, an immigrant to America with a zillion college degrees draws the audience into his search for truth and the steadfast desire to make it known. Even if you don't love football or even watch it, you will love this true to life movie. Great acting + great script + great direction = A Great Movie &amp; you can still enjoy it.

		<shortDescription>Honest, earnest and textbook storytelling that doesn't achieve the emotional touchdown it hoped for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What could have been an exhilarating story of putting a Nigerian doctor in the centre of a major controversy involving America's biggest sports body NFL, it rather whimpers into a safe and uninteresting screenplay that trudges to the finish line that you are already waiting for so long. Will Smith might have been too big a star to portray the earnest with the accent and all, my take would have been to have either Chiwetel Ejiofor or Jamie Foxx play it instead. Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) is an accomplished, unconventional and very passionate pathologist who has immigrated to United States from Nigeria. He has a very practical vision about the American dream, meets a girl Prema (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) through the Church and they fall in love and get married. All goes well until he unearths a pattern of deaths related to retired football players starting with a local favorite Mike Webster (David Morse). When Dr. Omalu starts raising his voice through print media by relating the head banging of the game leading to long term fatal health issues, he becomes a target for one of the biggest and most powerful corporations of United States.Featuring an ensemble of very talented actors, it is safe to say that it is a very well acted movie. But the main problem is the safe direction, which follows a textbook storytelling approach in such a linear format of a script without a bit of innovation in screenplay might feel a bit too exhausting considering its runtime. It also deliberates a bit too long on a love story that feels a little underwhelming. I understand it is a story of a real person and we can't and shouldn't do much to elevate the drama and entertainment factor just for the sake of it, but the script could have focused outside of Dr. Omalu's life and other people involved in this piece of history and identified some other interesting aspects around them. After all it is not a documentary and some documentaries these days are more interesting than this movie. It is not just the story, but presentation matters, entertainment matters and very likely commercial aspects matter considering Will Smith with no resemblance whatsoever with Dr. Omalu and being a huge star gets cast in the lead. Honest, earnest and textbook storytelling that doesn't achieve the emotional touchdown it hoped for.</fullReview>

I had to adjust to Will Smiths Nigerian accent for his character, however I think he played his character well. I like how the screen writers and directors focused on those who suffered as well. Focusing on their loss and betrayal. The relationship between Will and his on screen wife was a bit dry for me and seemed forced. It was quite a distraction from the rest of the movie. It seems like they edited parts out from the final cut. The timeline of the movie can be hard to follow at times. With scenes of family life then jumping to talking to doctors and examining bodies.

		<fullReview>Concussion (2015) *** (out of 4) Pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) is working as a coroner in Pittsburg when Steelers legend Mike Webster (David Morse) shows up on his table. Omalu is confused as to why what appears to be a healthy man would have so many hidden issues. After reviewing Webster's brain the doctor begins to think that playing football has done damage to his brain but as the doctor starts to spread his warning the NFL tries to shut him up.CONCUSSION, the movie, got pretty much overlooked at the box office and it didn't quite catch on like I'm sure everyone involved in it had hoped. If anything the movie made the most noise when Smith's wife threw a fit that her husband wasn't nominated for an Oscar and the fallout that followed is probably what the movie will always be remembered for. It should also prove that the majority of people who watch football on Sunday's probably don't care about the damage being done.As far as the film goes, it's certainly has many flaws but there's no question that it remains entertaining throughout, although I'd argue that there are a lot of times where it feels like a made-for-television movie. There's just not enough energy or power that comes from the film and I think it needed to be a bit darker. With that said, there's still a lot to enjoy here including the performances, which are without a doubt the best thing here.Smith turns in the best performance of his career (not one of the year's five best though, sorry Jada) as the African born doctor who finds himself constantly battling to prove his science. I thought the accent by Smith was terrific and you certainly saw a real character while watching the movie and not once did you feel that you were seeing an actor. The supporting cast includes nice work from Alec Baldwin, Albert Brookes and several others but I was really impressed with the work of Morse. He has always been one of the most underrated character actors and he turns in a brilliant performance here.CONCUSSION isn't a great movie and it's certainly not one of the year's best but it's an entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Concussion Could Have Been A Better Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No question about it.Concussion could have been a better film. Will Smith was obviously disappointed that he never was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal as Dr. Bennett Omalu.While I may say that he did a wonderful performance as the leading character,too bad that the film decided to make safe approaches which unfortunately weakened the film. The film directed by Peter Landesman was set back in 2002.At this time,a Nigerian forensic pathologist in Dr. Omalu discovered a brain injury known as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) which occurs to National Football League players after he did an autopsy on former Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster,who was found dead in his pickup truck.After releasing a report on the said findings on the degeneration of the brain that is highly possible for football players,he fights a battle against the league to suppress his research on it.Too bad that instead of focusing on the topic CTE or the football players who are prone to the said disease,it took safe approaches by dealing more on the life of Dr.Omalu.Unfortunately,viewers are more interested in both the brain injury as well as the most popular sport in the United States.Dealing more on the doctor makes it less interesting.It could have been a better film had it not done that.Also,it would also be more revealing on how the sport could be indeed very dangerous to the brain and one's mental health just like when cigarettes were first discovered as dangerous to one's health decades ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Why does an apparently healthy, favorite son of this city become self mutilating and homeless at 50? Cardiac arrest may be how he died, but not why." Dr. Bennet Omalu (Smith) is a pathologist in Pittsburgh. When an NFL hall of famer shows up dead Omalu notices something strange about the way he died. After asking for samples of his brain Omalu discovers something he named CTE. When he goes to the NFL with this information they not only ignore him, but try and discredit him. When more and more bodies pile up he becomes hard to ignore. Anyone that watched football, and even most that don't have heard about this growing concern. Most also know that the NFL is trying to downplay the issue, but I didn't realize to what extent they were until this movie. All politics aside, I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was good, although I can see why Will Smith wasn't nominated, the real snub is Albert Brooks in this. He was great. Much like Moneyball or Draft Day this is a type of sports genre movie that isn't 100% about sports. Also much like the Big Short the movie will anger you the more you watch. It is possible to still love football and agree that it's dangerous and something needs to be done. That seems to be what the NFL is not understanding. Overall, a very good movie that was better than I expected and I recommend. I give this an A-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Concussion" (2015) is a nicely told drama with superb performance by Will Smith. Actually, i my opinion this is one of the very best performances by Will Smith for which he definitely could have (but not necessarily should have) been nominated for Oscar. But because in this year there were more then one absolutely criminally robed movies during that ceremony, i don't even want to mention that award anymore - shame on them.Overall, "Concussion" is a good drama, which could have been even better if they could stick more to the discovery itself, and not how it made it feel his wife and etc. - that was the weakest thing in the movie. First hour was great, i would have rated it 9/10, but second was not that great, so overall score for "Concussion" is 8/10. Solid movie which could have been great. And David Morse steals every scene he is in - unforgettable performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At first in the past, all good things in the world were always denied.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the real life story of a Nigerian forensic pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu who discovered CTE disorder that most of the American football players are suffering from. So he fought for his theory against the NFL who was denying it. I was neutral when #OscarsSoWhite broke out, but for this movie I definitely agree on that. Whether he would have won or not, Will Smith name should have been in the best male actor in the lead list.That's not at all, this movie did not qualify for any other category in the event which is not unfortunate, but deliberately the Academy chose a wrong side to stand. Felt like they are supporting NFL instead of fact and its own product. This biographical movie talked mainly about one particular sport, maybe there are other sports in the globe that might cause CTE as must as this one. Since Dr. Omalu's research came from NFL players, so it was all about between them.This is a wonderful movie, I was very surprised for it. In the past, every good thing in the world was always opposed in its beginning, but later accepted widely like the global warming. I hope people aware of such thing is exist and act accordingly. No need to abandon the sport, just change the rules and the style of play. This is one of the best movie you could find from the 2015. I think it is a must see biopic, the credit must go to Ridley Scott who is the man behind for this movie to happen.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Football Fans Have to Watch this Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Football is an exceptionally violent game. Everyone already knows that. The violent aspects of the game are one of its biggest selling points. The same is true of hockey. I almost forgot about boxing. The fans love the violence. The fans need to know the consequences of the violence on the field or on the ice or in the ring. I can't believe a parent would allow their child to participate in these dangerous activities. The movie does a great job of making this important story available and accessible to a wide audience. It also presents some pretty damning evidence against professional football but big companies acting badly isn't exactly news these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tell the truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In three words: Tell the truth It is a shame that some movies are forgotten by the mass media or they are completely overshadowed by bigger over-hyped movies. This was the case in my country for Concussion. To my knowledge Concussion wasn't even shown in any theatre and I had completely forgotten about it until I saw a trailer on YouTube.I'm emphasizing over-hyped movies and mass media since this movie was released around the time of the Oscars. How can a movie like the Revenant be nominated and a movie like Concussion not? Sometimes I really wonder how movies are nominated for an Oscar. Is there a checklist or is there a popularity meter? I'm not saying that this movie is Oscar worthy I'm just saying that in comparison to Oscar nominated movies Concussion isn't a lesser movie at all. However, it doesn't really matter since the Oscars haven't been a measure of a movie's quality, in my opinion, for a long time now.Even if Concussion has been forgotten by most people I'm glad to at least spread some awareness for this movie and give you my opinion.Concussion is a movie based on a true story about a pathologist named Dr. Bennet Omalu, who uncovers the truth about the damaging effects to the brain in football players, caused by repeated concussions through normal play. It is a compelling story about how flawed the system and corporations are, when there is a lot of money on the line, and the hardships people will have to endure to make others aware of a problem.Dr. Bennet Omalu is a compelling character portrayed by Will Smith. Smith gives a good performance and an astounding job on speaking with an accent. He gives this character life and presence and carries the whole movie. There are many side characters, some with a large and other with a small but important part, however I'll focus on a couple who have left an impression on me. First of all Dr. Julian Bailes played by Alec Baldwin, he plays a doctor who worked for the NFL and decides to put his love for the game and carrier on the line to do what is right. I normally don't like the performance of Baldwin but it was acceptable in this movie. Dr. Cyril Wecht played by Albert Brooks, man what a guy. He supported Dr. Omalu throughout the whole ordeal and he occasionally made me laugh. He is portrayed as a mentor and a friend.The movie was directed by Peter Landesman and that is all I can say about him since I've never seen any other movie directed by him. However, if he keeps making good movies like this one I'll keep my eyes open for his name in the near future. The music was good but not noteworthy.The story was tight and focused with a warm beginning, strong middle, and a somewhat slow but redeeming ending. I personally think it could've cut 5 minutes from the movie to improve the pacing, especially in the middle/ending. The cinematography was fitting; the colors were warm and the contrast high.I know I've been saying this quite often about certain movies but this is TRULY no exception. This movie is good. It tells the story that needs telling and it is performed beautifully. Sure there are problems and it is romanticized in some parts, what "based on true events "movie isn't.If you want to watch a good drama, then give it a try, I promise you it won't disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyed it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith is most definitely the star of this show; and I strongly agree with other reviews that it could possibly be one of his best performances to date. I've always liked the majority of his movies; but it would seem he has entered into a completely new class, and brought a much deeper character out in the process.Some reviews have said that the movie took quite a tame approach in the legal wrangling against the NFL. Considering it was agreed that the NFL could keep quiet about a lot of 'what they really knew'; this was always going to be both a sensitive &amp; legally cautious movie to make. Personally, I think they did a great job with what they had (or were allowed) to work with. The message came through loud and clear.I don't have a particular interest (or dislike) for American Football; I do however believe that mental health is a topic which should be widely learnt about, discussed, and brought to the forefront more in today's society. Taking this into account - I thoroughly enjoyed the movie on many levels. You don't have to be a sports fan to appreciate the message of the movie; nor to appreciate just what a tremendous job Will Smith did in portraying Dr. Bennet Omalu. Highly recommended - 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Concussion was "Will Smith's Soul" : I consider him "The Drama King"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From beginning of the trailer release to now, i was awaited for this one than any other movie in this year, now i feel like my waiting worth it. A thought-provoking &amp; compelling drama about the NFL. To say about this movie, is to say about will smith 1st. From accent to acting, Will Smith was so ground breaking in his role. He was the beating heart of this movie. An "Oscar" Worthy performance. Direction was good, but the script was quite simple, that it was slow in execution and seems like nothing really accomplished in the end., but the good point about this movie was, when you are watching you feel like it was a bit slow, but in the ending you want it more."It was good, but it can be great." It was a "must known by everyone" movie which depicts the flaws of our world of what we love and admire."If people loves something, they pretend it was all good even it was bad."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a wake-up call and hits you like a sledgehammer. That'll surely give you CTE.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The NFL owns a day of the week. The same day the Church used to own. Now it's theirs."You can hardly say "Concussion" is a swirling, action-packed film. The movie tells (in a painfully slow pace) the true story of Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith), a Nigerian pathologist who discovers the existence of CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy). A brain trauma athletes of certain sports (mostly body contact sports) could get. Like top players of the NFL. This because they have to endure huge blows on their heads, countless times during their careers. In other words, their brains are slowly beaten to pulp. The end result is that these players inevitably change into aggressive, half-crazed hopeless cases, tormented by hallucinations, inner voices and a splitting headache (just to name a few symptoms). In most cases, their symptoms will be classified as an early stage of the Alzheimer's disease. After an autopsy on the deceased Mike Webster (David Morse), Dr. Omalu decides on his own to let Webster's brains being examined. This is how he discovered the true nature of Webster's strange behavior. And after examining brains of other former star players who committed suicide, it showed that they had the same symptom. Time for the NFL to take countermeasures. But not to protect future players for those injuries. We witness an outright clash between Dr. Omalu and the CEO's of the NFL, who consider this national sport in danger of disappearing when it appears to be unhealthy to bash your helmeted head against others all your life (I'm not a doctor, but I knew this wouldn't be healthy). Just as Dr. Omalu I don't know zip about American football. I also don't understand how come an entire nation is crazy about this particular sport. However, American football became an industry, with hundreds of thousands employed there and where a lot of money is made. Despite the generous donations from the NFL to different charities, it's obvious they want to protect their source of income, at all costs, against this Nigerian immigrant. And if it doesn't work with telephone threats and intimidation, they'll surely find a way to send him back to his homeland. Omalu versus the NFL. It sounds just like an exciting Super Bowl."Concussion" is a moving and emotional film. Actually, it's quite sad when you see how those huge, muscled guys end up as a heap of misery. And of course again an outsider who puts his finger on the problem. Needless to say this is some brilliant acting by Will Smith. One similar to that of "The Pursuit of Happiness". Overall, I think Smith is an excellent actor who in my eyes only twice made a mistake when it's about choosing a role. And for me that's "Wild Wild West" and "After Earth". In this movie he's once again excellent as the devout, sometimes naive but brilliant physician who has some bizarre rituals while performing an autopsy. This film was perfect to get an Oscar nomination. That explains the release date of course. Unfortunately, probably there were some American football fans among the jurors, making it being nipped in the bud. I'm also sure that Smith's popularity won't benefit from it.Also, the supporting roles were superb. Especially the traumatized Webster, in an admirable way played by David Morse. A beautiful and shocking interpretation at the same time. And also an impressive usage of makeup. It seemed as if Webster's forehead hid a swollen tumor. Even Alec Baldwin as the remorseful Dr. Julian Bailes was convincing. And finally, there is the lovely Gugu Mbatha-Raw, a Kenyan girl who stayed over at Dr. Omalu's house. Of course her contribution serves to romanticize this serious subject. Before you know it, she walks around pregnant."Concussion" is on the one hand an indictment against the NFL bastion. But on the other hand this national sport is also being praised a bit and shows some legendary moments of NFL matches. Even Prema quotes the following: "You should see this, Bennett. It's in fact something beautiful". All in all it's clear that money is more important than using common sense. I just wonder if this film will cause something of a stir. Certainly when you see how much fuss there was about an innocent nipple slip during the Super Bowl. Frankly, I think this storm (if it shows up) will lie down quickly, and everything stays the same. I just had one major question : how will an ex-NFL player feel, after watching this movie!More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The serious case of the mind and peril of announcing it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith is probably one of the best uncrowned actors without Oscar award on his name. He can portray his role with outstandingly natural conviction, and he does no less as Dr. Bennet Omalu here. This is a biopic about the determined doctor, his discovery of a malady and also uniquely about the popular sport.Dr. Omalu is a coroner who incidentally comes across a famous football player, sadly after his tragic death. He becomes curious of the cause of death and his research eventually becomes larger than he originally expected. It's a good biography which can be enjoyed for those even without much knowledge about the sport as it translates the procedure in approachable manner.As the lead Will Smith doesn't disappoint, he presents a variety of emotions with good origin accent. This is a story when the more he tries to help the more resistance he encounters, voiced by a compelling script. Both his personal and private lives are changed by the finding, furthermore the repercussion ripples beyond towards the lives of others.The movie has a respect towards the sport source and it's careful on presenting the subject without making judgment. It does tend to spread too thinly across the runtime with administrative process. Admittedly this is an integral part, but more time could be spent on the athletes themselves. The tension is built slowly and it's kept better in some instances than the others. Nevertheless, it doesn't take away too much from the sophisticated drama."Concussion" is an informative guide to the mind and its plague told by an educated thinker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Concussed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the true story of how a Nigerian-born pathologist persisted in exposing the long term health dangers of head injuries in football, 'Concussion' tells a fascinating slice of recent history. The negative effects of multiple concussions were apparently known to the NFL for years, but covered up by those promoting the sport, and the movie succeeds best when exploring this conspiracy and the difficulty of tackling a large organisation with high-up connections. The film is, however, only partially about this with at least half the screen time dedicated to the pathologist's personal life, which is nowhere near as engaging. There is something acute in how our protagonist, played by Will Smith, gradually learns to integrate into society at the same time so many NFL players start to slip out, but the filmmakers never make much of this irony and Smith learning to dance at a night club or gradually romancing a Kenyan woman forced into his company simply does not make for good viewing. Smith plays quite a conceited and arrogant character too, boasting about his many achievements from the very first scene and second-guessing the prejudices of others (accusing others of regarding him as a "voodoo doctor"). Accent aside, Smith is not very remarkable either for all the controversy over his failure to secure an Oscar nomination. David Morse is, however, very, very good as the first NFL player in the film to lose his mind and Matthew Willig is excellent too. Whatever the case, the film certainly ends on a strong note with an absolutely haunting final shot.</fullReview>

Now that's an awesome performance.

		<fullReview>I was interested in this movie after seeing the Frontline documentary, "League of Denial" which focused on the concussion issue in the NFL. After seeing the trailer and hearing Will Smith's portrayal of Dr. Omalu, I was determined to see the film. The way he perfected Omalu's dialect was quite impressive, and is perhaps the greatest part of the movie. I gave the film a 7 out of 10 because I was expecting a heavier focus on CTE itself. I though there was too much about Omalu's background. Maybe that is because I have already seen the CTE documentary and was expecting something similar. Overall, this movie was great, just not what I was expecting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"When's he coming back?he's done for the season?I found so much scar tissue underneath that boy's knee that he shouldn't have even been playing." "Oh wow, he never said anything to me about his knee pain," replied Bud Kilmer after visiting his star quarterback Lance Harbor in the hospital after suffering a serious injury in the most recent game. For those familiar with that film and having played the game of football at the division one level or higher, it's likely they have either been in that scenario or witnessed it before. A Coach willing to jeopardize the long-term health of one of his players all to be able to hang his next championship banner. We've all heard about these players being doped up on painkillers, getting injections prior to and during games, and a plethora of other treatments.As is typically the case, the chickens have come home to roost, and the leader of the revolution is a man by the name of Dr. Bennet Omalu played by Will Smith (a far cry of both time and maturity from his time as the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air). A man of courage. Someone who was willing to hold a $10 billion industry accountable for withholding crucial information regarding player safety. After the tragic 2002 passing of Michael "Iron Mike" Webster, Omalu performed the autopsy and made shocking discoveries about Webster's brain. His desire to examine his deceased patient's brain more in depth is met with harsh criticism and resentment by the Pittsburgh faithful. Despite this obstacle and its hefty financial costs, he continues with his work.Continuation with this work leads Omalu to conclude that while cardiac arrest may have been listed as the cause of Webster's death, playing football for so long is what ultimately killed him in the form of CTE. He suggests the same thing with deceased players Terry Long (suicide), Justin Strzelczyk (car accident), and Andre Waters (suicide). As these deaths happen consecutively (2004-2006), the NFL is finally forced to acknowledge his research and give it some consideration. However, newly crowned commissioner Roger Goodell does not take Omalu or his research seriously. They display such sentiments by disallowing Omalu to even be in the room and requesting former Steelers team doctor Julian Bailes to present instead. While thoroughly distraught and still under great pressure to back down, (despite the stalking of his pregnant wife and a politically driven prosecution on corruption charges aimed at forcing his testimony), Omalu continues.The final straw comes when Dave Duerson, an NFL Players Association executive commits suicide due to growing cognitive problems and requests Omalu to examine his brain in a suicide note. Many will view this film and ask what makes it so great? The answer is clear. Concussion puts a mirror to all of our faces and forces us to take long hard looks at the ugliest parts of our inner selves. It's not as much about why the NFL withheld such vital information about the long- term damage football could do to the body as it is why we as the audience find such pleasure in watching this barbaric game. It's about why these players voluntarily step onto the field with injuries galore. It's about why team doctors sometimes abandon their oath in allowing players to go back onto the field. While this entire film is important, perhaps the most telling part is when Omalu gives the demonstration of what happens to the human brain after repeated blows by using a fish in a water-filled jar and shaking it horizontally.Seeing that image and then picturing that happening to someone's brain multiple times on the football field is terrifying to say the least. It's enough to make you never watch a football game the same way again. The film also humanizes the NFL. It exposes their biggest fear. A fear that some guys will begin to say to hell with this game. A fear that some will follow the trends of young retirees like Jake Locker and numerous 49er players. Should such realizations continue, then slowly but surely, those billions the NFL brings in will start to dwindle. Eventually, that means no more high life, no more excessive luxuries at the expense of guys literally killing each other, no more ownership of an entire day of the week. Indeed that power is difficult to give up. While I don't promise to discontinue watching football altogether, I certainly can no longer ignore the outrageous price it costs to play this game at its highest level. For those who can, may the good Lord have mercy on your souls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific film - Will Smith excels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best football-related films I've seen. You see the stark, tragic reality of how any corporation abuses workers and doesn't really care if they live or die, as long as the money rolls in. But we love football, so it's OK, right? I don't think you'll feel the same after watching this film.This film is based on the true story of Dr Bennet Omalu (Will Smith), a Nigerian doctor with multiple degrees, who discovered Chronic Tragic Encephalopathy (CTE) in football players. Omalu was a pathologist who found life in the dead patients he autopsied. Taking place in Pittsburgh, Omalu notices that football players are doing strange things that don't match the condition of their brains to their age. His journey is just beginning when he discovers massive damage to ex-players' brains.Alec Baldwin also stars as Dr Bailes, ex-team Doctor who believes in the science that shows CTE is real. Baldwin strikes the right amount of righteous indignation at the NFL executives as they reign in the stagecoaches to protect their sport from attack.The Director Landesman weaves a nice story that slowly pulls you in to believing, as player after player succumb to tragedy. The scenes weave through multiple lives, but you are never lost - excellent connections were built to keep you on track. Besides Smith and Baldwin, there were great performances from Albert Brooks as Dr Wecht, Smith's protégé/mentor, and newcomer Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Prema, a recent immigrant from Kenya seeking a helping hand in a new land.Tension gets ratcheted up slowly but surely, leaving you wondering and hoping that sanity prevails. The ending won't leave you cheering, but rather, wondering, wondering about why it always seems to take death to get businesses to change.Concussion is a must-see movie. Enjoy.</fullReview>

But as the movie tells of a sport related story, it doesn't really established the relation between the doctor and the sport itself. With most of the movie happening around the doctor, the sport itself lacked appearance and thus felt distant even though this movie is based on a true story. The romance thing feels really flat, as only that it is used to lengthen the movie's duration somehow. Further the spouse character doesn't really fit into the whole story that her appearance felt redundant. All the athletes portrayed are pictured convincing enough, although again, the movie seemed like it didn't do them the justice of depicting their better days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have seen many inspirational football movies like "Remember the titans" , "Invictus" which portrays the good side of football.But concussion is a movie which portrays the other side of football we've never seen.The director almost manages to portray the true events on screen.This movie also had shades of "The insider" which also deals about a doctor going against big organizationsWill Smith plays the protagonist Dr. Bennet Omalu . He is back at what he does best.When it comes to playing a struggling character , Will Smith pulls it off easily. His change of accent was also good. The supporting actors Alec Baldwin and Albert Brooks also played their roles perfectly.Overall, Concussion can be watched for its interesting story-line and Will Smith's comeback performance</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Concussion - A revelation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can never understand sports like boxing where people hit each other so savagely that it deforms you. You can add American football to that list. I know these are very popular sports but my personal opinion is that it is somewhat sad to see men hit each other to claim victory. I used to actually wonder 'don't skulls crack when big men bang into each other with such animal ferocity?' And boy was I glad to see a movie on the same thought.Concussion is a true story about a Nigerian pathologist who discovers CTE (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy ) in American footballers. CTE is a phenomenon where long term effects of smashing into each other makes brains go mush. Dr. Bennet Omalu, played by the talented Will Smith, is this principled, humane pathologist who with his determination found out how degenerative the sport is for players. The NFL apparently opposed this view because obviously it means loss of business. As one dialogue in the movie goes 'Imagine if even one percent of mothers forbid their kids to not take up football ? you know what it would do to the sport? It would be dead before you know it.'The movie shows how cruel the world is when profits and a business model is threatened. How far a conglomerate will go to protect itself. It shows why some humans go down in history ? for their principles, for their determination to lead and fight the world to go forward in what they believe in. The movie is more than anything, a movie about human psychology which is what made it so interesting.The performances were really good ? especially Will Smith (though he did lose his accent a few times). After a few sci-fi roles, he is solid with a more than realistic portrayal of Dr. Omalu. Alec Baldwin, as his partner in 'crime' gives a serious, thoughtful performances as well. The movie at times is extremely slow which was my only grouse. But overall, a tightly edited and directed film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science versus powerful professional association in the American football.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Concussion is a 2015 American biographical sports medical drama film directed and written by Peter Landesman. This film is based on the 2009 GQ exposé "Game Brain" by Jeanne Marie Laskas. The film stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian forensic pathologist who fought against efforts by the National Football League to suppress his research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) brain damage suffered by professional football players. The film also stars Alec Baldwin, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, and Albert Brooks. Columbia Pictures released the film on December 25, 2015.--Critical response: -On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 60%, based on 153 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site's consensus reads, "Concussion lands a solid, well-acted hit on its impressively timely subject matter, even if its traditional sports drama structure is a little too safe to deserve a full-on dance in the end zone." On Metacritic, the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.-Will Smith's performance was praised for being "sensitive (and) understated" by The Denver Post.--Controversy: -Family members of Dave Duerson, a former NFL player who suffered from CTE, claimed the film portrayed Duerson in a bad light. In one scene, Duerson's character called Omalu's character a "quack" in addition to telling him "to go back to Africa" and "get away from our game." In another scene of the film, Duerson mocked former NFL player Andre Waters when he filed an application for benefits in connection with head injuries he sustained while playing in the NFL. Duerson's family members stated these scenes were false.-In response, Landesman, the film's director, stated that the film was "emotionally and spiritually accurate all the way through". -On December 21, 2015, Slate writer Daniel Engber published an article critical of the over-dramatization by the film, citing in particular a 2012 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health study indicating that football players, on average compared to the population as a whole, live longer lives, though the study also indicates, as Engber points out, that former football players are also more likely to suffer, and die, from neurodegenerative disease.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith was good in this film and he created an interesting character. His doctor Omalu was not just a silly accent, as some have called him, but a many layered character with whom you could empathise in his struggles. And I also liked David Morse in his small part but Concussion's biggest problem is that it's really not a people story. It's more concerned about the events and and the people serve more as accessories to them.Also they clearly didn't want to alienate football fans by making this a ?football = bad" movie. But how they went about doing this was by having the various characters give ?football is great" speeches and it all comes out as lots of tell and little show. If what they wanted to do was show why it matters to so many people they should have made the audiences feel what a majestic game it is. But they don't and the film becomes a boring fence sitter.The best part about Concussion's story is its good themes about religion. Through out the film it talks about how sport has taken the church's place in the modern world and just how inadequate it is in that role. There are some smart things in this story but they are never fully realised.Overall Concussion is a decent film but more fitting for the small screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film opens with an entertaining and curiosity-evoking scene that makes you forget that it is exposition and a plot device. In most cases I would find this otherwise negative in a film. Especially if it is used to introduce a character but like the rest of the film, it keeps you wanting more: from the story, from performances.'Will Smith' does another Drama which I personally believe is where he excels with his acting. After his performances in 'Pursuit of Happiness' and 'Seven Pounds', I knew to expect something passionate and powerful.I gave this film an 7 out of 10 because of its believability and execution from script to performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Changes. &#x2666; Grade C+</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All films which are 'based on a true story' have little effect quotient in them, not because of how they are made, but because of how they are made to look. Concussion is one such medical drama that starts off well but ends up injuring itself.Bennet (Smith) is a Nigerian pathologist who stumbles upon a dangerous and yet undiscovered disease while performing autopsy on a football player and goes on to write a paper about it, pitting himself up against the football fraternity. The story is about his personal and professional struggle regarding this new discovery and how he is oppressed by NFL and lovers of the game collectively. While this is enough material to make biographical content look like propaganda, there isn't much embrace to realism happening in the narration. The film says that 'he will stop at nothing to expose the truth,' which is true. But what next? Nothing.People are still playing and watching and going mad about the game and that is the greatest evidence why the film's theme and story is a cold turkey. Oh yes, there is entertainment in the first act, but all goes haywire in the third act as FBI and the US administration barge in (like they always do).The screenplay is fine, not great, and manages to tell a story. Smith's accent may be a problem for some, but I think it was a necessity; his air is good. Baldwin also does a fine job as Bennet's helping hand. Overall, the way the ending comes out is what plays with the believability and effectiveness of the film. Nevertheless, it deserves a watch.BOTTOM LINE: Concussion may look like propaganda, but it is not, and the biggest problem with the film is that it falters at the end, making itself look unrealistic.GRADE: C+Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"America A Little Lower Than Heaven"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We should be, and we are, grateful for the crumbs, whenever Hollywood provides audiences with the portrait of a courageous individual who has the strength of character to stand against impossible odds and defy powerful forces in American society. It will be interesting in a few years to look up Dr. Bennet Omalu, now in California, and discover what will have happened to him, after all the media attention which has now been focused his way. There is a price to be paid, in today's world, for articulating bedrock faith in historical Christianity, the traditions of which were the basis of the film's true portrayal of Dr. Omalu's spiritual approach to all the thousands of autopsies he has performed, in recognition that a human being consists of body, soul, and spirit.But where there is faith on the part of one man, there is also cynicism on the part of others. In this case, three months before the film's official release, the New York Times released a story that the top people at Sony, through their company lawyers, exchanged emails with the film's creative team, seeking to pacify the NFL. Call it damage control, or simply protecting a 'narrative'. No villains, please.We should be, and we are, so grateful that this movie was actually made. It will never jolt America with a Sunday Football Revolution, but thankfully there will be parents here and there who will take the lesson to heart, for the sake of their children, before the whole culture's usual attention-span amnesia kicks in (pun intended).Most interesting to industry watchers is how the choice of the director was made, who worked with the lady who wrote up the original magazine story about Dr. Omalu for GQ, to come up with a shooting script.Peter Landesman has moved up from being a foreign correspondent, covering wars of the American Empire for the MSM, and now he is a respected film director with two other critically acclaimed movies under his belt. The film "Parkland" gave a new generation an on-the-ground-running portrayal of events when John F. Kennedy was killed, especially right there live-and-in-person in the Dallas hospital... without discussing the autopsy reports, or showing the presence of three different Presidential coffins.Landesman's next opus was "To Kill The Messenger," and that film promotes a 'narrative' that investigative reporter Gary Webb committed suicide, after outing the CIA for drug running.Now in "Concussion," the audience can feast on revelations about sports injuries, without dwelling on identifying the accessories culpable for crimes committed against players and public alike over decades.Kudos to Dr. Bennet Omula, whose present euphoria will inevitably deflate, bringing him back to earth. He is right in saying that America is just a little below Heaven. But "just a little" is still a long way down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Concussion is about profit before people. Football/N F L is cultural and economically a big social force when one challenges football one is challenging America itself. Post Concussion syndrome has been ignored and ignorance of the condition creates a culture of profit before people. Concussion accurately portrays the madness that dementia induces as proteins suffocates the brain. Mike Webster became a homeless man left behind. A outsider (from Africa) with no idea of the N F L wonders how do these athletes get early dementia. M R I/ Cat scans show nothing and on the coroner's own dollar uses slices of Webster's brain and discovers brain trauma. Concussion is an example of scientific method vs emotion and corporate greed. Well acted and directed, one experiences people getting fired, strain, and emotional dark side of humanity. One of the N F L board members turns his back on a dementia teammate only to suffer ironically the same fate. After the board member's suicide does the N F L finally get it. A painful learning experience. A movie of faith, values and finding the truth, Seven out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of Concussion is really interesting. It's mind-blowing that it's based on true events. After hearing and reading lots of good comments about the movie, I genuinely expected a lot from this picture. Unfortunately, I was disappointed because the script was poorly written and the whole film's direction was a disaster. The script seems to be filled with shallow twists that had been seen in hundreds of other movies and that made the promising film look like another cheap Hollywood movie made for the masses. The story is greatly exploited here in this film as a bait for movie-goers.However, the film was saved by the the story, and the decent acting of Will Smith. Undoubtedly, not all people knew the story beforehand, and I personally was eager to know more after the film. So in this sense the film was a success. All in all, the film is not so fantastic as other reviews say. The film is clearly over-rated. However, the film is a good choice for those who want to spend some free time and just relax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith is brilliant and so is Alec Baldwin in this Compelling Drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie "Concussion" opens with former Steelers football player, Iron Mike Lewis (David Morse) talking to a group about his football years. No one, least of all Iron Mike is aware he has a broken brain that will lead to this poor man's downfall. The scene cuts to Mr. Lewis and it is sad indeed! He is homeless, broke, and estranged from his family. Mike is struggling with headaches and forgetfulness. He tries to tell his friend, Justin Strzelczyk who is also a former football player about his problems, but Justin doesn't really understand. Mike visits the team doctor, Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin) and is given prescriptions to help him with his condition.The next scene introduces Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) as a compassionate coroner from Nigeria, Africa who is doing an autopsy. Dr. Omalu talks to his cadavers in an understanding way and is very good at his job. Dr. Omalu will figure into Iron Mike's death and he talks to the dead man nicely as well before he cuts into him. Iron Mike's brain seems fine, but Dr. Omalu wants to investigate further because a man of 50-years-old who is healthy would not die unexpectedly unless something happened in that man's life. Dr. Omalu orders a more informative test and this reveals horrible damage to Iron Mike's brain. The medical literature points to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) that is a degenerative brain disease from repeated head trauma. CTE leads to dementia, aggression, and depression. Pretty soon, other former football stars are dying of CTE and this includes Justin Strzelczyk. Dr. Omalu along with coroner Cyril Wecht and neurologist Steven DeKosky wants to publish these findings of CTE as a warning to the NFL to take care of brain traumas the players incur during games. This doesn't bode well with the NFL and the group in fact tries to suppress Dr. Omalu's findings. The one thing that gives Dr. Omalu's report credence is the fact a football player named Tom McHale killed himself and in writing said he wanted to donate his brain to CTE research. Will Smith is wonderful as the compassionate, intelligent doctor who wants to help out the athletes so they don't suffer the effects of CTE. Alec Baldwin is great too as the fellow author of the CTE piece and so is the actor who plays the outspoken Cyril Wecht. I think this is one of the best real-life stories out there. In a weird way Dr. Omalu is like a black Erin Brockovich. Like her, he wanted to take on a huge corporation that was letting people get hurt. Unlike her, Dr. Omalu did not talk like a sailor or dress like a street walker! I think Dr. Omalu's research will help the NFL understand they need to do more to help football players past and present to protect their brains!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading up about Will Smith's upcoming role in Suicide Squad,I was surprised to recently find out that before Smith returns to the Comic-Book world that he was to star in a fact-based Drama,which led to me getting ready to see the game take place.The plot:Becoming a legend in the NFL, Mike Webster finds himself struggling once he retires,with Webster being having to sell his NFL ring.Suffering from serve mental issues,Webster dies from a suicide at just 50 years old.Coming over to the US from Nigeria, Dr. Bennet Omalu decides to perform a full autopsy on Webster.Studying CT Scans done just 6 months before his death, Omalu is surprised to find no sign of Webster suffering from serve brain damage.Wanting to find out what led to Webster mentally deterioration,Omalu decides to spend his own money for extensive tissue analyses to be performed on Webster's brain.Getting the results,Omalu discovers that Webster suffered from Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE),which leads to Omalu wondering about how many other NFL players have suffered from CTE.View on the film:Carrying his fake Nigerian accent in a natural manner,Will Smith gives a remarkably restrained performance as Omalu.Showing no sign of his blockbuster swagger,Smith delicately shows Omalu's determination to research on CTE with a quiet passion,which brilliantly stands above the thunder &amp; lightning response that Omalu receives for his discoveries. Whilst her character is not given the depth which appears to be on offer, Gugu Mbatha-Raw gives a graceful performance as Prema Mutiso,with Mbatha-Raw's expressive body language giving the relationship with Omalu a real warmth.Based on an article in GQ magazine by Jeanne Marie Laskas,the screenplay by writer/director Peter Landesman clearly displays his investigative journalism past,by tackling each of Omalu's attempts to make CTE public knowledge with an intense urgency,as Landesman presents each piece of Omalu's study of CTE on NFL players in a clear and assessable manner, with Landsman giving the title a dramatic atmosphere,as Omalu finds the NFL (and other doctors) trying to keep his results under wraps.Aiming to express the importance that Mutiso plays in Omalu's life,Landesman opens up their relationship in sweet sweeping notes which lack the attention to detail and focus that Omalu's CTE studies are given,which leads to the romance always feeling one step behind.Filmed on location in Pittsburgh,Landesman &amp; cinematographer Salvatore Totino (who earlier worked on Oliver Stone's football film Any Given Sunday) give the setting a warm,dusty blue (collar) appearance which subtly links up to "the man V the system" that Omalu is facing.Spending a good amount of the film in the morgue,Landesman unveils a strong sensitive approach to the scenes,thanks to tightly held corner shots giving the viewer a hint of the location but keeping well away from any blood/gore,to instead focus on Omalu's diagnosis of CTE.</fullReview>

This film also show to us how "bad" is the USA government,FBI,head of sports to this kind of things..what i am trying to say is that USA is doing everything for money,i am pretty sure they could also cure the cancer and other serious illness but all they thing about is money ,thats why there is no cure for these kind of illness yet..In a few words,the film is not bad but i found it a bit boring to watch,thank god i didn't watch it at the cinema</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's what the NFL tells Omalu. Whether it's an accurate statement or not, you've got to have a strong religion to not take heed of the movie's message after watching it. And I do mean religion. Like the movie points out, the NFL owns a day of the week, the same day the church used to own. And that's not all they own. They have enough influence to make the FBI end the careers of Omalu and his boss at the Allegheny County coroner's office for daring to buck the NFL party line on concussions. Will Smith's performance is outstanding. And so is David Morse's as Mike Webster. The connection between the enormous hits we love to watch on the field and what happens to the human brain, floating inside a fluid-filled skull without any anatomical seat belt, is chilling. If you have children interested in this sport, they and you need to know there are risks beyond broken bones and ACLs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Loved This Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Will Smith, especially when he plays serious roles. I avoided this movie initially for several reasons among them that there seemed to be no buzz, no awards, and I'd never heard of the real Dr.Bennet Omalu or Mike Webster for that matter. And then when the controversy about the lack of diversity in the academy award noms came out, I wanted to wait before I watched 'Concussion'. I can see what all of the fuss was about. This should have had several academy nods including Smith's role and best pic. Would it have won? Who knows. But the fact that hardly anyone in the industry short-listed this movie is very strange. A great cast, including Albert Brooks and Mike O'Malley in supporting roles, but it's Smith that carries this thing to a satisfying end. This isn't a movie about race, although the screenplay and Smith's quiet and subtle performance alludes to it in several smart scenes in a way that acknowledges it but also keeps it from being a key factor in the movie. The movie is about greed and corporate America. It would be a tired formula if it wasn't true. Not sure how it could have been ignored during awards season. Will watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 2002. Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) is the junior forensic pathologist in Pittsburgh. During the weekend, beloved Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster is found dead. Omalu is the low man and on call. Using his own money, he examines Webster's brain and discovers unexpected damage. With his boss Dr. Cyril Wecht (Albert Brooks) and others, he publishes a medical paper calling the disease Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). Webster's former team doctor Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin) also gives his support as the group faces off against the might of the NFL.It's an important story. It's an interesting story. Will Smith does the job well. It's simply lacks drama and the tension is not that high. It's a compelling watch for the most part. There are scenes suggesting the NFL coming after the doctors but they don't always say it directly. The punches are pulled a little and considering it's the NFL, I don't blame them. The retelling by Dr. Omalu of essentially the same story is slightly more intense. The movie adds very little drama to the true story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not a bad movie. The topic is important, the acting good. Clearly the NFL knew the danger of multiple concussions and chose not to do anything about them. As a result of the current concussion protocols, the game is safer though less interesting. There are now penalties every other play.Yes, the doctor who revealing CTE was black though as far as I know he didn't make a big deal out of that. This movie does. We are told several times how many degrees this doctor received. Well there are many MD/Ph.D.s in medicine, many from top US medical schools. The weakest med students are forced to go into pathology in the US because that field pays the least and is the least interesting. Yes there are some black MDs but they are less than 4% of all MDs and less than 2% of all dept. chairmen.The white doctor in our hero's office is antagonistic for absolutely no reason, a typical white caricature in PC movies these days. It added nothing to the movie. The NFL didn't see this doctor not because he was black but because he was not widely published and respected in his field. They would have ignored a Jew or an Asian with the same credentials.It is frustrating that Hollywood still finds the need to pander to certain groups, and they did in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The villain is not just a colossal organization, it's not just a gargantuan country... It's human nature.Like football, the world is at loggerheads propelled by selfishness, and like the players, humanity suffer from "ethical CTE"... And like the NFL, we don't want to admit it, because that means recognition of being bankrupt, morally.This is mainly why, this movie spoke to me and engaged. Greed vs Truth, that lead to Apology vs Bribery. Honestly, after this movie, one has to ask themselves; How is it, that this film performed badly at The Box Office?, and; How true are the findings of the Actuaries, seeing as, like all those doctors before them, who represented The NFL, lied.Peter Landesman was satisfactory on the directors chair, though admittedly, the movie could've come out much more, "hard hitting". The pace at times, was sedate, and the editing, jerky... But overall, the film was captivating. The dialogue was filled with so many sublime lines, so many I just couldn't keep up... And every time I heard them, the movie won me over more and more. "Mike Webster goes mad, and nobody asks why. They make fun of him. They insult him on TV, and they want to pretend that he's disease doesn't exist... And they want to bury me".Will Smith was amazing, and the reason he may have seemed less amazing is perhaps because, we expect him to be amazing, and so when he is, we're used to it. Also, his Nigerian accent, unlike many Americans before him, was well researched and practiced... It didn't sound like some generic African accent.I'd like to give this movie an 8/10... But, maybe it didn't quite reach that level, so, to stay true to my Review Title, I'll give it a solid 7.7/10.</fullReview>

People start playing football as kids with hope that one day they will get a college scholarship for football and then possibly go pro. If football stopped, kids would be left without dreams and careers that they have been training for their whole lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The NFL cover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie did a great job telling the story of a deadly disease that numerous NFL players fell victim to. It is shocking that this is based on a true story, and that it happened prior to 2011.Dr.Bennet Omalu, played by Will Smith, was the one who made the discovery and found the scientific proof that supported his research that football was the cause of deaths of many of the league's players. The NFL tried to shut him up, but Dr. Omalu would not stop because of the severity of his findings. Dr. Omalu's intention was to bring awareness so that safeguards could be implemented to prevent the diseases caused from suffering numerous blows to the head.Will Smith's performance was good, but it could have been better. The thing that he seemed to struggle with was the Nigerian accent he had to speak in. There were moments were he sold the accent, but then there were moments where it was not convincing. Considering how dynamic of an actor Will Smith is, he could have done better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar Worthy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the most controversial thing to happen to movies this past year was that revolving around race when it came to the Oscars. The flame that lit the fuse on the discussion came from Jada Pinkett Smith, actress and wife of Will Smith, who was upset that more blacks did not make the final cut when it came to the awards, especially since her husband had done such a wonderful job in the film "CONCUSSION". The argument can be made for both sides of the issue but with the release this week of that film the time to discuss Smith's performance and whether or not it was Oscar worthy is at hand.The movie features Smith in the true story of Dr. Bennett Omalu, an American immigrant and forensic neuropathologist in Pittsburgh who is doing the autopsy on Mike Webster. Webster was a star for the professional football team the Pittsburgh Steelers who had fallen on hard times after retiring suffering bouts or amnesia, dementia, depression and more while living out of his truck. Having died of an apparent heart attack at age 50, Omalu made a discovery while doing his autopsy on Webster.While he had these various issues, Webster's brain looked normal. While looking further into this Omalu discovers that Webster suffered from symptoms similar to those of professional boxers and in researching more issues with his brain tissue comes to the conclusion that he suffered from something unheard of before and which he names CTE of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. He publishes a paper on his findings alongside two well respected physicians and that's when things get nasty.While Omalu thought that his findings would be greeted with praise from the NFL he instead finds them doing their best to ruin his reputation and to force him out of his lab. The big business aspect of the game comes at him full force when the league refutes his findings and calls for him to retract his paper. Knowing the paper is accurate he refuses and the attacks on his findings and personal life begin.As all of this is proceeding Omalu is also discovering something he was never focused on before. With a bit of nudging from his pastor, he takes on a boarder and new immigrant to help her acclimate to the US, Prema Mutiso (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). The two become close friends first and then find an attraction that leads them to marriage. As the attacks on Omalu continue they take their toll on Prema as well.A legal battles ensues but not before Omalu finds a sympathetic ear in the form of Dr. Julian Bales (Alex Baldwin), a former physician for the Steelers. His conscious getting the better of him as ex-players he once patched up and sent back into the game begin dying from CTE, Bales assist Omalu not just in finding others who will back him up but in contacting NFL officials as well to bring this problem to into the limelight. Just what happens in the end makes for a well-made drama based on real life events that will make you think about the sport as well as those behind it.It seems a poor choice of words to say that a movie based on such a tragedy is entertaining but the fact it that the movie does entertain as well as inform. There is not a bad performance among the entire cast here. This include David Morse in an almost unrecognizable part as Webster. Well shot, well directed and well written, the movie is one that everyone should see, in particular anyone hoping to involve their children in sports.Which brings us to the question of Will Smith and his lack of a nomination for an Oscar for her performance here. When I think of the Oscar I've always thought that the awards were supposed to single people out for exceptional work be it photography, writing, directing or acting. With acting it needs to be a performance that stands out, that displays something different for the actor involved from anything done previously and should be so exceptional as to be better than anyone else. While Smith does an admirable job here as he always does I don't think it was Oscar worthy. Yes it's good but the best performance of any actor over the past year? I don't think so. Smith has developed from a rap star to serious actor over the years and will undoubtedly find that opportunity for an Oscar in his future. But this was not the role that would take him there.The topic in the film is one that needs to be discussed and from the ending of the film make you wonder just how serious it has been taken. It isn't a "cause" movie but it does deliver an important message about the problems of injuries in major sports. It's a movie that is well worth renting and for fans of Smith and movies of this nature worth adding to your collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful film, but a flawed film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Concussion was a film I was surprised a bit by how much I really enjoyed it overall. It was excellent and had a lot of really enjoyable moments in it. However the film doesn't go as dark as it should and instead fills itself up with this love story that takes away from the powerful message that the film was trying to convey and instead gets you to invested in the love story that is being shown on the film's screen right now. Along with all the grotesque imagery. This is a film that tries to hook you through the amazing acting of Will Smith. Who does a great job in the film undoubtedly. But the brunt of both the love and the hate need to go to Peter Landesman who seems to be doing a lot of true story films as of late as he tries to make a emotional impact on the eyes of the viewers right now.Overall Concussion is a film that you should defiantly catch at some point and then figure out your own opinions about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Concussion' was somewhat hard to watch, not only because it depicted the sad decline and death of several football players I had watched over the years, but also because of the graphic nature of some scenes; apparently the only way to diagnose the disease/condition these players were afflicted with is through autopsy. The movie tries not to be anti- football, but for the sake of ramping up drama and for the sake of emotional impact, the NFL and its fans to an extent have to be made into villains (although probably no more so than in past motion pictures such as 'Any Given Sunday' and 'North Dallas Forty'). The story of the main character's struggle to get the NFL, medical world, and general public to recognize this condition makes for fairly gripping viewing. It seems counter-intuitive that a sport involving giant men smashing into each other repetitively could produce a condition that was largely unknown or unacknowledged until historically very recently, but I suppose this is a testament to the institution that tried so long to ignore or discredit any such connection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent piece. After watching it I read a little about CTE on Wiki, where it also mentions TBI. Then I thought about some help/treatment for those ex-players and ex-soldiers and there was no mention of it at all. Does it mean there is none? Then I remembered reading an article about some Polish soldier getting a treatment (with good results) consisting of about 2 months of therapy on breathing pure oxygen. Now, apparently he suffered from PTSD and maybe he did, but what if it was TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) or CTE and there was a treatment for them all? Obviously, I'm no expert, but it would be great if there was some help for people suffering from this terrible conditions.PS.When I read about TBI I also remembered hearing that in Falklands War 255 soldiers British soldiers (SF Tier 1 and 2) where killed in combat, but another 200 committed suicide afterwards. How about that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie impresses even for an European like myself who does not have the faintest clue about football (Its not played here). However the good acting and interesting subject matter make it a movie well worth watching, even if you do not know the sport.Will Smith puts on a fine performance and is convincing as Dr. Omalu, the accent however is a little on the fake side and distracts just a tiny bit from his performance, although you do get used to it after a while.The fight against the NFL to make them see what is wrong with the sport is well done, the NFL is the giant enemy at a distance, always there always willing to destroy the reputation, friends and family of Dr. Omalu without actually resorting to direct violence. Its a nice tactic to keep you on the edge of your seat "what can happen to him or his family" The love interest is also well played though it feels sometimes like its just there to make the movie a little longer than is needed.All in all this movie was a delight to watch, made me interested about a sport i did not know i had interest in and should be on your to watch list regardless in what place of the world you live in. A real all American movie for everyone in and outside of the USA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch PBS's "League of Denial" instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie. I know a lot of people who may not sit through a documentary but probably would sit through a good movie. I was hoping this would connect with them. However, this movie is a bit long-winded and boring. The movie was 2 hours long but it felt like it was 3.I felt like they tried to really stick to the facts but it didn't have that much of a dramatic impact. It was boring and little held my interest and this is a topic I am interested in. Some of the interludes of Omalu's personal life felt a little too long or unnecessary. I kind of wished the movie had layered in more of the football players' lives and their degenerating mental health as opposed to just a few scenes peppered in here or there. Maybe, even see some more of the NFL's denial of the seriousness of head injuries over the years. Even though the story is focused on the struggle of Dr. Omalu, exploring the NFL's denial and the players' realities more would have strengthened and added more depth to the movie as a whole - who is he fighting for? And, who/what is he fighting against? Even the racism and xenophobia that Dr. Omalu faced as an outsider taking down the USA's favorite sport was mostly just flat out stated. Basically, the script needed a very deft hand to weave it all together in an informative, real, and compelling way.Some of the acting was a little wonky. Will Smith is poorly cast as Dr. Omalu. Smith's accent ended up more as a stereotypical generic African accent. Other than the accent issues, his acting was fine in the role (and the Academy has not only nominated but has given Oscars to worse) but, and I put this in part on the director, I hated how leaky-eyed and lifeless Omalu was portrayed.Last season, when football kicked off, PBS simultaneously ran a documentary about CTE called "League of Denial." I highly recommend it. It was much more informative and interesting than this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story of a man who cares deeply for humanity and wagers an all out crusade to save it from ensuing disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ConcussionFilm is the medium which often assumes a gruesome responsibility .It helps in telling stories that connects millions all over the globe in an entertaining manner often rather in a populist way. Among all major forces of creation like music, literature, painting dramatics on celluloid has the potential to influence the society in a significant manner transcending boundaries of language and nationality as it touches a person prolifically visually. Many directors across the globe thereby use this medium to tell a strong story that is needed to be told either to give broader leverage to any incident or to make people aware that some incidents of paramount importance have taken place some time back in history and people around the globe needs to pay heed to it. The movie Concussion directed by Peter Landesman in every sense tries to strike a chord. It tries to tell the story of a single person's momentous grit and desire to rise against an adversary so great and powerful that it had almost ruined his normal functioning in life for a cause where very few people were at his side to express solidarity. The movie brought into life the extra ordinary journey of a man against insurmountable odds and his conviction to stay rooted at his goal of saving precious American lives. In order to add to credence to any strong issue in films stellar performances are required which has been the backbone of the film .The performance of actors are escalated when they seriously feel for the issue they are depicting in the film. Apart from the need to tell stories that are important, the way it is told in the film is also pivotal for connection with the audience. The film has been able to successfully connect all the dots required for creating an inspiring experience. Careful analysis of the individual facets of this experience will help to substantiate finding, Story- Based on the book Game Brain by Jeanne Marie Laskas the story adapted by director Peter Landesman has been able to sincerely portray the detriment and colossal opposition which the principal characters of the film have been able to emulate in their subsequent sincere efforts to showcase the crusade of a man against a monstrous adversary who left no stones unturned to disprove the sincere efforts made by the doctor Benett Omalu helped by few other fellow doctors. The degree of hostility and misunderstanding showed even by the community who had actually suffered to the greatest extent due to this onslaught encountered during their sporting days- the football players have been shown with great care and poise. The best part of the story was not to show the principal characters of the film in a black or white fashion but to show every character from a certain perspective or view point without being judgmental. Direction-Creative people suffer often from the curse of talent. Often directors, obsessed by their ability to create something original and beautiful takes so much pain and effort to portray their true creative finesse that creative aesthetics involved comes to dominate over the story of their creations. However in this film the true protagonist has been compassion and uncompromising grit displayed by a person believing in a certain cause being ready to take any amount of inconvenience and trouble for it. Acting- Acting is a collaborative process. The goal of any major successful acting enterprise is not to achieve any artistic crescendo where efforts are made to outplay each other. An acting performance that goes down in posterity is the one where actors cooperate with each other to take the narrative ahead without offending the gravity and sincerity of the issue to be depicted on screen. In this film Will Smith as the protagonist Dr Bennet Omalu the sincere earnest neurosurgeon ready to save troubled players from agony of physical and mental atrocities has indeed been the captain of the ship. However Alec Baldwin as Dr. Julian Bailes, Albert Brooks as Dr. Cyril Wecht, Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Prema Mutiso, David Morse as Mike Webster along with other supporting actors have been able to maintain the earnestness , compassion for the affected in a benevolent heart touching manner. Editing- Editing by William Goldenberg not only accentuates the drama but the coherence created by one scene spontaneously dissolving into the other generates picturesque images of emotion, restrain and serious resolve- the corner stone of the film. Music and Background score- Music and background by James Newton Howard helps in elevating the drama but definitely not among his best. However it succeeds in signifying the grave premise of the film- a David versus Goliath crusade for victory of human values and survival. Cinematography- In present times whatever quality a film has in terms of acting or artistic vision- technical works like cinematography and special effects are always first rate thanks to the huge advancement of technology and able application of these revolutionary contrivances to visual medium. Cinematography by ace cinematographer Salvatore Totino has been exquisite in this respect. Frames captured with deft hands have helped in creating a visual splendor aesthetic yet controlled and minimalism to avoid excessive melodrama of the conceived objective. Make up and Costume design- Make up by Pierce Austin and team and costume design by Dayna Pink has been such articulate and detailed that all the principal cast in their minor habits and nuances almost appeared as original men involved in the true incident.Last words- The film is a must watch for all of us who value truth over capital, determination to do good against monstrous opponents with vested interests. The film has been successful to illustrate the unbeatable spirit of a person to champion a cause so close to humanity that it sticks against every opposition and overcomes each obstacle that comes across it ways.

		<shortDescription>Trouble in Overtime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ConcussionEarnestly told, indignant, and passionate--Concussion takes on America's biggest sport to a largely effective degree. Based on a true story, the film tells the story of a pathologist, Dr. Bennet Omalu, an incredibly pious and straight-laced immigrant who, through his work, uncovers what would soon be termed CTE. In short, his resiliency and tenacity led him to the shocking reality that repetitive concussions can have profound long-term damage translating to death. Obviously not well received, the film follows his struggles for attention and the attacks he inevitably received.It's hard to say this is a fair film. I don't know quite enough to say definiteively, but certainly the film is biased, and has a dramatic flair that you would expect. I do believe it's very real, but perhaps the film's assertions that "football kills" are a bit over-the-top at times. Still, as a movie--it's an effective one, with a brilliant performance by will Smith. The entire cast is strong, and the film has a way of unfolding that makes it a very enthralling story, even though the actual events took much longer to unfold. In short, the director did an excellent job of condensing a subject in to a confined story, and an effective one.4/5 Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith Delivers in Concussion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Webster was a center for the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Kansas City Chiefs from 1974 to 1990. Nicknamed "Iron Mike", some say Webster is the best center in NFL history. He died at the age of 50 and was the first NFL player to be diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease caused by multiple concussions. Concussion focuses on Nigerian pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) who first diagnosed Webster (David Morse) and embarked on a study of other NFL players. The results of his findings put him at odds with the NFL and some of his fellow doctors as his efforts to bring light to the problem are met with stiff competition to keep him quiet. Omalu, under the supervision of Dr. Cyril Wecht (Albert Brooks), believed the NFL would be pleased to hear of his discovery so they could prevent it from happening any more. Wecht believed Omalu would ultimately become an American hero. Instead, he was met with opposition from the NFL, from fellow doctors, and even received death threats against himself and his family, forcing Omalu to make the impossible decision to continue pressing for his findings to become public knowledge or to retreat for his safety and the safety of those he loves. Webster's death was officially reported as being due to heart failure. Omalu commented that "cardiac arrest may be how he died, but not why". More players died, but the NFL continued to silence and shun Omalu until 2009 when Cincinnati Bengals' wide receiver Chris Henry was diagnosed with CTE after his death at the age of 26. Omalu had moved to California with his wife and started a family. He was invited to speak at an NFL convention dealing with head injuries and offered a prominent position at Washington, D.C. Players began to sue the NFL for concealing Omalu's findings. The cases were settled with the condition that what the NFL knew and when would not be revealed. Movies like Concussion are tough. It's based on a true story, but without significant digging, it's hard to know how much of the movie is true and how much has been embellished or changed to make it more of a movie-going draw. The all-star cast would indicate that enough of Hollywood's big hitters felt this was a good enough story to tell. It's a story that has the NFL vigorously figuring out new equipment, new training methods, new treatment and new rules to help prevent CTE from continuing to take lives. I predicted 3.5 stars, thinking it would be a movie I'd enjoy, hopefully be able to discern between fact and fiction, and may or may not make it to my home collection. I thought Will Smith gave a wonderfully honest and subtle performance as Dr. Omalu. The movie is nearly two hours long, but I could have used a little more. There is a scene where Omalu proposes to his girlfriend at a plot of land he has already purchased for the both of them. Later, after being threatened by the FBI, they leave the home to move to California and he is completely broken up about it. I would like to have seen some more of their relationship develop and their investment into the house to support the heartbreak a little more. I felt the explanations of what was going on in the brains of the NFL players was very effectively addressed so that anyone would understand. I bumped up my star rating to 4.0 stars as this was well worth the money to watch it and has a decent chance of making it to my home collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The NFL: The New Freaking Liars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of the league of the same year's Spotlight, but I am still glad this doctor's story was told and the sins were sought out.It is far from a secret to anyone that knows me that I loathe football. But, oddly, this damaging story to that sport didn't make me hate it more. Big bad corporations that America can't simply live without will always do damage control and lie through their teeth to both keep profits up and their product sill producing?even at the cost of their own "employee's" lives and families.No, the movie, Concussion, didn't make me hate it more, but it did make me understand the dangers more and appreciation for humble people who want to only do the right thing. Since I couldn't care less about the game, I'm actually blind to how much trauma these players accumulate. Until now.The movie follows the walking ten-page-resume, Dr. Bennet Omalu, from when he stumbled upon the horrific side-effects of playing football and through the obvious lies from the NFL. That's a pretty quick and easy summery of this two-hour film, and don't get me wrong: this is completely worth seeing, if not for the triumph of the good Doctor, but for the fantastic performance from Will Smith. Admittedly, I haven't seen all of his movies, like his other Oscar- worthy performances, but this, by far, was the greatest acting I have seen from him. There wasn't a shot where I didn't see Smith as Omalu. He was completely transformed and I praise his talents for this role and proving he's not the same note he most always is.This "praise" isn't to take away from the supporting cast, which were also pretty darn good, as well as the filmmaking here. This was, indeed, a well shot and sometimes beautiful film.Was it perfect? Eh, no, but there's not much to complain about outside nitpicking the over-dramatized clichés critics see at least on a biweekly basis. Totally worth seeing and hope more do see it so they know the plays they're cheering on Sunday are the same ones that could possibly kill these men.***Final thoughts: I am uncertain on Will Smith's take on the whole "Oscar So White" controversy I heard that began with his wife, Jada. Actors get snubbed all the time and wrong ones get in there, as well. Not just by my opinion, but usually, universally we can agree some just don't belong in the race and many great films and performances were overlooked. That said, I believe, no actor should choose a role to gain an Oscar and then proceed to act their asses off just to get that award. Sorry, I saw that too many times from Leo?and it was such a distraction from his movies. I'm just glad Leo finally won so he can just go back to acting. I digress. Smith gave a great performance in a movie with a message we need to hear. His reward will be more people seeing this?and I hope they do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Biopic, If Only Too Long and Unfocused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is interesting to compare the two-hour PBS Frontline program "League of Denial" with the feature film concussion. While both films spend considerable time in developing the story of Dr. Bennet Omalu, the Nigerian-American physician who studied the effects of concussions on NFL players, the two experiences offer different insights into a vital medical issue.The Frontline program was purely documentary, and the film "Concussion" was clearly biographical. While brilliantly acted by Will Smith, the personal story of Dr. Omalu began to overshadow the dramatic narrative of how his research slowly came to be recognized by the medical community and the media The Frontline documentary offered a more scathing appraisal of the NFL, which used its powerful influence and financial resources to cover up the findings of Dr. Omalu. In "Concussion," there could have been a greater balance of the biography and the extraordinary story of the repression of a reality that was known for years, if not decades, within the community of the National Football League.Nonetheless, "Concussion" was well-written and well-acted, and the prominence of professional football in American culture was depicted visually in the repeated shots of the skyline of Pittsburgh, in which the landscape is dominated by Heinz Field.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terribly important subject in just an OK movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, Will Smith as Dr. Bennett Owalu, who discovered CTE as a pathologist working on a football star in Pittsburgh and went further to discover it as a major issue in the sport, is more than OK here, and I was glad to see him pulling out some dramatic work that was him constantly trying (and usually succeeding) in elevating about the restraints of the script and basic goodness of the character. It's a shame the script and director are kind of ho-hum; after Spotlight and The Big Short this past year, which took on incredibly major topics and gave them stories and characters that had wide breadth and interest, here it's just kind of eh seconds. We may care about what this character goes through, but just on the level of straight movie drama he's only given so much dimension, and his love interest/wife is rather underwritten.Again, Concussion is not really bad; aside from Smith there's some solid supporting work from Albert Brooks and Alec Baldwin, and a number of scenes are good (albeit a few others seem to be trying to make sure they don't offend American football fans, with comparisons to Shakespeare with the sport, which makes things a bit confused, like saying that cigarettes are still so good to have in The Insider or something). But ultimately there's no reason to not just save your money and just watch the Frontline documentary about the entire CTE issue, or wait for TV as it's a fine option for that.It may be watching that that's given me the thought that this could have gone much deeper and perhaps given the subject more analysis and weight as opposed to what is a story that is in sort of conflict between doing a straight-forward biopic on a not very interesting man and an expose on one of the great scandals of our time. If this was made in the 1960's it would be kind of the same movie except with Sidney Poitier in the lead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An engrossing biopic with something to learn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Football is embraced as one of America's most popular sports, and for many decades; has lead many of America's biggest athletes to fame. Not many people, however, are aware of the dangers that lie within this sport when a player is tackled and suffers a head injury. This is the crucial subject this biopic directed by Peter Landesman (Parkland, Kill The Messenger) dwells upon. Inspired by true events set in 2002, this film follows the story of Dr. Bennett Omalu (played by Will Smith), a Nigerian forensic pathologist in Pittsburgh who discovered a neurological disease known as CTE (Chronic traumatic encephalopathy) -- a disease suffered by players as a result from multiple head traumas on the field, when performing an autopsy on former football star Mike Webster (played by David Morse). Supported by county corner Cyril Wecht (played by Albert Brooks), Omalu made his mission to shine light on his research to the public to present them with this disease, but found himself at serious odds with the NFL who looked down upon his research. This biopic drama dives into a fascinating topic that football fans can relate to, though its not always as compelling as it should be. What the film does best is paint a clear picture of who this doctor was. In the beginning of the movie, we are introduced to Dr. Bennett Omalu who is shown to be intelligent with multiple college degrees, but is looked down by his colleagues for his unorthodox ways of working, talking to his patients during operations in particular. When Omalu discovers the brain damaging disease, the story gradually grabs your attention and digs deeper into the subject while transcending into a somber atmosphere. The mental effects of the disease is exhibited in great detail with former football stars who begin suffering. When Omalu and his colleague Cyril Wecht start fighting to expose the truth to the public, that is when your mind is left flooded with questions. You began connecting with the story is questioning whether Omalu was trying to make football pictured as an villain, or condemn the NFL for keeping the dangers a secret from the public. This entire portion of the story is when the film tends to falter in terms of pacing. At various points, the story tends to lose appeal for a while, but eventually picks back up towards the end.Will Smith is one of those actors stood high on the A-list before eventually starring his some bad roles (After Earth for an example) that put him on the sidelines of Hollywood's A-list. Here, he gives the most genuine performance I have seen in a long time. Smith strikes surprising diligence in the role of Dr. Bennett Omalu with a thick Nigerian accent. and strong emotional investment, making his character very believable. Alec Baldwin and Albert Brooks are also spectacular in their roles, and put fair effort into their characters. Guga Mbatha- Raw as Omalu's fiancée should also not be forgotten for her endearing performance. Concussion may be not be the best of Director Peter Landesman's works, but it is an engrossing and thought-provoking drama with a compelling subject that will lead to some serious discussions and leave people with crucial thoughts when they watch football whether they are watching it live on TV or watching a family member play. The messages the film delivers may be found iffy or somewhat debatable for some, but doesn't mean this film couldn't use a viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A head injury for the NFL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was very well acted. Will Smith does give a really good performance, which wasn't his best but he a notable performance. This movie wants to be a "whistler blower" movie. It gives you some interesting information to the non die hard NFL fan. This movie drives home a point, I think most people already know" Getting hit in the head is bad for your health". I think this movie might make want to think twice about letting your kids play football. On a professional football level it is now common knowledge that it is dangerous. This movie didn't change my opinion of football or the NFL. The NFL is not the boogie man, they offer entertainment and the people who play in the NFL are risking their minds and limbs to provide this entertainment. It is a violent sport but we don't need to change our beloved sport or let lawyers ruin our favorite American Sport because there is opportunity to sue and get money for people who knew that played a violent sport but made the choice to play. Mike Websters story is very sad but he made the decision to abuse his body and could of walked away like Chris Borland of the 49ers did in 2014 after only 1 season. This topic would be better served as a documentary than a Hollywood movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's really amazing just how powerful the NFL is. They control a day of the week (as the movie clearly states) and they allegedly even tried to get the filmmakers for Concussion to cut down on some of the film's harsher segments. Some have said that the film doesn't go after the NFL enough for its concussion issues, which I can somewhat agree with, but I also think the film did a good job balancing the science behind concussions and how much denial went on for years from the NFL towards these particular doctors.Will Smith plays the lead doctor, Bennet Omalu, behind the finding of brain issues in former NFL players and what is now known as CTE. We get a look at a handful of the hundreds upon hundreds of NFL players who have had brain issues including Dave Duerson and Mike Wesbter. Both were incredibly vital in Omalu's path to finding CTE and proving the NFL that it is in fact a real issue and maybe even an epidemic.We also get a look at Dr. Omalu's personal life with his wife, Prema Mutiso, played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw. At first, their relationship doesn't necessarily fit in with the rest of the film and for awhile it becomes a distraction. With that said, their chemistry is very good and Smith's performance thrives alongside Mbatha-Raw. I would almost go as far as saying Smith's performance is probably better than the film itself.It takes awhile to get going but once it does Concussion is an interesting watch. What the NFL did to protect itself (and really STILL doing) is fascinating. Smith brings life to the film with his unrecognizable performance, but it doesn't give the NFL the punch it probably deserves and you don't leave the theater knowing much more than you probably did. Even with all that, Concussion is worth the price of admission.+Smith gives his best performance in years+Fascinating science+Supporting performances and chemistry between characters-Pulls some punches-Some unnecessary focus on Omalu's personal life at times7.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional Movie and unbelievable true story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time and I go to the movies with my wife every weekend. The story and script are excellent and Will Smith is unrecognizable as himself, fully embracing his character. It is great and positive story of truth, strength and most of all, human dignity, as this obscure African doctor teaches a great lesson on how people should treat each other both when dead or alive. I also normally do not write movie reviews but this one is well deserved of a positive critique. It is not only a movie about science and discovery, which is interesting enough but also about valor, honor and dignity, values that the main character brought to the US from Africa, that alerts us in. North America of things that made the US a great Nation and are now being lost due to financial or political interests. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie should have been about the players, not about a doctor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Potentially a great movie, except for a few problems. First, Will Smith. Smith playing a Nigerian medical doctor? No way. He is hopelessly miscast. Second, the plot: reformer versus entrenched special interest. This theme is as old as Hollywood itself. Third, the story's premise, that contact sports can cause brain trauma. No surprise there. The relationship between sports and brain trauma has long been a recognized fact. The question is: when a player begins to exhibit symptoms of neurological deterioration, is football the only cause? Also, the acting in general is stagy. Some of the dialogue, especially Will Smith's, is hokey. The relationship between the doctor and his wife melodramatic and contrived. The only parts of the story that evoke real drama are those depicting the actual players complaining about their symptoms and desperately asking for help. They should have been the principal characters in this movie. The story should have been about the players, not about the doctors and administrators engaging in academic and legalistic debates. Will Smith should have been cast as one of the players. The movie depicts a foreign-born government pathologist who never examined or treated any football players and is not even a football fan as a hero who manages to make an entire medical establishment look like a bunch of bumpkins and then goes public with his autopsy report in an attempt to embarrass the NFL. That the NFL reacted defensively should be no surprise. The doctor himself is not a damaged party. He did not play football. He was not an employee of the NFL. The involved parties were the players themselves. Instead, the movie is used to promote an anti-corporate, anti-NFL agenda.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somehow I found myself waiting for the movie to get started and felt really let down when I realized it was all over. I think another actor would have given Dr Omalu's part more life. I just never got attached to him despite his frequent attempts at portraying deep emotion - I think Will Smith was a very wrong choice. For marketing, I get it, but for that movie feel, nay. For me the most moving parts of the movie were Justin and Mike and as briefly as they showed, somehow they impacted me. I gave the movie a 6 because of the seriousness of what they were portraying but in terms of casting and engagement I wouldn't score it more than a 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that hits hard and bears lasting effects on the viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems there is nothing more American than a corporation going against damn-near indisputable evidence of harm being done or being perpetuated by their silence. In the 1990's, it was tobacco tycoons like Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds funneling countless money to lobbyists in effort to keep word from getting around that smoking cigarettes and cigars causes innumerable health problems to ones system, and in the modern day, it's the rampant denial of climate change by big oil companies like BP and the billionaire Koch brothers. Somewhere in between blowing the lid off of both the tobacco and the oil industry was a deeper, more human-centered issue that shocked a corporation that has gone on to own a day of the week.That issue is concussions and pervasive, crippling head trauma in the National Football League. In 2002, following the death of former Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster, a Nigerian pathologist named Dr. Bennet Omalu discovered that repetitive head trauma, by way of thunderous and recurring blows to the head, winds up choking the brain, which sits inside the human skull in a bath of fluids disconnected from any part of the skull. Dr. Omalu's research discovered that Webster's bouts of dizziness, paranoia, and instability were results of taking thousands of blows to the head - the equivalent of more than 20,000 car accidents - while playing football. Omalu's research would seem outlandish if it didn't keep being proved, following the death of Steelers offensive tackle Justin Strzelczyk, who had suffered from chronic trauma encephalopathy (CTE), and the suicides of Philadelphia Eagles safety Andre Waters and Chicago Bears safety Dave Duerson, who wound up donating his brain to Omalu for research.Upon Omalu's findings being published and released to the public, he was met with widespread criticism for his lack of formal U.S. citizenship and his alleged efforts to take down or neuter one of America's most cherished sports. The NFL, including the newly appointed commissioner Roger Goodell, tried everything to silence Omalu, even going to great lengths by staging panels and press conferences that made the public look like the league was addressing the problem, when really, it was nothing more than a publicity stunt.Though it's difficult to go any Sunday without hearing something about concussions during a game, be it from a coach asserting that he's taking every step to prevent such matters, or a player experiencing concussion-like symptoms, Omalu's story is given the recognition it deserves in Peter Landesman's "Concussion." Landesman, who wrote and directed "Parkland," a film about the multitude of key people that witnessed the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on the frontlines, molds "Concussion" into a tense, slowburn procedural with a strong central performance at its core.Omalu is played by Will Smith in what is a comeback role he was lucky to get. After the notorious financial and critical failure of "After Earth," Smith was sidelined as a movie star, barely earning a secondary mention in the forgotten 2014 "Winter's Tale." This was a role he needed in order to propel him back to the frontlines as one of America's strongest and most consistently impressive actors, and needless to say, he nails it. His performance as Omalu is understated and thoughtful, as he plays the softspoken, Nigerian pathologist with strong charisma, effectively depicting an almost meditative admiration for America as the homeland of God's people where anything is possible. Even certain scenes in the trailer, such as the famous "tell the truth" scene that came off as corny as a stand-alone moment, achieve fireworks here as Smith is back in his element.Right by Smith's side is Alec Baldwin, playing Dr. Julian Bales, an NFL-appointed doctor for teammates, who abandons his cozy, high-paying job for the greater good of mentally unstable football players that run the risk of dying under the same circumstances as Webster. Baldwin does a nice job of holding his own weight as a character in this film and not intruding on Smith's almost tour-de-force performance as Omalu.As an audience member, I can see from the montages of football games in the film and hear from the sound two helmets or skulls make on impact that that kind of repetitive trauma isn't good for the head, just from a logic standpoint. I can see from Webster's worn-face and addiction to painkillers as he lives in the back of his beater pickup truck that the effects of that kind of trauma are lasting. I don't need to be told in multiple different terms I cannot remember, let alone pronounce, how and what membranes are affected in the brain by that kind of brutality. Landesman thankfully recognizes this and makes "Concussion" about those who suffer from this kind of illness and Omalu's struggle to be honest and compassionate as he goes up against a money-hungry, corporate entity interested in protecting their own brand rather than the lives of those that make said brand what it is."Concussion" is a film that succeeds because it's a human-centered story, with two strong performances that work off of one another, yet stand alone in their own elements, in addition to having some seriously crisp, almost dreamlike cinematography (done by Salvatore Totino, who also did the cinematography for "Changing Lanes" and "The Missing"). Some will complain it's not as critical of the NFL as it should be, and some will find the lack of explicit science deceptive in some way. For me, it's about all you can ask for a film that simply wants the truth and human-scale to prevail above all. It doesn't have the slickness nor the social relevance angle that this year's amazing "Spotlight" had, but it also serves as competent dramatic entertainment in addition to being the nudge we all need before we fall asleep from our wakeup on this issue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With a better screenplay, this really could have been something.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Concussion tells the story of Dr. Ben Omalu and his struggle to bring to light the dangers of head trauma within the NFL. As his studies intensify, so do the attempts to silence and discredit him and those around him. The film starts with former Pittsburgh Steelers player, Mike Webster (David Morse) and his psychotic behavior that eventually leads to his untimely death at 50. When his autopsy is completed by Dr. Omalu (Will Smith), it is discovered that his days playing for the NFL may be directly responsible for his behavior. This is about as far as Concussion goes in regards to that storyline, the rest of the film goes downhill from here. The start of the film is promising, featuring David Morse as Mike Webster and giving an awesome performance under heavy prosthetics that, despite how obvious it is, gets the job done. Will Smith is a real stand out here as he should be. His performance as Ben Omalu is great and refreshing to see that Smith still has these types of performances left in him. If anything, Smith is getting better the older he gets. Alec Baldwin is another stand out here and correctly compliments Will Smith's thunderous performance. One of the disappointments of the film is Luke Wilson, not because his performance is bad or he is miscast, he's barely in it. It would have been nice to see more scenes with him. Now, the film itself is nowhere near the caliber of it's cast. Writer/Director Peter Landesman has a grasp of his actors but fails to elevate the source material above anything more than an average medical drama. The one thing that is almost overbearing is the music and the placement of the music. The score is ridiculously dramatic and epic sounding, so much so that you would think it is from a Ridley Scott action film. It just simply over the top. The pacing of the film is also a very hard thing to get passed, the beginning fires like a bullet and then the film slumps for the next hour and a half. It makes for a very lop sided, borderline boring film. Overall, Concussion demonstrates Will Smith in top form as is the rest of the cast but the film is too lop sided for it's own good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Will Smith ruined this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The subject matter of Concussion is pretty important, in America, and also the whole world. It's a pretty uncomplicated example of the consequences of our rampant, piggish consumerism.The subject matter also has all the ingredients for a movie classic. It's got a horrifying neurological disease. It's got conspiracies, and cover ups and big evil ruthless corporations. It's full of people who have sold their souls to live the American dream.So what exactly does Concussion end up doing with it's engrossing subject matter? It puts it aside in favor of the glorification of Will Smith's character, Dr. Benet Omalu. I'm not saying that he's not a hero. Omalu is a fantastic human being, and an inspiration for people all over the world. But I think it would have been far more affecting movie if we saw the rot rather than the angel. By the end of the movie, CTE didn't even seem like the focal point of movie. It's was Will Smith, doing a slightly angry Gandhi.This movie could have been great, but it wasted it's potential to be a feel good star vehicle. It sold it's soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has been quite a spate of movies recently boasting of being based on events that really took place. Up comes the sentence during the opening credits: 'Based on a true story.' Spotlight, Black Mass, The Big Short, Suffragette...Just when you think the movie is over, writing appears (usually white on a black background) telling the audience what happened to the characters or the next stages in the historical events depicted. Drives me crazy. If it matters so much that there's a need to tell you what happened next, it should be in the movie. If it doesn't matter, there's no need to tell us about it.Concussion follows this trend. But that's far from the only problem with it. It's a pedestrian piece that doesn't do anything like justice to its fascinating and important story. In spite of the best efforts of Will Smith and the authoritative presence of the ever-welcome Albert Brooks, the result is feeble. The movie attempts standard Hollywood emotional manipulation but it fails even in this, due in the main to poor pacing and inept shaping of the screenplay. Someone, someday, might make a very good movie about the way the NFL concealed vital information about the dangers to its players of head injuries. I certainly hope this flaccid attempt is not going to be the last word on the subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Why would a man take his own life at the age of 50?" Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith)For 28% of pro footballers, head problems not just restricted to dizziness are a result of the pounding every week in the NFL. Dr Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist, in Concussion, based on a true story, begins in 2002 the outside-of-the-league autopsies that will eventually expose the CTE impairment and other life-threatening results of the professional battering.As gently and convincingly played by Will Smith, the doctor eventually gets the NFL and world's attention by scientifically exploring the dead bodies of former players. As in the tobacco wars, the corporation, in this case the league, denies any connection, but that stand is bound to deteriorate as devoted scientists and doctors who know the players are forced to admit the causal relationship.The film is absorbing when it plays like a medical thriller, perhaps like something Michael Crichton would write in non science fiction. When Concussion tries to integrate the more melodramatic elements of Dr. Omalu's life such as his marriage and the couple's miscarriage, the film becomes mired in tears and melancholy, unfitting for a story worth telling about the professional struggle alone.Concussion's emphasis on the need for public awareness of the probable danger of tackle football is well presented, even though the NFL seems like a Bond villain's empire. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue started The Committee on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury to explore the injuries and left the results with new commissioner, Roger Goodell.Although settlement for players ensued, the concussions are still around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith's character hasn't a REMOTE semblance to Mr. Smith's usual tongue-in-cheek, Fresh Prince.His concentration never waivers in sadness or a smile, in serious discussion or anger.There's a term that's used on stage called "breaking character". You won't see THAT in this film.The subject matter brings a sad commentary to light. Too often sick or injured people are regarded by those of authority as people who are strictly bad "actors" whose behavior is deliberate, and under their control.The saddest thing that this movie presents is that Doctors, who should be more aware and first to alarm, often are the "authorities" that perpetuate the fallacy.KUDOS to Will Smith and the rest of the cast for presenting a film that not merely entertains, but presents the subject with the seriousness it deserves and a sledge hammer to the heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my 50 years on the planet, I've never seen such a piece of lopsided idealistic garbage. I'm a big fan of Will Smith. I'm also a fan of the NFL and Science. I not a big fan of propaganda. If I'm to believe this movie, the NFL forced the FBI to indite an innocent doctor and, just for fun, give Will Smith's character's wife a miscarriage. This is not an exaggeration. The implication was not subtle in the movie it was beaten into your skull much like a head on collision in the NFL. The NFL's omnipotence is mostly focused on it's ability to trick everyone into believing that getting hit in the head couldn't possibly be bad for you, but those little extras are thrown in just to remind you that God works for the NFL too. That must be why the movie says the NFL took over God's day.The NFL certainly could have taken steps long ago, which they now have, to make the game safer. Some say too safe. Taking the decision to allow players with possible concussions back into the game out of the players and coaches hands is an obvious addition that few could disagree with. This movie movie doesn't address any of that. The movie simply should have been call the Saints vs The Devil (aka the NFL). This picture is that simplistic in it's portrayal of characters.Now I've been a soldier for nearly 30 years. The military has never once told me that getting shot could be bad for my health.

		<shortDescription>Concussion's not that bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Concussion' has not received the best write up. Not here or abroad but I would have to disagree with most and have to say that this film is very compelling even for those in the audience that don't fully understand the impact that contact sport has on the athlete. The amount of punishment that the average American NFL player has to contend with is astounding but not surprising with the ferocity of the collisions that are demonstrated out on the field, made even greater by the competitive glory that each athlete strives for. It's the same for the fighters inside the ring who put their bodies through so much all for the dream of seeing themselves crowned the 'greatest' ever. Unlike boxing which has had to contend with the controversy for years, light has only been shined on the affects of head injuries in American football and Rugby codes in the last decade. Men are men and they know what they are getting themselves into right? Maybe but what 'Concussion' has done is not destroy the image of these great sports but make aware to us all that these favoured past times do have their dangers and some of the greatest competitors to play the game have suffered because of them.'Parkland' Director, Peter Landesman gets the job of telling this delicate story, more so for those that hold the NFL in high standing but becomes relevant for all those that participate in such full contact sports like Rugby Union and League where head injuries are just as serious. Landesman can also be credited for writing the provocative narrative. His story requires a fair bit of diplomacy and Landesman can be accused of playing it safe but there is no doubt he has successfully navigated through a sensitive issue, pointing the finger not at the game itself, rather the complacency and arrogance of the organisation that runs it. Putting it simply this story needed to be told and Landesman has created a cinematic environment that is both informative and emotional.Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) is the hero of this story but it becomes apparent that he doesn't want to be. "I am the wrong person to of discovered this", but he provides the fighting voice that these supreme athletes needed to bring them the dignity they deserved in their final horrific years. Omalu's discovery comes in the saddest of circumstances when he performs the autopsy on Pittsburgh football great, Mike Webster, portrayed by an unrecognisable David Morse. Webster eventually died of a heart attack but not before experiencing some disturbing behaviour up until his death. After this shocking discovery, evidence points to more cases of severe brain damage in top line footballers that had made their name in the NFL. 'Concussion' becomes a David and Goliath battle as Bennet Omalu tries to expose the damage that repeated head trauma does to the average footballer. With the support of his superior, Dr. Cyril Wecht (Albert Brooks) and a former NFL team doctor, Dr. Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin), the against the odds confrontation to force the powerful football league to be proactive about the dangers that lurk in their sport.'Concussion' has the right balance of quality that helps make the film provocative watching. Will Smith provides a reliable and solid base for Landesman to build his production on. Smith's bona fide portrayal sets the tone for an intriguing film and with another strong performance by Alec Baldwin in a meaty supporting role, 'Concussion' has more going for it than just another sporting drama. It does inform and it does make aware what we have all known for so long. Repetitive head trauma can destroy an athletes health. 'Concussion' does come with an emotional presence that will leave the audience satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent movie, not to be missed. Will Smith tells the truth with conviction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure about going to see this one. I hadn't heard much about it and although I thought the trailer was good, I knew Will Smith had been overlooked by the BAFTA's and the Oscars. So with the rumours about the reasons for the snub fresh in my mind, I went to see Concussion, and what a good choice! It was great!Never mind the negative reviews about this movie. The harsh criticism of the accents by both Will Smith and Alec Baldwin. The weight of these opinions sadly could be the reason for the films demise. I fear, if the cinemas don't support it, it will disappear and be forgotten. This will be a terrible mistake!!! I thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought Will Smith did a fine job of depicting the lovely doctor, and Alec Baldwin was excellent, even if his accent did slip a bit. The accents aren't important here anyway. It's the story itself that deserves our attention. Namely, Dr Bennett Omalu. What a wonderful man. In the movie, the focus is on him; his love of America and his desperate desire to belong and be accepted in a country that is free and where a man can do and be whatever he wants to be.... but be warned. Don't get into an argument with the NFL.I went to see Concussion yesterday. It hasn't been out long here, it was released on 12th February. (it was released in December in USA). Yet, it was being screened in the smallest theatre. After you watch the movie you may, like me, start to wonder why it hasn't been given the same kind of attention as Spotlight. They are, after all, quite similar movies in many ways. Stories based on true events, stories that uncover great misdeeds and people who have been treated badly, ignored. These movies will make the viewer emotional. Angry. Sad. Upset. But mostly angry. More people need to see this film. I completely missed CAROL (funnily enough, another film that was snubbed) because it was only at my cinema very briefly, and it was up against some stiff competition from the likes of Star Wars and Spectre. I was gutted to miss it, but it felt like it was only there for a few days!! It seems, there are more fans of other genres of movies, and the cinemas have to give the public what they think we want. Or what we are told we want, if you wanna look at it another way. There is a reference in the film to the tobacco companies and their determination to deny the dangers of smoking in the 90's. Everybody knows now, of course, and it seems crazy that people walked around everywhere smoking before the dangers were exposed. But those companies were, and still are, big and powerful, generating income through tax and keeping people addicted. So..... with the NFL. Powerful and wealthy. Offering people something different to do on a Sunday than church (not my words but stated in the movie and I think a very accurate statement). Giving people something else to believe in, something to feel a part of... but staying purposefully ignorant to the personal damage and death the much loved game has caused it's stars. It makes me think about my son's friends who play Rugby and suffer similar injuries. I worry for them.This movie is more than just a film, it is a voice for all those people who have suffered, and all those who may suffer in the future. It is beautifully made, respectful and honest, with a fine cast, who all work together really well to tell a story with an ending that is kind of predictable. I only say that because the story is based on truth and past events.Go and see it if you value freedom of speech. Go and see it if you like a movie that moves you to tears. (incidentally, I cry pretty easily but the only movies that have triggered my tears recently were this one and Room.) Especially go and see it if you are a fan of Will Smith, and take some tissues!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Concussion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would have imagined that receiving hits in the head for many years has negative consequences? I'm sorry. I don't want to seem insensitive. Dr. Bennet Omalu is obviously a medicine genius who didn't only overcome the racial and cultural prejudices of his new nation (the United States), but also had the courage to defy the huge economic interests who were against his discoveries. That's the central premise of Concussion, whose main pro is definitely the excellent performances from the whole cast, starting by Will Smith in the leading role, who brings intensity and credibility. The supporting cast also makes a perfect work, highlighting David Morse and Alec Baldwin. However... it was difficult for me to get interested in Omalu's investigation. Were there really any doubts about the effects of football on its players... specially in the brutal professional level? It's like making a film about the first doctor who related junk food with obesity: it's difficult to get surprised when we already knew it, even without scientific evidence. So, all the scenes in which different experts examine Omalu's data and they seriously nod with their heads lack of any dramatic impact, because it would be absurd to suppose that football is a safe and inoffensive sport to its players. And I wasn't convinced by the romantic sub-plot between Omalu and his "roomie" either; it might have been like that in the real life, but it doesn't contribute to the main story too much, and it feels like typical "filler" to humanize a character who didn't need it. Maybe, I should have started this review stating that I'm not a follower of football and I don't know very much about that sport (and the few things I know are probably wrong because I learned them from films such as Any Given Sunday and Draft Day). Therefore, I didn't have any illusions about the loyalty of NFL to its employees and I wasn't scandalized by its cold betrayal to the spirit of the sport; no wonder the corporations are the most popular villains of cinema. In conclusion, Concussion deserves a slight recommendation because of the performances and its valid warning against the dangers of a violent sport. Besides, who knows?, the film might save the lives young university (or high school) football players who recognize the danger before the damage is irreversible. But honestly, I didn't find it very satisfactory as a film, even though I will employ it as a new excuse not to do any exercise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, persuasive and affecting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's unfortunate that this medical drama has been dragged into the Oscar racism / boycott saga; it's a stirring tale that deserves to be approached and appreciated on its filmic merits alone, not with the additional baggage it has been lumped with. Will Smith gets serious as Nigerian doctor Bennet Omalu, a specialist in why (not how) people die. When an ex-NFL champion lands in his morgue after a rapid mental health decline and subsequent suicide, Omalu investigates a potential link between playing American Football and long-term head trauma. Not surprisingly, shining a light on this topic does not sit well with the NFL, a multi-billion dollar corporation that will go to extraordinary lengths to protect their brand. And here lies the meat of the movie, explored with intelligence and passion by writer-director Peter Landesman. With its David vs Goliath foundation it would have been easy to allow this true story to slip into midday melodrama, however Landesman keeps it grounded through smart dialogue, a perfectly paced narrative and well-defined characters who aren't embellished to fit nicely into "good" or "bad" categories. Smith earns his fair share of praise too, his likable central protagonist is multi-layered and rough around the edges. Initially it appears as if he is a Saint among men, but Smith hints at more egocentric characteristics to make him a more authentic person as presented on screen. In the pick of the supporting roles, Alec Baldwin brings his A-game as former NFL team doctor Julian Bailes, providing a pragmatic counterpoint to Omalu's idealism whilst providing Smith with a suitably heavyweight sparring partner. It may not reach the levels of brilliance inherent in the very best dramas, but Concussion is an interesting, persuasive and affecting film that boasts cast and crew in top-notch form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dialogue driven film that's captivating and excellently crafted...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many titles I have seen rely on cheap action and very prevalent antagonists, this film however has neither of these, and still kept me captivated from start to finish. We never see an actual physical antagonist, but rather a shared entity which stays at the back of our minds throughout the film, regularly reminding you of the overall threat that is present. Our protagonist is the highly-intelligent Doctor Omalu, a man of African descent, who has traveled to America for a so-called better life. We follow his story along the way as he uncovers a deep and dark secret that has been kept away from the public eye for many years.Will Smith's performance was outstanding as ever and incredibly believable, the use of real archive footage also helped drive the piece in a pseudo-documentary film style and helped sell the fact that this really did happen, making the revelation even more shocking.The only criticism I would give the film, is Will Smith's supporting character. Whilst I don't want to give much away, I felt that she was never really introduced properly into the film, there is a lack of context to her presence, we only really start to see her real involvement later on in the film (which I must say is a turning point for her character).If you are after a gripping piece of cinema with a very heavily dialogue-driven storyline, this is the right film for you...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Footballers are the gladiators of our time and the NFL is big business.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Investigative dramas are characterised by an imbalance of power between those seeking the truth and those who withhold it. The genre is popular because audiences identify with underdogs and speaking out in the face of danger is what heroism is about. Of the current releases, Concussion (2015) shares this dynamic with Spotlight (2015) and Truth (2015), and all are based on fact. This film is the story of a modest hero who inconveniently discovers why so many pro footballers were dying and the vested interests that tried to silence him.Footballers are the gladiators of our time, and the NFL is both big business and integral to the "American Dream". With his trademark humour and understatement, Will Smith is a natural in the role of Nigerian doctor, Bennet Omalu, who discovers a pattern of brain damage amongst top players who were dying at an alarming rate, many by their own hand. The condition can only be discovered via an autopsy and the game's governing body went into denial when Omalu presented the evidence. In the face of death threats, character assassination, and FBI harassment to have him deported, this lone black immigrant medic would not be silenced in saying that grid-iron was killing its players. Based on his work, the new disease was named chronic traumatic encephalopathy, now known as CTE. A charmingly restrained love story is woven into the film, not to distract or romanticize, but to accentuate Omalu's vulnerability once he had a family to protect.Smith's acting anchors the film and the avoidance of soap-box lectures gives the story objectivity amidst the emotional provocation that occurs. The film gives hope that in the future when head smashes occur, the ones that make fans roar loudest and watch again in slow-motion on the big- screen, they will remember Will Smith explaining that, unlike animals, the human brain has no shock absorbers and every smash propels the brain against the skull. Like so many excellent investigative dramas, this film has the potential to change social attitudes about the risks our gladiators take for our entertainment. This well made film needs to be watched by parents, players and sports administrators alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie makes me proud to be a Nigerian. In a year in which Nigeria made the headlines globally for the wrong reasons, Concussion has come to salvage some pride for the one time pride of Africa. Now to the acting, I've always been a huge fan of Will Smith and I feel he's one of the most unheralded actors in Hollywood. Will Smith definitely deserved at least an Academy award nomination for his performance in Concussion. His intonation, use of language, craftsmanship, and maturity was phenomenal. We actually get to see a paradigm shift from the 'bad boy' kinda roles to him portraying a role model to global youths at large. I always knew American football had its side effects but I never knew it was this grave. The beautiful thing about Concussion is that it sends a clear message to all athletes, especially football players and boxers to tread cautiously and beware of the side effects involved in sports as a whole. Nothing hits harder than the truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guess Who's Tackling The NFL!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith is superb in CONCUSSION, the fact-based drama about a courageous immigrant doctor from Africa who "blows the whistle" on pro football's darkest secret, the link between on-field player concussions and suicidal behavior.This is a movie that genuinely succeeds in making the viewer feel for the athletes, and it makes a powerful and passionate case for reform. The cast is brilliant, from top to bottom. Will Smith delivers a spectacular performance. His accent is convincing and consistent and he has no trouble with the scientific and medical jargon either. He makes Dr. Omalu both human and heroic, his sense of humor and awkwardness just as vital as his courage and moral integrity. All of this makes CONCUSSION a compelling and successful film. As I was watching, however, I couldn't help but notice that while the plot line of NFL cover-ups and concussions was ripped from today's headlines, the presentation of the hero and the way others relate to him was almost shockingly old-fashioned. Will Smith is basically playing the same character Sidney Poitier played in all those musty old Civil Rights films from almost half a century ago. He plays "the noble black hero striving for acceptance," the proud Negro who is always perfectly dressed in a suit and tie, who always speaks perfect (but charmingly accented) English, who admires and emulates white professionals with total devotion, and who never, ever loses his temper with racist whites, even when they insult and taunt him. This is the template Hollywood created for "acceptable" black males in film almost half a century ago . . . and they haven't modified it in nearly fifty years! So what's wrong with that? Well, nothing, I suppose. Still, when you watch a movie like STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON, (made by black people, for black people, and about black people) you get the impression that Hollywood's understanding of what black people feel and how the express themselves is, well, about fifty years out of date. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON was a huge hit, a surprise hit not only in black communities but in mainstream America. And how does Hollywood react? By dusting off Sidney Poitier's creaky old suit of armor and ordering poor Will Smith to go into battle as the white knight. Or no, wait. I meant the black knight. Or maybe I had it right the first time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well-Acted, But A Little Generic Sports Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the last few years, awareness about the problems retired football players are facing has risen. Just a few years ago a large group of retired football players sued the NFL because they all had concussion-related issues, Concussion is about the beginning of that. Concussion is well acted, tells a well-timed story, albeit it being a little generic. The best thing about this movie is Will Smith, especially his performance as Dr. Bennet Omalu. Will Smith anchors the film as Forensic Pathologist Bennet Omalu, and he flourishes in the role, even handling Omalu's accent pretty well. The film features a talented ensemble including Alec Baldwin, Albert Brooks, and Gugu Mbatha Raw. The entire ensemble is great, even the actors only appearing for short periods, despite some weak characters. Perhaps the only caveat is that Smith and Raw's romance feels more awkward than romantic at times, but it seems that was intentional.The film also does very well portraying a timely story, that will undoubtedly be relevant for years to come. The film brilliantly shows the story of one man against one of the biggest corporations in America and the cover-up of a major issue. That is not an overly original storytelling method, but the film definitely portrays the NFL as an "evil" organization. Much like Spotlight earlier this year, the film shows the scary true story of how when an organization gets too much power it can cover up terrible truths.The film does have some problems, namely, that is somewhat generic and slow. Concussion follows the sports drama formula and struggles pushing the story along. While the film is only 2 hours, it feels more like 2 and a half hours. Because the film tells a story that is still unfolding, it's ending is a little anti-climactic. On top of that, the dialogue in the film isn't very good, and the film has next to no humor.Concussion is a very entertaining sports drama featuring a great performance from Will Smith. The film's story is interesting, because of it's modern appeal, as well as the fact that it pulls no punches, and ambitiously accuses one of the most powerful corporations in America. However, the film struggles it feels long, is a little generic, and limps to the end. In the end, sports fans will more than likely enjoy the film, but beware the film has a lot of football criticisms littered through it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONCUSSION This outstanding film is about how doing the right thing, even as a medical doctor, can get the doctor into all sorts of very serious trouble.In a normal African country, news about this kind of film about a heroic African doctor would be shouted from the roof-tops. The publicity from the mega movie distribution houses, cinema chains and media would be in your face all the time.However, Dr Omalu was made to feel like a criminal. The doctor had crossed the line and cared more than he was supposed to.A public service Pittsburgh pathologist with many medical degrees, Dr Bennet Omalu, dared to expose the cerebral damage that was being suffered by American football players when they head-butted and engaged in other dangerous activities in the course of participating in their aggressive sport. The trauma is often intra-cerebral and is not detectable with CAT scans. Doctors at that time were mystified by the bizarre behaviour, memory loss, headaches, depression and sometimes violent, irresponsible acts of these former professional sports stars when they reached their forties and fifties. Macroscopic examination revealed virtually nothing to the pathologist. The quietly spoken, dignified and professional Dr Omalu is very thorough and meticulous; an 'alien' Ibo from Nigeria, the Black African doctor was always under the microscope. His ability and findings would always be unashamedly questioned and doubted; he would always have to try much harder to have his work and himself accepted. Disgrace and deportation is but a hair's breath away for many such professionals who are non white immigrants doing very difficult work in a 'white' country. He worked in the state sector; his working methods upset some of his colleagues as his professional output would be less. Omalu has great respect for the deceased and he wanted to know about the kind of lives that they had led before they ended up on the mortician's table. Having that kind of attitude meant that he would question why young football players would behave as they did before they died prematurely, and why some even committed suicide. Dr Omalu decided to do histopathological slides of the brains of the athletes - at his own expense with money from his savings. The Public Service would not allow such expensive procedures being undertaken on the presumption that there might be pathology detectable in a brain. That's when he saw the intra-cerebral bleeding and other damage that led to the premature deaths of revered, national sporting heroes.Sadly, many whites and even other doctors had a problem with addressing Dr Omalu by his professional name in a professional environment. We see too much of that in South Africa as well. These privileged Americans saw that he qualified in Africa. How could he be a 'real' doctor?The doctor responded by studying almost continuously; he would not even switch on his TV and, for a long time, he did not marry; he accumulated a vast array of impressive medical and other qualifications. But of course, that meant nothing to antipathetic racists. One reviewer of CONCUSSION even called Omalu's achievements 'comical'. Despite all this opprobrium and lack of understanding, Dr Omalu was prepared to go out to bat, with an extraordinary zeal, for the people of his adopted country.This foreign graduate had to convince the American establishment that his findings were accurate. His article was published in a medical journal, finally, but this was just one case. Many more athletes had to die in similar circumstances before the American public could be alerted. The NFL behemoth fought our modern day Don Quixote all the way, tooth and nail.Opposing a wealthy, all powerful establishment which is abrogating its responsibility, is nothing to be undertaken lightly.The ogres in power have access to all manner of resources including the wherewithal to undermine (sometimes via the media and biased, traitorous, embedded journalists) the doctor's reputation, his career, his family life, threaten his home and make a social pariah of the doctor even among his colleagues; they are happy to use gangsters to harass the doctor and his family and generally make his life and the lives of those he loves an absolute, living hell. Being a medical doctor is stressful enough. Acting on behalf of the public is far too dangerous. When the doctor is not even an American citizen, and is courting deportation because of his ethical deeds, then one can see how brave and honourable this Ibo doctor was.Dr Omalu naively thought that the NFL would welcome his discovery of CTE (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy) and that they would try to make the game safer. From threatening phone calls to being undermined at work to having his family life disrupted, Dr Omalu knew it all, but still he persevered. His greater allegiance was, in the manner of a Dennis Brutus, to an unknowing and anonymous public; their well-being and welfare was being undermined by a greedy, rat-like cabal who tried, like the cigarette manufacturers, to keep the people ignorant.FBI agents raided the office of Omalu's boss, and questioned that doctor's use of stationery and even his use of the fax machine! hey also threatened Omalu. The pressure was unremitting.The NFL held a conference to examine Omalu's claims but would not allow Omalu to present his findings. Instead a white doctor (played by Baldwin), (who had joined Omalu in his fight against the NFL) who had been a Football Team doctor, was called in to testify. Omalu's claims were dismissed as injuries caused by 'other factors' like 'diving into water' etc. Eventually, Dr Omalu and his family relocated to a job in California.After many years, the US dept of health invited Dr Omalu to take a prominent position with them. He declined the offer.I thoroughly enjoyed this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Concussion is a movie written and directed by Peter Landesman. It stars Will Smith, Alec Baldwin, Albert Brooks, and David Morse. It is a real life story about Bennet Omalu and his discovery about a disease called CTE and his troubles with both his life and in work. Will smith plays Mr. Omalu, a forensic neuropathologist who dissects bodies and tells information to his chief. The performances in this movie are really good and it mostly comes from Golden Globe nominated actor - Will Smith. He is utterly brilliant as he has an African accent and the actor is American, so it I think it was hard for him to get that accent. The story is really interesting as the more you find out about the disease, the more interest the story becomes, the more curiosity the viewer gets as the plot gets along. The direction and cinematography were actually great and made a great service for this movie, and make the movie a little bit more visually compelling than your average movie. The romance its really forced, and does not really make the movie more romantic in any way, except on the third act (which is good but still flawed). In this movie, await people die very frequent, obviously they have families, but the families are there for the audience to know that you need to care for these characters, but you don't. I'm not saying to NOT care for these people in real life, its just in the movie, they try to put families and friends to this people, but it just comes of kind of odd. In the end, I really enjoyed this movie, it has amazing performances, a good and griping story, but not good enough romance. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Concussion is based on the true story of a doctor from Kenia living and working in the US who uncovers CTE, brain trauma found often in footballers due to repeated blows to the head. This is a serious trauma often leading to death. However the football world does not want to hear of this and a David and Goliath kind of story unfolds. The fight from this doctor to get recognition and help for this trauma in footballers.The movie opens with a scene where Will Smith is talking in a court room. I was immediately nicely surprised. Will Smith is engaging, endearing and his accent is well done. Accents are often annoying and so often sound fake. Will Smith does a great job of speaking with a French accent. Throughout the movie he sustains what starts in that first scene. He does a great job of portraying this doctor.The only scenes where I feel he felt fake is in some of the scenes with Gugu Mbatha-Raw. These scenes feel fake and cheesy. Made my toes curl a bit with embarrassment for them. In general I didn't think Gugu managed to portray Prema in a convincing way.As for the story I thought it was well told though maybe at times a bit slow and a bit flat.Overall I enjoyed the movie. For me not among the best movies of the year but for sure a good one. One thats worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith is good, but struggled to pull off Omalu.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Pittsburgh native (parts of the film were even shot in and around my office building), I was looking forward to this film. It was enjoyable, and I learned a thing or two. I think that it framed Dr. Omalu and how he is as a person (including what drives him) very well. I'm also a first generation American, so I could really relate to the conflict between doing the right thing, and potentially sabotaging your long term goals and dreams for the future.While I generally like Will Smith, and I think he did his best in portraying Dr. Omalu, I just do not think he was the best choice. Not when there are plenty of African actors, such as Djimon Hounsou, Edi Gathegi, or even Desmond Elliot (who is Nigerian, and even looks a lot like Dr. Omalu) that would have nailed this part. I admit, the writing was good. The words and phrasing had me thinking, "Oh yeah, that's definitely how an African would talk." And like I said, I think Will Smith pulled it off. But you could tell he was trying; whereas for another actor, the cultural mannerisms could have some across more natural. {Sigh} My other (small) gripe was the way that Pittsburgh was portrayed. Don't get me wrong...it wasn't horrible. But there were some moments that made me cringe. 'Danny' from the coroner's lab filled the bill as a 'typical yinzer' who is boorish and blinded by their love for the Steelers. Ms. Omalu refers to Pittsburgh as "...this rusty city" (???). In spite of Pittsburgh having one of the most stable economies in the nation, the film still managed to work in references to the massive job losses in the 70s and school closings in the 80s (due to population decline). Any of these things on their own...no big deal. But through the course of the movie, Pittsburgh somehow gets bundled together with the NFL as the proverbial bad guy.And finally since the film was based on a true story...I wasn't expecting a happy ending or anything like that. But the blurbs at the movie's conclusion focused on the characters...not the changes made to the NFL's playing policies in regards to tackled that are not allowed anymore; which I believe were a result of Dr. Omalu's findings.Overall this was a good movie. I think it would have benefited from better casting and a bit more insight to the NFL's side of things. But overall...nice job.</fullReview>

Will Smith gives a great performance as the forensic neuropathologist who sees the changes in the brains of several Pittsburgh Steeler players who died before they should have. Of course this takes him on the journey of trying to get the NFL to recognize the dangers of concussion. Not a battle he wanted - he just wanted to help keep CTE from happening. I have to confess - I do not support pro sports for many reasons - the main one being that they focus on the money - not the player. The NFL did not want the players to know the dangers - even when they knew them. This is well portrayed in this movie. I admire this doctor for what he did and the fact that he persisted. At the end of the movie it is stated that it is believed that 28% of professional football players have CTE - that alone should wake the public up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's almost as if I would say, how dare you give this movie less than an 8? Aren't you ashamed of yourself?This is what America has become because of so-called "Democracy" (i.e. socialism) and bogus capitalism, rather than true/real capitalism.The comparison to the Tobacco war of the 1990's is clear and concise, and it is truly scary that the people behind it refuse to see it.Stop playing Football? No, that's not what its about, It is a question of minor changings - respecting even the Declaration of Independence. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness".That in itself means that anyone who treats people unequal are criminals. And when one denies indisputable facts like this the dr. Bennett Omalu presented one remains a criminal.Of course people are free to play football anyhow, but they also have the right to know about all impending dangers.This is being denied the American people and the players through Democracy and Bogus Capitalism, rather than A true Republican rule and true capitalism (The American Way). The Democratic Party has stolen America from under Americans bottoms, and the GOP has blindly accepted it.America truly needs people like Bennett Omalu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I concur that Will Smith rocked in "Concussion"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set Hut Hut Hut.... Yes, that was my opener of a film review about a football-based movie. Was it original? Of course not! Should I be penalized for unreviewlike intro conduct? Yaaa! But I got your attention, your still reading (at least for now). Yes, you are not the only one that thinks that I should get my head examined. Speaking of heads, the movie "Concussion" is definitely an eye- opener on the damage that football-related concussions can do to the brain that can eventually causes thoughts of suicide, depression, and schizophrenia, among others. The movie is based on a true story and stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, an accomplished Pittsburgh pathologist who discovered the aforementioned complications that football-related concussions can incur on the brain while autopsying the brain of Pittsburgh NFL Hall-of-Famer Mike Webster; who sadly committed suicide at age 50. Omalu did have to tackle his biggest opponent for this theory to be considered authentic; and that would be a little league we call the National Football League; heard of it? Smith's superb performance as Omalu should land him in the Best Actor Oscar nomination roster; and if it doesn't, I think the Academy should (yes, you guessed it; had to use it again) get their heads examined. Writer-Director Peter Landesman gets solid auteur points for his direction &amp; script of the film; however, there were a few directorial fumbles with some formulaic scenes between Omalu and his wife Prema, and the miscast of Luke Wilson as NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was a castaway disaster. The supporting performances that came to play were of Gugu Mbatha- Raw as Prema, and David Morse as Webster. The rest were adequate (including the work of acclaimed actors Alec Baldwin and Albert Brooks) but I would not consider their work as first-string caliber. So head on over and examine "Concussion" today. **** Good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome back Will Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8/10. Will Smith does a fantastic job, he nails the accent. I love him as an actor but his last few movies have fallen a bit flat. A solid return to form. A good film that was well written and a captivating true story.There wasn't much in the way of a supporting cast, Will Smith pretty much Carries the whole film on his back. His wife does play a nice sweet role, but with it a lot of substance. Putting all that aside still definitely worth seeing, and a hard hitting (pun intended) film that should really shake up the NFL. What a joke that nothing has been done a bout this problem. I don't see why they can't come up with a rule change to stop the head crunching blows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Concussion is a worthy drama about why some NFL players suffer from some mental problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this "Based on a True Story" drama with my movie theatre-working friend. We both were enthralled by this story of Will Smith's Nigerian doctor finding out about a former NFL football player's death after suffering a concussion of the head and his later attempts to analyze similar fatalities of other deaths involving football players. Alec Baldwin plays another doctor who was also once a football player who sympathizes with Will's plight especially when the organization tries to put a stop to it all. We also get a little look at Will's character's off-duty life with a woman who's living with him and who's also from his country. Maybe there could have been some improvements, drama-wise. Still, Concussion is worth a look for anyone wanting to learn why not more is done to make sure many of these players are protected from constant injuries when on the field.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK movie, a So-So Will Smith project.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of the film is really odd, Concussion. I thought the movie was about a Nigerian doctor who discovers Concussions, so that was confusing from the start, considering players have gotten concussions from day one. Adding to the confusion is fact that I never really got the concept of what CTE (the brain disorder this doctor finds) is and how it's different from any other concussion. The movie is telling us about the long term effects of Football playing as if we don't know. I'm not saying this as an over barring football jock, but the movie is not giving us enough information for me to be more concern. My thought is, the subject is to fresh to make a film about so soon. Concussion was a good movie about a Nigerian doctor attempting to live the American dream. That was entertaining as we go through his idea of America and what he actually found here. This looks like one of those roles Will Smith takes to prove he is worthy of a gold statute. Smith has not lost is charm over the years, but I liked him better in his other attempts at the Oscar like Ali and The Pursuit of Happiness I saw from another post that this is the maybe movie the NFL does not want you to see. Maybe that's why it falls a little short. It's a great Will Smith film that shows his movie star cred, and the personal journey of this doctor was a good touch, because the focus on why they made a movie about this Nigerian doctor is completely out of focus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I take back everything I ever said bad about Will Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, It has been rough for Will trying to stay relevant in the social media era where one bad thing can make you unpopular. Jaden has made Will Unpopular for some odd reason. People love Will but without Jaden and Willow. Sadly he needs to distance himself from his kids when doing movies because when he does it works out great. Second off, This movie was acted brilliantly from Will Smith. This is hands down his best performance ever. My girlfriend kept asking me "Is that really Will Smith"? He completely turned into a whole new person in this film and those questions about if he can play someone else besides himself have now been answered after long years of heavy criticism. I hear the script sucks but the script is just fine and there are no gimmicks or stupid jokes written in but just natural dialogue which suits the seriousness of the movie. Despite there being no action Will Makes you stay focused wondering if he will accomplish his goals throughout the movie. Alex Baldwin was wonderful and this is one of his best performances as well. Go see this movie and enjoy learning about the cold hard facts about Football. Last but not least, I work with a guy from Africa and he sounds exactly like Will's accent in the movie so yeah Will did do a job hands down and he deserves an Oscar Nomination for this but probably won't get it because of the other movies out there that will win because of politics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . from Japan's Sony Corp. against America. Japan's latest assault on American Values, CONCUSSION, is particularly insidious, being so well acted, edited, and paced that it merits a rating of "9" as a product of world cinema. However, any True Blue American would give CONCUSSION a mark of "2" at best, since it besmirches our current National Religion, NFL Football (which, as CONCUSSION emphasizes, has stolen the ownership of American Sundays from their long-time possessor, Christianity). CONCUSSION's bottom line is that 28% of NFL players will die young of the CTE brain condition that Will Smith discovers during this movie. C'Mon, folks, do the math: Even IF that's true, the remaining two-thirds of Pro Bowlers won't get Alzheimer's until they're in their 80s, like Bart Starr! More importantly, without PeeWee, Middle and High School, and College Football, America would surely lose at least half of its professional Servicemen (All-Girl Army, anybody?) and Police Officers. So football is the main thing keeping Lawless Chaos from over-taking the United States, and CONCUSSION is no less of a sneak attack by Japan on America (in the form of corporate warfare) than Pearl Harbor was (in a military sense)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An inspiring, academic by the name of Dr. Bennet Omalu takes on the titan of Sundays, the NFL, in order to prove a direct link from head trauma during football games to CTE, a football related injury that occurs. Writer/director Peter Landesman takes on the very detailed, and dramatic thriller "Concussion," with an insightful amount of control in direction, mostly thanks to Academy Award winning editor William Goldenberg, who keeps most of the film at a decent pace. However, with a clichéd script that brings the eye-rolling effect to a fever pitch, you can't help but wish that the material was more rendered and secure in its delivery. Surely to bring on an inner rage as we watch these men, so revered by Americans on a weekly basis, beg for absolution as they lose sight of themselves as time progresses. What doesn't work in "Concussion's" favor is the glossing over the real human condition that is so desperately apparent in each frame the film attempts to show.Starring two-time Academy Award nominee Will Smith as Omalu, he delivers one of his strongest performances ever. An impeccable capture of a man from Africa, soulfully searching for acceptance in America, Smith brings a visible intensity in each line spoken. Settling into a role that calls for the best parts of Smith's charisma, which he has demonstrated effortlessly throughout his career, he handles it with an equally emotional heft that garners most of the film's best moments. This is a performance that deserves to be considered for the Academy Award for Best Actor.Landesman also constructs a decent cast with Alec Baldwin (not totally owning his own southern-ish accent in his exchanges), Gugu Mbatha- Raw (beautiful but utterly wasted in under developed scenes), and David Morse (who deserves much more roles and is quite effective in his limited screen time). Of all the supporting players, Albert Brooks delivers as the vulgar Dr. Cyril Wecht. It'll call back to his beloved turn in "Drive" just a few years back (minus villainous murders). As a distracting entity, Luke Wilson cast as Roger Goodell is a poor choice by the filmmakers, serving nothing more as celebrity wallpaper.Composer James Newton Howard puts his horns on overload, sweeping into scenes that work well in films like "The Village" but with a film such as "Concussion," it begins to grate on the ears at times.At 123 minutes, the film bloats like you over indulged at dinner time. In some bizarre, and almost "too try hard" choices, Landesman attempts to focus on some of the more "human" and "natural" elements of Dr. Omalu's life. As we find ourselves more interested in the case at hand, the writer/director almost sets out to make his version of "The Insider," which would be fine if he got a better grasp on which elements he should focus on."Concussion" isn't a complete failure, delivering at times with a grandiose turn from Will Smith. If anything, he's more than worth the admission ticket but I believe most of all, the film does successfully place a spotlight on an issue that is in desperate need of change. The final title cards will prove the NFL's power, and even deepen your frustration and anger. I think that it'll at least offer up a discussion point. That's success on its own.</fullReview>

This is a total bore. Milk toast cinema, folks. I felt like I was watching a 2-hour Lifetime movie. I should've known. Will Smith should've been the first warning. He never headlines good movies anymore. Some people are hailing it his best performance, but that distinction must still go to The Pursuit of Happiness. He was absolutely the best part of this movie, but even in a few parts, you see him trying very hard for a film that isn't trying to do anything at all. The writing, the cinematography, the flow of the story.. amateur hour at best. I'm disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome Back, Will Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a series of career missteps in truly awful films, Will Smith returns with a vengeance in "Concussion." Smith is nearly unrecognizable as Dr. Omalu, the Nigerian immigrant who takes the powerful NFL to task for the deaths of players due to the brain disease he discovers.While the plot is a very familiar Little Man David ? Corporate Goliath story, the film is elevated by not only Smith's work but terrific supporting players in regretful Alec Baldwin and supportive Albert Brooks. There's particular note of David Morse, a C level, sixth billing actor who continually shows his impressive chops. Morse plays to great effect Mike Webster, a Steelers player who goes quietly insane ? pulling teeth and supergluing them back, shocking himself with a Taser ? and finally succeeds at suicide. As a Pittsburgh Coroner, Dr. Omalu's scientific curiosity regarding the death of the otherwise healthy Webster sets the ball in motion.Thing is, Webster is a former football God in Steeler's town where fans take the game far more seriously than a sport ever should be. The pressured Omalu persists, pays out of pocket for expensive tests while the complications quickly pile up."Concussion" adds subtext about what it means to be an American. Smith places Heaven just slightly above America. Surely a large corporation who knows they're killing people will take swift and direct action to stop the deaths and forget the billions at stake. That's what America stands for. Or so the not-yet-a citizen Omalu believes. Then the very rude awakening alarm clock goes off.This ripped from the headlines story also adds a love interest for Omalu that's sweet but neither here nor there.One laughable scene finds Omalu courted by the Fed to be the US Coroner. The interviewer touts the government's honesty. Omalu doesn't take that corrupt bait.There's sincerity in these proceedings. A Capraesque quality. "Concussion" successfully walks the tightrope between earnestness and cynicism - quite an accomplishment in contemporary cinema. "Concussion" offers good acting, a solid story that's part forensic mystery, part Don Quixote quest, part pledge of allegiance. It's satisfying and worth a look.</fullReview>

This is one of the few times were he doesn't rely on his personal charm to create a compelling character. He disappears completely and his transformation seems natural. He speaks with an authentic African accent and I completely forgot I was watching Smith, the mega star. Unfortunately it is the only thing worth rescuing because the pacing is a bit slow.The subject matter, a doctor who discovers a link between football players and brain damage, might not seem interesting enough to maintain the audience's attention, but if you're into sports medicine this is the film for you. There is an interesting scene where Smith's character explains the effect of each blow to the head that a player receives. Other than that the film does follow a familiar beat and the story becomes formulaic and predictable up to the inevitable inspiring grand final speech. The film plays it safe, but Smith makes it worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Concussion", starring Will Smith-Focus, The Anchorman movies; Gugu Mbatha-Rwa-Jupiter Ascending, Larry Crowne; Alec Baldwin- Mission:Impossible-Rogue Nation, Rock of Ages and Albert Brooks-This is 40, The In-Laws.This is based on a true story about the immigrant doctor, Bennet Omalu, that found a connection between severe head trauma in football injuries and the degenerative brain disease CTE-Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. Will plays the doctor that made the NFL mad-it would damage their precious money making sport of football, if his allegations were true, and they were. Will plays the Nigerian pathologist that was working as a coroner in Pittsburgh when he first found the evidence. He even thought that the NFL would be happy that he brought it to their attention-Boy, was he naive! Of course, the NFL denied any connection between the deaths and the new found disease and even brought out their own evidence saying the opposite of Will's-sort of like the tobacco industry did with the 'Smoking is not bad for you' campaigns. Football players start turning up on Will's table and they all show signs of aggression, suicidal tendencies and early dementia which led to their deaths. Oh yeah, they are only in their 40's &amp; 50's when this happens. Will goes to his boss, Albert, and tells him that the repeated blows to the head are not good for the players-Duh! Gugu plays Will's love interest and Alec plays the Pittsburgh team doctor. As the end credits start, they tell you what the good doctor is doing now and what happened with the NFL and what they have done about the problem. It's rated "PG-13" for disturbing images and language and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 3 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-one viewing was fine-but it would be a good rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'CONCUSSION': Four Stars (Out of Five)A medical/sports-drama biopic, based on the true story of the Nigerian forensic pathologist, named Dr. Bennet Omalu, who took on the NFL; in trying to expose the dangers of brain damage (in the extremely violent sport). The movie stars Will Smith, as Omalu, and it costars Albert Brooks, Alec Baldwin, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and David Morse. It was written and directed by Peter Landesman; and based on the GQ article 'Game Brain', by Jeanne Marie Laskas. The film is well acted, written and directed; it's definitely pretty powerful stuff (but maybe a little too systematically constructed, in the tradition of big budget Hollywood).The film begins in 2002, when Mike Webster (Morris), a former Pittsburgh Steelers center, suffered from severe brain damage, and died; homeless in his pickup truck. A gifted forensic pathologist (from Nigeria), named Dr. Bennet Omalu (Smith), was assigned to perform his autopsy. Omalu discovered that Webster's death was caused by brain trauma, he later named CTE, and he linked the 'cause of death' to multiple other professional football players. The National Football League, of course, used all their money, and power, to cover-up his findings. The movie is informative, and very involving; for the majority of the film. Smith is fantastic in the lead, and the supporting cast all does adequate jobs. This is a movie that tackles the 'very inspiring subject', of the little guy, taking on a big powerful corporation. Landesman dealt with the same subject matter, in the last film he wrote: 'KILL THE MESSENGER' (except in that movie, the US government was the 'big powerful corporation'). This film reminded me a lot of 'KILL THE MESSENGER', and that was before I even knew it was the same screenwriter. I hope Landesman continues to do movies like this; and maybe next time, without such a big powerful corporation (backing the film). His next movie is (very fittingly) about the Watergate scandal; I just learned!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/j9uf6E4pnlw</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith can carry a movie as well as anyone in Hollywood, and he's been doing it for about the last 20 years. In Concussion he plays Dr. Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian pathologist working in Pittsburgh, who notices something he's never seen before when conducting an autopsy on former NFL player Mike Webster. It turns out that it's a new brain condition that causes its victim to enter a deep depression. He names it chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE.Smith does an amazing job as Omalu. He doesn't use his lilt robotically, but commits to every inflection along the way, providing a very natural delivery that makes us believe he is Nigerian.The filmmakers may not take a lot of risks with Smith's character, pinning him as the interminable hero--which he undeniably is. But I think many people would have wanted to visit his weaknesses a little bit more, other than the first 15 minutes when it is merely stated that he has no human relationships. This gets taken care of fairly quickly with the introduction of Prema, played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw, a Kenyan nurse who needs a place to live and develops a relationship with Omalu.Even though Smith's character doesn't face a whole lot of moral dilemma, he is so earnest that he becomes honorable--a personage to cherish in cinema. Smith brings his own personality to the film, and although he's fully committed, you are comforted knowing that it's him donning those grey sideburns.There are a plethora of self-aware dialogue that may rub people the wrong way, but it's paced very very well so as to not discount the script. With all the science that the story surrounds, it never makes itself confusing or convoluted by over-explaining the details.Not that I was already fond of the NFL organization, but watching this movie makes me dislike them even more. I know the film tries to be unbiased at times, but the facts are all there pointing the other way.But Concussion is about more than just football. It's about the misconception of the American dream. The realization that that dream is rooted in monetary gain by any means necessary. And as Omalu discovers it, we do too. An organization that our society is loyally infatuated with isn't all that we romanticize it to be.Driven by Peter Landesman's honest direction and a score composed by James Newton Howard, which helps drive the intensity of the film, Concussion is one of my favorite films of the year. It isn't perfect, but it's very good. And more than anything, it's powerful--which, in this case, may be the most important factor of all.Twizard Rating: 94</fullReview>

When we will we concede that just because something is the American Way doesn't make it beyond criticism. Omaulu exposed our Gladiatorial attitudes about our sports. Well back to the film. It does get a little slow toward the middle and it doesn't have the high drama of the Insider; which is kind of interesting since Football is a lot more popular and lucrative than cigarettes.

Smith is back to his element after a long time.'Concussion' Synopsis: In Pittsburgh, accomplished pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu uncovers the truth about brain damage in football players who suffer repeated concussions in the course of normal play.'Concussion' is about a man's fight to speak the truth. This is an interesting true-story, thats been told effectively on celluloid. This biographical sports medical drama engages at most parts, although the second-hour is a bit dragging. But overall, I was arrested by the force of 'Concussion'. And by that I mean, Will Smith. He deserves Oscar Attention for this one. He slips into the character effortlessly &amp; he picks up the accent, most accurately. Its a pleasure to see him back to being the terrific actor he is, even though its been years since he invested himself so deeply into a role. Offering him tremendous support are Alec Baldwin &amp; Albert Brooks, who ignite the screen in strong supporting roles. Gugu Mbatha-Raw, too, adds depth to her part. On the whole, 'Concussion' is certainly a film worth watching as Writer-Director Peter Landesman keeps the narrative tight, at most times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Concussion" features great acting and an interesting and timely story, but is otherwise unspectacular.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to hear something bad about the ones you love. You don't want to believe it. You don't even want to think about it. But when you do, you worry about how what you've learned will affect the relationship. Well, what if the relationship in question is not with a person, but with an activity? That's the case with many of us football fans when we think about the sad reality of CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy). The knowledge that many years of the vicious blows that football players endure (and we cheer) has had long-term health effects on many players, and even ended some of their lives, is a sober realization indeed. It's an uncomfortable truth that fans, players, trainers and coaches at all levels of the game now face. The man who discovered and called attention to the problem ? and fought to be heard ? is Nigerian-born pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu. "Concussion" (PG-13, 2:03) is his story.Previous Oscar nominee Will Smith stars as Omalu, who happens to be just about the nicest, most generous person you'd ever want to meet ? and one of the smartest. He's the coroner for Allegheny County, the county that includes Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Omalu is qualified enough to be an expert witness in a murder trial, astute enough to get an innocent man acquitted of a murder charge and compassionate enough to speak softly to a corpse before beginning an autopsy, asking the deceased to help him discover what happened to him or her. He's also kind enough to share his limited living space with a recent African immigrant, expecting nothing in return. However, as kind and unassuming as Omalu is, he's also extraordinarily determined ? determined to do his job as thoroughly as humanly possible and to right wrongs when he finds them, regardless of any obstacles placed in his path.Omalu is the pathologist on duty when the body of retired Pittsburgh Steeler Mike Webster (David Morse) is brought in to the morgue, and the good doctor is determined to solve the mystery of this man's death at the age of 50. "Cardiac arrest may be how he died," he tells a co-worker, "but not why." Omalu ignores the pleas of his boss (Mike O'Malley) not to cut open the local legend and even goes as far as paying out of his own pocket for expensive brain analysis that the chief medical examiner won't authorize. The result of these tests is the discovery of a new brain disease that Omalu names CTE. With the support of his boss' boss (Albert Brooks) and another local expert (Stephen Moyer), he publishes a paper on his study of Webster's brain and the conclusions he reached in a major medical journal. He hopes to trigger further study by fellow scientists and an investigation by the National Football League.Dr. Omalu doesn't quite get the response he was hoping for. Much like the industrialists who likely contributed to global warming and the tobacco companies before them, the NFL flatly denies the science that proved this newly-discovered threat to health and safety. And that's just the beginning. The NFL, the scientific community and even the government work to discredit Omalu and those who help him. He even gets death threats. Omalu responds by publicizing similar findings from autopsies he later does on other former players, meeting with various powerful people and demanding that attention be paid. He receives help from the former Steelers team doctor (Alec Baldwin) and is supported by his new wife (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) every step of the way, but the forces arrayed against him may prove to be just too powerful. Omalu is desperate to be heard by the NFL leadership ? people like the new commissioner Roger Goodell (Luke Wilson) and NFL Players' Association executive Dave Duerson (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), but the question remains as to who can be more stubborn for longer ? the NFL or Dr. Omalu."Concussion" is an interesting, inspiring and timely film. Smith's portrayal of Omalu, complete with Nigerian accent, is award-worthy. He makes it easy to forget that you're watching Will Smith ? not an easy task for such a well-known actor ? and he makes us see this story through Dr. Omalu's eyes. Smith's supporting cast is also consistently strong and effective. Peter Landesman's script and direction nicely balance the personal and professional aspects of Omalu's story. The movie provides solid character development which generates empathy from the audience, while giving Movie Fans just enough of the science behind the plot to understand the story, without overindulging in jargon. This film compares most easily to small screen procedurals like "House" and "CSI", with a touch of "Law and Order", but gives us a story and a topic that are even deeper and more relevant. "Concussion" isn't spectacular, but is entertaining and eye-opening. "B+"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hard hitting tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Concussion, is a dramatic story-telling depiction of Dr. Bennet Omalu's, lone fight against the NFL, over the consequences of years of head injuries suffered by football players, primarily CTE.Will Smith delivers a good performance. He is an inconsistent accent throughout the movie, but that does not deter him from delivering a strong performance. Alec Baldwin, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Albret Brooks were also superb in their respective supporting roles. David Morse, as the deceased Mike Webster,manages to pack a punch with a splendid cameo appearance.William Goldenberg, deserves a special mention for editing this film and making it a crisp and riveting drama.Deserves a watch, to recall the point Dr. Omalu tried to make and remember it, this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's painful playing football, obviously."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's painful playing football, obviously," states Mike Webster (David Morse). It's a somber remark made by a retired football star who would soon abandon his family, become homeless, and eventually kill himself at the age of 50. As Webster's mental stability rapidly deteriorates, a former Steelers team doctor and good friend Dr. Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin) is baffled by brain scans that show complete normalcy. His despair over the situation worsens as additional ex-NFL players meet similar, untimely demises brought about by suicidal tendencies and fits of rage.In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 2002, neuropathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) is tasked with performing the autopsy on Mike Webster. The doctor is a bit peculiar, regularly talking to the cadavers in the Allegheny County Coroner's lab as he prepares to cut them up in the cleanest, most respectful manner possible, hoping that their spirits will somehow assist him in discovering the hidden reasons behind their deaths. To some degree it must work, because Omalu is able to formulate that Webster has torn out all of his teeth and glued them back in ? before ever touching the body. After paying for special tests on Webster's brain tissue, beyond what his duties entail, Bennet discovers that a specific, recurring disease may link the cases of hysterical, Alzheimer-like, aging football players ? and that the culprit is the game itself.Since the film is essentially just a message piece to inform viewers (especially those lacking in common sense) that billion-dollar-businesses are corrupt and that excessive concussions can cause serious damage, it runs out of steam about halfway through its hefty two-hour runtime. To pad the picture and to incorporate expected elements of familial drama and character development, Omalu gains a houseguest ? almost immediately after boss Dr. Cyril Wecht (Albert Brooks) suggests that he interact with living human women for a change. Prema Mutiso (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a conveniently attractive, single, seemingly age-appropriate, romantic interest takes up residence at Omalu's home, setting the state for an obligatory love story (with an obligatory nightclub flirtation scene), which rears its head every time the analyzation of scientific findings grows too tiresome.Through pounding music, montage sequences, and quick edits, "Concussion" occasionally conducts itself like a psychological thriller - but there are no thrills to be found here. The research and studies are also presented like a great mystery, but there's really no mystery at hand either. The fact that certain brain damage can only be proved through an autopsy is curious, but hardly cause for theatrical endeavors.And what is less amusing is the manner in which the film hopes to make the NFL ? and, by extension, every fan of the game ? a villain for perpetuating the deadly act of contact sports; surely no one forced professional football players into participating in such a barbaric ritual, with little more than fame and adoration and millions of dollars in compensation. It's not like football is equivalent to gladiatorial fights to the death between slaves. Finding sympathy for any side of this entertainment entity (is it any different than boxing or rugby or hockey when it comes to its level of violence?) is a major struggle, chiefly when the only effective resolution is to cease the sport of football altogether - or to pay ungodly sums of money to players who feign shock at the potential for repetitive blows to the head to have negative long-term consequences. After all, does anyone stop mountain climbing or skydiving or base jumping (or any extreme or even non-extreme sport) after they've been warned of the dangers? Isn't the brutality part of the fun? - The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Repetitive Cover-Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sony is the one Hollywood studio that doesn't have a mult-billion dollar contract with the NFL. This left some hope for the movie about a story the media, as business partners of the NFL, has refused to properly delve into, but there were frustrating signs all along that this wasn't going to be a serious movie about a very serious subject, and the results like the disease are upsetting. They called the movie Concussion. A ridiculous title, but not something so harmful in and of itself. It is that its ignorant, not just that it sounds stupid. Fitting with the current cover-up tactics by the NFL and media, it makes it appear as if concussions are the issue. The truth is that the real science the movie skims over, in its focus on easy dramatization, shows that it is repetitive head trauma that is the true cause. The league and media don't want you to know about this because it means that the sport itself is fundamentally the problem. They want you to think that they can reduce big hits and everything will be solved.The media has been extremely important in pushing this lie. The movie from the unattached studio covers the previous lie that CTE doesn't exist, but it fits in with the current false narrative. It is a great disappointment. Sony wants to tell you the current story being told by cable news and click-bait print journalism. Concussion even had Peter King, a complete lapdog of the NFL and one of the most notorious liars release their trailer for them.Sony didn't want to make a movie about CTE, and they didn't want to tell the truth. They wanted to take advantage of a trending story, and a movie star's popularity. Concussion revolves around Will Smith's portrayal, rather than diving into a deeply interesting reality. The acting from him and the rest of the cast is pretty good, but they only have surface characters to deal with. It's all gloss without strong material. Upon reflection, it makes you nauseous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Speaking for The Dead vs. Money Talks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What we got here is another proof that once the truth hurts the cash cow, the truth got to be thrown out of the window. Let's see how the truth becomes the burden of proof, let's see why before elected, all and every candidate who's seeking political job in America, he or she represents the voters of the district he or she claims to protect, serve and fight for; for their welfare, benefit, their jobs, their incomes, their living standards, their decent life styles, but once he or she was elected, they only represented themselves. To hell with the voters, to hell with the promises they vowed to carry out. Let's all see another living proof, the person who's running for president, he or she would and could say anything he or she wanted, but once elected, once checked into the White House, once the view point was from the inside and looking out from the Oval Office, all the campaign agenda, promises...whatever, will tur kn 180 degrees around. Once you become a political animal, once you are business men involved with billions billions profit and revenue, the truth means jacksh@t.Here, we got a doctor who tried so hard to "speak for the dead", speaking the truth for the benefit, welfare and health of the football players. What he got in the end? Nothing. Parents still want their boys to play football, because it would bring millions millions of dollars to their sons if they become NFL players, and their parents will also benefit from their sons' signing money. Concussion? Big deal! Money talks, man.I laughed so loudly when I watched the last scene of this pathetic naive doctor stepping out of his Mercedes outside of the football field, watching those high school football players banging their heads against each other or one another speechlessly and hopelessly, I just laughed. The whole movie suddenly became a comedy. None of the American parents give sh@t to the truth that playing football is dangerous to their sons, they just don't care. Because in America, sports means money, means mucho mucho dineros, sports is not sports but entertainment, and entertainment means mucho mucho money. Who cares about concussion! Nobody gives sh@t to concussion.It only proved one thing when this movie ended: NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, BUSINESS AS USUAL. MONEY TALKS.</fullReview>
