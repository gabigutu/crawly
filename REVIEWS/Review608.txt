		<shortDescription>Runners to your marks: Ready: Set: "RACE"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe not as prominently remembered as he once was, Jesse Owens, was one of those men in history who was able to overcome the many barriers in his life to exemplify greatness. Not only as an athlete, but as a human being."RACE" is the story of Jesse Owens(Stephan James) from 1933 through 1936. James Cleveland Owens was born in Alabama and at age 9 moved with his family to Cleveland, Ohio. It was in Cleveland where one of his teachers, unable to understand his thick southern accent, thought he was saying his name was Jesse when in fact he had been saying JC. This mistake led to JC being known as Jesse for the rest of his life.A prominent high school track athlete, Jesse entered The Ohio State University in 1933 and began his NCAA track career under the tutelage of legendary track coach Larry Snyder(Jason Sudeikis). Snyder recognized greatness in Jesse the first time he watched him run and let Jesse know that he would be able to compete and win in the 1936 Olympic Games.The movie moves from Jesse's life and troubles to Nazi Germany and back again. The story of The Amateur Athletic Union(AAU) and the American Olympic Committee(AOC), struggling with the decision to attend or boycott the games, runs parallel to Jesse's trials, tribulations and his ultimate success.When the AAU and AOC make the decision to attend the games, the NAACP asks Jesse to refuse to enter. Due to the atrocities being committed against the Jewish population in Germany and the open hatred the Nazis expressed toward other races as well, the NAACP felt Jesse's refusal to attend the games would make a strong statement. The decision to attend the games by Owens turned out to be a much more powerful statement than could ever have been imagined. As the scene unfolded and the representative of the NAACP told Jesse what a strong statement his boycott would make, I was hoping the writer's would have had Jesse respond by saying, "It will be much more meaningful for me to attend the games and come home with the Gold" ? or something along that line.Jesse Owens, to me, has always been one of the larger than life individuals that only come along every so often. The film not only celebrates Jesse Owens' accomplishments, it also emphasizes the wrongs to which people of color had to endure in the United States. Even at a dinner held in Mr. Owens' honor, Jesse and his wife were asked to enter the hotel through the service entrance. The filmmaker's parallel stories of Jesse and Nazi Germany, as they prepare for the games, brings to the forefront the hypocrisy of our American Ideals and what was really happening to many of our citizens. "RACE" is a title that fits well because it not only speaks to Jesse's prominence on the track, but to the relationship between the citizens of this planet.The story is a worthwhile one. Historical figures like Jesse Owens need to be kept in our memory. However, as great as Jesse Owens was, this was not a great film. At 134 minutes, I felt it was a tad too long. I also felt it dragged somewhat at various times. Although the parallel story of what was happening in Europe at this time in our history is important, I feel to much time was spent on that story and not enough on Mr. Owens.I recommend seeing this film although I feel the matinée price would be the best option.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May take liberties with actual events</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Race' is an overall entertaining movie hampered by some fairly predictable flaws. It features pretty standard sports movie clichés, e.g., hard-ass coach with heart of gold, rival who becomes best friend, etc. The personal (melo)drama seems pretty mundane, and, as to be expected in historical dramas, certain liberties are taken with the facts for dramatic purposes. But there is interesting dramatic tension in the scenes in which the US Olympics commission debates boycotting the '36 games, and in Owens' personal struggle over whether to compete in the face of certain factions of the black community entreating him not to. The actual scenes of competition are presented in an exciting fashion. My favorite scene captures Owens' P.O.V. as he enters Berlin Stadium at the height of pre-War Nazi pageantry, Hindenburg flying overhead, Hitler waving in the stands to a thunderous chorus of "Sieg Heils." It must have been overwhelming. Carice van Houten plays Leni Refienstahl as a sympathetic character, defying Goebbel's orders to tell the true story of the 1936 Olympics, and Stephan James as Owens provides an enjoyable leading performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sports movie that once again shows the triumph of the human spirit and how everyone is equal when the gun goes off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A man has to present an image to the world." Jesse Owens (James) is a college track star. His coach Larry Snyder (Sudeikis) pushes him to be the best he can be. Jesse pushes himself on and off the track to be the best person and athlete he can be. Everything is going as he wants, he becomes a record breaking collegiate champion with his Olympic dream in his sights. The only thing stopping him is his conscience. With Olympic gold in his grasp Jesse must decide if he is willing to compete in Germany, as an African-American, with Hitler watching. This movie is in my wheelhouse. Not only is this a sports movie but its a true story as well. I knew the basics of the Owens story, but this movie goes deeper into the pressure put on him from both sides of the Nazi debate. Even knowing how the movie will turn out the drama was gripping enough to keep me interested and wondering how he got to where he was at. Sudeikis actually does a really good job in a non comedic role and is almost the perfect choice for the coach. This is a movie I cannot say enough about. I highly recommend this, and the use of the n-word is limited so this is OK for family viewing as well. Overall, a sports movie that once again shows the triumph of the human spirit and how everyone is equal when the gun goes off. I give this an A-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, lousy title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was with some trepidation that I went to see this movie. Jesse Owens had been my sports hero since the eighth grade when I discovered that he had been holding the world broad jump record for 24 years, an extraordinarily long time for a 12-year-old to contemplate, and won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympic Games. But I had the lingering fear that the biopic would emphasize his awards rather than the quest for excellence, as evidenced by his performances, and the usual self-flagellation that whites are supposed to feel for their past treatment of African-Americans even though history can't be changed. I was also put off by the multi-layered but generally meaningless title "Race" which like similar recent one-word titles such as "Rush," "Flight," and "Room" smack of artistic pretension and self-importance, professing to offer so much more than they can possibly deliver.Happily, I can report that my fears were unfounded. The movie was, by and large, wonderful and a worthy tribute to perhaps the greatest American track and field athlete ever. Yes, it does show some of the seamier sides of the African-American ? and, to a lesser degree, the Jewish ? experience at home and during the Berlin games as well as the German people's attitudes at the time but director Stephen Hopkins wisely does not dwell on them too much, since to do so would bring a biased 2015 perspective to the earth-shaking events which were unfolding at the time and the outcome of which had yet to be determined.Fortunately, the film's main focus is on the athlete during his record-breaking years of 1935-36 and Canadian born Stephen James does an admirable job in portraying the legendary Owens. He manages to keep the emoting down to tolerable levels, presenting Jesse as a polite, respectful, family man with just enough bravado to appreciate his own God-given talents. His performances on the track (and in the broad jump), while hard to emulate the original, are convincing enough. Particularly good are the scenes showing him break or tie four world records at the Big Ten Conference Championships at Ann Arbor, Michigan on May 25th, 1935.Less credible is Jason Sudeikis' portrayal of Coach Larry Snyder. While he may have been a difficult taskmaster, he comes off as too boorish and too bombastic to earn Owens' unwavering respect. Their relationship, at times, is not entirely convincing. I have to note here that his repeated reference to Charles Paddock's victory in the 1924 Olympic 100 meters is incorrect. Paddock won in 1920. Harold Abrahams of Great Britain won in 1924 (as shown in "Chariots of Fire.").To be sure, there are questions that the movie does not delve into deeply enough but for a true blue lifetime Jesse Owens fan like myself, the overall effect of the movie is extremely satisfying, not too much and not too little. It is memorable enough that I will want to get the DVD when it comes out. I only wish I could change that insipid title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor research?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the script writers were confused. Either they don't know the difference between Cleveland, Ohio and Cleveland, Mississippi, or they don't care, which would be even worse.There was no discrimination in public accommodations in Cleveland, Ohio in the 1930s. African Americans did not have to sit in the back of the bus. When the script called for Jessie Owens to sit in the back of a bus in Cleveland, Ohio, it was in complete disregard for the truth. I checked with my mother, who went to the same high school with Jessie Owens. She went everywhere on the bus or the street car. Everyone did. And they all sat together, black and white. Another problem with the script was the blatant racism in the locker room at Ohio State University. The Buckeye football team was already integrated by the time Jessie Owens arrived. William "Big Bill" Bell was an All American for the Buckeyes, and played from 1929 to 1931. I guess there could have been some racists who gave Jessie Owens some grief in the locker room, but it certainly would not have been so institutionalized as depicted in the film.As much as those blatant misportrayals bother me, the thing that bothered me most was when Jessie was agonizing over whether to go to Berlin, his wife told him that he was never much good at thinking, so he should not do it. How much more racially condescending could the script writer be?What a shame that this movie that could have been a rich source for teaching a moral lesson instead was turned into a source of misinformation and condescension. The movie had some good moments, so I give it 4 out of 10 stars. Do not accept it as a reflection of reality, as it is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Race" makes good use of its title's dual meaning, but it could have gone deeper into both issues.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to get distracted by? well, life ? even when you're doing something important (maybe, ESPECIALLY when you're doing something important). If you have a faithful "significant other" who is not around at the moment, you may be tempted to stray from "Miss Right" in favor of "Miss Right Now" (or "Mr.?" whichever the case may be). If you're determined to accomplish something big, you may be confronted with people who believe you will fail (and even want you to fail) ? and openly express those feelings, whether out of pettiness, jealousy or even the color of your skin. If you're succeeding at something that draws a lot of attention, others will want to use you or your accomplishments to further their own personal, financial or political goals. These are just some of the distractions competing for the main character's attention in "Race" (PG-13, 2:14). Of course, I think we'd all agree that, in the end, what defines each of us is how we deal with our distractions. Jesse Owens learned that lesson well.Stephan James plays the legendary runner from the ages of 20 to 23, the years that turned him from virtually unknown high school track star in Cleveland, Ohio to the man who defied Adolph Hitler's myth of "Aryan" racial superiority at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany. Jesse (actually, "J.C.", notwithstanding his elementary school teacher's misunderstanding his name) is in a long-term relationship with Ruth Solomon (Shanice Banton), with whom he has a little girl, but he has to say goodbye to both of them (and his large family) to begin his higher education and college track and field career at The Ohio State University in Columbus. It is there that he meets track coach Larry Snyder (Jason Sudeikis), the man tasked with turning Owens' raw talent into even greater accomplishments.Owens first struggles with, then learns to overcome the distractions of sexual temptation, racial prejudice and the competing interests of some pretty important people who are determined to make Owens a pawn in their games of politics and perception. Early on we see Owens' incredible performance at a 1935 Big Ten track meet in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he put together what many people consider the most impressive 45 minutes in sports history. While at a meet in L.A., Owens' growing fame attracts the attention of the sexy, glamorous and wealthy Quincella, otherwise known as major distraction no. 1. Throughout his life, and even as a famous athlete, Owens has to endure the indignities of being forced to use "colored" entrances to buildings, being literally pushed aside by his white teammates and having racial epithets screamed at him while he's competing. (This is major distraction no. 2, but it also shows the illogic and hypocrisy of racism as his successes lead those who treat him horribly to cheer, embrace ? and use him.) This brings us to major distraction no. 3 ? the politics which swirled around Jesse Owens.As Owens works hard to become a better runner ? and a better man ? the pattern of ethnic and racial discrimination in the Olympics' designated host country overshadows (and even threatens to derail) Owens' growing list of successes and his potential future accomplishments. The U.S. Olympic Committee (with Oscar winners Jeremy Irons and William Hurt representing conflicting positions) debate whether it's more important for the U.S. to boycott the Berlin games to make a statement about Germany's human rights abuses or for the American athletes (including the black and Jewish ones) to have the hard-won opportunity to compete ? and maybe even to beat the Nazis at their own? games. Eventually, the debate literally arrives at Owens' doorstep as a representative of the relatively new NAACP puts significant pressure on Owens to refuse to attend the games as a way of striking a blow against discrimination. Owens now has the same debate within himself as the U.S. Olympic Committee had on behalf of all the athletes. It's no great mystery which decisions are made, but it's still interesting to see these stories play out on the national and international levels ? and on a very, very personal level."Race" is solid entertainment and very inspirational, but not as impactful as it could have been. James makes Owens' struggle suitably personal, but his portrayal lacks the emotional depth that would have really driven the movie's messages home. SNL's Sudeikis is effective at playing it straight, but is a little shallow as Owens' coach-mentor-friend. The screenplay, by Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse, does a great job at balancing Owens' story with the surrounding historical drama and spares us the full ugliness of the Nazis' treatment of their own people and Americans' treatment of Owens, but fails to go far enough into the story's most important issues. Stephen Hopkins' direction is even-handed, but antiseptic. "Race" is appropriate for families, but should have explored the parallels between the racial issues of the 1930s and those of the 2010s. While we do see a reflection of the ongoing argument over whether it's more important to take a stand than to overcome adversity through accomplishment, the theme isn't sufficiently played out. Overall, the film effectively tells the dual stories implied by its title, while it educates and inspires, and it has its thrilling moments, but it runs past issues that would have been better served by a deep dive (if you'll excuse the mixed sports metaphor).

		<shortDescription>Jesse Owens and his battle against racial discrimination at home and abroad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Racial discrimination both at home and in Germany are in the forefront of this movie so the races become a battle of good vs evil. The victories are that much more moving because of that. Lots of pointed references to how discrimination was in the U.S. before and after the Olympics.The supporting cast are good. Jeremy Irons is effective as the questionable Avery Brundage who does some good by pushing for participation over boycott but also possibly being bought by the Germans. Carice Van Houten plays the infamous Leni. Strangely, instead of being shown as a Nazi propogandist, she is shown as a hero here pushing for including Jesse in her film. The actor who plays Goebbels is totally wrong for him. Google the real one. Stephan James as Jesse Owens doesn't overact and keeps his performance dignified. Jason Sudekis is good in a non comedic role as the coach.Effecive use of effects to recreate the stadium and crowds.A fascinating and well made movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspirational Acting, but Needed More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They say those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. I guess this motto is the reason Hollywood continues to make historical figure movies at least once a year. This weekend, the life of track legend Jesse Owens comes to the silver screen in the movie entitled Race. While the Oscars may eat up these kinds of movies, they sometimes get overcredited with being the best movie over the year. So once more I dive into my local theater to review the latest in cinematic productions. Let's get to it then. When it comes to historical biographies such as Race, you look for a portrayal that elicits pride, passion, and other emotions that will inspire the audience. And once more Hollywood manages to bring all of that to bear with cinematic magic. Race is packed with well edited sequences that show the struggles Owens faced in his day as he trained to become the champion. The racial fervor of the times is brought in full force with extras intensely screaming with furious scowls painting their faces. Captains and financers of the Nazi regime are even more chilling, as they radiated the menacing energy we've come to know from history, adding suspense to the film. The emotion it brings will truly unnerve some people, and I'm sure some group will get offended by the portrayal of some Race in this movie (despite the inspirational theme in this movie).But the negativity is only one side of the coin, and Race does an even better job with their more lighthearted moments. The training sessions are just the ice breaker to preaching the morals of hard work and determination. Once at the meets, things get turned up a notch with blaring music and beautiful shots raise your emotions to new heights. With each shot of the gun, each stride across the track, I felt roped into Owens world. And the finale? well lets just say the morals they preach would be grand for today's society could stand to learn from. Of course being based on actual events, this suspense can be missing if you know Owens accomplishments already, which is unfortunate in these types of movies. Yet even the best editor can only do so much and we switch our focus to the actors now. Stephan James gets two thumbs up from this reviewer for his portrayal of Owens. He was able to capture the work ethic of Jesse, delivering powerful lines to motivate the audience, but not to cross the line into cheesiness and overdramatic presentation. In addition he adds a nice comedic edge that balances his character out into a new light. Jason Sudeikis also did his role justice playing Larry Snyder, the coach of our Olympian. Rarely do you see Sudeikis in a serious role, so it was refreshing to see him tackle this part. He has emotional fervor, bringing fire to the screen as he defends his morals and encourages his athletes to give it his all. Sure the screaming rants were a little over done, but all in all it worked for me. However, don't think his comedy has been drained away, Sudeikis still brings his comedic timing to the picnic and reigned his ridiculousness in for this film. These two have great chemistry and together really sold the story. Yet with all the good I've mentioned, we should probably talk about some of the limitations to this film. The first is of course the predictability of this story. YES I know when it comes to historical biographies you have only so much to work with, but it still slightly takes away from the suspense and mystery. A second limitation was the lack of seeing his relationship with his teammates that could have led to some interesting substories and character building. Yes we did see some of this near the end, and it was probably more important to portray the pressure placed on his shoulders, but still I would have liked to see a little more. As such there were a few moments that could have been left out of the movie to either make the run time shorter or make room for some other plot lines. Outside of that though, it is quite a fun and entertaining film. Overall, Race does it job to illustrate the past and inspire you to accomplish your dreams. The phenomenal editing and great casting truly preach the morals and lessons that history has to offer us. Yet it is a simplistic movie that lacks a lot of special effects are uniqueness to require a theater visit. As for the accuracy of this film, I can't say as I need to revisit his biography at some point. Historical fanatics are going to enjoy this the most, but those who appreciate good acting should check this one out. My one hope is that this movie doesn't add further fuel to the fire and cause another fight on social media or some other avenue. My scores for this film are:Biography/Drama/Sport: 7.5-.8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment, but certainly not a failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about this movie is the performance of the star, Stephan James. He is very good as Jesse Owens.The biggest problem with this movie is the length, 134 minutes. It is WAY too long for what it has to offer. As one of the other reviewers on here says, the director tried to put far too much material into it. The first hour or so, before we get to Berlin, plays like a so-so made-for-TV movie and should have been cut drastically. Once we get to Berlin, things get much better, but even then, it could have used cutting. We spend a lot of time with Leni Riefenstahl, for example, but why? We never see what she ends up doing with her Owens footage in *Olympia*, her documentary of the 1936 Olympics.That leaves the other problem, the script. Too often it isn't very dramatic. (Contrast it with *42*.) Yes, some of the events in the Olympics are very moving, but that's largely because of the events themselves, not because of the way they are presented. A good script doesn't just repeat historical events, it puts them together in a way that makes them effective, leaving out what isn't effective, and presents them in powerful language that makes them stick in the memory. This script doesn't do that.If it's true that this is the first feature-length film about Owens, then it's good to have it. There isn't anything here that will harm his reputation.But neither, alas, is there a movie here that will fix it indelibly in the minds of viewers. That movie remains to be made, and, I hope, will start with a much better, much shorter script.---------------------Since writing the above, I've read Jeremy Schaap's book *Triumph: The Untold Story of Jesse Owens and Hitler's Olympics*. (It's not a very good book, I'm sorry to report. A lot of personal opinion, often not enough documentation. For a better, if much shorter, account of Owens in Berlin, see Ch. 6 of William J. Baker's *Jessie Owens: An American Life*) It would seem that this movie hews fairly closely to the historical truth, for whatever that's worth. (This is a feature film, after all, and not a documentary.) Sometimes it "fills in the gaps," perhaps most notably with its explanations of why Avery Brundage did what he did and why Owens was put on the 4 x 100 relay team to the exclusion of one of the Jewish runners who had practiced for it. The movie makes Brundage out to be venal, willing to do dishonest things for money. For me, that detracted from what appears to have been his fundamental racism against both Blacks and Jews.I also found it strange that this movie does not deal with the immediate aftermath of the Olympics for Owens - he was barred from further Amateur Athletic Union competitions, and all the offers of money from various American individuals and groups vanished. Before he had even returned to America, in other words, Owens had already been cheated of part of his success.Now I need to watch the movie a second time, to see where else it diverges from or extrapolates on history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This successful film biography traces the life and career of Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. The film is well acted, and the closing sequence recreating the Berlin Olympics was especially dynamic.Stephan James is a clearly a gifted athlete and a fine young actor, as apparent in his interpretation of the role of Jesse Owens. Much of the film was presented through the lens of Owens' relationship with his Ohio State track coach Larry Snyder, convincingly played by actor Jason Sudeikis. The cast included Jeremy Irons, who was excellent in the role of the controversial Olympic administrator Avery Brundage.Another strength of the film were the behind-the-scenes maneuverings of the Nazis in Berlin. The most interesting character interpretation was that of the filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl, which was played very well by Dutch actress Carice van Houten. The unique spin taken by the screenwriters was to make Riefenstahl a very sympathetic and even impartial filmmaker, who defied Goebbels' edict to ban the filming of the final relay race, which was Owens' fourth gold medal. Some of the best scenes of the film were those of Riefenstahl at work in filming her famous documentary "Olympiad." This revisionist view of Riefenstahl may serve in thawing the longstanding prejudice about her as a pawn of the Third Reich and a director associated exclusively with Nazi propaganda.Overall, "Race" was a well-made and well-performed historical drama and biography of one of the great athletes and heroes of the twentieth century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review of Race (spoiler free)**** (4 out of 5)Cast: Stephan James, Jason Sudeikis, Academy Award winner Jeremy Irons* and Academy Award winner William Hurt** Plot overview: Jesse Owens' quest to become the greatest track and field athlete in history thrusts him onto the world stage of the 1936 Olympics, where he faces off against Adolf Hitler's vision of Aryan supremacy.Over the last year Olympic based dramas have shined and this is no exception, the story follows the life of young wannabe Olympian Jesse 'J.C' Owens (James), a student from Cleveland, Ohio. The young man dreams of winning the Olympics and becoming the fastest man on Earth. In order to reach his dream he has to go through extensive amounts of training with coach and friend Larry Snyder (Sudeikis) in the best performance of his career.Here are some points on why this is a must see drama: Research: The research is well done if a little wrong but you can tell that the makers of this feature spent researching about what happened before and during the 1936 Olympics. The facts that are right is that Germany didn't appreciate African Americans in the Olympics and they especially didn't want one of them to win. The fact they got wrong I won't say because of spoilers you will have to watch it.Acting: The acting is to a considerably high standard through almost the entirety of the film but near to the end falls a little flat. The stand out performance comes unexpectedly from Jason Sudeikis normally known for comedies like Horrible Bosses and We are the Millers, this is possibly I have said it before but I'm going to say it again the best performance of his career. The acting done by Stephan James is outstanding he definitely what kind of character he was playing and he didn't shy away from the character he portrays.Sports movies have been on the rise for many years now and this movie shows that sports movies especially sport biographical dramas will continue to rise over the years. It is a delightful story that just lifts your heart.Verdict: A delightfully enthralling and uplifting drama that just makes you to run and win. A truly winning spectacle that shines. 8/10 highly recommended.*1991-Best Actor in a Leading Role, Reversal of Fortune (1990). **1986-Best Actor in a Leading Role, Kiss of the Spider Women (1985).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Covered Too Much For Its Own Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jesse Owens story is extraordinary. It deserved a film for sure. But it deserved to be told with care. I have no doubt there was a ton of passion from everyone involved with the making of 'Race' but I also think there was just too much information for the filmmakers to give Owens the proper big screen adaptation. At times the film is special as Stephan James gives a really good performance as Owens, but other times I felt myself wondering why I was watching a film focusing on a handful of other characters when this was supposed to be a legit Jesse Owens biopic.James' performance is probably the standout here but the entire cast rounds out the film well. Jeremy Irons, Carice van Houten, William Hurt, and even Jason Sudeikis bring plenty of credibility to one of the most important stories in Olympic history as Jesse Owens attempted to overshadow Hitler's regime by breaking records in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Although predictable and cliché at times, I found myself enjoying the relationship between Owens and his coach/trainer played by Sudeikis. I wasn't however that found of them including so much focus on the other aspects of the Berlin Olympics (though still interesting material).I understand these Olympics had many moving vehicles that were important to the overall history of the event, but I just ended up wishing Jesse Owens got more of a focus. With that said, the times when he got his time to shine, the film was at its best. The last act of the film in Berlin felt very cinematic. The games, beginning with one long shot, felt like something made for an IMAX screen. The CGI for the Olympic Stadium also looked surprisingly well for a lower budget film (apparently 5 million). Overall, I don't think this film is as fascinating as the story it's based on is, but there's still redeemable qualities to make it a winning sports drama in my book.+James' lead performance+CGI-Covered too much for its own good6.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Race bait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The correct name of the movie is "Race bait". A movie that should be about an athlete and his great achievements is made into muh discrimination and muh Nazis. Obviously the Hollywood propaganda machine has run out of ideas on "How can we twist historical events to make our left ideology printed on people's minds?" this leads to many bs scenes with no historical context (example: laws against minorities in Germany weren't implemented until after the Olympics and people talking about it for most of the movie about something that doesn't exist yet). What exactly wasn't it OK at the time? they even had Jews and homosexuals in the SA and SS, but let's make it a propaganda movie about politics instead of making it about what Jesse really was about: constant work to improve, perseverance, winning and becoming the best. The guy was better treated in Nazi Germany than in the US and is probably rolling in his grave at this bs movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jesse Owens Brought to life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>7/10. In this bio-pic we take a look at Jesse Owens, who took the Olympics by storm in 1936 in Germany. Stephen Hopkins who is known for directing Lost in Space does a nice job of showing us a glimpse into 1936, and the life of Jesse Owens who was a track and field genius. I enjoyed the portrayal of Owens by Stephen James, he was charismatic and a joy to watch. I also thought that his chemistry with his coach played by Jason Sudeikis was well handled, with Sudeikis taking charge and doing a good job. I like true stories and although they are not always 100% accurate, they do help give you an insight into history. I found it was a solid 7, and was hoping for a little more intensity to push it to a 8, but overall just an enjoyable flick.

		<fullReview>Jesse Owens' quest to become the greatest track and field athlete in history thrusts him onto the world stage of the 1936 Olympics, where he faces off against Adolf Hitler's vision of Aryan supremacy. The director of this film made Predator 2 back in 1990 wow that is such a big development Race was a pretty good film sure it had it's flaws mostly in repeating same old stuff like he breaks up with his wife, they make fun of him because his black and you know it's not an original film but for what it was i was entertained although it does get kinda boring at times but pretty good acting and locations and i was very big surprised by the performance of Jason Sudeikis he was amazing in this film and i can't remember a role that he owned like ever 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'RACE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A biographical sports drama flick, based on the 1930s track and field star Jesse Owens; who won four gold medals (a record) at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The movie stars Stephan James, as Owens; and it costars Jason Sudeikis, Jeremy Irons, William Hurt and Shanice Banton. It was directed by veteran action filmmaker Stephen Hopkins, and it was written by Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse. The film performed moderately well with critics, and at the Box Office. I enjoyed it, to a moderate extent, as well. The film tells the story of Jesse Owens (James); as he first begins college (the first member of his family to do so) at Ohio State. He struggles with racism, and finding work to provide for his family (back home), while becoming a world famous athlete; under the tutelage of his coach, Larry Snyder (Sudeikis). After he's accepted to the Olympic Games, Owens must also decide if he wants to compete (in a Nazi Germany controlled 1936 Berlin). After America also debates this decision.The movie is highlighted by the performances of it's two leads. I'm a huge Jason Sudeikis fan, and I really like seeing him try different things (like this). I think he pulls it off. James is good as well; and the parts of the movie that deal with their characters' friendship (which is a large part of it), are the movie at it's best. The rest of the film feels like it could have been more inspiring though; as it kinds of settles for a lot of overdone clichés instead.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/YnZSF_6sbsA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really well-told story of Owens and the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. The movie is very well made, entertaining and historically important.When I was a boy growing up in the 1960s I was a rabid track and field fan and, even though it happened in the 1930s I was aware of Jesse Owens and his great times in the dashes, times that are great even today, 80 years later, that is how good he was. But until I saw this movie I never knew his name was "J.C.", for James Cleveland, not Jesse at all, but that is what one teacher though he was saying and the name stuck.The story here is set between about 1933, when Jesse was almost 20 and going off to college at Ohio State and 1936, the year of his Olympic victories in Germany, much to the distress of Hitler and the Nazi regime. The story overall seems to stick pretty closely to the facts, although many things about Jesse Owens in private time had to be invented.Stephan James was about 20 during filming, he is Jesse Owens. He had to undergo quite a lot of training to look like a sprinter and to mimic the particular running style of Owens. He does very well in the part.Usually just a funnyman, Jason Sudeikis is really good as Larry Snyder, the track coach at Ohio State who fine-tuned Owens' running to help him become the world-beater that he was.The 1936 Olympic games are dramatized well here. Overall a very entertaining and historically significant story, very well presented.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Use of typical subplot formulas found in docudramas to make palatable to a broad audience, especially with esoteric subjects like track and field, i.e. athlete discord; coach discord; coach w/issues; love interest conflict; outside pressures, and so on. I thought I was re-watching the same script from half dozen similar athletic movies. The problem is that it detracts from any chance of an honest portrayal, of authenticity. So much film time was spent on these distractions that very, very little time was devoted to giving a sense of Owens' hard work in training. An odd inconsistency was the coach teaching a new method of starts with head down and staying low for the first ten or so meters - something that was never done from that scene onward. Interesting subplot was on the German filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl who should also show up in "The Boys in the Boat", if they ever finish it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie - great cast!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I heard about Jesse Owens was - ironically - from my aunt who grew up in Nazi Germany, having been a teenager during the 1936 Olympics, but always speaking of Jesse Owens with the greatest respect. So I was eager to see the movie; and I must say I was very impressed. One thing though, which the movie does not get into, is that apart from Nazi racist ideology, there was also another notion during that time that propagated racial segregation in sport; namely that it was unfair to European athletes to compete with black athletes, postulating that because of superior muscle and bone structure black athletes had an edge over the Europeans. In due course of time that notion was dropped (rightly so, in my opinion) as it is incompatible with the Olympic spirit, and today's philosophy of diversity and equality. I think it is also important to realize - and this the movie portrayed very well - that regardless if one is black or white, there will always be athletes who are physically more gifted than others; but that ultimately the correct mindset and sate of mind is the deciding factor whether one becomes a winner. This was also very sweetly portrayed in the film, that when Jesse Owens was sleeping with the 'wrong' woman he started losing races; but when he was back together again with his true love he became a winner again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit cheesy, but otherwise pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Race was beautifully shot and while that is obviously a great thing, I also felt that, in some cases, it worked against the film's favour. The depiction of Nazi Germany somewhat failed to convey the horror and austerity of the time period, even when we were shown some pretty harsh images. Another thing that made the movie seem more light-hearted was that it seemed to follow the typical Sports Movie formula. Jesse Owens is the young athlete who raises from nothing and through talent and hard work wins four Olympic medals. Larry Snyder is the harsh and demanding coach who secretly has a heart of gold. The movie was not without its cheesy moments. In a particular scene, Larry Snyder learns that Jesse Owens has a daughter and when he confronts him about it, Owens replies with "You never asked." Later in the film, when Jesse finds out that Larry has a daughter and he asks him why he never told him, Larry also replies with "You never asked." Those cheesy moments felt somewhat silly in a movie about real historical people, but they were not enough to ruin the movie for me. Overall, Race was an entertaining and beautiful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Owens sprints to defiance to greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Race (2016) ***1/2 2hr. 14 min.Jesse Owens was one of the earliest black athletes who became famous. Owens was able to transcend race at a time where racism, segregation, and Jim Crow laws were a way of life. For Owens, the only way to confront the harsh realities of racism it to use his very fast legs to fame and fortune. Owens born and raised in Chicago goes to Ohio State on a Scholarship. He has a girlfriend and a baby girl, they are not married, but he promises her that one day he will marry her, in the meantime the coach at OSU, a former Olympian as well, who never seen anyone who has run as fast as Owens. The coach, Larry Snyder (John Sudikias) asks him to give up his current lifestyle even his grades at OSU to focus only on Track and field. In the beginning Owens (Stephan James), accepts the commitment but he has a young daughter and girlfriend he needs to take care of. When Snyder realizes Owens responsibilities he basically, gives him a salary from training and running in track and field. As the Berlin Olympics approaches there are people in the United Stated who want to withdraw American athletes to boycott due to racism and antisemitism of Germany and its leader Adolph Hitler. Jeremy Irons is Avery Brundage who is the Manager of the 36 Olympics and William Hurt is Jerimiah Mahoney who is ahead of the Olympic committee. Mahoney wants to withdraw whereas Brundage wants the American to participate and goes to Berlin to talk to Hitler's right hand man and Hitler's documentary filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl (Carice Von Houten). Brundage requests that all athletes of every racial and religious persuasion would be allowed to play. Brundage gets assurance from Hitler's assistant that Hitler will begrudgingly agree to American demands. Meanwhile, as Jesse popularity leads to travel all over in the US and beyond. In America Owens, meets an assertive and beautiful black female, who has eyes own Owens. Newspapers spark romance rumors. When Owens, tries to explain the situation to his girlfriend back home. The girlfriend will not listen or talk to him over the phone. Owens goes back to the States to profess not only his love for her but to get married as soon as possible. They do and its one of the best scenes in the movie where Owens declares his undying love for Ruth (Shanice Banton). On the career front, the NAACP Leader has a meeting with Owens not to participate in the Olympics due to Hitler stance on Race Relations and Anti-Semitism. He agrees, much to the dismay of his white coach. The coach and best friend list their reasons for Owens to go to Berlin and there various reasons make Owens go to Berlin to stick it to Hitler. The track field scenes in Ohio, Kanas and Berlin are very well done. There's one scene, at the Olympics in the long jump competition, due to racism, Owens just walks and looks at the long jump area, only to disqualifying him as a "fault", there's another athlete from Germany competing who is congenial and requests the track judges and officials to treat Owens fairly, with a disgusted Hitler watching on. That scene is very powerful and telling that not all Germans think alike in Nazi Germany. Riefenstahl is paid by Hitler films to film his warped/twisted propaganda, nonetheless, Leni senses Owens great talent and fights to let Owens contributions at the Olympics in the documentary to stay in the film. One scene that stood out for me is when Brundage is when Owens to see Hitler face to face. Hitler refuses to see in person or shake his hand. That is very telling in Hitler hateful nature but it is not a surprise. The scene is more or less expected by Hitler, at the same time it doesn't diminish Owens accomplishments. Stephan James in his first lead role is very good as Owens who embodies the acting and athletic skill to be a convincing Jesse Owen. Jason Sudikias who plays the coach, who is usually seen in comedies such as the very funny Horrible Bosses, gives a good performance at the loyal and unbounded coach. Hitler is seen is 2 scenes that lasts less than 5 seconds and you never see his eyes, but the hideous mustache remains intact. You know what happens in the movie but so what! All the obstacles that Owens have to face in his professional and personal life and still won only 2 or 3 but 4 gold medals, was with the same woman for almost fifty years until Owens died in 1980. Despite the disease of racism that inflicted the world at large you see two men. Owens Coach and German teammate, were able to see pass the racial bigotry that they see on a daily basis and see Owens as a good and decent man who happens to be black who shows endorses amount of integrity of courage and to see racial harmony with these three people, where racism and anti-Semitism was at his peak is commendable. Overall, Race is a film that needs to be seen, in particularly with the younger generation of young black men. They need to be inspired by a man who had enormous courage and conviction. The police shootings by unarmed black teenagers making headlines within the last two years. This is a film that can convince young black teens if racism is bad now, despite having a black president Barak Obama, if Owens overcame odds that were much worse in 1936 than it is now in 2016, then anything is possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good to see Stephen Hopkins again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a long while since I've seen anything from director Stephen Hopkins; It seems he's been filming a lot of TV in recent years. Two films of the nineties, directed by Hopkins have been favourites of mine and cult classics of others, firstly the Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr. And Denis Leary starrer 'Judgement Night' and then Jeff Bridges and Tommy Lee Jones under- rated film 'Blown Away' both gripping and well made thrillers. He hasn't lost his touch with 'Race', instantly capturing 1930's American at a time of discrimination basing this film of the Olympic champion Jesse Owens who travelled to pre-war Nazi Germany for the 1936 Olympics. Though I'm not sure how much of it is actually factual as there has been some reports of irregularities. The cast is strong yet boldly choosing a fairly unknown, newcomer Stephan James as the lead. The only fault maybe, not attracting a larger audience due to the fresh face, but nonetheless, he performs amazingly well. Jason Sudeikis, is a completely different actor, this being his first serious, non-comical role and he out performs all his previous films, proving what a good actor he is, playing trainer Larry Synder. Other cast members include Game Of Thrones' Melisandre, Carice van Houten playing Germany filmmaker trying to capture the unrestricted events of the Olympics. William Hurt and the ever busy Jeremy Irons, being his fourth film to pop up on my screen this year, both playing American officials deciding the political stance. The film isn't solely about challenging discrimination and the Olympics, but also about tolerance, change, wanting to change and good sportsmanship. The script is amazing with some clever and good pieces, it's got great structure and doesn't lose pace covering a lot of ground. I'm surprised at the score, being composed by Rachel Portman, it didn't seem like her usual work but still, very triumphant and impressive. There's a fine balance between drama and running and jumping. The action is perfectly captured without the over dramatics, and allowing the acting and scenery to portray the feeling and excitement. One scene in particular when Jesse Owens enters the stadium for the first time, standing in awe, especially with the Zeppelin fly-by. Ignoring the minor glitches in history, it's tells a good story and you leave having a greater admiration for both star and character. I surprising hit for me. Running Time: 9 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 8 Script: 8 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being a very well rounded and well made film. Just unfortunate the film won't reach wider audiences, such as those two other films from the nineties. 88% 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No salute?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great until the last ten minutes. How the hell can you have a Jesse Owens film about the 1936 Olympics and not include his famous salute?! The film had so much promise; surprisingly well acted, pulled at the heart-strings and covered Jesse's faults, i.e. his affair, well.The film is all about Jesse Owens and the 1936 Olympics - it's not about anything else - and yet by far the most famous thing involving those two is missed out. During the last few minutes of the film I'm thinking to myself: 'What exactly inspires Jesse to do the salute? Is it a political movement? Is it his friend? Is it the Jewish guys? Wow, don't tell me it's the German guy!' And, then, it ends without it! Totally unacceptable in my book.It also missed out what Roosevelt did concerning Jesse, as do most US history books I'm lead to believe (Watch the BBC's "QI" to find out).All in all, a great film, heading for a 9 from me, until the acceptable rewriting of history, hence 6/10</fullReview>

I can't believe the US / White House didn't acknowledge his achievements, the government sets a great example in educating the new generation indeed and Trump is in the lead???It felt like a long movie but quite a lot about how Jesse's career panned out and it was interesting to see it all worked out in the end.

		<shortDescription>(Not just) about Owens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Reg. review title) And that's the best part. Stephen Hopkins, know more for his entries in the action/adventure genre, specifically from his work on (the cult hit) 'The ghost and the darkness', 'predator 2' (which, while being a neo-cult classic, also reviled him to fans of the John McTiernan-helmed first entry, in the now-unnecessarily running stand-alone, plus crossover series), 'Judgment night' (one of my favorite 'small' urban thrillers, with perhaps Denis Leary's best performances, that almost-divided his MTV-act fans) and 'blown away' (a mainstream hack of a thriller, with its moments). Not including his prolific work on TV ('House of Lies', '24'). Instead of just solely focusing on Owens' life (which it headlines), this movie instead adopts multiple story lines playing out in common timelines, a technique often employed to either keep the content grounded, or to mask the absence of it, and I'm glad to report that in this one, it seems like its more of the former, than the dispiriting latter, that seems to have driven this narrative decision, again something I did not know Hopkins did well.In the beginning, we alternate between getting to know Owens from the time he meets coach Snyder (a fantastic, always-slipping-into- character Jason Sudeikis, and anyone who knows me knows that he's prolly my favorite actor on SNL, who has displayed range that the Wiig and Hader types only strive for and never 'get', though they're given better material than the likes of Leslie Jones) and (U.S. Olympic committee) authority types Jeremy irons and William Hurt battling it out, in an interestingly-comprised white-man's clubroom, about whether or not the U.S. needs to send out its best and brightest to Germany for the '36 Olympics. Now, don't get me wrong, this movie, while being engrossing, is thoroughly mainstream studio fare, concerned most with checking off all the cliché boxes in trying to narrate each of these journeys, along with (the other track that goes in parallel to the actual Olympics) later detailing the filmmaking experience of Riefenstahl (played by Carice 'Melissandre' Van Houten, who I know from the masterful/seminal Paul Verhoeven work, 'Zwartboek'/'Black Book', and her later forays into Hollywood, like 'Valkyrie', 'Repo men' and 'The 5th estate', in which she wasn't, imo, given much substantial to do - and Hollywood makes up for that with this role). Considering this is a biopic that stays largely true to the material it culls from, there are hardly any surprises (though, in my case, the NAACP angle and Owens' reaction to it was something new to me..along with a few other plot threads), and that's a huge part of a movie's charm for me, which cannot be found in something like this, in spite of the material itself being engrossing.Performance-wise, since the audience needs to be in Owens corner all the way, newcomer Stephan James has his job cut out for him, but he proves to be more than equal to the task, of course, with strong support from the writing/direction in terms of his characterization, followed by Van Houten chewing up scenery whenever she appears. Unfortunately though, he's also saddled with the writing not completely exploring the lead's grey areas (so to speak), and while he remains an inspiring figure at the end of the flick, he's just not humanized enough, at least not for the likes of me. An Indie production might just have gone all the way with that aspect, but I'm not really complaining hard enough - enjoyed what I got to watch, overall.And I have to say this - while Barnaby Metschurat's Goebbels does not take away the smarm and menace that Sylvester Groth brought to his portrayal of that character in Tarantino's faux-bio 'Inglourious Basterds', this is a chilling rendering of that character, who has to hold his own with the likes of Irons and even Van Houten in the same frame, and that is not an easy thing for even seasoned performers. So, kudos. William Hurt does well (as he's always wont to - remember the 1 scene he stole in Cronenberg's 'A history of violence'?) in the short screen time he's in, and I love that the makers did not succumb (like many might have done) to have him in the movie more. His thread also is neatly wrapped up, and all's well with the world. The technical departments are all mostly good, but one scene with digitally-rendered flames (a la the Hunger games 3 and 4) kinda 'rained on my parade', so to speak, and completely took me outta the movie, including the typical rousing soundtrack. Though the period details do look appropriate, they also look digitally rendered on- the-cheap, and do not give the look of, say, something like 'Seabiscuit' or 'The road to Perdition', or even something like 'Inside Llewyn Davis'.However, it should also be observed that other than the main leads in each segment/thread, the supporting characters never really come to life, being drawn in broad strokes, and I never really cared if they were around. One thing the makers can be lauded for - 'Race' (an appropriate title if ever there was one) does try to showcase hypocrisy on the topic that was prevalent then, in terms of 'your racism versus mine' approach that the powers-that-be in U.S. white man clubhouses were patting themselves on their backs with. Now, this is, sadly, always gonna be timely and topical, for audiences in any region, and mainly for that reason, I think this one merits multiple viewings by people who can try thinking while watching their cinema, even if they have to put up with mainstream fare on the subject. Don't miss, especially on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jessie Owens will go down in the history books as an athlete who didn't compete for long, but did something that took a stab at prejudices; he competed in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin that was under the rule of the Nazi party, an organization that considered people of color in the same tier as Jewish people. The Olympics have never supposed to be about politics, but when the games are set in a state with a controversial government, it's understandable that people are going to take sides on what's more important. Is it better to go to the Olympics for yourself or to take a stand with your country and protest?And this issue was on Jessie Owens shoulders, who was already facing problems because of the color of his skin. These kinds of people deserve some form of immortality for making these moments happen. To him, this was simply taking his skill of sprinting and running with it (no pun intended) all the way to the top. The Olympics are for the best of the best, and Jessie Owens had the bad luck of competing in Berlin out of all possible years. Race chronicles that famous year in which Owens went to the Olympics.Jessie Owens (played by Stephen James) is attending Ohio State University while caring for his family, fiancé Ruth, and his baby daughter. He had the grades to get into better schools, but he chose this college as the coach of the track and field team was Larry Snyder (played by Jason Sudeikis). Snyder happens to be a former athlete who nearly got to go to the Paris games of 1924, but is now having trouble winning matches with his current lineup. As a guy who wants the best of the best, the prejudices of color don't matter to him, especially seeing how fast Owens is.Owens claims several wins for his school, giving him leverage to join the 1936 Olympic team. There is pressure from the public for the U.S. to boycott the games, but the president of the International Olympic Committee, Avery Brundage (played by Jeremy Irons), insists that the country will compete, as the games are not political. With some insistence that the games are a once in a lifetime chance, Owens heads to Berlin with Snyder as something of a secret coach. He faces against some impressive German runners and the constant reminder that the Nazis dislike him.The good news is that Race happens to be very entertaining. Unlike the most recent bio stories that put a particular focus on the subject (like with Steve Jobs and the three act structure around presentations), this tells the story as it probably was. It'll serve as a good educational lesson about Jessie Owens and what he was facing during his time in the Olympics. Stephen James makes for a good Jessie Owens, though the biggest surprise is Jason Sudeikis who is primarily known for comedic roles. He is an example that comedic actors can handle dramatic material just as well.The bad news is that Race tries to tell a lot of side material along with the story of Jessie Owens. We get Jason Sudeikis' story of being a coach, Jeremy Irons and the Olympic Committee struggle, a Nazi director insuring that the games are to the liking of the führer, and even one with a German movie maker making sure she can shoot the games properly. At least one of these had to be cut, because these stories almost push Owens out of his own story. At least the movie tries it's hardest to work with itself to ensure that Race belongs to Owens.I'll give this seven sprinter shoes out of ten. Race may not be a gold medal winner like it's subject, but it has plenty of substance to make it worth watching.</fullReview>

There is plenty of talking about should the U.S. boycott the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. An equal amount of time and talk is devoted to whether Jessie Owens should boycott the Olympic Games. Well if you know the outcome of all that debate you know the USA goes and Jessie runs.The movie looks good and the period is captured on the screen. Stephan James gives a strong performance and looks his part. Jason Sudeikis doesn't seem like the runner he use to be turned drinking coach. The other white males were all portrayed as flawed. That includes Avery , did I accept a bribe, and Dean Cromwell along with Hitler both seemed out of touch with reality. The portrayal of Leni Riefenstahl was interesting as it had her recreating scenes for her documentary of the games.The movie looks good on the big screen and would be best enjoyed in the theater. It tells the story of an American hero. The over end credits photos of the real Jessie Owens are a highlight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Race (2016) Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the dream of Jesse Owens to be the best runner in the world. As the 1936 Olympics is set to take place in Germany, Owens faces adversity when discrimination at home and politics overseas begins to build. With the help of Ohio Coach Larry Snyder, Owens proves to himself and his family that nothing will stand in his way from pivoting to greatness. The film is directed by Stephen Hopkins and stars Stephan James, Jason Sudeikis, and Jeremy Irons.One of the great things we see in 'Race' is the dual narratives about the discrimination at home between whites and blacks; while overseas it's the Hitler regime readying to host the Olympics. The director, Stephen Hopkins, did an amazing job telling a story about the politics of race. Actor Stephan James who plays Jesse Owens was likable and you could sense the weight of politics on his shoulders when he is forced to make a decision to take part in the Olympics. Not taking its time to recognize how good of an athlete Owens is, much of the movie is centered on the Hitler Regime. You sense the animosity building as Germany prepares to host the games while holding hostility towards Jews and those of color participating in the event.You can read more of my review here at: http://thecinemascore.com/2016/02/22/race-2016- review/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Derivative in a Made-for-TV Kind of Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was in high school, I had an English teacher who asked the class to write a short story from the perspective of a famous historical figure; an exercise to get us to understand first person perspective. Being the resident class smart-a**, I wrote my story from the perspective of infamous science-fiction director Ed Wood struggling to finance Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959) commonly dubbed the worst movie ever made. Watching Race was like watching one of my classmates' essay put to the screen. It was quaint, it was obtusely dedicated to a first-person narrative and it was disappointingly derivative.The film is about track and field champion Jesse Owens (James) and the struggles he faced to make it to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Despite being among the fastest humans on earth Jesse faces constant discrimination in his home city of Cleveland, his school Ohio State and track meets across the United States. Despite this though, he remains committed. Aiding him in his "crusade" to show up Hitler is his coach Larry Snyder (Sudeikis) and his girlfriend and eventual wife Ruth Solomon (Banton). Yeah, that's basically it.I put "crusade" in quotations because the movie never seems to know or care whether Jesse himself is concerned with Hitler, Nazi Germany and their racial policies. In fact the movie is hardly able to gesticulate what exactly Jesse cares about at all. He's so much of a preeminent figure in this fluffy piece of glorified biography that it's a wonder he's given motivation of any kind. Discrimination at home; he doesn't sweat it. Relationship troubles; solved by the half-way point. A living symbol of hope for the Black community and by extension European Jews; who cares. The movie is clearly more concerned with the destination than the journey.Aiding us in getting there are two completely unnecessary subplots. One involving the American Olympic Commission led by Jeremiah Mahoney (Hurt) and Avery Brundage (Irons). Mahoney leads the faction of the commission that wants to boycott the Olympic Games because...you know...Nazis. Brundage on the other hand feels the Olympics transcend politics; it also helps that his construction company is receiving sweetheart contracts from Berlin spearheaded by Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels (Metschat). The other subplot involves famed film director Leni Riefenstahl (van Houten) who wants to give the 1936 Olympics the same Wagnerian treatment she gave Hitler in Triumph of the Will (1934).What Riefenstahl did for Jesse Owens in Olympia (1938), director Stephen Hopkins attempts to recreate with the slick post-production of a modern feature film. Problem is Hopkins doesn't have Riefenstahl's eye, nor the attention to story details necessary to create anything beyond a made-for-TV movie. Stephan James does as much as he can with the little he's given but doesn't get past second gear. He constantly regurgitates and absorbs the thoughts of others, passively making his way through a plot so overtly made for him that his look of awe when entering the Olympiastadion is about the only interesting moment of characterization. Choosing Jason Sudeikis as Jesse's coach and mentor is a choice so out of left field, it's almost too distracting to enjoy. Sudeikis looks like he won the role after looking in enough Wheaties boxes with his gruff "coach talk" appearing almost comical.With a loaded a title as Race, you would think this movie would have a little more going for it. Unfortunately it is worse than a point- by-numbers biography about a gallant sports hero. A movie of that caliber would be goodly enough to provide themes, characterization and subtext. Alas the only thing Race manages to fit into its bloated screen time is a very dry hagiography about a man who did some running and got to almost meet Hitler. If only we were all so lucky.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for this movie I wondered why no one had done it before. I mean, there are so many angles to the story - the Depression, Hitler and his wonder men, the sort of no man's land Northern blacks endured before the 60s, and in the middle of it one of the greatest athletes of all time, Jesse Owens. Growing up in the 60s we all knew the meat of this, about how Jesse had single-handedly stood up to and beat the Nazi "super men", but it was still fun to see it played out on the screen (with an appropriate homage to the real Jesse at the close of the film). And we also knew that Avery Brundage was an old (by then) elitist windbag. I guess this film could have been done better but I wouldn't be able to tell you how. The lead actors and particularly Coach Snyder were solid, I didn't know much about Jason Sudeikis going in but he looks and plays a little like a cross between Bruce Willis and Ed Helms. The music was good, some of the cinematography was spectacular, but what I thought was best of all was the pacing. They had a great story to tell, and they took just about the right amount of time for each step. They also told the story straight up, they gave you both sides to the characters and let you decide who was good and bad. This is really a well made and well considered film, I gave it a 10 and my ten year old (who was popping off his seat during the races at the end) also gave it a well-deserved 10 of 10. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By-The-Numbers Bio-Pic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RACE is a "by-the-numbers" bio-pic of Jesse Owens and his 4 Gold Medals won at the 1936 Olympics in the heart of Nazi Germany. A perfectly agreeable - and instantly forgettable - movie that skims the surface, but never really delves into, the events that transpired.Director Stephen Hopkins has mainly worked in television and it shows as this film was nice, hitting on some controversial topics of race and politics, but never really hitting them too hard. As soon as the movie hits on a topic, it moves on to some sort of "feel good" moment, mostly of Owens winning a race.While the stakes in the world were high at the time, the stakes in this movie never really seemed high. Partly, I blame the director, but there should also be fault found in the two lead performances of Stephan James (as Jesse) and Jason Sudekis as his coach, Larry Snyder. They both do some good "TV" acting, in that they hit a note of contemplation, or angst or sadness right before they jump to another scene and the previous scenes emotions were completely forgotten.A case in point was the championships where Owens hurts his back right before competing. There's a confrontation scene between Owens and Snyder where the coach declares "I'm going to scratch you" from this very big race. Owens glares and says "no way" and then competes and sets all types of records and the injury was never spoken of, or referred to, or even was a factor in the race.All in all a "fine" motion picture, one that I will forget that I saw when I look back at the films that I viewed in 2016.6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film on an amazing story that has a really good use of CGI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You don't want to throw around the word epic and overuse it, but when you make a movie about the Olympics, it's usually a movie about one athlete taking on the world (sport depending). For Jesse Owens this concept is met with more difficulty. A black man barely welcomed in his own backyard gets the chance to run in the greatest competition of all time, in another country that does not accept him as well, and he does it and helps change the face of the world forever.Stephen James did a fantastic job playing Jesse Owens. He gave a lot a heart to it, which was important. It's a great reflection of who Owens was. Becoming a huge fan of the work of Jason Sudeikis who plays Jesse's Coach, Larry Snyder. The well known funny man takes the same position as Sylvester Stallone did in Creed with this dramatic supporting role, and it was a decent turn to see him do something a little different.Also want to give credit to Jeremy Irons who plays Avery Brundage of the U.S Olympic committee. Race mostly focus on the life of Owens up to the 1936 games, but also has a great side story about America dealing with the Nazi Regime with the Olympics being held in their hometown. Irons is the center of this sub plot and does a good job making it interesting.For what it is, I'm also fairly impressed with the CGI being used to built the 1930s in this movie. Race is a big movie and the visual effects help make it look better. I wish the budget was bigger so that the effects could be better, but it's very impressive for a 5 million dollar film. The only odd thing that was distracting is that it looks like they used visual effects to replace stunt men in the movie. Instead of getting a stunt double who looked fast enough to play Owens, they have parts in Race that just look like the took footage of Stephen James and speed it up to make his running faster. Not sure about this method, and others were they used digital images for high jumps, or a least that's what it looks like.But overall, Race impressed me. It's a good tear jerker that puts a a smile on your face. Truly an epic movie about overcoming the biggest obstacles to be the very best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bland sincere docudrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1933. Jesse Owens (Stephan James) leaves his home in Cleveland to go to Ohio State. Former track star Larry Snyder (Jason Sudeikis) is the coach of a losing program. He sees natural talents in Owens and aims to win gold in 1936 Berlin. Owens has a daughter with Ruth Solomon. Meanwhile, the US Olympics Committee is debating boycott supported by Jeremiah Mahoney (William Hurt). They send construction magnate Avery Brundage (Jeremy Irons) to Berlin to meet Leni Riefenstahl (Carice van Houten) and Joseph Goebbels (Barnaby Metschurat).This is a very sincere, functional historical drama. Stephan James does sincere work. There is very limited drama before the games. There are snippets of insights into this track and field world. The best is Snyder talking over the football team in the locker room to demonstrate a hostile crowd. However, I'm not sold on Sudeikis in this dramatic role. He doesn't have the gravitas. He always seem out of place in this role. The first half really holds very little drama or surprises.Jesse Owens' romantic challenges hold little interest. The NAACP and others pushing for boycott adds a little color. The drama seems to come from Luz, Brundage, Riefenstahl, Goebbels, and finally the replacement of Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller. This indicates a better drama not in the biopic of Owens but a drama behind Berlin 36.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jesse Owens' Story Deserve A Better Telling Than This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Race,which have themes that refer to its dual meaning - sprint contest and racial ethnicity, is a biographical film about American Olympic icon,Jesse Owens.Stephan James takes on the lead role of the African-American sprinter that won 4 gold medals at the 1936 Berlin Olympics at a time when racism was at its peak in both the United States and Germany.Director Stephen Hopkins takes us into many themes to provide us a look at the world during the 1930's particularly about racial inequality that was prevalent and how Owens captures his well-known glory at the track amid these circumstances.The screenplay of Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse allows the film to take us from various points of Owens' life from his collegiate years representing Ohio State at the track that focuses on the coach-and-sprinter relationship of him and his coach,Larry Snyder and his excellence at the NCAA championships.We are also taken to the life experiences of Owens like having a young daughter with his girlfriend Ruth,his affair with another woman,his consideration of non-participation on the Games as recommended by the NAACP, his Olympic glory that includes his unlikely friendship with German track star,Carl "Luz"Long and being snubbed by Adolph Hitler after winning a gold medal.In addition to all these,it also allows us to take a look at the segregation and anti-Semitism that exist in the United States and Germany respectively.Also included in the film are the political battles Olympic committees of the United States and Germany as influenced by their dislike for each other.Finally,we are also treated to the struggles and exploits of German filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl of filming the Olympics. With all these things mentioned from the previous paragraph,the viewer is treated to a by-the-numbers movie that would seem tad too long as we are presented with many things that could probably be somehow told better by the screenwriters in terms of cohesion and given a better treatment in terms of the characters presented.While the major characters like Stephan James provided us a great performance of Owens as his portrayal made the viewer cheer for the him as he undergoes many trials and proud moments,the other minor characters felt like they are lacking as they felt more like one- dimensional types.We get to see Germans as simply anti-Semitics with only Carice Van Houten's portrayal of Riefenstahl as redemption as well as Caucasians in America as simply hating African-Americans with only Jason Sudeikis's first dramatic role of Larry Snyder redeeming them as well.Despite the presence of Jeremy Irons and William Hurt,the Olympic committee members simply were just lacking in terms of character and there is nothing much being told nor their similar attitudes towards race aren't at all being explored.It played everything safe to avoid controversy.It even have the clichéd scene which many have been debating for years now: Hitler snubbed Owens as expected.While I may not be really be complaining about this film as I still would consider it a good one as it was still recommended by the Owens family particularly the late sprinter's sisters,it could still have been a great movie if it wasn't told in a strategic and simplistic fashion.As many Americans would agree,Owens' story deserve a great and classic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; - powerful story told with mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Jesse Owens is so powerful and inspirational, I'm surprised it has taken this long for there to be a major big screen version. And to put it in the hands of someone as experienced as Stephen Hopkins, it surely has to be a winner?Let's start with the casting. Stephan James is great in the lead role. He cleverly balances determination with integrity, forging a character that is well-rounded, honest and inspiring. Jason Sudeikis, on the other hand, is less impressive. In one of his first non-comedic roles, he fails to give any conviction or motivation to either himself or his trainees, and feels strangely unauthoritative and miscast. The rest of the cast do suit their roles pretty well, Jeremy Irons fits the part of the persuasive businessman perfectly.Visually, Race is impressive too - the 1930s costumes and sets adequately look the part, and the stadium scenes are very well realised and immersive, with terrific swirling cinematography by Levy. Unfortunately the audio doesn't quite match the quality - Portman's music is disappointingly blatant - the evil three-chord motif every single time we look at something German gets incredibly grating.Unfortunately the score reflects the movie. It feels a little rushed and simplistic - all Germans are bad guys, all black Americans are good guys. It wouldn't have hurt to have lost 15 minutes either, ideally the side-stories of embassies, film making and politics. By making those parts peripheral, we could focus more on the heart of the story, Owens himself, and his reactions to racial inequality, corruption and bigotry in order to make it a more personal and emotional tale.3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film thinking it would be a next bio that would be spoilt by Hollywood and be cast on the rubbish heap of other Bio's. I have read a few other reviews before saying about the inaccuracy about it. Yes there are some but if the film had to carry every single one ? we would be watching this film for about five hours plus. The years or months may be a little out, however; Mentioned in a previous post ? In 1933 the Nazi passed a law that allowed the forced sterilisation of people who were considered 'congenitally sick. This was not just aimed at the Jews. The Olympics in Berlin was in 1936. Back to the film ? Nice CGI acting is very good. Good Tear Maker. A big thumbs up from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always worth producing and telling stories like these to remind some and educate others about what happened 60, 80 or 100 years ago in our small sliver of human history. It's good to present people with recorded facts, inspiring challenges and obvious injustice ? it's how pop culture can make a dent in ignorance and prejudice, if it's well done. The main actor does a good job and the actress who plays Ruth is pretty as hell, while seeing Van Houten as Riefenstahl was a nice surprise. The coach role should have gone to someone else, I think; Sudeikis is a hammy sketch performer from forced and stilted comedy setups, despite his effort. The glide over of the nitty-gritty and the stark realities of racial murders also stands out, but you can't have everything all the time. This is not just about a moment of pride in American history and a man's grace under pressure, but hopefully one more way to reinforce the truth that there's only one race of people: the human kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another liberating hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I clearly have a weakness for stories about the pursuit of justice, of what is right and the German Nazi regime during World War 2, especially when they are based on real events. Race combines brilliantly these two themes. The long pursuit of real equality for blacks in the US, still in progress more than a century after the abolition of formal slavery, is punctuated by the appearance of these sports heroes who carry the burden of liberation of their people on their shoulders being the pioneers in their respective sport, besides having reached record highs. Through cinema I have known the boxer Jack Johnson, the first black champion 1908-1915; the baseball player Jackie Robinson 1947-1956 whose exploits are commemorated by retiring his jersey number 42 in all major league teams today. My preference for these stories may be rooted in the empathy I have as a Québécois as we also have our sports heroes in history: Louis Cyr and Maurice Richard. In Race it is the story of Jessie (JC) Owens, the Olympic sprinter that during the 1933 Olympics showed to Hitler's face the flaws of his insane ideology based on the supposed superiority of the Aryan race, by eclipsing many world records. The film is touching, very moving and visually beautiful. A definite must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Race is a biopic about professional sprinter, Jesse Owens(Stephan James). Jesse has been a track &amp; field athlete, almost all his life. He goes to Ohio State University, to pursue his dreams. Here, he trains under Ohio State's track &amp; field coach, Larry Snyder(Jason Sudeikis). Coach Snyder tells Jesse that, he will take him all the way to the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Snyder also informs Jesse, that he needs Jesse's complete dedication, if Jesse wants to achieve his dreams. However, the Hitler-ruled Germany is extremely prejudiced against African Americans. Race is a flawless film. Race is a sports drama, that will inevitably lift your mood. Director Stephen Hopkins has masterfully brought Jesse Owens' life, to the big screen. I love the fact that Jesse Owens is not showcased as being a perfect man. He has his flaws but, he is a great human being who is dedicated to his sport &amp; loves his family. The race set pieces are thrilling &amp; will have you on the edge of your seat, for those few seconds. The way Jesse Owens created history at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, is staggeringly amazing. A note on the performances. Stephan James is outstanding as Jesse Owens. James portrays the protagonist with various shades of emotions. Jason Sudeikis is spectacular as Larry Snyder. Sudeikis shines, in his first dramatic role. Eli Goree is impressive as Dave Albritton. Shanice Banton is great as Ruth Solomon. Carice van Houten is superb as Leni Riefenstahl. Houten's character is a stark contrast, to her role as the red priestess on Game of Thrones(2011-). Jeremy Irons is mind blowing as Avery Brundage. Irons gives one of the best performances of his varied career. William Hurt is good as Jeremiah Mahoney. David Kross is excellent as Carl 'Luz' Long. Barnaby Metschurat is awesome as Joseph Goebbels. The supporting cast is impressive, in their respective roles. Race is a must watch for every sports buff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about a moment in time that happened to make a difference in the modern history of mankind. That moment was defined first and foremost by sport. Not politics, not finance, just sport. And that moment was carried out by an incredible athlete who had decided to focus on the one thing that he was gifted for: his athletic gift.if you want to see a story about the life of Jesse Owens, this is not the place to go. The movie is called "RACE", not "THE INCREDIBLE LIFE OF JESSE OWENS".Jesse Owens' life was complicated. He went through a lot and did a lot. He actually messed up quite a bit, and, after his performance in Berlin, he certainly did not leverage his own new brand to make a fortune and become influential. He was probably born at the wrong time in the wrong place. Except for that moment in time when, against all odds, he found himself in the heart of the Berlin Stadium, facing 120,000 people believing in ideals which were a direct threat to his own existence, with one guy with a small mustache leading the pack of wolves. And the winner was...the fast black dude who had the guts to do it: RACE! The result: 4 gold medals in your face, man! Of course, that moment is what needs to be celebrated, again and again, because, you know what, we almost forgot about it, America!This movie is the real thing: it tells how things went, for real, for a period of 3 years, during which events built up gradually and slowly at first, then accelerated, then slowed down a bit again, and finally exploded metaphorically and figuratively. Anybody who would want more stuff and more complexities and more brutal, in your face kindastuff, I think, does not understand, or accept, what this movie is all about.Stephan James' performance is incredible: this guy is a natural actor. He is 22 (Jesse Owens'age at the time) and he is already on a big screen, filling the shoes of an American Hero, with an incredible maestria: his performance is a must-see.Jason Sudeikis is such a gifted actor. I have seen him in many interviews, smart, quick-paced, naturally fit for comedy,and I was wondering how he would fare in a drama. The result is: he is all about depth, precision, control, truth in this movie: if I were Larry Snyder, I'd be extremely grateful to Jason Sudeikis for his portrayal of myself.Jeremy Irons and William Hurt bring the right touch of experience and depth to the story: I loved their performance.The other actor who stands out is Barnaby Metschurat, who plays the role of Joseph Goebbels. I thought he was simply scary: his presence always made me feel like I was facing the constant threat of death, that somebody was pouring on me a ton of ice that made me shrink and want to become an insignificant mouse escaping through the first hole I could see.What did the movie miss to be perfect? It is difficult to say. A faster pace? that is debatable. It depends how much proximity to the facts vs. how much "Marvel-like" story-telling one wants. CGIs? A few background spots were sometimes postcard-like or made me feel like I was seeing some decor right out of the Dick Tracy movie. The musical score? well, it was at times a bit subdued, I thought, though it did find a good balance overall. Details, really, that maybe an independent production with their budget a fraction of a Studio movie has to face.Overall, a well-deserved 9/10 score. My two cents.</fullReview>

But I loved the historical accuracy and truth that this movie showed. I didn't like that submissive black man stuff, but that's how we were always portrayed in EVERYTHING.

		<fullReview>Just as Chadwick Boseman was terrific as Jackie Robinson in last year's "42", so too is Stephan James as Jesse Owens in this wonderful recreation of the the early story of one of America's greatest Olympians, winner of four Gold Medals at the 1936 Nazi hosted Olympic games in Berlin. Jason Sudeikis surprises as a dramatic actor playing Owens' college track coach at Ohio State in the early 30's. The racism of those days was flagrant and in your face and its ugly aspects are on full display here, yet Owens endured with silent dignity. It's fun to learn that the name Jesse was a phonetic mistake when his grade school teacher shortened his birth name, James Cleveland Owens to "JC" and the elongated pronunciation of JC became Jesse. The first two arcs of the film concern Jesse and his evolution as a track star under the guidance of his color blind coach, Lary Snyder, very well played by Sudeikis. In the states the undisputed coach of college and Olympic track and field is the late, real life Dean Cromwell who was the track and field coach of the Univ. of Southern California which dominated the college competition which also led to his selection to coach the USA team for the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. The nastiness of the Nazis is not glossed over and the then nascent President of the Olympic Organizing Committee, Avery Brundage, is well played by Jeremy Irons. William Hurt, another Oscar winner along with Irons, plays a conscience driven executive concerned about whether to send Americans to compete in Hitler's games on the world stage. Curiously, much is made of Leni Reifenstahl who was the maker of Hiltler's greatest documentary supposedly to support the superiority of the Aryan "race". She is capably played by Carice van Houten delivering lines in both English and German to great effect. The Nazi nastiness drips from every pore and word spoken by Josef Goebbels superbly played by German speaking actor Barnaby Metschurat-yep with a first name of Barnaby and his last name, it must have been a very confusing choice of names for his parents. He is creepy and detached. The depiction of Hiltler is lousy though. The few scenes in which he is presented do not include any dialogue and the actor chosen to play Hitler, given the visage we know all too well is feeble, plus the actor doesn't even really look like the real deal; his moustache is not right and he looks too young. But this is a gem of a tear jerker patriotic tribute to all that is good in a race blind Olympics and a testament to the stoic, enduring and graceful ways in which one of our greatest athletes made us all proud.Source: http://www.livingfilms.org/triple-9-2016/3540</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Film but One too Many Subplots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a feeling this would be a pretty good movie from the trailers but I'm also a bit biased since it's based off of an actual historical event. I enjoyed it but there were a few things that I thought the movie didn't delve into enough and there was one thing in particular that had a bit too much time devoted to. Still, these are just mild complaints and the film is honestly very good. It was directed by Stephen Hopkins and I have to admit that he hasn't always impressed me with his work but I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. I have to give him props for that. Let's talk about the plot.The film focuses on the life of Jesse Owens (Stephan James), a track and field athlete that became popular in the 1930s for constantly breaking records and taking home four gold medals during the 1936 Olympic games. The story shows us how he got into Ohio State and dealt with the extreme amount of racism around him. Owens, thanks to the help of his coach and family, makes his way to the Berlin Olympic games where he represents his country despite the horrible treatment he received at the hands of his fellow Americans.The cast is absolutely solid on this one and I found myself wanting to see more of these characters interacting with each other. Stephan James gives us a likable Owens that is sometimes ambiguous about his situation in life but is ultimately surprisingly positive and forgiving to others. I also enjoyed Jason Sudeikis' as Larry Snyder and I honestly wouldn't mind an entire film about Snyder now. Snyder is gruff and comes off as uncaring at times but ends up being one of the most supportive people in Owens' life. The only other character that stood out to me was Jeremy Irons as Avery Brundage. I always enjoy seeing Irons and his character is just ambiguous enough that I found myself rooting for and against him at different times in the movie.The film is well done but there are some excess subplots in here that I don't believe really needed to be told. I did enjoy seeing some of the background story on Larry Snyder and the motivations behind his character and I believe that it's important enough to Jesse Owens' own story that it should be included in the movie. What came off as forced to me was the subplot involving a German director trying to convince Joseph Goebbels to shoot her film about the Olympic games the way she wanted to. I wouldn't mind seeing someone tell this director's story but it feels like the focus was taken off of Owens a bit too many times during movie. The film still focuses most of its time on Owens but it feels relatively light considering the running time is over two hours.I enjoyed seeing the life of Jesse Owens put to film and it is always enlightening to see what minorities had to put up with during this time period. I would have preferred to see a bit more of the story focusing on this aspect but what we got is pretty good. This movie really is interesting and entertaining but it feels like some of the subplots aren't really relevant to the main story. Fortunately, even the unnecessary material was still entertaining so it didn't bother me too much in the end. I have to give this one a recommendation, especially to history and sports fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Quit thinking so much, Jesse . . . "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>" . . . it's not what you're good at," wife Ruth counsels her spouse, track star Jesse Owens, 75 1/2 minutes into the 134-minute Biopic, RACE. This movie exposes two long-time bastions of American Racism, Columbus, OH and Ann Arbor, MI. Ohio State University was one of the last Big Ten schools to integrate its athletic showers, due to the fearful crackers depicted in RACE. Worse yet, Owens was deprived of his feat of officially breaking an unprecedented four world records within an hour at Ann Arbor's University of Michigan by a racist time-keeper, or "timer," which is tantamount to a horse-hater finding a ruse to deprive Secretariat of his Triple Crown. (In the 1930s, Southeast Michigan, including Ann Arbor, was a major hotbed of Racist Nazi Sympathizers and enablers, led by car-maker Henry Ford, aviator Charles Lindbergh, and "Hitler's Priest," national radio ranter Father Charles Edward Coughlin.) Though Hitler himself makes a few cameo appearances in RACE, there are plenty of other Big Villains here, including eventual World Olympic Dictator Avery Brundage. Avery stops just short of loading the U.S. Team's only two Jewish members onto cattle cars bound for a Death Camp, in exchange for 30 pieces of silver from Nazi Olympic Organizer Joseph Goebbels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible Story of an American Hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it tonight. It was awesome and entertaining. A powerful movie and a great story that should have been told sooner. Can't believe a film about this incredible wasn't made before! A black American Athlete going to Berlin in 1936 and beating Hitler himself, I can't even imagine the pressure the real Jesse went through...Very interesting to see what people were dealing with in their everyday life back then. Great acting performance too by Jason Sudeikis and Stephan James. I really think that you can feel the respect they both had for each other. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i didn't watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie is so awful i didn't watch itthis movie is about a black guy who runs. what else is new?was he fast?what was he suppose to prove, that blacks can run faster then whites?did the guy have to ride in the back of the bus?did they let him pass in the whites only restaurants?all of these things i do not know, since the movie is awful and i didn't watch itbut if i were to watch this movie i would expect to see a lot of deep fried chicken and ripe watermelons.since the guy was a runner he must have been fed very well. that's probably why they consider him the greatest track and field athlete in historyseriously?? in history?? seriously?? Nazis didn't even hate blacks. they hated Jews.on the contrary.. its in US of A where they hated the negroas far as I know there were black African officers in German Army during WW2so the Nazis thought the whites are the superior race. all right fair enough.i'm white. i'm not a Nazi. but i completely agree that white race is superior.what is so bad about being superior??i think whites contributed a lot of great things to this worldthe lone fact that we educated blacks and let them run for sport and not for food somewhere in Africa.. proves that white race is morally superior.MORALLY GENTLEMEN.physically we are not that superior.that's why we invented everything to compensateyes. we invented really cool cars and big houses planes and tanks to compensate for our about average sized penises no, we don't need to run fast. but we drive fast cars.no, we don't need to jump high. but we fly planes.no, we don't need to watch movies about black dudes running. but we watch the news.and in the news.. it seems they don't run very fast.at least not faster then the bullet.what is it our fault again??dammit.</fullReview>
