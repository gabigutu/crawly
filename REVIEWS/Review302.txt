		<shortDescription>Taut, gripping, vintage cop thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's doubtful that even Dirty Harry in his most menacing moments could match the smouldering rage that Glenn Ford brings to the screen in this excellent 1953 Fritz Lang flick. From a modern POV there is nothing unfamiliar here, except maybe the dated hardboiled lingo. The maverick cop, the revenge theme, the underworld characters and heroines. It's just that whereas a modern director would make this into a predictable two hour yawn-fest with slow-motion car accidents and ten minute shootouts with shoulder-launched missiles, Lang's movie clocks in at under 90 minutes, and there isn't an ounce of fat on it. It's lean, fast-moving and engrossing. Not a single camera shot is wasted or unnecessary. The script crackles, the cast is uniformly excellent, and Ford and Lee Marvin in particular are unforgettably intense. Ford, just when he's about to go way over the top, reins himself in, adding to the aura of barely suppressed violence in his character.The movie can also lurch from plot exposition to sudden, economical and unexpected explosions of violence which can still shock today and must have been extremely confronting fifty years ago. And from there it can become suddenly, unexpectedly sensitive and moving. Nothing is wasted in this movie. Everything is nailed down just right. It's not that they don't make them like this any more; it's more that they've been making them like this ever since, and generally to lesser and lesser effect.A strong 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corruption in higher places</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang, a man who knew the business like no other, is seen at the top of his craft with this interesting film noir that pays off in unexpected ways. Mr. Lang was a man that believed in total control and who wanted to get the best out of everyone in all his films. "The Big Heat" is one of those rare films in which all the elements come together with surprising results.Corruption in higher places is the basis of the story. A good police detective who cares enough to keep on probing into the suicide of one of his comrades, is what brings Dave Bannion, not only to the attention of the higher ups in the police department, but to Lagano and the mobsters that work for this evil man. Tragedy finds a way into Dave's home that makes him even more resolved into seeking justice and unmasking the mobsters found along the way that have a grip on the police department.The casting of "The High Heat" is what makes this film different from the rest of the films of the genre. Glenn Ford made an excellent appearance in the film. He gives one of the best performances of his career. But of course, the film belongs to Gloria Grahame, the bad girl in most of the films of this genre. What a joy it's to watch her! Her Debby Marsh is one of the best roles she portrayed for the movies. Surprisingly, Ms. Grahame and Mr. Ford show a lot of chemistry in their scenes together.The others in the film do good work under Mr. Lang's direction. A young Lee Marvin is perfectly creepy as Vince Stone, a man who gets what's coming to him at the end in a memorable sequence playing against Ms. Grahame. Jeannette Nolan makes a valuable contribution as the bad widow of the man that commits suicide. Alexander Scourby, as Lagana has some good moments. Joselyn Brando plays Dave's wife. Also, in a small part we see Carolyn Jones."The Big Heat" demonstrates why Fritz Lang was one of the best influences in the American cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This punchy little noir moves along at brisk clip. Glenn Ford simmers the whole time like a boiling kettle about to blow . This man has no pleasures that are obvious except his Westinghouse wife and child. Lee Marvin barely maintains control for much of the film. He is a catalogue of evil and greedy excess. Gloria Grahame is marvelous, witty, beautiful, bitter beyond hope. There is no redemption to be had for most of the characters in this sordid little universe. Conspiracy theorists of the 21st century will look back at the kind of simple-minded corrupt worldview espoused by Lang in this and other films and lament its loss. In THE BIG HEAT, evil and rot have names and faces and with enough fortitude, and the willingness to lose everything, they can be conquered. At least for a day. We know today that the whole infrastructure of power is poisoned beyond repair. The fifties held out a modicum of hope. Brief, fleeting hope. This is a violent film. Others have commented that much of the horror is committed off screen. But you can easily imagine it. Lang doesn't pull many punches here. The treadmill of denouement speeds up rapidly in the last few sections of the film. After viewing a film like THE BIG HEAT, I often want to wander down some dark street and find a corner diner, something like the one portrayed in Hoppers's NIGHTHAWKS, and have a cup of java, listen to some Brubeck on the jukebox, and wait for someone to come in from the chilly street . But the diners in my neighbourhood are either in the middle of the block or close early because of street crime. So I stay home, have a cup of tea, and dream noirish thoughts half asleep on my couch. This is a fine entry into the film noir lexicon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal &amp; Violent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Big Heat(1953) focuses on the conflict between honest cop and corruption that is around him. The cop, Dave Bannion is someone who believes in law and order and this conflicts with the activities of the people he's working for because they are dishonest. He pays the price for his fight against the corrupt system with the almost total loss of his family. At first he's just one man who is forced to take on the system on his own. In this film Dave Bannion is someone who stands fast against the corruption around him that is squeezing him.The theme of revenge is an important element of The Big Heat(1953). In fact, its the biggest motif in the film history of Fritz Lang as he dealt with the emotional and destructive forces of one person's vengeance. Fritz Lang did not believe in the idea of revenge as he thought of it as negative and pointless. Its interesting to note how Dave Bannion played by Glenn Ford goes from being quiet and nice to angry and cold. The revenge motif had previously appeared in other Lang films like Die Nibelungen(1924), M(1931), Fury(1936), Return of Frank James(1940), &amp; Rancho Notorious(1952).Lee Marvin made one of his most famous roles with this film. His performance gives an early sign that he was on his way to stardom. His performance as Vince Stone is absolutely awesome. This role would set up later roles in films like The Killers(1964), Point Blank(1967), and Prime Cut(1971). Lee Marvin in The Big Heat(1953) shows why he is one of the best Hollywood tough guys from his era.The Big Heat(1953) was released during the late period of Film Noir. Film Noir was on its dying legs during this time but was still coming up with some gems. Many of this late Noir pictures are characterized by their increasing depiction of violent behavior and events. Some of the best noirs to come out of this period are Born to Kill(1948), White Heat(1949), The Asphalt Jungle(1950), Desperate Hours(1952), The Big Heat(1953), Kiss Me Deadly(1954), The Killing(1955), and Touch of Evil(1958). The Big Heat continued the great tradition of the genre with its excellent storytelling.The car bombing sequence in my opinion my have inspired a similar sequence in The Godfather(1972). In both scenes, the bomb kills the wife of the husband instead of the husband. Also, the scene in The Godfather(1972) is done with the same unexpectencey and shock. The difference is that Dave Bannion regains his humanity while Michael Corleone stays cold blooded and ruthless. The Big Heat(1953) would have a major influence on Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather(1972).The Big Heat is unusually violent for the year of 1953. The violence in the film must have shocked audiences then because most films in the early 50s were light and harmless. The intensity of the violent scenes must have really disturbed audiences and critics alike. The coffee throwing scene is one of the most vicious acts of violence in a film from the 1950s. The violence is shocking even though they are mostly implicit.The Big Heat features the death of all the main actresses of the film. This implies that the world in the film is very brutal and vicious towards women. The film deals with how the loss of a woman can have a negative effect on a male world. The Big Heat is one of the few movies that I've seen where all the main female characters are killed off. The deaths of Debbie and Katie are very sad and tearjearking.The acting in the motion picture is just brilliant to watch. Glenn Ford gives a balance performance as the idealistic cop, Dave Bannion. Gloria Grahame as Debby Marsh portrays both toughness and vurnability as the girlfriend of Vince Stone. Jeanette Nolan is just cold and cleaver as the crooked Bertha Duncan. Alexander Scourby is terrific as the mob boss and politican Mike Lagana.There is a great film reference to the classic flick, Gilda(1946). The car bomb scene is refered to at the end of the Scorsese pic, Mean Streets(1973). The Big Heat(1953) is an early precusor to revenge driven films such as Point Blank(1967), Get Carter(1970), and The Limey(1999). The Big Heat(1953) also sets the stage for the Dirty Harry pictures as well as the films of Charles Bronson. The Big Heat is wonderfully executed by director, Fritz Lang.The structure of the film is tense and mesmorizing to follow. Has some stark camera work and tight editing. The final twenty moments are suspenseful. The Big Heat is my favorite of all the films by Fritz Lang. The Big Heat(1953) is a great movie that one cannot take their eyes off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Fastest-Movie Film Noirs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intense characters, led by Glenn Ford's portrayal of "Det. Sgt. Dave Bannion," make this one of the better film noirs of the period, at least one of the ones I enjoyed the most.Ford is a believably 100 percent honest and tough cop who is unrelenting in getting his wife's killer. (His wife is killed early on in a car bomb.) Ford takes the law into his own hands, which really contradicts what he stands for, and is not least bit apologetic for his actions, either. Make no mistake: this is a pure "revenge" film.Gloria Grahame, Lee Marvin, Jocelyn Brando, Alexader Scourby, Jeanette Noland and Carolyn Jones complete the cast of "name" actors of the period. No surprise that Marvin plays the lead villain. Grahame almost steals the show as Marvin's girl who gets scalded when the latter throws hot coffee in her face - one of the more shocking scenes in film noir history. She then, understandably, switches allegiances.It was kind of fun to see Marvin at such a young age. This was my first look at Scourby. Pro football fans know his distinctive voice well, as he became the voice of the NFL Films for many years.One of the attractions of this story is the pace: it is fast-moving, and it's not too dated either, despite being over 40 years old. This is highly recommended for crime buffs of any era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A violent story about a detective working in a corrupt department who investigates the apparent suicide of a fellow officer. Worth seeing for Glenn Ford's prototypical performance and Gloria Grahme's show stealing portrayal of a boozing moll with a conscience. With facial disfigurement and cigarette burns it took violence up a notch from the standard gun play of the past, making it grimmer and more realistic, and giving the story more punch. Grahme's tough and tender role stands out and gives the film a tragic element, while certain of its portrayals of greed and corruption (namely the dead officer's wife) stand out for their attention to detail. In the end, it IS the details that give this formulaic story its clout, and we can thank director Fritz Lang for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film noir crime classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the 1950's a new wave of hoodlum pictures filled the screens: 'The Asphalt Jungle,' 'Rogue Cop,' 'Party Girl,' 'The Desperate Hours,' and 'The Big Heat', to name but five...Most gangster-movie fans remember that a girl got hot coffee thrown in her face in some film, but how many remember the film, the girl, and the thrower? Gloria Grahame is a green-eyed blonde, with unusual lips, tiny voice, and sulky appearance... She is a gangster's moll dressed in silk and satin... Her presence alone can incite men to criminal behavior... She is sensual, spiteful, uncontrolled, and lethal... Her freezing looks are as memorable as her steamy actions... She is both tough and vulnerable, a combination not rare but here at its most winning... Lee Marvin (later to become famous as the toughest of all screen villains) is sadistic, cold-blooded mobster, a very bad person... Glenn Ford is angry and icy, with quiet authority and sincerity... He made what is almost certainly his best film... He is fine as the honest homicide cop who resigned from the police force to discover who murdered his wife... He bust a crime-ring with manic determination, gradually becoming as cruel and ruthless as they are... Ford is ordered repeatedly by his lieutenant to stop interfering, but,obsessed with vengeance, walks out of the police department and sets out to get Marvin and Scourby unrestrained by the delicacies of police technique and the influence brought to bear on his superior... The film's tensions are strongly intensified by : - Dorothy Green, the 'B-girl' who tells Bannion that she was Tom Duncan's girlfriend and that the policeman had no reason to kill himself...- Jeannette Nolan, the grieving widow who is "on the take" for years, and isn't silenced... - Jocelyn Brando, the cozy martyred young wife who is brutally blown up in a car by a violent explosion intended for her husband... (An interesting foreshadowing of 'The Godfather.')- Alexander Scourby (an interesting foreshadowing of "The Godfather"), the suave chief villain and loving family man who at the same time ran a criminal empire with business efficiency...- Willis Bouchey, a corrupted Lieutenant who orders Bannion to lay off the case...- Howard Wendell, the Police Commissioner whom Bannion advises to find out who planted the dynamite in his car...- Robert Burton, the detective who promises to help his companion, but off the record... - Peter Whitney, the retreat's bartender who assumes a "don't ask" policy... - Adams Williams, the mob who threats the obsessive detective to stay out of the case...- Dan Seymour, the very cool and uncooperative 'scared rabbit.'- Edith Evanson, the crippled secretary who offers the information Atkins withheld... - John Crawford, Bannion's brother-in-law who makes a call at exactly 9:30 P.M. and "ask for Larry." Considered at the time to reach a new low in violence, this excellent film noir crime classic also struck a new note of realism in crime films (gambling, conspiracy, extortion, murder...) and produced one of Glenn Ford's most typical performances...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My interest in film noir goes all the way back to "The Maltese Falcon" and, in the last few years, I've managed to see quite a few good ones. But none of them come even close to what I saw this very day with "The Big Heat". Perhaps more than any other film noir I've seen to date, this one sums up it's genre almost completely.I'm not the slightest bit suprised why such a story appealed to the film's director, the legendary Fritz Lang (whose earlier films, particularly "M", were instrumental in the creation of the film noir genre). An escapee from Nazi Germany, he had a special affinity for the kind of atmosphere portrayed here. When the basic ground rules are look the other way, pretend you didn't see it, you don't know anything we don't want you to, is there that much difference between the Third Reich and the corrupt city government portrayed here? Sgt. Banion (played with low-key, but believable calm by Glenn Ford) pays a heavy price for bucking the cowardice of those around him. His wife is killed in a car bomb. He's suspended from duty. He loses yet another friend to Vince Stone (perhaps Lee Marvin's best role as a villain ever). But when push comes to shove, he eventually makes the right decision. Nothing about the way the plot moves is forced or unrealistic (though being blown in a car or shot in the head is a lot messier than portrayed here). This is not a film to be forgotten nor to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In The Big Heat, Fritz Lang by casting Glenn Ford against type, probably directed Ford to his greatest screen performance and one of the best noir films ever done.Ford is a homicide cop in an unnamed big mid-western city which is in the grip of systemic corruption from organized crime. Remember The Big Heat came out only two years after the Estes Kefauver hearings and stories like these were topical. Another veteran police sergeant has committed suicide and Ford's called in. The widow, Jeanette Nolan, appears to be cooperating, but when the late cop's mistress contacts Ford and is later found murdered, this sets off a chain of events that brings tragedy to Ford personally, but also lead to the cleaning up of the town.Normally the kind of part that Ford is cast in would go to someone like Kirk Douglas who would explode with all kinds of rage on the screen. What Lang did was cast Glenn Ford, known as one of the cinema's nicest men and squarest shooters. When the gangsters accidentally kill his wife, Jocelyn Brando, with a car bomb meant for him, Ford goes off on a rage and you know there is no force that will stop him without killing him. His performance is effective precisely because of Ford's nice guy image, the viewer identifies with him as Mr. Average Man. Think of Ford as Atticus Finch as cop instead of a lawyer and something happening to kill one of his kids. Gregory Peck as Atticus would react the same way.The movie rises with what is arguably Ford's greatest screen role. But Glenn gets nice support from Gloria Grahame as the good time gun moll who also comes in for tragedy because she's a flirt and Lee Marvin the number one button man for syndicate head Alexander Scourby. Marvin had done several roles before The Big Heat, but it was in this film that he got his first real critical notice. Carolyn Jones has a small part as a woman who Lee Marvin beats up and my favorite small role in the film is from Edith Evanson as a shy crippled woman who gives Ford his first real lead in tracking down his wife's killers. By the way Jeanette Nolan is one truly evil woman as the late sergeant's widow, one of her best screen roles.The Big Heat is one of Fritz Lang's best at what he does best, delve into the dark side of his hero/protagonists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good and the Bad are eternal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a precursor to "Serpico" starring Al Pacino many years later. It's the story of an honest cop surrounded by corrupt and cowardly police officials who are in the take of a powerful city mafia. It's like Chicago during the times of Al Capone. The script is well written and has a good pace. The scenes are neither too short or too prolonged, just the right amount to move the story along. The actors played their parts well: Lee Marvin as a sadistic degenerate thug is very convincing as is Gloria Grahame playing his not so empty headed girlfriend, who has more depth and humanity than meets the eye. Jocelyn Brando (Marlon Brando's sister) played a small but very convincing role as Detective Bannion's loving and supporting wife, who encourages him to be the honest cop that he is. Their best scene together is right before she gets blown off in the car. It's a very tender, sentimental family scene when their daughter interrupts their kissing because she cannot go to bed. This is actually the pivotal scene of the film because Katie's violent death becomes Bannion's main motive in getting her killers. Jocelyn Brando plays the role of the perfect woman: dedicated wife, mother and the moral support behind her husband and Glenn Ford plays the role defending this order of things. In the end, he triumphs over those who seek to destroy this order: Lee Marvin and his thugs. The film makes a strong case for this theory with the hope that the natural order of things has been restored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty, brutal, intense and powerful ? a fantastic pot-boiler than stands out almost half a century later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An honest, family man cop with a wife and daughter is put onto the investigation of another cop's suicide. He closes the case as suicide due to ill health. However when a women tells him another story and is promptly killed, Bannion just investigates further to find that powerful criminals and powerful politicians share the same table at dinner. When his family is split in an attack meant for him he loses his job and becomes bitter ? he starts to become more like his enemies as he pursues them.This is a hardboiled thriller that would still stand up today as a tough film ? violence and attitudes that make it feel more modern than it is. The story follows the descent of family man Bannion into violence and bitterness when he not only loses what is important to him, but when he finds that corruption at high levels has fed down into rank and file officers causing him to stand out when he tries to catch a criminal.The brutality of this film shouldn't be underestimated ? Fritz Lang is no softy! Here we have women beaten and killed, we have sex crimes, we have a women disfigured by scalding coffee in her face. Of course all these things are unseen but this was the 50's! However it is still powerful and adds to the intensity of the film. The story may well have been done many times now ? but imagine seeing something like this back then!The cast are great. Ford descends into bitterness really well and seems at ease as both thug and family man. The female cast are good in different ways but the one that catches the eye is a young Lee Marvin. I suspect Marvin got fame because his coffee attack stuck in people's minds ? even today he is best know as a tough guy in the movies.Overall this is well worth hunting out ? it is still being copied by many video thrillers and it just goes to show that you don't have to show gory or graphic violence on screen to be powerful, gritty or shocking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corruption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming full cycle, Hollywood seems to be back on the theme of good cop vs. bad cops controlled by the mob. Recently "16 Blocks" successfully pitted honest Bruce Willis against dishonest city hall. For a time, with "The Big Easy" being an early example, this type movie presented the image of a totally corrupt government from top to bottom with omnipresent mob ties indicating cynical times, even the one good cop being tainted, just not as much as others. "The Big Heat" is a prime example of this type film in the early Cold War period, emphasizing the importance of one good man standing up against all odds, in particular unconcerned citizens who either themselves become tainted or who are simply apathetic as long as they are left alone. "The Big Heat" like "High Noon" showed that the good must take a stand or the entire house will come crumbling down with the rodents taking over.Glenn Ford was never a versatile actor. In the right role he could carry the load sufficiently to get by. In the wrong role, his acting was amateurish. That he had potential is indicated by his performances in two movies, "Gilda" and "The Big Heat." Arguably, his role as Det. Sgt. Dave Bannion is the better of the two. Perhaps it is the inimitable director Fritz Lang that prods Ford on to realize his true talents. There is no doubt that Ford makes Sgt. Bannion come alive and puts real flesh on his bones. Ford is so good in this film and in "Gilda" that he deserved more recognition than he got from the Hollywood big wigs.The two shining performances are given by Gloria Grahame and Lee Marvin who run away with the show. They provide one of the legendary scenes in film history that just about everyone has either seen or read about, when Vince Stone (Marvin)--note the last name of Stone--pitches a container of boiling coffee into Debby Marsh's (Grahame) face, scarring her for life. Vince Stone's demise is also memorable. The coffee sequence alone is worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

Not to mention, how to employ a younger Lee Marvin, who not only puts out a cigarette on a woman's hand but also dumps scalding hot coffee in her face. No, this ain't your mama's black and white.

		<fullReview>Effective film noir about a cop fighting the mob as well as his own corrupt superiors as he investigates a murder. Ford has perhaps the best role of his career as the good cop. His scenes with wife Brando are very nicely handled, adding poignancy to the tragedy that would befall the family. There are shades of Dirty Harry as Ford takes matters into his own hands. Marvin and Grahame are also good as a mobster and his moll, respectively. Lang, a master of this sort of film-making, keeps things moving at a snappy pace. Some of the violence is jarring but of course nothing graphic is shown, given the era the movie was made in. After an excellent start, the second half of the film becomes somewhat routine but it still packs a punch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glenn Ford does a great job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally, when I think of Film Noir, I DON'T think about Glenn Ford. Yes, he did a few, but his personality always seemed a little too "nice" to play in these gritty films. I was very pleasantly surprised then, when I saw this movie. Ford is an honest cop in a very crooked town. However, when the mob attacks and nearly kills him (killing his wife instead), he "pops a fuse" and becomes a very tough cop who won't take NO for an answer. I loved watching him slap people around and threaten his way to the top of the syndicate, as, with his life in ruins, he had nothing to lose. Along the way, the headstrong Ford encounters a lot of amazing characters--all played exceptionally well. In particular, a young Lee Marvin gives perhaps his best supporting performances as a hood who has a penchant for beating up women. In one scene, he nearly breaks a bit actress' arm (and it happens to be Carolyn Jones in a performance before she was famous). In another scene, he throws scalding hot coffee in the face of his girlfriend, Gloria Grahame. It was so brutal and realistic, I flinched and found my stomach churning at its ferocity and cruelness. As for Miss Grahame, she plays the sort of excellent role she became known for--a "dame" who, down under layers and layers of scum, beats a real human heart.Wonderful performances, terrific pacing and excellent writing make this one film well worth seeing and as a result, it's one of the best examples of Film Noir out there and a great example of a film about a cop who's seen enough and is on a rampage. This is probably Glenn Ford's best performance.FYI--In what appears to be a cool inside joke, in one of the scenes where Ford is in the bar, the song "Mame" is playing in the background--the same song made so memorable by Rita Hayworth in GILDA--a Glenn Ford film from 1946.Also FYI--I recently saw this film for the second time. I rarely watch films twice, but this one impressed me so much the first time, I couldn't resist. The film was, believe it or not, better the second time around and I noticed so many wonderful Film Noir touches that I truly love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Lang Revenge Noir...Ford's Best Performance And Grahame Is The Quintessential Floozy With A Heart Of Gold...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Lang's THE BIG HEAT last night for the first time.It was everything I expected, and more.Glenn Ford probably gave his best screen performance as Bannion, he was excellent throughout the picture. And Grahame's performance should have netted her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar...but sadly she wasn't even nominated. It contains many classic scenes and great moments, and is well-written, with surprisingly very few plot holes or weak/unnecessary twists.I found Lang's film noir unusual in that it provides so many tough and tender moments. Those early scenes between Ford and Jocelyn Brando are beautifully played out-we finally get to see the cop away from the beat and the criminals, as a family man. These are lovely scenes...Brando cutting up that huge steak...the film has so many wonderful little bits of detail throughout...It is violent and brutal yet so emotional....the scene where Bannion's wife is killed is both shocking and heart-breaking. And then, when asked how his little daughter is holding up, he puts it so achingly bluntly "She thinks her mother is on a trip".Grahame's performance is a big highlight. Of course, everyone remembers the scene where Marvin (also perfectly cast, and very early in his career...his character reminds me of Dan Duryea)throws hot coffee on poor Debby- but I think her best scenes come with Ford. I just really loved her performance. Her last scene, where pays back Marvin for his brutal act by pouring coffee in his (along with blowing the lid on Lagana), is shot, and dies in Bannion's arms, is one of the most wonderfully acted scenes I think I've ever seen. The death scene with Ford had tears running down my cheeks, which is unusual for me when watching a noir...I think it's the best scene in the picture...Grahame asks Ford tell her about his dead wife, what she was really like. It's such a perfectly written and acted scene- and we get the sense that Debby ("I like her...I like her a lot") wishes she had a man who loved her enough to say those lovely, simple, yet beautiful things about her . She wishes Ford could have loved her...or anyone really...and Bannion chokes up, realizing what he had and lost, and what Debby never had....This noir packs a huge emotional punch (at least for me). One of the top noir picks of the 50's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fritz Lang 'Essesntial' Noir Showcases Actresses...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Big Heat", Fritz Lang's concise, hard-hitting Noir drama, both defines the genre in it's 'mature' form (with the obligatory black and white, high contrast photography, a short running time, a hero, portrayed by Glenn Ford, who teeters between justice and vengeance, and villains, particularly Lee Marvin, every bit as shaded and complex as Ford), and tosses in, almost casually, a fascinating subtext, that the three central female characters of the film are, in fact, as essential as their male counterparts, and even more interesting! Portrayed by Jocelyn Brando (Marlon's older sister), Jeanette Nolan, and the fabulous Gloria Grahame, they are not only pivotal to the plot, but actually become the characters you're most likely to leave the film talking about.Beginning with the suicide of a cop 'on the take', who leaves a letter exposing the mob's connections with the police and local government, the film first introduces Nolan, as a less-than-grieving widow, who steals the letter, and uses it as leverage to enjoy 'the good life'. An underrated actress, usually cast in sweet-natured supporting 'grandmotherly' roles, Nolan here gets to cut loose, blackmailing the mob while tossing false 'leads' to cop Ford, and adjusting her 'image' to suit whatever situation she faces. Her portrayal, alone, would make this an extraordinary film! Ford, the dedicated, honest homicide detective, has a history of ruffling official feathers to find the truth, and much of his strength comes from the love and support of wife Brando. Not your 'traditional' 50s wife, she 'samples' his drinks and food, hints at her satisfying sex life (remarkable, in itself!), and casually smokes while preparing dinner, sweetly bantering with her husband. In the smallest of the central female roles, it is easy to 'lose' her, between the flashier performances of Nolan and Grahame, but, in fact, she is the catalyst of the plot, whose untimely demise would set the chain of events in motion.Then there is Gloria Grahame, the 'party girl' mistress of enforcer Lee Marvin...wisecracking, and blissfully ignorant of the risks she takes in verbally 'jabbing' her boyfriend's relationship to mob boss Alexander Scourby, she grabs the screen, each scene she's in, and makes Marvin's performance, as a genial yet psychopathic sadist, even better. When she warms up to Ford, she is rewarded with a pot of scalding coffee in the face, disfiguring her, and providing the hook to blow things wide-open...Three powerhouse performances, by three terrific actresses! Fritz Lang's American film work was always remarkable, and "The Big Heat" showcased him at the top of his form.The film is, deservedly, a classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Let Gloria Grahame Make the Coffee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I love film noir, I enjoyed "The Big Heat," but I didn't feel that it distinguished itself from any number of other similar films from the same time period.This surprised me somewhat, as I don't think of Fritz Lang as an anonymous director, and he's usually able to imprint a strong visual style on his films. Not so for this story about a good and honest cop (Glenn Ford) who's dragged into the seedy underworld after his wife dies in a booby trap meant for him. Many of the themes common to this genre are present here: the blurred lines between the criminals and the law, the insidious encroachment of the scary city on the peaceful idyll of the wholesome suburb. It also picked up a main theme from "The Asphalt Jungle": cops and robbers alike have families and lives separate from their work, and this fact makes them more like one another than they might want to admit.This film is most notable for a feisty performance from Gloria Grahame, who plays a gangster's moll who gets tired of being used and abused by her thug of a boyfriend (a repulsive Lee Marvin) and gets her scalding revenge. I've always felt that Grahame was never really used to her fullest potential by any film director, but she has such a strong screen presence that she's able to make this film all about her.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb film noir by Lang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Big Heat must rank with Phil Karlson's The Phenix City Story and Robert Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly among the masterpieces of what Paul Schrader called "late noir'.Like Kiss Me Deadly, it features an almost psychotic protagonist, obsessed cop Bannion. Like many of the late film noirs, it features a blistering critique of public corruption and incompetence, and offers instead a highly conservative, almost fascist populism.Like almost all of Lang's films, it is superbly paced, well acted and blessed with a laconic, witty, taut script.It also has some of the great 'shocks' in all of cinema. Not quite an "eleven", ( for that, one would have to turn to films which define film noir such as Double Indemnity or the Big Sleep, or which transcend it, such as Touch of Evil), but very much a "ten".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a movie for our political times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, Gloria Graham should have been a bigger star, a la Marilyn. She's really got it ? sexy, knowing, witty, touching. In the Big Heat, she plays the anti-femme fatale, who does an unexpected evil act to help the hero rather than hurt him. Pretty unusual twist in a noir.Glenn Ford is a very limited actor, but he works perfectly in the narrow range of this role.While the film starts slow, what makes it work better than most noirs is how it deals with the multi-level complicity of ordinary people in evil, people just going along to get along, and one man going up against that (assisted by the old crippled woman who risks her life to give him a key tip). It's quite moving and timely, given what's going on in America today.My favorite line is when the young, stupid hit man asks Lee Marvin to tell him when he plans to dump Gloria Graham. Why does he want to know. "I'm a rebound man," he says. Perfect. I realize there's a whole genre of rebound men in real life. My former roommate was one.Does anyone know what city the story takes place in? I thought at times New York, but then at the end someone mentions South Street, so I thought it might be Philadelphia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fritz Lang deals nicely in obsession and corruption.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Detective Dave Bannion is investigating the suicide of corrupt cop Tom Duncan. As he gets deeper, and colleagues get nervous, his wife is inadvertently killed by a car bomb that was meant for him, he turns from mannered family man to a vengeful obsessive, the heat is most definitely coming down on those responsible.Writer Sydney Boehm took a Saturday Evening Post serial (written by William McGiven), and crafted a tight, biting and incredibly bleak script. Handed it into director Fritz Lang's hands, who then cloaked it (along with Charles Lang's perfectly apt photography) with dripping noir nastiness. Playing out as a tale of murder, revenge and pure hatred, The Big Heat holds up now as one of the best of the dialogue driven genre pieces of the 50s.Lang isn't concerned with showing the violence exactly, more like the reaction of our protagonists to the violence in the piece, this makes for a sort of ethereal viewing, with the sets themselves becoming integral to our characters personalities, it really is a wonderfully put together picture. The cast are excellent, Glen Ford as Bannion was never better in my opinion, but even he is playing second fiddle to the fabulous Gloria Grahame as Debby Marsh, a Moll who makes a decision that has very far reaching consequences. It begs the question from me as to why Grahame never had a far better career? Because here to me she is one of film noir's best (anti?) heroines. Rounded out a trio of great performances is Lee Marvin as the vile and brutal Vince Stone; Marvin of course would go on from here and deliver a ream of brilliant gruff hard bastard performances. Excellent. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sisters under the Mink</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great film noirs. Fritz Lang's powerful study of police corruption has a B-movie structure and pace, but it's a great B-movie, lean and taut; there isn't a redundant moment in the whole film. Glenn Ford, in what was probably his best performance, is crusading cop Dave Bannion, after the men who killed his wife, (the bomb in her car was meant for him). Lee Marvin is the vicious gangster behind her killing, (he throws scalding coffee in girlfriend Gloria Grahame's face) and Alexander Scourby is the corrupt political lynchpin: (he has wonderfully florid speeches; pointing to a painting of his grey-haired mother he tells Bannion, "they broke the mould the day they made her").For it's period (the early fifties) it was a very violent film. It doesn't shy away from violence but is all the more powerful for not being overly explicit, (we don't see the coffee hitting Grahame's face). Sidney Boehm's terrific script was adapted from a Saturday Evening Post serial and the film remains one of the highlights in Marvin's career. It's a smallish part but he's absolutely unforgettable and Grahame's performance as the battle-scarred Debbie is much better than the one that won her the Oscar in "The Bad and the Beautiful". (She has the film's best line when she tells corrupt policeman's widow Jeanette Nolan that "we're sisters under the mink"). Subsequent films in the genre such as "Kiss me Deadly" and "The Big Combo" would take this new found emphasis on violence a step further but Lang's film remains the prototype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The birth of the revenge genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fifteen minutes into this film, something strange happens. A police detective (Glen Ford) returns home after a hard day's work and we're immediately introduced to his family. Director Fritz Lang then goes to huge lengths to make these family scenes as touching, cute and loving as possible. We watch as husband and wife chat and joke, sharing a beer and then a cigarette. We watch daughter and father hug, playing with toys before he tucks her in bed. We're hit with scene after scene of sweet domestic bliss.Why? This is a film noir, isn't it? Where are all the hard boiled, tough talking coppers? What's going on? Oh...I see. Lang is setting up the audience for the death of Ford's family. Sure enough, half an hour into the film and the tone immediately changes. Glen Ford's wife is killed in a car bomb meant for him, and the audience is immediately hooked.From here on the film is all about revenge. Glen Ford becomes a cop hell bent on taking down the crime lord who killed his wife. Notice the gruff change in his voice. Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson will mimic this voice decades later in the "Dirty Harry" and "Death Wish" films. Ford's performance here became the Hollywood textbook on "how to talk when you're only thinking about revenge!" Note also that "The Big Heat" is the bedrock of all those revenge and cop movie clichés. Take for example one scene in which Ford holds a gun to a gangster and wrestles with the decision of killing the guy or letting him live. Then there's the scene where our hero trades in his gun and badge. And another where our hero vists the villain in his lair and makes his intentions clear. And of course the famous "unexpected car bomb" gag.In terms of camera work and set design, Fritz Lang's direction is anonymous. There's nothing visually special. Instead we see Lang's sensibilities more in the choice of material and in his constant portrayal of a bleak universe severely lacking in morals.7.5/10 - Two or three good sequences and some brilliant acting by Glen Ford. What's nice is the whole morbid tone of the picture and it's fun to spot the cop clichés (Lethal Weapon lifts about 3 scenes from The Big Heat).</fullReview>

When Banion's wife is killed by a bomb meant for him, he gets even more angry but things are back to near normal at the end and he starts back to work.For its time in 1953, The Big Heat is rather violent, which makes it better.The cast includes Glenn Ford, Lee Marvin, Gloria Graham, Jocelyn Brando and Alexander Scrourby.

		<fullReview>Hard to find fault with this picture. A good cast and an even better script make this one of the better noir films to come out of Hollywood. It also has one of filmdom's best directors in Fritz Lang, who was something of a hemorrhoid in Hollywood circles but whose directing credentials were impeccable. I thought Lang added dimension to each character and fleshed them out to a degree not usually seen in this type of picture.It's all been said before about this film but I just wanted to check in, having finally seen it all the way through. I really enjoyed the support cast, especially a brutal portrayal by Lee Marvin, the seldom-seen Alexander Scourby as the mob boss, and another super-slut role for Gloria Grahame, who excelled in this area. My only (minor) complaint was casting nice guy Glenn Ford in a tough cop role, although he carried it off well. Director Lang did the same thing in "You Only Live Once" (1936), casting whiny nerd Henry Fonda as his hero. On the whole, "The Big Heat" is definitely worth all the glowing input on the website and I agree with our rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Big Heat is directed by Fritz Lang,produced by Robert Arthur,with a screenplay by Sydney Boehm based on the novel by William P.McGivern and stars Glenn Ford,Gloria Grahame,Jocelyn Brando,Alexander Scourby and Lee Marvin.Gritty and realistic,the Big Heat joins the club of big gang runs the town crime exposes which were so popular during the 50's.This one is a little different though,it teems with a rage that like an unwatched cooker, is just waiting for the right moment to explode and when it does you know about it.On the acting side of things Glenn Ford(often considered by some to be a limited actor)is breath taking, his character starting off gentle and focused but turning dark and violent following an horrific act of violence delivered upon his wife.He becomes a determined anti hero who we can all root for.The Big Heat begins with the suicide of a corrupt cop.Investigating the case is honest Detective Dave Bannion(Glenn Ford)who finds out the dead man was on the take and linked in with crime boss Lagana(Alexander Scourby).When his investigations get him noticed by Lagana's men his life is under threat.Bannion won't leave the case alone,a decision he pays a high price for when his wife(Jocelyn Brando)is killed in a car bomb meant for him.After that Bannion flips,quitting the force and turning cold with revenge the only thing on his mind.He has help in getting closer to the gang boss courtesy of a gangsters girl,Debbie(Gloria Grahame)who becomes embittered when her vicious boyfriend,Vince Stone(a chilling performance by Lee Marvin)throws a pot of scalding coffee in her face disfiguring her for life.She runs away to Bannion who keeps her safe with him at a cheap hotel while inching his way ever closer to his prize.Usually playing the bad girl in this genre Gloria is brilliant as the wronged woman with a heart of gold who want's to get even.She and Glenn have great chemistry and it's their relationship that becomes the films heart and soul and it doesn't end quite how you think it will for them either.The film famously ends on a downbeat(but realistic note)involving a hit and run fatality.Proving that you can stop one sort of evil,but evil in one form or another is unfortunately with us all of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crackling dialogue, fascinating plotting and several outstanding performances mark this terrific crime thriller from Fritz Lang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Police sergeant Bannion (Glenn Ford) is a tough cop who steps on too many toes in and out of his corrupt department and finally wages a one-man war against the local crime syndicate, with the Irish Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby) at the head and Vince Stone (Lee Marvin) as his top lackey. Stone's girl (Gloria Grahame) becomes a martyr to Bannion's cause, while a duplicitous policeman's widow (Jeanette Nolan) is the key to the mob's dirty secrets.Fritz Lang directed this potent crime thriller in a somewhat flat style, as Martin Scorsese has pointed out, in order to keep us at a certain distance from the action and the main character, whose apparent heroism may hide darker motives that are too dark even for him to see. Roger Ebert wrote a brilliant essay on exactly what those motives might be and exactly how they might be manifesting themselves. I can only add how much I enjoyed the crackling dialogue, fascinating plotting and several outstanding performances. Ford is quiet and coiled in the lead. Grahame is a mixture of sexiness, sauciness and unlikely goofiness. Marvin is the cowardly, sadistic lout wielding scalding hot coffee. And Nolan is a consummate actress playing a woman who is a consummate actress, shedding crocodile tears and feigning grief for her unloved husband, who shoots himself moments before she coldly takes advantage of the situation.My only complaint is with the phony scenes with Bannion's phony wife (Jocelyn Brando, Marlon's sister) and phony young daughter (Linda Bennett, who several times anticipates what she is about to do before she is cued to do it), although the unconvincing sugary happiness of Bannion's home life, before tragedy strikes, may have been another way for Lang to keep us at arm's length.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Masterful, Entertaining and Timeless In Film Noir, Amongst the Truly Definitive Works of the Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's films are fascinating takes on their genres because of his wisdom concering social evils, combining them with the unlikely perceptions of morally ambivalent characters. The Big Heat, however, appears to be a simple good vs. evil tale. An earnest family-oriented homicide detective played with a brimming force by Glenn Ford investigates the death of a fellow officer named Tom Duncan. It would seem to be an open-and-shut case, suicide brought on by depression, suspicion, implication and gut feelings leading up the hierarchy of the city mafia and to a retalation too close to Ford's home. Ford confronts a suave mob boss played by Alexander Scourby in his palatial home, where Scourby berates him for his nerve to bring his business into his home, to which Ford check-mates with a rhetorical interpretation of Scourby's criminality, implying the double standard of Scourby having his men deliver phone threats to his house. Of course, Marvin has yet to fully grasp just how far Scourby is willing to go with that double standard.Le Marvin plays a degenerate, abusive gang thug who is rotten to the core, an almost robotic agent of corruption and violence. He is sought after by Ford's heartening good guy. But The Big Heat is a classic revenge story. It rouses the vindictive morale inherent in the emotional facet of our hearts. And again, Lang unfolds a narrative following the darker side of a good person. Holding true to our lust for Ford's vindication, as well as the legal justice that serves as its circumstantial springboard, the bad guys are absolutely despicable slime, but Gloria Grahame's character is the misreading.Grahame, a fireworks display of unwavering presence, emotive skillfulness and unabashed sexiness, plays Marvin's girlfriend, whom we first see impressed when Ford stands up to her man after viciously punishes a girl in a nightclub by burning her hand with a cigarette butt, forcing him and his bodyguard out of the joint. She tries to get friendly with Ford, who keeps pointing out that she gets her money from a thief. Marsh states: "I've been rich and I've been poor. Believe me, rich is better." But when she unwittingly reminds him of the time he courted his late wife he sends her packing: "Well, you're about as romantic as a pair of handcuffs," she remarks. Despite her deceptive appearance as just another token gun moll, there is already very telling subtext latently established in this scene. What ignites her fascinating transformation is a shocking scene of cringe-inducing violence, when Marvin accuses her of talking to a cop about his activities and throws boiling coffee at her face, a shot that betrays this grisly act, for Lang understands the augmented horror of what we can only hear and not see.Grahame is on the wrong side of the law who is driven to a means of justice, as we see in her greatly increased screen time during the last half of the film. And boy, is revenge ever a dish best served cold. Lang's truth-seeking wisdom is the key to its transcendence of average formulaic noir exercise. There is an intrinsic need for each major and minor character. Some of them are highly unlikely on Hollywood terms but zealously realistic on social terms, such as a mob informant in the form of an old woman with a limp working at a storefront junkyard. And on top of it all, Grahame is the emboldened highlight of whom you simply cannot get enough in this thriller, one of the most masterful, entertaining and timeless achievements of the silver screen noir variety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a hard boiled egg of a classic, with a side of coffee...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang can conjure up a paranoid thriller with the greatest of ease (actually, it's probably a lot of work, but it looks easy, which is a feat unto itself), and The Big Heat provides some of his classic paranoia to the proceedings of a story of a good, hard cop on the trail of a case that's gone way too corrupt. There are simple visual touches, amid what looks like a standard-shot thriller (when compared to, say, M, which is Godly in its vision of the darkness of humanity's layers peeled back). But it's got the kind of grit to it that most likely inspired Dirty Harry, even if, arguably, Glenn Ford isn't quite as great a star as Clint Eastwood. He's got a style to himself, anyway, like someone who is almost TOO good, and knows it, which is why he'll get the job done even if it means some busted knuckles and a few cracked heads. He's a compelling force as Dave Bannion, and he's perfectly cast against a bunch of sinister, slimy characters (save for the women, and even one of them is just rotten).After a cop seems to have killed himself, the case looks open and shut. But there seems to be more for Bannion, as he didn't seem like a guy, from some accounts, to do himself in. Turns out there's a big cheese named Lagana who wants this put hush-hush like, and pays off the widow to keep a letter he wrote under wraps. But Bannion is suddenly put to the test, if only of himself, when his family is put in danger (with, of course, tragic results). Lang doesn't stop for a detail that isn't worthy of the attention of the narrative, and there's a connection that he makes between the world of the criminal underworld and the law: it's a place where there's some gray, but the black and white aspect rings through due to the situation at hand: corrupt cops, dirty criminals, and only a couple of dames to trust in the mix of it (one of them Debby, played in another great turn by Gloria Grahame, takes a savage incident with a pot of coffee via Lee Marvin's hand to wise up).It might not have the depth of an M or Scarlett Street, but the Big Heat is about as solid a genre piece as one could ask for, getting more harrowing from the first gun shot of the picture all the way to the final moment when Bannion leaves the office for a hit-and-run case (a cop's work is never finished, one might suggest). It's also got more intelligence for its conventional roots with the little things; for example, there's a point in the movie where something pivotal could've happened with Bannion's daughter and the thugs, but Lang makes a good step to push aside it, keeping the focus squarely on the task at hand instead of sidestepping the climax into cliché. Land understands how, for the sake of a piece of pulp fiction like this, to keep the lines in order, even if it might seem standard for today: keep Bannion's family wholesome, maybe TOO wholesome, with stories of three little kittens, and keep the criminal elements savage, sinister in their grins and suits and violence brimming underneath.One things for sure, it doesn't get much less thrilling than seeing Ford and Marvin in an unpredictable shoot-out.

		<fullReview>The main character of this film is Sergeant Dave Bannion, a homicide detective in the fictitious American city of Kenport who is investigating the suspicious suicide of a fellow-officer, Tom Duncan, and the murder a few days later of the dead man's mistress Lucy Chapman. When Bannion's investigations suggest that Duncan was corrupt and in the pay of Mike Lagana, a wealthy local crime boss masquerading as a legitimate businessman, he comes under pressure from his superiors to drop the case. When he fails to heed these warnings, his car is blown up and his wife killed by a bomb obviously meant for him. Feeling that his colleagues are not doing enough to solve the case, Bannion resigns from the force in order to pursue Lagana, whom he knows to be responsible for his wife's death.The title "The Big Heat" echoes, probably deliberately, the titles of two other crime movies from a few years earlier, "The Big Sleep" with Humphrey Bogart and "White Heat" with James Cagney. All three can be considered as part of the tradition of film noir, although I have always regarded "White Heat", although an excellent film, as being "not quite noir" as it lacks that typical noir characteristic, an atmosphere of moral ambiguity. The moral boundaries are clearly defined with idealised law enforcement officers taking on vicious criminals. The moral boundaries in "The Big Heat" are rather more blurred. Certainly, Lagana and his thugs are vicious, but the portrayal of law enforcement is far from idealised. The police force is riddled with corruption from the Commissioner downwards; Bannion can only seek justice for his wife's death by handing in his badge and acting as a free agent, akin to the private eyes played by Bogart in "The Big Sleep" and "The Maltese Falcon".Even Bannion is in some respects an ambiguous figure. Although he is an innocent man who has suffered much, by the end of the film he is also a man driven by a potentially destructive desire for revenge. His personal code of honour will not permit him to kill his enemies in cold blood, but he has no compunction about engineering their killing by one another, as when he permits Lagana's henchman Vince Stone to kill Larry Gordon, a member of the gang who has confessed to his part in the death of Mrs Bannion. This ambiguity, however, should not lead us to overlook the elements of heroism in Bannion's character or to conclude, as some critics have done, that the film is an essentially pessimistic one. Bannion is not simply (like, say, Sheriff Maddox in "Lawman") an inflexible lawman whose determination to uphold the letter of the law at all costs leads to tragedy. Certainly, it is true that, as a result of his investigations, several innocent people are killed who might otherwise have remained alive. It is also true, however, that those investigations lead to a corrupt Police Commissioner being exposed and a gang of violent criminals being brought to justice. Had Lagana and Stone remained free to continue their criminal activities, this might have led to many more deaths.Glenn Ford, whose style of acting made him well-suited to film noir, makes a forceful lone hero, bringing out the ambiguity and the contrasting elements in Bannion's character. Glamour is supplied by Gloria Grahame as Debby, Stone's cynically materialistic girlfriend who is shocked out of her cynicism by her lover's capacity for evil and throws in her lot with Bannion. Grahame, another star well-suited to the noir style, was generally better as the "bad girl" than as a heroine, and this is one of her best performances. Lee Marvin is also very good as the thuggish Stone, although the other villains are a fairly bland lot.The film was controversial when it came out in 1953, partly because of its uncompromising exposure of police corruption, but mostly because of the graphic way in which violence is shown. The scene in which Stone throws boiling coffee into Debby's face, after she has betrayed him by talking to Bannion, was regarded as particularly shocking. Although "The Big Heat" may not seem so shocking today, it can be seen as prefiguring the increased levels of violence seen in the "tough cop" thrillers of the sixties and seventies. Ford's character can be seen as, on the one hand, looking back to the Bogart-style noir heroes of the forties and, on the other, looking forward, to the likes of Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry, especially in his willingness to go beyond the strict limits of the law in order to achieve what he sees as justice. This is a powerful and engrossing noir thriller. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A policeman commits suicide and everyone in the department seems content to let it go. Everyone, that is, except Det. Sgt. Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford). Bannion starts asking some tough questions and sticks his nose where it doesn't belong. Bannion knows he's on the right trail when one of the people he spoke with turns up dead. But when the violence gets a little closer to home, things change for Bannion. It gets personal.Just about everything works in this movie as I'm sure director Fritz Lang intended. Interesting plot, gorgeous cinematography, terrific acting, fantastic writing, great atmosphere, believable character motivation, etc. etc. etc. All highlights of The Big Heat for me. There's really nothing significant to complain about. But I suppose I was most impressed with Gloria Grahame. I cannot imagine anyone doing more with or being better in the role of Debby Marsh as Grahame is. Innocent, tough, frightened, street-smart ? you name, she played it. And usually to perfection. She literally steals every scene in which she appears. And in the end, well, I don't want to give anything away, but Grahame's final scenes are amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have long been a fan of "film noir" but never managed to see this picture. I just viewed it on the Turner Channel and now want to purchase the DVD. It's so powerful. Gloria Grahame is always terrific, though the cheesy make-up showing her "disfigurement" looks like candle wax dripped on her face. The Columbia production values are never high. Jeanette Nolan's home looks like they borrowed it from June and Ward Cleaver. But the level of violence and pessimism is incredibly steep for the early '50s. It still holds up well. I wish someone would do a serious retrospective on director Fritz Lang which addressed the ways his escape from the Nazis in early '30s Germany influenced and shaped his Hollywood "noir" stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It burns, burns, burns...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It stars the gun. Everyone else is a supporting player. Follow the gun, think about the title. Then add the fire (the explosion) and the coffee and don't forget the last line. The dialogue is amazing and most of the best lines have been quoted here (for example, Gloria Grahame's line when she comes to Ford's nondescript hotel room for the first time: "I like this place! Early Nothing!"). All of Lang's ability to direct actors is used on the damaged characters - Lee Marvin and Grahame. And Alexander Scourby (Lagana) functions (excellently) as some sort of midpoint marker, in the story of the Americanization of the Italian - American gangster, between Muni in Scarface and Pacino in Godfather. The domestic relationship between Glenn Ford (Bannion) and Jocelyn Brando is ostensibly so happy and loving, but the constant use of high - key lighting and somewhat jarring cutting in their scenes together reveals an element of "false utopia" in their construction of family life. Only an émigré can look at mid-century American life with that kind of subtly jaundiced eye. If you're a native like Nicholas Ray, you end up with the brilliantly hectoring Grand Guinol of Bigger Than Life.Lang is just as much an expressionist here as he was in M, but here he handles these elements with a magnificent understatement that only the viewer who is ready to do a "deep reading" will ever really see. The classically expressionist elements are many: the collapse of the toy police station that Bannion's daughter is trying to charm him with, mirroring the collapse of Bannion's police career; the shadows in the bright empty vacated Bannion house after Mrs. Bannion's murder, where only the baby carriage remains as a symbol of the life that was; Debby (Grahame) in her mink, half of her face bandaged, silhouetted by the curtains of Mrs. Duncan's window; Mrs. Duncan and Debby and their twin minks. The way Bannion violently stubs out his cigarette while discussing the burns on Lucy Duncan's body - and this counterpoised with the way Vince (Marvin) burns the dice dealer's hand with his cigar (and how all this leads to all the face burning) - all of these dualities which visually link "good" and "bad" characters. The implacable Freudian nightmare that is the portrait of Lagana's mother - especially when the camera rests on it while Lagana and Vince are jocularly discussing Larry's murder. The auto lot and its jumble of wrecked cars - not long after Mrs. Bannion has been killed in a car explosion. The crippled woman, with her two canes, as the only one who has a deep conscience (reflecting Lang's sympathy for emotionally "crippled" characters). And then, there are the Army buddies forming a parallel, alternative police force, much as the gangsters do in M (and in You and Me). All this and more, all with a background of generic sets, generic music. What is perhaps less expressionist than might be desired can be found in the fact that environment doesn't shape character as much as could be. The Bannions' kind of pre-fab house, purchased on a "Police salary", contrasted with Lagana's mansion, OK. But how do the chinoiserie and cubist paintings in Vince Stone's apartment tell us anything which illuminates Marvin's character? We certainly have a right to miss the wealth of surface detail of films from the '20's and '30's and to notice that the street Bannion lives on looks like the same set used for episodes of the Twilight Zone, such as The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street. This film presents the standard look of Mid-Century Americana and we have left the carefully constructed alternative universe of films like Murnau's Sunrise far behind. It is sad. But none of this changes the fact that this is one of Lang's richest films, where he constructs a world of corrosive behavior, corruption, lies (or half-truths) and complacency that doesn't rely on embellishment to make its points. This is not a greater film than M, but Lang is a greater director here than he was on M.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal, dark and memorable film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Big Heat starts out as many crime films do. A detective investigates a death which could possibly be a murder and gradually things become more complicated. But usually, you get a whodunnit where everyone acts suspicious and slowly a mystery unravels and a culprit is found. The end. But here, we jump head-first into a major battle between a cop and a mob syndicate. The tone is ominous and the people and places are dangerous. But our hero is not happy to do as he's told and he can't stand being surrounded by those that do (because they're afraid).Movies maintain your interest with tension and changes to the situation. The plot moves and it keeps you involved. Some movies feel slow at times or predictable. If nothing is happening, the suspense fades away. The Big Heat contains many events that can be quite shocking and which shift the balance of power and motivation for the characters. It keeps getting more interesting. It can feel inevitable in retrospect, but the first time it's full of surprises.I really like Glenn Ford as Bannion. He seems like a good, passionate cop and a kind and caring husband and father. I was genuinely moved by his performance in several scenes. But that's also thanks to the direction, the story and the other performances. Jocelyn Brando (Marlon's older sister) is very good, a loving wife but in a real kind of way not a cheesy way. Gloria Grahame and Lee Marvin are excellent as well and bring lots of energy and character to their roles (I don't know how else to word it).I felt like some of the scenes were a bit typical at first (giving so much attention to an attractive woman, showing intimate family moments) but as the film progresses, you see that everything is there for a reason. What is white without black? You need contrast, a background, a context. Loss is not appreciated without seeing what is lost. An empty room has meaning if you know what used to be in it. Every scene in this movie serves a purpose. We might not be told the purpose, but we feel it in the greater scope of the whole film.The Big Heat is riveting all the way through. There is real menace and a feeling that anything could happen. It holds no punches - I was really affected by certain scenes, they have real impact and involve you even more in the film. There are a number of interesting similarities with The Dark Knight, another great film where a man takes the mob head on and tries to put an end to corruption and crime. Anyway, I immensely enjoyed it. It's uncompromising but very rewarding and entertaining. One of my new favourite movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After suicide, the police "Tom Duncan" leave a letter in which he confesses to have been bribed by a band of gangsters, but also denounces the corruption of senior officials. When Sergeant "Dave Bannion" (Glenn Ford), tries to clarify his death encounters all sorts of obstaclesThis is one of the top movies in the genre of detective Noir American cinema of the 40s and 50s. Lang had already impressed us years earlier with such extraordinary films as "The Woman in the Window" 1944 or "Human Desire" 1954, which addressed issues as common as the desire, jealousy, hatred or crime. But in "The Big Heat" which makes perfect in the genre, offering a film full of violence, corruption and instead of greatness by the protagonist and his personal environment surrounded by the love of a happy family, which forms a kind of island in the quagmire in which it operates its daily work.Lang shows us in this wonderful film, that this type of honest life ends triggering "terrible collateral damage" to those who dare to stand against corruption and unscrupulousness of certain undesirable characters.The great script, the power of black and white photography, the wonderful dialogue and interpretation of all the cast is unbeatable.Lang is arguably the best noir filmmakers and this has been one of his best films. It's an extraordinary film in all aspects</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic movie. Possibly Glenn Ford's greatest role.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From time to time in film noir the line dividing the police from the criminals seems to blur. That is not the case in The Big Heat. In The Big Heat the line separating the police from the criminals is clearly delineated. In the story the police are afraid to assert themselves not because they are tied in with gangsters but because the police commissioner, who is an appointed official and not a professional police officer, is tied in with the mob. They don't want to do anything that will cross the commissioner and jeopardize their pensions. Nevertheless, the police follow Bannion's lead and join him in his one-man vendetta against the sadistic Vince Stone and his boss, Mike Lagana. The presence of the ex-GIs further accentuates the divide between the two factions. The American GI is a metaphor for goodness, strength and courage. The ex-GI who drove a 50-ton tank in World War Two is one of the good guys.Detective Sergeant Dave Bannion is an iconic character. He sets the standard for future movie law enforcement fighters: Virgil Tibbs, Buford Pusser, John Spartan, Frank Serpico, Alex Murphy, Eliot Ness, Daniel Ciello, Martin Riggs, Roger Murtaugh, John McClane, and Harry Callahan. Like Bannion, these cinematic heroes are incorruptible, which sets them apart from the criminals. They are readily distinguishable from the bad guys. They are heroes, not anti-heroes. To equate the police with the criminals is like saying the American soldier in World War Two was as corrupt as the SS because they fought each other on the same battlefield. Dave Bannion puts his life on the line not for money, but as a matter of principle. Bannion and the other heroes mix with criminals because of the nature of their work, and when they resort to violence, it's only because they have to, not because they want to. It is difficult to decide where to begin praising this movie. Should we start with the story, which is terrific? Or with the acting, which was great? Or with the continuity, which never let up and took the audience straight to the finish? Or with the cinematography, which conveyed the feeling of tension and drama? Or with the music, which perfectly caught the somber mood of the story? This movie is an example of what a movie is like when all the elements that go into making a movie come together. Gloria Graham's performance is stunning. Glenn Ford conveys an intensity that is remarkable. But the actor who propels this movie to the level of greatness is Lee Marvin. Marvin's performance has to rank as one of the most powerful and compelling in the history of cinema. His performance is memorial and sets a standard of excellence that may be equaled but not likely to be surpassed. One other point: Although this movie was made in 1953, it withstands the test of time, meaning that the story is as relevant today as it was in 1953, thus this movie is a classic.One other point: This movie may arguably be the finest example of expressionist cinema ever produced by an American movie company.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a much better thriller than I had anticipated. Perhaps inevitably it is known as the one where Lee Marvin throws hot coffee into Gloria Grahame's face and it occurred to me that one shocking - at the time - sequence doesn't make a movie so I tended to avoid it. I was, I am not ashamed to admit - wrong. In fact seen today the coffee in the kisser scene is merely a small part of a fine film - for the record the coffee is thrown off camera. I always found Glenn Ford a tad wooden but he acquits himself well as an honest cop prepared to lose his badge rather than go along with the corruption all around him. Alexander Scourby also scores as the 'Mr. Big' but far and away the most interesting person involved is Jeanette Nolan who, after an auspicious film debut as Lady Macbeth opposite Orson Welles in the title role, went on to appear in just about every television series you can think of, with a brief pause to play the voice of Mrs. Bates in 'Psycho'. Carolyn Jones also makes a brief appearance as a girl on whom Lee Marvin stubs out a cigarette. Fritz Lang brings a Teutonic sensitivity to the proceedings and a good film is had by all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darker things better left unsaid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's deeply disturbing film-noir looks unflinchingly at two different types of characters: some who are obviously and intentionally corrupt and self-seeking while others presume to be safe and well- intentioned on the surface. This sets up a very intense and stark crime story which feels most unconventional compared to others of the same genre during the same time period.What sets Lang apart from most other directors is his willingness to see the seedy and immoral side in all human beings. Even the protagonist of the story, straight cop Glenn Ford, becomes somewhat of a mixed character in the audience's mind due to his seemingly inability to realize the danger in which he puts those who try to help him. The end result is a typical ending that leaves us with questions as to the possibilities of what might happen next to Dave Bannion. Can he remain out of trouble or does he have a penchant for finding it? Either way, the consequences of such activities are perhaps better left unsaid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's direction, even pared down as it is, is the most striking thing about The Big Heat -- not a frame is wasted, and he manages to make some striking images even in the shady world of film noir. Lang also draws some great performances out from his actors, especially Lee Marvin, who manages to be sleazy and corrupt without ever seeming unreal -- he's the kind of villain you could see yourself being friends with and simply turning a blind eye to the shadier parts of his work.As for the rest of the film, it may be my apathy to film noir tropes, but it left me fairly cold (sorry). To its credit The Big Heat takes a more societal approach than most noir, envisioning a whole corrupt power structure instead of just isolated venal criminals. But after a while the film simply becomes one plot point happening after the next in increasingly fast succession. Glenn Ford's rogue policeman also never seems really three-dimensional, even after his postcard-perfect family gets offed to give him some edge. (There's a refrigerator-stuffing if there ever was one.) Noir buffs will and do love this, and I can't really blame them. But if it stands above most of its genre, it doesn't really stand outside it like the best movies do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Old time movie goers thought it pretty shocking when Cagney jammed a grapefruit into Mae Clark's kisser in 1931's "The Public Enemy". I would love to have been around first hand to see the reaction to Gloria Grahame getting a scalding hot pot of coffee in the mush by a 'Stone' cold Lee Marvin when this first came out. The kind of violence on display in "The Big Heat" has nothing on modern day cinema, but one's reaction has a lot to do with the way it's done off-screen using the power of suggestion. Detective Bannion's (Glenn Ford) wife dies in a bomb blast, Vince Stone almost breaks a girl's arm at a nightclub, Grahame's character returns the favor to Stone in the closing minutes of the story. The threat of harm isn't so over the top to be unbelievable, but imagining it done to yourself sends a shudder up your spine.I'm not so sure if Glenn Ford was the best choice to portray the good cop going rogue here. I'm thinking of someone like Robert Mitchum with a natural intensity for this kind of role, one suited for an understated malice under the veneer of respectability. Picture him with his hands around Bertha Duncan's (Jeanette Nolan) neck and you'll see what I mean. Ford gets the job done well enough I guess, but even when he was blowing his top it looked like he was just a little too much in control.Not to get sidetracked, but it's always cool when a dated picture like this offers up some reminder of the way things were back in the day. A beer at The Retreat went for thirty five cents ('pay now'), and can you wrap your head around this - Bannion laments that it's costing the taxpayers a hundred bucks a day for the cops to guard Lagana's joint twenty four hours a day! What was that - like less than five bucks an hour? I guess they weren't unionized back then.Questionable make-up aside (they should have kept Grahame's face covered), this is a good start for movie fans interested in testing the waters of the noir film genre. You've got your women of questionable virtue, nasty villains, good cops/bad cops and violence and danger lurking around every corner. Atmospherically it could have been a little darker, but I'd still recommend it. Who could argue with Glenn Ford when he said to the bartender - "Tell that to your mother."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it is a typical noir. The main character is a detective, there's a girl, there's a wife. Yes, it stars Glenn Ford. Yes it is outdated. But, yes it is directed by Fritz Lang. Yes, it is shows much more violence than I would would expect for that era. Yes, it is one of the best Film Noir's ever made.The opening shot is a gun. The camera slowly pans back to show the gun being lifted towards a man's head. The gun fires and the man is dead. His wife comes downstairs, she is not affected by the death at all. She doesn't scream or call the police. She picks up a note, reads it and then calls the head of a major crime syndicate. Not a normal response, not a normal wife, but then again not a normal movie.The film follows Glenn Ford's character. Ford plays in an interesting character. There are moments when you just have to look into Ford's eyes to see his whole character. Also excellent are Gloria Grahame and Lee Marvin. Both actors portray their retrospective characters well. The plot follows Ford as he unravels every layer of the syndicate, ending his journey with a final shootout in Marvin's home, that is both powerful and exciting.Not wanting to say too much more about this excellent film, I suggest you check it out. It packs quite the punch, and with all the bad movies these days, it is refreshing when you find a film with so much too love. I highly recommend "The Big Heat."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tough noir from the German master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>German master Fritz Lang spent most of his post-German silent film career in Hollywood making film noirs and western B-movies. The Big Heat follows hardened police detective Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford) as he investigates the apparent suicide of a fellow police officer. He is suspicious, and after he is contacted by the deceased's mistresses who claims it could not possibly be suicide, Bannion begins to unravel foul play on a large scale. When he stands tall against a powerful crime syndicate against the warnings of his peers, he is hit hard and vows revenge and justice. He must come up against the likes of mob boss Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby) and woman-beating goon Vince Stone (a young Lee Marvin).It's a shockingly brutal noir, complete with torture and facial scoldings. The rules and traditions of film noir are interestingly flipped on their head, such as the classic figure of the femme fatale being completely missing. The women that Bannion comes across are weak, afflicted or morally ambiguous. Or all three. Glenn Ford's performance in the lead is staggeringly intense, as he punches and smart-mouths his way through gangsters and authority in his quest for closure. Bannion is often repulsive in his brutality and right-wing morality, and the film goes much further than what the typical noir allows it's anti-hero to go. One of, if not the best, film Fritz Lang directed after his relocation to the U.S.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever film noir is discussed there tends to be a lot of banter about cynicism and amorality. And yes, there does tend to be a lot of that, but it's not all doom and gloom. Film noir was never a codified genre as such, more a tendency or set of stylings, and there were certainly no rules to say it couldn't indulge in a bit of tenderness or poignancy from time to time.The Big Heat is very much an archetypal noir, a familiar crop of crime thriller clichés. You have the tough, rule-breaking cop who gets personally involved in a case, has to hand over his badge and ends up pursuing the crooks on his own time. The characters and their portrayals (by a very worthy cast) are shameless stereotypes of the form ? Lee Marvin's heavy, Gloria Grahame's moll, Alexander Scourby's clean-handed mob boss and even the square-jawed, uncompromising hero played by Glenn Ford. Lines like Glenn Ford saying he won't use his gun until he catches up with his wife's killer sound like they come from some cheeky parody. And yet it is the very simplicity of the story that allows for some hard-hitting differences. In contrast to the man-eating femme fatales of your average noir, the women in Ford's life become casualties in his crusade, and this makes the tragedy bittersweet rather than misanthropic. Writers Sydney Boehm and William P. McGivern won an Edgar Allen Poe award for The Big Heat, and this is quite appropriate as there is something distinctly Poe-ish in this theme of a protagonist possessed by the memory of his lost love.The director here is Fritz Lang, a man often associated with the pessimism, not to mention the stark and shadowy look of film noir. In the first scene we get a glimpse of how the latter part of his reputation was acquired. The light is murky, and Lang keeps the camera close to the wall, so that every edge seems to press in on us. To see the extent of the effect, check out how light and open the same room looks in a later scene when Ford visits Mrs Duncan at home. But it's not just oppressive atmosphere that Lang is emphasising through space. In the scene in which we first see Ford with his wife, the camera is constantly on the move, showing off every aspect of the room, giving almost 360-degree coverage so it becomes like a real space around us. Another director might keep the backgrounds plain and focus us on Jocelyn Brando's pretty face, but Lang chooses instead to bring out the cosiness of her surroundings. It's only when Ford gets a phone call and his job interrupts that we get a close-up. Whenever some key plot detail is revealed Lang keeps removes all the surrounding clutter and harnesses our attention. After all, this isn't like The Big Sleep where the story is almost openly made to play second-fiddle to the images and chemistry of the leads. The criminal intrigue really means something here and Lang wants us to take note.Not that this is in any way a message movie. But it's important here we get a full view of what drives the action, not only Ford's quest to avenge his wife, but Grahame's decision to stand up to the gangsters, Commissioner Higgins's attempts to bury the case, and the good or bad actions of every stooge or witness our hero encounters. We get a strong sense of injustice, but one countered by an almost rousing feeling of people pulling together, all of which pays off in a finale that is emotionally charged and neatly satisfying. The Big Heat is firmly rooted in the lowdown world of film noir, and yet through its sensitive humanism it represents noir at its most uplifting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Academy Film Archive, part of a foundation created by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, was established in 1991 and "dedicated to the preservation, restoration, documentation, exhibition and study of motion pictures." This is one of the films they recently restored. It took three years to do the work.German director Fritz Lang (Metropolis, Dr. Mabuse: The Gambler, M), who built a career on gangster films, gave a a film noir that was fast paced and had some really great lines given to some really remarkable actors.Glenn Ford (the original 3:10 to Yuma,Superman, Pocketful of Miracles) had the lead as a cop whose wife is killed by the mob. Lang liked using everyman characters seeking revenge, and Ford was perfect in his relentless pursuit of those who did him wrong.Oscar winner Gloria Grahame (The Bad &amp; the Beautiful, Violet in It's a Wonderful Life), was superb as the gangster's moll, who had boiling coffee thrown in her face. Don't try this at home as the result is not the same in real life.The gangster that did it was played by the evil Lee Marvin. You could see the maliciousness in his eyes.A real treat for film noir fans, and a superb introduction to the genre for those looking for superlative entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating noir film with a terrific performance by Glenn Ford and well directed by the master Fritz Lang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The storyline centers about a persistent and upright cop named Dave Bannion ( Glenn Ford ) happily married ( Jocelyn Brando ) and with a daughter . He is stubbornly adhering to track down a mobster ( Alexander Scourby ) and his henchman ( Lee Marvin ) . Dave is helped by the gangster's girlfriend ( Gloria Grahame ) . In spite of killings Bannion is determined to bust the criminal ring . But the corruption , ambition and greed create a spiral of hate, murder and vengeance.Columbia Pictures film production , put all the force of the screen into a challenging noir drama of furious passions and though there are pretty dialog and violent action is enough entertaining . It is a psychological , dark drama about fatalism , duplicity , pessimism , vengeance , human passions and corruption . Stylish , well designed and compelling drama , although is sometimes annoyingly shrill . The film is a classic cinema noir , packing riveting scenes with an interesting script plenty of surprises and twist plots . The movie gets usual Lang's characters , a man is caught web-like in seedy nightmares of his own making and a tremendously imaginative journey into the depths of human desperation . Love , hating , killing , revenge indeed figure strongly in this brightly seedy portraits of low life as Fritz Lang did also in ¨ Human desire ¨(1954) equally with Ford and Grahame . The well-designed atmosphere elaborately recreated is entirely convincing throughout , including the famous coffee hurtling scene . Wonderful performances from whole casting . Interpretation by Glenn Ford as revenger cop is first class , the evil racketeer Alexander Scourby is top notch and his underling Lee Marvin makes an absolutely hypnotic interpretation , also Willis Bouchey as corrupt Police Lieutenant is first rate . Smouldering Gloria Grahame -married by that time to Nicholas Ray- is magnificent and Jeanette Nolan as manipulating widow who subtly destroys them , winning yet another awesome acting in her account of the predatory domineering . The film contains stunning cinematography by Charles Lang , the photography is extraordinary , setting of lights and shades depict this type of noir cinema and Charles Lang along with John Alton and Nicholas Musuraca are the main cameramen . Good musical score fitting finely to the sensation of menace and suggestion . The motion picture is narrated with agility and slickness by the great director Fritz Lang . The German Lang is an expert on noir cinema such as proved in ¨ Beyond a reasonable doubt ¨, ¨ While the city sleeps ¨, ¨ Secret beyond the door ¨ , ¨ Scarlet Street ¨ , ¨ The woman in the window ¨ and many others . Rating : Above average , a real masterpiece . Worthwhile watching , it's a must see for noir cinema buffs .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>82/100. With Fritz Lang at the helm, you know it is going to be a great movie. He excels at film-noir. Glenn Ford gives a wonderfully low key performance, but it is Gloria Grahame that gives the best performance in the film, she is unforgettable. Lee Marvin is memorable in a supporting role, as is a very young and blonde Carolyn Jones. The screenplay is compelling, sassy and fast paced, the cinematography is stylish and superbly done. The use of light is remarkable. The great editing fuels the fast pace, and it has an excellent score that enhances the film. It is just a marvelous film all around and it works on every level. One of the best film-noir movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Too Hot to Handle for Fritz Lang and Glenn Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a corrupt cop shoots himself dead, wife Jeanette Nolan (as Bertha Duncan) confiscates his multi-page confession and contacts mob boss Alexander Scourby (as Mike Lagana), promising to keep the detailed note in a safe place as long as she continues to receive $500 payments from the mob. The blackmailing widow puts on a tearful act for police Sergeant Glenn Ford (as Dave Bannion), claiming her dead husband "Tom" was in ill health. But, his mistress, Dorothy Green (as Lucy Chapman), contacts Mr. Ford, saying her lover was in good physical condition, and had no interest in killing himself.Ford becomes suspicious, especially after Ms. Green is thrown from a car, tortured and beaten to death. "Looks like a sex crime to me," the lab investigator says, "You saw those cigarette burns on her body." But, Ford thinks barfly Green was killed because she was seen talking to the police. They may both be correct. Mr. Scourby's main henchman, Lee Marvin (as Vince Stone), seems to specialize in torturing women. "You like working girls over," Ford tells him, after rescuing a hustling blonde Carolyn Jones from Marvin's clutches. Watch for another woman to get a scalding, scarring pot of hot coffee thrown on her beautiful face.Not much of this violence is actually shown on screen, but director Fritz Lang and writer Sydney Boehm (from a "Saturday Evening Post" serial by William P. McGivern) are clearly pushing the limits of the movie production code, with this dark tale of police corruption (One of the original guidelines was to never show a policeman behaving badly). "You can fill in the four-letter word," advises Ford's dutiful wife, played by Jocelyn Brando (Marlon's sister, as Katie). And, Gloria Grahame (as Debby Marsh), who is sexy without even trying, squirms all over Ford's hotel bed. Ford keeps his feet firmly on the ground, however.There are great small roles for many, from hapless Adam Williams (as Larry Gordon) to helpful Edith Evanson (as Selma Parker). He may not have realized it at the time, but this was one of Ford's best roles. Mr. Lang, cinematographer Charles Lang, and editor Charles Nelson make "The Big Heat" both artful and entertaining, in beautiful lighted black and white. Some of the blocking and prop business looks a little rough, but it really doesn't hurt the picture. At first, little Linda Bennett's baby carriage seems like a mistake, because she is obviously too big for it. But later, we see she uses it for a doll. Now, that's good cover.******** The Big Heat (10/14/53) Fritz Lang ~ Glenn Ford, Gloria Grahame, Lee Marvin, Jocelyn Brando</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Big Heat' sizzles (and not just with hot coffee)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a riveting crime drama, from the cynical mind of Fritz Lang.The movie presents some of the stars in some of their best performances, most notably Gloria Grahame, who plays an unforgettable funny and sexy Debby Marsh.Glenn Ford, whom I often find uninteresting, gives an inspired performance as the pompous cop O'Bannion. He's dealing with some real slime-balls in this film, and Ford's sergeant must test his scruples constantly to deal with his corrupt police department and crime king Mike Lagana.In one of his few film roles, Alexander Scourby plays a most elegant and smooth crime chief. Scourby's voice is better known for the millions of movies, TV and commercials he narrated.Jocelyn Brando has probably one of her best roles in her playing of Ford's wife. I don't remember Jocelyn looking quite as good in any other feature.Even reliable character actress Jeannette Nolan gives a striking performance as the cop's widow who is now blackmailing the syndicate.But this film works so well because of the relationship between Gloria Graham's 'Debby' and Ford's 'Dan'. Grahame won an Oscar for 'The Bad and the Beautiful', but she is wonderful playing Lee Marvin's moll in this film. At once funny, sexy, wise-cracking and vulnerable, Grahame makes her character come alive.Lee Marvin, a fine actor, almost gets lost in the mix. His gangster, 'Vince Stone' just isn't as interesting as his girlfriend or the cop he is menacing.I don't think this movie gets the acclaim it deserves. Often overshadowed by John Huston's "The Asphalt Jungle" (another great film), "The Big Heat" seems to be almost an afterthought. But I definitely would put it up there with the best crime dramas ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such tenderness and such violence in one movie, in one man...a moving crime film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Big Heat (1953)Starts good and gets better and better as it goes. Glenn Ford is the perfect stoic, principled cop, and Gloria Graham is astonishing as a gangster's moll. It gets complicated from there but never confusing, and if the morality is ambiguous, you never question whose side you're on. Just for sheer, step by step plot development, you get sucked into this small town corruption and really feel for the characters. Not that you have time to consider it while it's happening. Director Fritz Lang may not be as physical with his lighting and camera as in earlier (European) films of his, but he is in total control. keeping the shadows sharp and the editing efficient. The tragedy and violence may be something of a surprise to people used to more cushioned crime films--even a lot of film noir classics don't dwell on the pain people are suffering, or the sadism inflicting that pain. And through it all is a stubborn higher principle that Ford will not shake, even if his actions are morally dubious.The bit parts are significant and sterling, which is part of pumping up the intensity--Lee Marvin as a cocky, ruthless villain, and Alexander Scourby as the suave mob boss are archetypes. And the mood of the city at night, early 1950s, is a joy of its own. The film has a terrific sense of presence out there, out of the studio in the real world. To add to it all, it's written like a gem, with noir quips that ring true. Great stuff. Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The casting is perfect. Glenn Ford as the upright cop has a boyishness, an innocence which is just right for the role..the sadness in his eyes, the purpose in his stride as he sets out to avenge the death of his wife..he maybe an actor with limited talent but this role was tailor-made for him. Gloria Grahame! She's out of this world...she was outstanding in In a Lonely Place and she's stunning here. Lang does a wonderful job of making the audience understand the characters motives and their past lives without spending too much time on it. In a fast paced movie like this, its hard to relate to the characters..to get emotionally linked to them but the way Gloria's character is brought out pure class. In one of the beginning scenes she's shown acting like a kid, drinking too much and making fun of Vince's (her boyfriend's) servitude to Lagana (the mob boss)..she hops around the hall singing a nursery rhyme. In a later scene, she tells Ford that she's been both poor and rich and rich is any day better even if it means being beaten up by her boyfriend once in a while. An innocent young girl who's seen a lot in life and feels the deal she's got - a rich boyfriend who can be abusive at times - is good enough - but still retains her innocence - she identifies with and gets attracted to a good man who's been wronged (Ford). Gloria's attraction to Ford's character is NOT "the dumb blonde likes tall, handsome male" stereotype.What makes this movie even more amazing is that you can actually believe it could've happened. Lang doesn't make the mistake of making anyone the "superman" of the show. Ford's character is not shown as masterminding the downfall of the mafia. He's helped by unlikely friends..and some of them have their own motives too.Fast paced, gripping, believable, twisted, bordering on Gothic and then rebounding to a cop revenge story and then changing again...this is a must watch for Film Noir fans!</fullReview>

Fritz Lang, director of such classics as "M", "Metropolis" and "While the City Sleeps" came up trumps with this one. The prototype modern thriller, it has a strikingly new feel to it, wheres other films from Fritz Lang (i.e: "Ministry of Fear") are rather dated.

		<shortDescription>Riveting plot will keep you nailed to your seat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Big Heat' is a film noir classic due to its original and riveting plot. The film draws you right in with the suicide of a police officer in his home and his widow, Bertha Duncan (played by Jeanette Nolan) who hides the suicide note which implicates Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby), the town's number one crime boss. Duncan concocts a plot to blackmail Lagana, making sure the suicide note is released to the press in the event of her death.Assigned to investigate the suicide is Det. Sgt. Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford). Bannion interviews Duncan who is uncooperative and hostile. Bannion then gets a tip from B-girl Lucy Chapman who insists that Duncan's husband didn't commit suicide and implied that he was on Lagana's payroll. (I had trouble believing that she would have met with Bannion in open view at the nightclub which easily tipped off the mobsters that she was spilling her guts). Bannion turns up dead the next day, the victim of multiple stab wounds and possible sexual assault by a psychopath (the coroner's report to Bannion on the B-girl's death foreshadows some of the more explicit scenes of violence to come).When Bannion gets a phone call threatening his family at home, he decides to confront Lagana directly. Lagana is depicted as a man who seeks to project an image of a model citizen?he even has a picture of his mother on the wall and tells Bannion that he cared for her in his home right before her death a year before. Bannion isn't impressed by Lagana's phony resume and ends up slugging Lagana's bodyguard which outrages the crime boss further.In a scene you can never forget, after Bannion gives his wife the car keys, she leaves to go on an errand while he's singing nursery songs to his daughter. Suddenly there's a tremendous explosion right outside the window. Bannion runs out to find his wife trapped in a burning car. He breaks the car window and pulls her out. But it's too late. She's the victim of a car bomb.After the funeral (never seen on screen), Bannion meets with the Police Commissioner who suggests that his wife was murdered by criminals Bannion may have locked up in the past. It's clear that he doesn't want to investigate the possibility of Lagana's involvement. Bannion accuses the Commissioner of being in league with Lagana who promptly demands his resignation. Bannion turns in his badge but keeps his gun which he bought himself.Bannion finds out from the crime lab that parts of the bomb are linked to an auto salvage shop. The owner at the shop won't tell him anything but after he leaves, a crippled woman who works at the shop as an office assistant, tells him that a man named Larry called the shop from a nightclub (The Retreat) where Bannion had met the recently deceased B-girl Chapman earlier. Unable to find out who Larry is, Bannion still makes the acquaintance of Lagana's right hand man, Vince Stone (played by a very young Lee Marvin) at the Retreat. Bannion prevents Stone from beating up a woman who he's been playing a game of dice with at the bar.Stone's girlfriend, Debby Marsh (played by an over-the-top Gloria Grahame) comes on to Bannion and they end up at his hotel room. Bannion wants Debby to tell him who Larry is but she's more interested in having an affair with him. Later, after Vince finds out that Marsh has been talking with Bannion, he scalds her face with a pot of steaming hot coffee. With her face (and life) basically ruined, Marsh has no compunctions about revealing Larry's identity. Bannion confronts Larry Gordon, the sadistic hit-man hired by Vince to kill Chapman as well as the one responsible for the death of Bannion's wife. But Bannion doesn't kill him?he extracts the information he's been looking for: Bertha Duncan has been blackmailing Lagana all along with her now deceased husband's suicide note. He tells Gordon that he plans to let his mob associates know that he's a snitch.Debby Marsh now seeks revenge on both Stone and Lagana. She bumps off Duncan (who is the actual femme fatale in this film noir) and then throws scalding hot coffee in Vince's face at this apartment (how she so easily got in is not explained). Stone then shoots Marsh just as Bannion arrives who gets in a shootout with him. Now out of bullets, Bannion has a chance to finish Stone off but decides to hand him into the police. A newspaper headline reveals that Lagana and the Police Commissioner (who was seen in an earlier scene playing cards with Stone and was a witness to Stone scalding Marsh with the hot coffee) have been indicted and presumably on their way to jail. Bannion is restored to his old job (why he doesn't get a promotion I have no idea) and once again is a respected member of the Police Force.What sets 'The Big Heat' apart from some of the lesser "B-rated" film noirs is the complicated plot as well as director Fritz Lang's decision not to 'soft pedal' any of the violent scenes here. His message is that when criminals kill, they do so with no conscience. So the car bombing scene along with Lee Marvin's treatment of women (to the point where he has no pangs about throwing a pot of scalding coffee in a woman's face) is both explicit and shocking. The collusion of the 'respectable' Police Commissioner and the timidity Bannion's colleagues add to the overall atmosphere of dread. The Big Heat is by no means a 'perfect' film as it sometimes falls back into the typical sentimental moments of the B noir. The story overall however, is most satisfying as it will keep you riveted in your seat throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fritz Lang's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The finest film Fritz Lang ever directed in the America and certainly one of the best film noirs ever made, this movie parades a series of original underworld characters who first came to life in a series of Wm. McGivern Saturday Evening Post short stories adapted to the screen by Sydney Boehm. Columbia Pictures leading man Glen Ford, cast against type as the vengeful and obsessive detective, comes upon the elegant and smooth talking Alexander Scourby --possibly the first suave Godfather in the history of film before Marlon Brando. (Ironically, Marlon's sister, Jocelyn, who bears a remarkable resemblance to her brother, plays Glen Ford's wife.) Gloria Grahame is memorably kittenish and sexy as the gangster's moll and the then relatively unknown Lee Marvin steals the show as her sadistic boyfriend. Variations of these violent, repellent but thoroughly believable characters were to appear again and again in the films of the seventies when censorship lessened. The film is constantly underscored by lots of music, some of it obviously stock, but no one composer is credited! Was Harry Cohn, in his typical penurious manner, trying to save a few bucks in the budget?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film years ago at the cinematheque in Paris and was wowed. I just bought a copy for myself and it is still a wonderful trip.This is a revenge film, pure and simple, and if it appears somewhat dated from all the copycats that followed, it still packs a wallop. This sort of Old Testament revenge can be found in Lang's work all the way back to "Kriemhilde's Revenge" in the silents. Some things can be figured out - Lang isn't much of a "surprise" director, but we have to savor his vocabulary with the camera set-ups, the lovely symmetry and impeccable timing. Actually the plot devises are rather complex considering who does what to whom, but the film is completely clear and lucid. Gloria Grahame had her moment in the sun - and what a moment! This is a fine, fine noir picture that needs to have more attention. It's Lang at his American best and that's saying something.Curtis Stotlar</fullReview>

And now he is an ex-Sergeant looking out for revenge, because of his wife's murder, against the most powerful criminal in the zone, Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby). But to get closer to Lagana he must deal with Vince Stone (Lee Marvin) who is the best partner of Lagana, and also with a lot of corrupt cops. But for that he will have the help of the few honest people, specially Debby (Gloria Grahame) who is Vince's girl.This is the main plot of this film noir, directed by the great Fritz Lang. The story is simple and very direct (the film runtime is only 89 minutes) and the performances are superb, especially Glenn Ford and Lee Marvin. Also the one of Jocelyn Brando (as Bannion's wife) who is the older sister of Marlon Brando, is great and this is her best-known role in all of her career and is the first time i see her in a film. But the unique character that i truly don't like is Lagana, who is the most powerful criminal but he doesn't look like a really bad guy and for be the greatest criminal in the film he don't have a big participation. And in consequence, Lee Marvin's character is the best criminal in the film.Anyway, the storyline is great involving a fictional place called Kenport, where you must fight not only against criminals, also against corrupt cops and politics. Just like in every "normal" city in our world.Conclusion: this film is great, superb performances in a great and simple crime story. And also it's one of the best films of the great Fritz Lang but in a way a little forgotten. 9.5 out of 10DVD: i truly doesn't know about this film until a couple of days ago i saw the DVD for only $3. It was in an special offer of used DVDs in a big store, and i just bought it because of Fritz Lang. The DVD is good, with a few extras like trailers and a posters gallery but anyway the price was really good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, it's all that, and it holds up after 50 years..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the positive comments here at IMDb about this Lang/Ford collaboration. With all the entries of the 'noir' category now available on 'Turner Classic', I'd been hearing about 'Big Heat' for quite some time, and was pleased to catch it today. Direction and character portrayal are superb -- in fact, we probably don't lament enough about the death of supporting actors in modern Hollywood, the 'character' players who made these older flicks shine.I'd like to add that elements of this film (police manipulation, corruption, intimidation, mobsters living in style, rogue ex-cops getting it done) have been portrayed countless times since, in film (Clear and Present Danger, Godfather) and on TV (Sopranos, 24). And even after 50 years, the 'grass-root' detective methods employed by the Glenn Ford character are employed on the fictional 'CSI', but also on the A&amp;E real-life crime shows (48 Hours, Cold Cases). I think that marks it as a brilliant piece of cinematography, as many older films have become at least partially 'dated', especially to modern sophisticated viewers! Finally, the film is hard-hitting but not always graphic - there are some shoot-ups, but we don't need to see blood or gaping wounds. Why not just let the actors 'act'? Enjoy!! 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glen Ford on a Hate Binge.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this it struck me as another revenge movie of the sort that Fritz Lang seemed attracted to around the time this was made. Just that the cop in this case, Glen Ford, was more hard-boiled than usual.Now, some years later, it seems a bit more than that. It's still a hard-boiled movie, the story of a cop who is so determined to clean up the organization that runs the town of Kenport that he goes overboard, a little like "Dirty Harry." "The Big Heat" is more conventional, more ambitious, and less an outgrowth of its Zeitgeist than "Dirty Harry." In the latter, Clint Eastwood knocks off urban villains that are heartless and nameless. They're just bodies to be mowed down. Eastwood's only motives are to protect the innocent, whom he appears to hold in contempt, by killing the heavies, whom he despises. He has no other motive. The gunshots are explosive, the dialog cynical, the locations colorful, and the cops are hobbled by the Constitution of the United States. It all reflects the backlash against urban crime that was making all the headlines in 1971. It moved the Manichaean Western to the streets.But "The Big Heat" is more personal. Glen Ford at least has a strong motive for his relentless pursuit of evildoers. When he pushes too hard against the top gangster Lagana, Alexander Scourby, Ford's wife is accidentally blown up while starting the family car.Unlike Eastwood, Ford has a family -- a wife, Jocelyn Brando (Marlon's sister), and a lovely kiddie whom he lulls to sleep by telling the story of the three little kittens who lost their mittens. These scenes, backed up by a soapy musical score, are trite beyond belief, but there is a payoff at the climax when he distracts a dying gun moll by telling her, at her request, the story of his own family.That gun moll is Gloria Grahame in what's arguably her best role. Grahame was never beautiful in a standard Hollywood way, nor was she a bravura actress, but the writer, Sydney Boehm, has given her a splendid part with some sparkling dialog and Grahame does just fine with the character of the good-natured, self-centered whore. "Listen, I've been rich and I've been poor and, BELIEVE me, rich is better." She hops around like a trained circus dog. She looks as sexy as she was supposed to be and is charmingly candid.Her face is horribly scarred by a pot of boiling coffee that the sadistic Lee Marvin tosses at her because of some minor slight. Marvin was in his thug period -- that horse face with its protruding, plump lower lip, the ugly sneer, the brutal gesture. He's great.He's the only heavy that isn't in some way humanized -- again, unlike "Dirty Harry." All the others are either fearful of being murdered, for good reason, or in some cases, as in Scourby's, they have families. Scourby beams at his daughter's coming out party. He keeps a portrait of his recently deceased mother prominently hung in his study. He's utterly ruthless in ordering assassinations.The plot has the aggressive detective embittered by the murder of his wife. He trusts no one and insults everybody, even those who try to comfort and help him. Only gradually does he develop as a character. His conversion back to some simulacrum of humanity is initiated by a lame old woman who, at her own peril, feeds him some information that guides him in his quest.It has all the usual icons of noir. There is the marginalized moll, the smooth villain, the snarling enforcer, the snub-nosed .38 revolver, the detective with flaws, the night-time streets, the penthouse apartment, the threatened middle-class home, the ex-GIs, the corrupt chief of police.It's a good job. Maybe I shouldn't qualify these remarks but I'd just finished watching "Laura" and couldn't help noticing the differences in the quality of the cinematography. "Laura", another detective story, was shot by Joseph LaShelle and the photography is magnificent, whereas Charles Lang's photography here is relatively flat or stark. In "Laura", for instance, no simple wall is either light or dark but rather subtly textured with shades of gray. It makes Lang's photography look like an episode of "The Honeymooners" or "I Love Lucy." (It's not that bad; I'm exaggerating to make a point.) Photography isn't often something you think of when watching a film unless it's exceptional. I always thought I could act a little -- and have -- or, with some coaching, even direct a movie. But I can't imagine lighting a film in the expressive way Joseph LaShelle did without years of experience behind me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tough, uncompromising late noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Glenn Ford is a police sergeant seeking retribution for the death of his wife in "The Big Heat," a 1953 film that also stars Gloria Graham and Lee Marvin. While investigating a police officer's alleged suicide, Ford's idyllic family life is ruptured when his lovely young wife is killed in a car bombing intended for him. Some have suggested the similar scene in "The Godfather" was inspired by "The Big Heat." It's certainly possible.For 1953, the violence is uncompromising, particularly against the female character played by Gloria Graham when she crosses her boyfriend, Lee Marvin, in one of his early roles. Marvin is fantastic as a brute, and this characterization must have done a lot to raise his profile in films.There are some outstanding performances, including that of Jeannette Nolan as the late officer's wife who knows plenty. Glenn Ford, a handsome, solid actor who seems forgotten now, underplays his role but the coldness and rage he feels is evident as he goes from happy family man to angry avenger.Excellently directed by Fritz Lang, "The Big Heat" packs a wallop.</fullReview>

I'm surprised that they had this in the movie due to the super strict standards of the 1950s, however, knowing Fritz Lang and his films ("M" and "Human Desire"), it really isn't surprising at all. Thanks to AMC, I didn't have to rent "The Big Heat" (in fact, I never even heard of the film until I looked it up in the TV directory in my local newspaper).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic film noir by Lang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The overall tone of this film is very dark and violent but Fritz Lang was a master of these types of stories and his trademark style of sets and shadows can be seen throughout. Story is about a veteran cop who commits suicide and Detective Sgt. Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford) from homicide is investigating. The widow Bertha Duncan (Jeanette Nolan) tells Bannion that her husband was sick but didn't want to tell anyone. Then while at home he gets a phone call from a strange woman who wants to tell him something about the suicide. Bannion heads to a bar called "The Retreat" where he meets the woman who tells him that she was having an affair with him and that he was definitely not sick. He doesn't know what to think of it but the next day the same woman is found dead. Bannion is now suspicious and he is sure that the head of a crime syndicate is involved. Bannion goes over to Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby) who is a mob boss and has the police commissioner on the payroll. Bannion threatens him and slugs his bodyguard. But the next day Bannion's wife Katie (Jocelyn Brando) dies from a car bombing meant for him. Bannion is on a crusade to get those responsible but the commissioner tells him that they will handle it. Bannion knows not to trust him and throws his badge on his desk and quits. He starts his own private investigation and it leads to Lagana and his henchman Vince Stone (Lee Marvin) and one night at the same bar he meets Stone. After witnessing an altercation with a woman he tells Stone to scram. Then Bannion meets Debby Marsh (Gloria Grahame) who is Stone's girlfriend and she is curious by him. *****SPOILER ALERT*****Debby has a drink with Bannion but one of Stone's henchmen witness's her and tells him. Stone confronts Debby and scars her face with hot coffee. With her face bandaged she hides out with Bannion at a hotel and she tells him everything that she knows. Fritz Lang's style is evident throughout this film and the set designs help him paint a vivid portrayal of a man dealing with cruel and dishonest people. I noticed some things like the scenes with Gloria Grahame usually have mirrors in them. Her character knows she is pretty and she likes to look at herself whenever possible. Then after she is scarred she spends her time making sure that she stays in the dark avoiding them. Both Marvin and Scourby live in big fancy houses and apartments while Ford's home is a very modest looking abode. The bar called "The Retreat" has an entrance where customers have to walk down the stairs to get in. It looked symbolic that Ford would have to trek downward to be among the shadier types. All the violence aimed at woman in this film is done by mob types and it has often been said by Lang experts that he usually portrayed mobsters as violent to woman. The performances are all excellent and Ford is very believable as the cool but extremely angry detective. He has genuine moments of deep sorrow when he is remembering his wife. But the film is a real showcase for Grahame. She's tough talking and sarcastic but she also knows she's attractive and likes to use it. She's been hanging out with bad men so long that when Ford comes along she seems curious to find out whether their is a difference between the two types of men. Also, look for a young Carolyn Jones who gets her hand burned by Marvin in the bar. Wonderful atmosphere and rich performances by all. A must not only for Fritz Lang enthusiasts but for fans of classic film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forerunner of L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and THE BLACK DAHLIA...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty brutal stuff is the best way to sum up the contents of THE BIG HEAT, easily a forerunner of two biggies that came along much later in time--L.A. CONFIDENTIAL (with its exposure of police corruption in Los Angeles) and THE BLACK DAHLIA (the same).GLENN FORD is out for revenge when his wife is killed by the mobsters and he walks into some pretty scary situations when he tries to take justice into his own hands. JOCELYN BRANDO (Marlon's sister), who plays Ford's wife, is the unfortunate victim of a car bomb. JEANETTE NOLAN is a woman who wants to bribe the police department when she finds out some incriminating details in a letter her husband wrote before his suicide. LEE MARVIN is a brutal mobster with a pretty blonde girlfriend (GLORIA GRAHAME) who is treated so viciously by him that she decides to switch her allegiance and falls in with honest cop GLENN FORD.It's a tight, taut, suspenseful film (with good chemistry between Ford and Grahame) that shows no mercy in dealing with several of its main characters for the sake of telling a gripping story about corruption and loyalties in the "crime does not pay" mold.A definitive example of film noir and well worth sampling if you're a fan of this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First-class noir, whatever that may be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never managed to find out what `film noir' means; but anyone who wants cynicism with a smile, let alone cynicism with a snarl, will be disappointed. From the two Hollywood films of his I've seen (the other is `Scarlet Street'), Fritz Lang is a big softie. He's not a timid softie - he's neither afraid to kill a character off, nor afraid to keep a character alive - plot-wise, he doesn't seem to be afraid of anything - but there's something warm and human about his darkness, something touching rather than titillating. For all the powerful corruption we see, corruption is never treated as if it were inescapable.The storytelling is both clever and satisfying - no stunning twists, lots of nicely obscured half-secrets. And yes, Lee Marvin is an amazing thug. A pity the title's so very generic (they're careful to see to it that a character uses the phrase `the big heat' in the course of the film, but I doubt his heart was in it). The film is much better than its title would suggest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget Gilda, This Is Ford's Noir Zenith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Yes, I know, the words intensity and Glenn Ford usually don't go well together. His diminutive stature, like Alan Ladd's, always was a big impediment to his tough guy persona. I liked him in the original Ransom but this is the best he ever achieved. His Dave Bannon reacts to Vince's retarded stooge blowing up his wife by going into a hate filled revenge rampage that has to be seen to be believed. What is atypical about this Noir is how indifferent Bannon is to collateral damage, he ends up getting Debby disfigured and he is almost obliviously careless about it. Marvin equals his performance in Liberty Valance as the head enforcer Vince for gangster Lagana. Unlike Gilda, Ford seethes with hatred, his rendering of Bannon is evocative of Cagney's Cody Jarrett. The movie follows Bannon's going after Lagana for killing his wife. The movie is a bit slow at the very beginning but this is thematically necessary for us to see the love between the couple and their life together. Vince has a real bungler of an assistant who ends up causing the entire mess by the crappy fake auto crash, then blowing up the wrong person: Bannon's wife and not Bannon. Ford is far more convincing here than in Gilda, often he dares the hoods to pull their pieces with the memorable,"What are you going to do about it, Thief?"Do not be fooled by the age of this Noir, it is quite intense and not remotely for children. What you will notice is violence against women is openly depicted. SPOILER: While Debby's burning is off camera, we hear her blood-curdling screams. Vince doesn't mind slapping or hitting either. My favorite part is the realistic showdown between Bannon and Vince at the very end. It is shot almost in the dark, and like the Neo-Noir Body Heat, things don't go well just like in real life. Bannon almost bites it, surprises happen, I will not spoil it for you. What is meritorious is how like real life it is with furniture and objects being thrown everywhere and bullets going wrong places. This is the best way to help you with this old masterpiece. Versimilitude, it has such realistic intensity in Bannon's hatred and the confrontation are not phony or have a contrived feeling. The mafia is delineated as just a business, Lagana is not the Satanic Mr. Brown from The Big Combo, he even tries to patch things up with Bannon. He goes out of his way to avoid a confrontation almost killing Vince's retarded assistant for causing the entire debacle. Yes, I know, Criterion Collection has just canonized Gilda making it one of their selections for fifty bucks on Blu Ray. Pay it if you want, yes Hayworth is hot, no debate there, but just the silly shot of Ford in that dreadful costume made my whole living room die laughing. Also, the reality of a big gangster putting a street guy in charge of his casino is why I never went over the cliff for it. This movie, after the requisite slow beginning, moves without pause; it is full of intensity and great performances. Yes, Ford was intense in Ransom, but that story just is not the equal of this one. Parents should avoid showing this to small children, the scalding scene and the final showdown are quite violent. I have never cared for Gloria Grahame but she gives her best performance here much better than In A Lonely Place. After The Lineup, this is my second favorite Noir for a reason: it nearly equals Siegel's classic in intensity and surpasses it for two great performances: Ford and Marvin. Take it from a Noir collector, with hundreds of Noir, start your collection with Siegel's The Lineup followed by this one. One Fantastic Intense Film Noir. Say No To The Coffee When Vince Asks You, By The Way. Q.E.D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During his investigation of the death of a fellow cop a police sergeant is warned off by his mob-corrupted superiors, and his defiance ends in tragedy for his family. Revenge is in the cards, but a gangster's moll plays her ace.Gangster story stuffed with devious characters. Some great actors, especially the women, but I didn't buy the lead male - too upright and uncompromised for a noir, and the punch ups didn't feel real. As Marlowe would say, No iron in his bones. Also his lines lacked the zing of Chandler.The actress playing the lead's wife has good presence (Brando's boozy older sister), but the main claim to fame is from Grahame who executes the perfectly doomed blonde, giving the movie a sense of innocence lost in a brutal world. The coffee scald scene is so cruel it becomes the engine for the revenge story, rather than the hero's loss.The pace is good, photography too although not moody enough. A nice close up on the scalded face, with division of light and dark. Standard orchestration of the music, and a bit obvious in the lead up during the famous car bomb scene - you just know the mood is going to switch dramatically.Overall - good entertainment, but the outcome is too moral for classic noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Big Heat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die has helped me find a lot of film I probably would never have known about before, this is one of the titles I found in it, directed by Fritz Lang (Metropolis, M, Secret Beyond the Door). Basically upright cop Detective Sergeant Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford) from the homicide bureau is assigned to the case to investigate the cause of the suicide of Tom Duncan, head of the records bureau. This case seems pretty open and shut, until the police are called by Lucy Chapman (Dorothy Green), Tom's girlfriend, who says that Tom would never commit suicide, Bannion dismisses this comment, but then when Chapman is found beaten and tortured he believes there is more to the case than predicted. Despite warnings from his superior and others Bannion's trail leads him to a vicious gang he suspects holds power over the police force, he suspects many officers are on the payroll of the gangsters as they keep silence about particular things, and Bannion's assignment gets personal when a car bomb meant for him kills his wife Katie (Jocelyn Brando, Marlon's sister). Bannion is furious to get vengeance and justice, and he is aided along the way by Debby Marsh (Gloria Grahame), the spurned girlfriend of the gangster Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby), and when push comes to shove he quits the police force to pursue the mobster and his henchman Vince Stone (Lee Marvin) on his own terms. Also starring Jeanette Nolan as Bertha Duncan, Peter Whitney as Tierney, Willis Bouchey as Lieuntant Ted Wilks, Robert Burton as Detective Gus Burke, Adam Williams as Larry Gordon and Howard Wendell as Police Commissioner Higgins. Ford is good a the crusading on and off cop pursuing the gang and all corrupt characters, Grahame as the gangster's girlfriend gets many dramatic moments, and supporting cast members like Marvin get their time too, the most memorable moments of the film is also the one the censors wanted trimmed, when Grahame is scolded in the face by hot coffee thrown by Marvin, also the car bombing moment, there are other moments that get your attention, and it is a relatively interesting story of corruption and crime, it is a worthwhile classic film noir.

		<fullReview>THE BIG HEAT is a top-notch crime thriller and one of the best Fritz Lang film's I've watched. It's a pitch-perfect hardboiled film noir, featuring a stolid Glenn Ford playing a cop who has a dangerous and deadly run-in with a criminal organisation with roots at the very top of the city. Before long, Ford is involved with various femme fatales and encounters some truly sadistic criminals in his quest for justice.I'm not too familiar with Ford as an actor but he's in his element here, playing a quietly unstoppable character who has to be one of the most sympathetic leads out there. Ford underplays the role, allowing the showier parts to take over. The women in the storyline are particularly well served, with the likes of Gloria Grahame seemingly catalysts for the moments of stark violence that punctuate the production.Lang's direction is top dollar, and in particular he elicits some excellent turns from the entire cast. Best of the bunch is Lee Marvin as the bestial villain for whom violence against woman is a way of life. Although tame by modern standards of on-screen violence, this still feels like a graphic and nasty production, and the lean, fast-paced narrative also gives it a modern feel much unlike the stodgy B-pictures of the decade. THE BIG HEAT is unmissable entertainment.</fullReview>

A woman approaches him and claims that it wasn't suicide - it was murder. Intrigue ensues...A great crime-thriller from master director Fritz Lang. While you know broadly who did it, you don't know all the details. Moreover, you mostly see it from the policeman's point-of-view, and feel his frustration as he is constrained in his abilities to crack the case.Great work from Glenn Ford in the lead role, especially as he is more known for westerns. Good support from Gloria Grahame, Alexander Scourby and an early-career Lee Marvin.Not perfect - Bannion's big break feels a bit contrived. In addition, the pacing is a bit off: after building the tension, the ending feels rushed. These are, however, minor negatives in an otherwise flawless movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's The Big Heat is among the best noir movies ever made, and unlike any noir movie that I have ever seen before in my entire life. As the movie opens we see a corrupt cop commit suicide and then within a few seconds his wife comes downstairs to see what had happened and she finds her husband on his desk with a pistol in his hand and calls the police. Thee movie stars Glenn Ford as Police Detective Sergeant Dave Bannion the man who is in charge of this investigation of the apparent suicide, then within a few days Bannion is ordered to stop asking the wife of the dead cop questions about her husband. While trying so hard to crack this case right open he continues persistently until an explosion in his car happens for him ended up killing his wife (played by Jocelyn Brando, who was the sister of Marlon Brando) instead. Then Bannion permanently resigns from the police force and finds out that all of this was planned by the mob underworld led by Mike Lagana (played by Alexander Scourby) as well as his abusive henchman Vince Stone (played by Lee Marvin), then when Vince's wife Debby Marsh (played by Gloria Grahame) Vince then disfigures half of her face with hot coffee, and then Debby is more than ready for payback by telling Bannion all about Vince and all his other mob friends and what they did all along and the cop suicide case was a cover up. Theis movie compares to classics in it's genre such as Touch of Evil (1958), The Maltese Falcon (1941), Sunset Boulevard (1950), The Big Sleep, and some of Alfred Hitchcock's best films. What a great film this was.</fullReview>

What makes it so is that Gloria Grahame's Debby Marsh and Glenn Ford's Dave Bannion - both stars are luminous in their roles - make a genuine and believable human connection. Although there's a touch of romance to it, it's not primarily an erotic connection ? just a human one.

		<shortDescription>This film is really a timepiece! First as a Film Noir Genre and also as a historic memento. The story line and cinematography was a bit slow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interestingly enough, I started to get into the film, mostly because of the Mes En Scene of the 50's and the props, automobiles and language that was from the era I grew up in. The motifs were things that have long since become relics like the old rotary dial phones, cat clocks, mink coats and beat-nick artwork. The liner narrative of Big Heat has a three-act structure, with the inciting incident of a tip to the law following the suicide/murder (?). As the clues roll in for detective Bannion, the development of each character defines subsequent developments. Questions to arise, especially since "Tom had no reason to kill himself" and "Then why did Bertha's husband kill himself if he was in good health?' By the second act the protagonist had more questions and doubts about the reliability of the cast. Act Three Debby Marsh, the typical Femme Fatal has revealed a not so innocent character, closing doors with open-ended pondering like, " Do you get your kicks walking out on people She and Dave leave together in a taxi to his place. This binary opposition of family vs. the corrupted individual is intertwined throughout the final act where the plot unravels and all his well traveled wife wants to do when things get tough is go out and get her legs waxed.Dave Bannion is a typical patriarchal, hard working detective, married to a self centered and not so innocent wife, who admittedly isn't a romantic. He's got the garb, morality and motivation to find justice on either side of the law. Dave and his supporting characters all act like they are in control, when in actuality they're barely keeping up with the Jones and fall in step way behind the dominant dames. Debby, Dave's beautiful, but deceitful wife looks for revenge, while displaying a classic Femme Fatal character, or should I say, lack of one. She is rebellious, manipulative and pretends to be something she's not, in order to get her way. Mrs. Duncan acts and plays the part of a distraught widow, but curiously isn't emotional after her husbands supposed suicide, yet in order to tug at the heart strings of the investigator, Bertha hams it up and pretends to be out of sorts when the detective candidly asks her, " Do you know why he'd (her now dead husband) take his own life?" _ " Oh", she answered, " he's complains about his painful hip", as though she was offering some kind of inside scoop about why an otherwise healthy and happy man, up and kill himself. As a Femme Fatal would be expected to do, Bertha twists her alibi and blames some other woman. One of many "Lucy's or mistresses in her unfaithful and deceitful husband's life. Debby wasn't the only Femme Fatal in this film; Debby March knew how to wrap men around her little finger without being childish. Rather, she was sexy, desirable but unreliable and dark. Like the other women in this film who all seem to fit the MO of a Femme Fatal, Debby is manipulative and willing to use men like Vince Stone for their money and luxury. They are motivated to do wrong.Comparing and contrasting the relationships brings to light the homogeneous bonding between the investigators and even the commissioner. Their costuming is similar and even though they share a conflict of interest, on the surface they all seem to be hard working patriarchal men. The opposition of that of course is the Femme Fatale who tries her darnedest to confuse the truth and avoid being found out as the crook she is. Also, how everyone is ready to double-cross whoever they need to in order to squirm out of the immediate predicament.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cruelest (and best) of film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Big Heat is a prime contender for the cruelest and most brutal of all film noirs, which is saying quite a lot. At the same time, a big part of why that may be so is that The Big Heat is in many ways hardly a film noir at all. All of the great canonical film noirs, including Otto Preminger's Laura, Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity and Ace in the Hole, Jacques Tourneur's Out of the Past, and Alexander Mackendrick's The Sweet Smell of Success, tend to be populated by characters with little trace of goodness left in them; they are all doomed, fated to their inevitably bitter ends from the outset. What makes The Big Heat so powerful and disturbing?and, ultimately, so unlike most film noirs?is that it has, at its heart, many genuinely good people.Fritz Lang, the brilliant German director who had already cemented his place in cinematic history with monumental films like Metropolis, Dr. Mabuse: The Gambler, and M, creates in The Big Heat a film whose strength lies in defying expectations of plot, genre, and characterization. Its opening, for instance, is not a far cry from the usual hard-boiled detective formula. Police Sergeant Bannion (Glenn Ford) is assigned to investigate the suicide of a high-ranking fellow officer, which leads him to uncover a trail of corruption and licentiousness and, in turn, puts him into deep trouble with the local mob syndicate, headed by Mike Legana (Alex Scourby) and the psychopathic Vince Stone (a young Lee Marvin).Lang manages to transcend these cut-and-dry foundations, however, by affording his protagonist a greater depth than one usually finds in a hard-boiled detective hero. The typical hard-boiled detective is unshakeable, wisecracking and ethically-ambiguous, but generally one-note: coolness is all they have going for them. Glenn Ford's character, by contrast, is a family man and, ultimately, a tragic figure. Whereas the characters in other film noirs are often so uniformly reprehensible that any misfortunes that befall them seem almost warranted, the juxtaposition between Bannion's tough policeman persona and his fatherly sensitivity and protectiveness?first with his daughter and later with Stone's abused girlfriend Debbie (Gloria Grahame)?makes the character's plights and perils all the more involving. You see, Bannion is not just a smart-talking male power fantasy, but a decent, honest man who is merely driven to brutality by tragic circumstances.Perhaps the reason that The Big Heat seems so sadistically violent, then, is that the audience is given genuine reason to sympathize with those who are subjected to it. Again, this is where Lang's genius really comes into play. Anyone who has seen enough Hollywood movies would naturally expect that after Bannion carries his unconscious wife (played by Marlon Brando's older sister, Jocelyn Brando) off-screen after she has been wounded in a car-bombing intended for him, there would be a scene in which we see her safely recovering in a hospital bed and Bannion angrily promising her that he will find out who was responsible for the attack. But no: in the next scene, we find out that she dies. On top of that, Lang mercilessly obliterates the quaint, idyllic domesticity of the Bannion household in earlier scenes with a scene in which Bannion bitterly packs up and moves out of the old family home, now cold and empty. It's truly heartbreaking, and it makes Bannion's subsequent trials all the more compelling and, dare I say, poignant. The same goes for the infamous scene in which Lee Marvin scalds Gloria Grahame's face with a pot of boiling coffee. The scene is especially cringe-inducing and sadistic because the audience realizes that she is not just some vain, self-obsessed gangster moll (which, in a more conventional film noir, would make the cruel attack seem like poetic justice), but merely an unlucky, good-natured girl who got caught up with the wrong kind of guys.The rest of The Big Heat then works like the best of revenge tragedies, in which even more cruelty and violent retribution is enacted as form of catharsis. The one thing that struck me the most about the action in this film is just how much more forceful and yet satisfying it seemed. Just like any hard-boiled hero, Bannion goes around and punches the lights out of a lot of henchmen throughout the film. Under Lang's direction, though, the punching in The Big Heat doesn't have the stagey and almost slapstick-like physics of other cinematic punches, with the bad guys awkwardly stumbling backwards or flipping over tables. Instead, when Bannion punches somebody, they practically fly across the room, knocking everything down in their path. That Lang often quick-cuts or whips the camera around in tandem with the physical blows gives an even greater illusion of weight to the action. Furthermore, not only does Bannion punch a lot of people, but he strangles quite a few people too, including one of the female antagonists. It is here that I must give due credit to Glenn Ford for his performance here: he is not just good; he's scary good. Again, the fact that Ford is capable of showing Bannion as both a loving family man and a ruthless enforcer makes things all the more chilling.It's almost unbelievable that a film as relentless, audacious, and absorbing as Lang's The Big Heat could have been made in the context of the Hollywood studio system under the notoriously restrictive Production Code. Then again, like many of the best films from this era, maybe it's precisely *because* of the constraints of the period that the film is so effective: denied the ability to portray realistic violence or sexual content?the kind that is all but commonplace in today's films?, a filmmaker like Lang would have had to rely on the subtle power of suggestion and of well-honed characterization to generate emotional impact. That Lang was still able to make it all work so astoundingly well is surely a testament to both his and the film's undeniable greatness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very modern police crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Det. Sgt. Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford) investigates the suicide of a police colleague Tom Duncan. However the case turns darker and darker as he finds a corrupt system and its connection to a crime boss. Duncan's secret mistress Lucy Chapman is killed, and they start coming after the incorruptible cop.This is a surprisingly modern police drama from legendary director Fritz Lang. The first 30 minutes has some slower moments. Louis CK joked that he hated the part of his indie film where a character dials an entire phone number on a rotary phone. Sometimes, that's what we have here. It has some slow moments. It's something that must be excused for the era of movie making.The subject matter is tough noir and hard boiled. Glenn Ford plays the stand up cop perfectly. He has an air of moral superiority. He is a cross between John McClane and Dirty Harry. There is great violence. The story is tough. Gloria Grahame makes for a great noir dame. And Glenn Ford has great intensity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First-rate film noir with a terrific cast and great director in Fritz Lang. Glenn Ford plays a cop who is asking too many questions. He's warned to stop by gangsters and his corrupt superiors. When he doesn't, they kill his wife! After this, Ford snaps and sets out to bring the bad guys to justice no matter what. Obviously this sort of material has been handled many times in the decades since and in much more violent and graphic fashion than could be allowed in 1953. But I still feel the grit and emotion in this classic hold up well today. The coffee scene still packs a punch.Glenn Ford gives one of his best performances in this film. Some memorable support from an up &amp; coming Lee Marvin and especially Gloria Grahame in perhaps the best acting job of her career. I mean, she'll always be Violet Bick to me, but this is a much more challenging role. This is a bona fide classic everybody should see at least once. A powerful example of film noir. Great direction, acting, writing. An excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course, that's metaphorically ugly. It all starts with the suicide of a cop, strange testimony from both his ungrieving widow and a devastated girlfriend, and the ultimate discovery of so much corruption so deep in the department.Glenn Gord is the beleaguered police officer who is certain there is more to the story than what he's told, and digs deep, which ultimately results in tragedy for him and his family. Along the way, he encounters Gloria Grahame, the ultimate film noir femme fatal, cheery on the surface, but not quite inside. Lee Marvin, her gangster boyfriend, violently teaches her a lesson, resulting in double loyalties, more murder, and a gripping climax.If you watch Glenn Ford, he adds much detail to the man ascending into despair. He can't look the bad guys in the eye, accidentally drops a block on his daughter's castle, and has a crooked twitch on his lip that is quite noticeable when he smiles. Grahame's lemon puckered voice makes her character more pathetic, and each line she says reveals more into her soul descending into living hell. Marvin's evil mobster is so violently malevolent, he's even twice as horrid as he was a "Liberty Valance".Jeanette Nolan (as the cop's widow) and Carolyn Jones (in a brief role as a B girl who feels Marvin's violence) have nice cameos while Alexander Scourby and Peter Whitney make nice supporting villains. Who better to direct this than the master of violent suspense, Fritz Lang, who also brought us "You Only Live Once" and "Fury".</fullReview>

Of course, if you want to see Gloria Grahame when she has some real material to work with, go straight to In a Lonely Place. As for the other principal, he's quite good here, excellent, in fact, but has there ever been a truly great Glenn Ford movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overwhelming in its simplicity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many have said that Noir films succeed in captivating even today we viewers, who have witnessed far more different styles, genres and adaptations that our 1940s counterparts. Bear in mind that we enjoy the luxury of being able to sample almost 90 years of film anywhere at any time. However, this does not explain at least in my mind why the dialogue in this movie seems to dwarf any modern attempt to compel an audience.Without a doubt, we are blessed to witness a powerful Glenn Ford portray an epitome of modern cinematography -the tough cop with such ease you might mistake him from a real life policeman. His struggle astonishes me and destroys any attempt modern cop heroes put out on the big screen.Grahame further adds to the drama, thus proving my point that everyone in the cast is crucial in setting the backdrop of the mid-century American society: glamorous but pure.The director manages to display such a compelling picture that it is rather hard to compare to any contemporary endeavor to create a perfect revenge story.Punisher, Bronson, Segal eat your heart out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Glenn Ford in a tremendously effective performance as a police sergeant and family man who pits himself all alone against a mob syndicate after his investigation into the death of a colleague results in the inadvertent killing of his innocent wife. This film noir from Columbia Pictures has that artificial movie-lot look, made even worse by over-lit interiors and poor sets. However, the dialogue crackles with a kind of high-toned bitter flavor and a handful of the supporting characters (particularly Gloria Grahame's hothouse squeeze) became archetypes of the genre. Sydney Boehm based his screenplay on William P. McGivern's magazine serial, and his florid interplay between the gangsters and the b-girls is much more interesting than the routine police asides. Roles of the police commissioner (with dirty hands) and the affluent crime boss are both underdeveloped, however Ford rides right over the picture's weaknesses as the tough good guy who pulls no punches. Also terrific: Edith Evanson as an aged secretary willing to stick her neck out for a just cause. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Traditional Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Big Heat," directed by Fritz Lang, is a proper example of a traditional film noir. What makes the movie so incredibly noir is the amount of violence, method of filming, and style of characters which when combined complete the noir package. The film makes great use of shadows and lighting to make scenery and actors appear gritty and dark. Areas like the bar appear suspiciously criminal and seem like the kinds of places one would find in a gangster setting. The characters are undeniably noir in that they are composed of the hard cop and the variety of gangsters and lowlifes that prey upon the good moral people of the city. Even the traditional femme-fatale makes an appearance but this time in a different light. The female lead who one would assume will destroy the life of the man she is leading on ultimately winds up doing good and redeeming her character. The violence is standard for your traditional noir gangster movie but it contains an incredibly shocking scene of a women being scolded by hot coffee in her face. The likes of which haven't been seen a film before. The use of expressionistic lighting and the phenomenal character design that defines a traditional gangster setting make "THe Big Heat" an incredible example of a true film noir. These qualities combined with the moral lesson of good can prevail when upstanding people fight together against evil and ultimately save society, make "The Big Heat" a wonderful film that defines it's genre completely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly enjoyed this film. I like the whole idea of Film Noir - black film and dark movies that tend to be more psychologically thrilling than horror films. What makes The Big Heat a film noir is the fact that the lead character is involved in a series of crimes that take an unexpected turn when his beloved wife is soon murdered as well. As he tries to figure out just who was responsible for his wife's murder (and the connection between all of the other murders) he becomes more and more detached from society. Debbie Marsh would be the femme fatale that is often found in films such as this one. She ends up helping and guiding him and although she killed the cop's wife and poured hot coffee on Vince for revenge (that scene seriously shocked me), she was ultimately a good character.</fullReview>

Ford portrays his character magnificently, and the audience knows nothing will keep him from bringing those responsible to justice. The suspense and darkness in the film is very high which I believe is due the violence and mayhem that is shown, more so than most other films of the time. Things like scolding hot coffee and subsequent burns, raises the brutality over the common gunfights or other disguised violence seen in most code-era films. This is an excellent film noir that anyone can appreciate, and for those with a new appreciation for the genre, like myself, will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing stopping me from rating this film higher is that i'm just not a huge fan of the Film Noir genre. It's a beautifully directed film as all films in this genre tend to be with their contrast in lighting but unfortunately these films just eat at me. They're so cliché and they tend to have some sort of cheesy romance involving a woman who most men would be clever enough to steer clear of and a bull headed cop who can't seem to back off a little bit. Granted this one is a little better with the latter because he eventually investigates the murder of his own family but it just doesn't do it for me. I do however praise this film for pushing the boundaries. It's ahead of it's time in terms of violence (i.e. the coffee pot to the face (twice) and the shoot outs) which I guess could be considered a bad thing too. It also did a little to separate itself from the genre by giving Detective Bannion the more traditional "femme fatalle" traits seeing as every woman he comes into contact with meets their demise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summary and film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Big Heat (1953) is a crime and film noir directed by Fritz Lang and stars included in this film are Glenn Ford, Gloria Grahame, and Lee Marvin. This film is about a detective sargent (Glenn Ford) who gets involved in a case where a local officer had killed himself. While Ford is investigating this case, another woman is killed and Ford's character did not need to be involved in the case at all, and he is clearly warned by his chief and members of a mob. Ford's wife is killed in a car explosion, and Ford sets off to find out who killed his wife for the rest of the movie.There were 2 classic scenes that showed how this is a film noir movie. In the scene where Ford's wife is killed, it is really hard to figure out why the scene is even in the movie until you hear the explosion of the car blowing up and seeing that Ford's wife dies. As I was watching the movie, I thought to myself that something big was about to happen, and then came the explosion.Another scene was when a mob member (Lee Marvin) was returning back to his apartment, and his former girlfriend (Gloria Grahame) gets revenge by throwing hot coffee at him. This scene portrays film noir because it was a dark scene and she was hiding in a corner and you wouldn't expect what was going to happen. Marvin then proceeded to shoot her with his pistol.Overall I think this an excellent film that portrayed crime life in the mid 1900's and how detectives found ways to end it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AWESOME. Best film Noir I've ever seen. Classic storyline where the main action occurs right in the opening scene and the movie works backwards to the end to reveal what actually happened. Glenn Ford who plays detective Dave Bannion is excellent. His character is a true badass. Takes no junk from nobody and does what needs to be done in order to get answers. His character Bannion is sort of an original version of Dirty Harry. Works for law enforcement, but goes against laws to get answers from underground crime. Of course the police department doesn't take kindly to it. Not only was the acting very well done but I also enjoyed the costume design for some reason, I thought it was very creative. One of the coolest scenes in this movie was when Bannion busts into a criminals hotel room with a classic top hat and overcoat on. He fights the guy to the ground and whips out his six shooter through his overcoat and threatens the guy. This was just excellent. Reminded me of classic older gritty crime films. I also thought the film being shot in black and white was absolutely necessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is- a wonderfully modest script, a superb example of film-noir drama, a prime example of realism, an example of the power of brilliant acting, a lesson for Tarantino that extreme violence is only affective in small doses, proof that film-noir works best when you know the back story well rather than just being thrown into the action. Glenn Ford playing the role of a lifetime, throughout he plays the character with extreme subtlety, never overemphasizing his emotions, which is essential to the film, his lack of emphasis makes the emotional affect all the more powerful. Gloria Grahame is superb, so lovable, her character is captivating throughout, it makes you wish in some ways that you might have learnt more about her character's background, although it would have spoilt the film if you did. Lee Marvin's role is I think overstated, he's okay but nothing special. Katie Brando, is stunningly beautiful and her character is so desirable, the kind of woman that dreams are made of. Finally, Alexander Scourby plays the sleazy and amoral bad guy to great effect- there's a particular scene early on, indeed his first full scene, in which he shows his characters capacity to lie and continue to do so without any element of discomfort. He is a cold-blooded killer and yet he is entirely cool headed and rational, a rare novel character, matched only by Orson Welles in The Third Man.All in all I loved this film, I was enthralled throughout. I recommend to any film-noir lover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the very first revenge flicks in essence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I love Fritz Lang's early work from the '20's and '30's, I also must say that he really made some bad movies later in his career. Luckily "The Big Heat" is one of those exceptions to this.In its core this movie is an early revenge flick, in which a man goes after the persons responsible for the death of his wife, after an hit on him has gone wrong. He is later joined by a female who herself also has a score to settle. Like basically all film-noir's this movie is a pretty straight-forward one, that shows some violence in it. I also must say that the shootout at the ending also really reminded me of some good action flicks. Fritz Lang of course always had been a director exploring new grounds and did some groundbreaking stuff for the early cinema. Till some extend "The Big Heat" is also a movie like that.In these type of movies it's always important that you have the right type of characters in it. You need a tough main character, preferable one that is carrying a big loss or grudge with him, a femme fatale and of course an evil, influential crime boss. This movie does certainly has all of these things in it.It helps the movie of course also a lot that it had got some great actors to fill the parts. Glenn Ford, who really didn't do much film-noir throughout his career, is a great leading man for this movie and he meets his match in the still quite young and unknown Lee Marvin. Also Marlon Brando's older sister Jocelyn Brando plays a fine role in this movie.The story is really one that suits the genre and helps to keep the movie going and a compelling one to watch. At times you really need to keep paying attention, or you might loose track, as always is the case with the best movies that are part of the film-noir genre. The movie itself is perhaps not being as film-noir like as some different movie examples and crime/thriller is perhaps a more fair way to describe it. It still has some familiar film-noir ingredients in it but it's just a bit more difficult placing this movie under one genre. But that's Fritz Lang for you, always trying out some new stuff and exploring some new unfamiliar grounds.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Then the Big Heat Will Come Down'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gloria Grahame was Hollywood's greatest possessor of je ne sais quoi, and no one will ever know what that is. If it could be defined, everybody would be doing it and everyone would be a Gloria Grahame. Explaining Gloria Grahame would be like telling the world in a newspaper article about the best little restaurant in any big city, everybody would go there and it would be ruined in a week. (And this happens all too often.) Phenomena like Gloria Grahame thrive in isolation, they cannot be copied, they must not be accessible, there can only be one. Sometimes people simply MUST not be duplicated. Imagine a world with two Jesus's or two Mohammads, or four Popes (in mediaeval times, there were two, and that was bad enough!) So that settles that then. And there is also Glenn Ford, and furthermore there is Lee Marvin. There must only ever be one of them. And aren't we lucky, because all of the above shine in this classic noir film directed by Fritz Lang. With this project, Lang was thrown a bone and made it into a chop, but it still didn't become a steak. The story is so corny and threadbare, the film is essentially a 'junk noir' elevated to classic status by the director and the stars. Here for the hundredth time we have the honest cop struggling against the corruption of 'the city'. Glenn Ford is everybody's idea of the honourable fellow, and so he makes a natural for the honest cop. Grahame in this film, baffled by Glenn Ford's preaching at her, gets to utter the memorable lines: 'Thinking is really hard when you've spent your whole life not thinking.' She is fabulous at 'sashaying' around, teasing and taunting her tough guy boyfriend (Marvin), attracted to the dour Ford who is mourning the death of his murdered wife, and Marvin gets to rant and rage and lash out like a rabid dog, with as deadly effect. Ford wants to blow all the corruption sky-high, and 'then the Big Heat will come down' and everything will be clear again. Things get tough, and then they get tougher. But then they always do. This film is nothing special, but the performances are simply Gloria-ous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coffee, Corruption &amp; The Vengeful Catalyst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's "The Big Heat" is a tough, uncompromising drama about one man's crusade against corruption and the high cost his actions have on his own life and the lives of those around him. Its violent, fast paced story of an honest cop's angry and vengeful struggle against, what seem like impossible odds, is exciting and gripping throughout and the callousness and cruelty it depicts give it a harder edge than most movies of its period.Over the years audiences have become inured to seeing violence used against men but in this movie women are tortured, burned with cigarettes, disfigured, strangled and murdered. These acts would be regarded as pretty unpleasant by many present day cinema-goers and so must've been seen as extremely shocking in 1953.Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford) a homicide detective with an idyllic family life has maintained his own integrity in a city which is run by a criminal gang who exert a strong control over the Police Department. When one of his fellow detectives (Tom Duncan) commits suicide, he's assigned to the case. Initially, the cause appears to be health worries, but when he speaks to Duncan's mistress Lucy Chapman (Dorothy Green) she tells him that Duncan had no concerns about his health and in fact, was quite happy because his wife, Bertha (Jeanette Nolan) had recently agreed to give him a divorce.When Lucy Chapman is found murdered, Bannion is convinced that she was telling the truth and goes on to investigate the circumstances of her death. This results in a telephone call being made to his home during which abusive language is used to his wife and threats are made against him. He reacts by going to confront Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby) who is the boss of the local crime syndicate. He demands that Lagana and his men stop harassing him and his wife and when one of Lagana's henchmen attempts to remove him from the mansion, Bannion beats him up. This action leads to his wife being blown up and killed when she turns on the ignition of the family car and also to Bannion handing in his badge and setting out to avenge his wife's murder.At the nightclub where he met Lucy Chapman, Bannion sees Lagana's right hand man Vince Stone (Lee Marvin) stubbing out a cigarette on a girl's hand. Bannion intervenes and gets Stone to leave the club. Stone's girlfriend Debby Marsh (Gloria Grahame) is impressed and follows Bannion into a taxi and then to his hotel room. She tells him about Stone's violent ways and Bannion uses her to get information about Lagana and Stone.When Debby returns to Stone, he punishes her for consorting with Bannion by throwing boiling coffee in her face. Later, she goes back to Bannion's hotel and gives him information about gang member Larry Gordon (Adam Williams) and his involvement in Lucy's murder and the hiring of a mechanic to plant the bomb in Bannion's car. Bannion violently obtains a confession from Gordon about his role in the two murders and about Bertha Duncan who is on Lagana's payroll because she had information about him and his activities which could bring down his whole racket.Debby having been disfigured by Stone is out for revenge. Bannion explains to her that if anything happens to Bertha, measures are in place for the information that she holds to be released so that the gang will be brought to justice. Debby duly responds by killing Bertha and going to Stone's penthouse where she takes her revenge on him by throwing boiling coffee in his face. She is shot by Stone, an act which leads eventually to all the loose ends being tied up.The screenplay by Sydney Boehm is economical and effective and includes some great lines such as Bannion describing his spineless senior officer as a "leaning tower of jelly" and telling Lagana that "you couldn't plant enough flowers around here to kill the smell". Debby says "I've been rich and I've been poor. Believe me, rich is better". She also describes Bannion as being "about as romantic as a pair of handcuffs" and refers to Bertha and her as being "sisters under the mink". After she takes her revenge on Stone she tells him that "the lid is off the garbage can and I did it".Political corruption is typical Fritz Lang subject matter and his famous expertise in using lighting and composition imaginatively is also in strong evidence as is the use of some unusual and interesting camera-work. There is a noticeable symbolic contrast between the highly lit environment in which Bannion enjoyed his perfect family life and the shadowy hotel surroundings which he later inhabited. Much use is also made of mirrors, which in most cases highlight Debby's vanity but in others signal duplicity (e.g. when Bertha acts distressed about her husband's suicide).Considering the amount of violence depicted and Bannion's confrontational style, it's remarkable that he gets through the story without anyone managing to land a punch on him. It's also notable that he rather cleverly makes himself the catalyst in the demise of Bertha and Larry Gordon instead of taking matters into his own hands."The Big Heat" is a great film with a very solid performance by Glenn Ford and an exceptional one from Lee Marvin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tough,Searing Hollywood Noir Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Fritz Lang's best American films,THE BIG HEAT's combination of themes such as police corruption,mob syndicates,violence and unending cynicism rank this as one of the most memorable of Hollywood's film noirs of the 40's and 50's.The Viennese Lang was perhaps the best exponent of this celebrated genre,and he brilliantly produces the goods again on this occasion.An incorruptible if imprudently relentless police detective,Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford),delves into the suicide of a fellow cop who was apparently driven to such actions by syndicate boss Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby).Bannion's further enquiries into the case reveals that virtually all his superiors are on the take via Lagana's crew,one of whom includes a particularly vicious yes-man,Vince (Lee Marvin).Along the way,several deaths occur,including that of Bannion's wife.He eventually finds an unlikely ally,Vince's mistress,Debby (Gloria Grahame),who is scalded and scarred by her lover but eventually obtains redemption by assisting Bannion in exposing the police/mob criminal axis,namely "THE BIG HEAT".Lang must have rubbed his hands with glee when he agreed to direct Sidney Boehm's caustic,no-nonsense screenplay,and despite a relatively modest,mostly studio-bound production,provides any number of memorable scenes.With so many seedy characters around,our sympathies should be with the main protagonist Dave Bannion.But he isn't necessarily faultless,coming close to strangling some of his opponents,and seemingly caring little about the deaths that are taking place as a direct result of his investigations,all of them women,with his wife tragically among them (Jocelyn Brando,sister of Marlon).Mrs.Bannion is the only genuinely decent,blameless character on show,bringing her husband a temporary relief from the unrelenting stench of immorality that he is seemingly powerless to stop,yet even this veneer of happy family life shudders to a brutal conclusion as she perishes in a car bomb attack (obviously meant for him);his small child is also now put under threat in this endless cycle of malice and intimidation.Brooding,fearless and snarling,this is one of Glenn Ford's best screen performances.Ford is predictably at his most impressive in his confrontations with gangsters like Scourby and Marvin,though his exchanges with Gloria Grahame are perhaps more noteworthy.Miss Grahame is even better in succeeding making her character of a basically cheap,tawdry gangster's moll into a sympathetic,rounded individual with genuine depth and pathos,perhaps with more compassion than Bannion.Her willingness to break the mob (by killing the suicide cop's wife,which will bring incriminating evidence into the public domain) at the cost of her own life,is the decisive act of self-sacrifice that Bannion never quite managed.Grahame's death scene with Ford is very moving and not in the least maudlin,a rare moment of tenderness in a film that has little room for such an emotion.Lee Marvin had not been in many films to this point,but his performance here gave him a niche as sadistic hoods or villains which he successfully and convincingly portrayed for years afterwards.It all started here though,and this may have been the most repellent villain of them all;never bothered who he brutalises or threatens,male or female (Carolyn Jones,before her days as Morticia in THE ADDAMS FAMILY,is briefly but memorably a victim),he of course takes part in the film's most famous (or infamous) scene,hurling scalding hot coffee at Debby's face,all the more disturbing for not actually being seen;Miss Grahame's piercing screams conveying the horror more than persuasively.She gets her revenge against Vince in exactly the same mode towards the end.The ending itself is not particularly optimistic;Bannion may be back at his desk again after having exposed mass corruption from all sides,but no doubt it may all start again as Lang more or less makes it clear in the film that to him there is little difference between those that transgress criminal law and those that are supposed to uphold it.The film's fairly low budget is not readily apparent with ironic contrasts between the more luxurious,if ostentatious premises associated with the mob and the far more prosaic surroundings that Bannion puts up with (his house,office,hotel room,etc.).The director's namesake,cameraman Charles Lang,one of Hollywood's finest,produces much strikingly effective imagery and lighting effects,further enhancing the tension and excitement.THE BIG HEAT has somewhat increased in stature in recent years after not having the most positive of responses when first released (perhaps because elements of the film were fairly graphic,if not unpleasant,at the time).It is tamer by contemporary standards,but THE BIG HEAT is a compelling and thoroughly absorbing thriller from a brilliant filmmaker,with scenes that can still pack a punch five decades later.RATING:8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rules are for wimps?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is very well made, but to be honest I did have trouble with what one reviewer mentions as its 'highly conservative, almost fascist populism'; watching 'good cop' Dave Bannion descend into what is basically the behaviour of a raving vigilante thug is not comfortable viewing. This is fighting fire with fire with a vengeance, as the ex-sergeant of police goes round insulting and assaulting all and sundry, accusing those who don't help him take the law into his own hands of being "scared rabbits", recruiting gung-ho army bodyguards for his daughter with an attitude that is essentially shoot-to-kill, and finally attempting to kill a witness in order to ensure that the statement to be opened after her death goes public as soon as possible. Characters occasionally try to suggest gently that this behaviour is no better than that of the gangsters themselves, but Bannion -- and by extension, the main viewpoint -- rejects this analogy violently. And there are no consequences to the rampage; far from wrecking his career, as a reward he gets reinstated.No nonsense about turning the other cheek here. Perhaps I'm shocked because this is the first of the 'bad lieutenant' films I've seen, never having watched any of its modern-day descendants - but the message we're left with seems to be "hit them first and hit them hard and don't worry about who gets in between". It's not so much the story of a man's descent into soul-wrecking violence and abandonment of his professional ethics as a hymn to the vigilante approach. Rules are for wimps.Gloria Grahame's performance has been justly praised, and the film offers a surprisingly important selection of female roles - the women don't, by and large, engage in the copious violence, but they actually play a more pivotal part than the more passive male characters, who spend most of their time stalling or merely reacting to events: it is the women who plan and act. The script is generally high in quality, with taut quips and value in the details, and the use of music is often notable. And, of course, "The Big Heat" has its famous shock moments, all the more powerful for mainly taking place off-screen. It was just that I found its apparent politics uncomfortable to watch: if I found this one hard to take, I quail to think what I'm likely to make of "Taxi Driver" or "Bad Lieutenant"...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 1950's "Dirty Harry"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One glimpse of Lee Marvin and you know he's on his way up the Hollywood ladder. He doesn't look or act like anyone else at the time. So when he slobbers while manhandling several of the women, we believe it. The irony is that over time he would become a bigger star than anyone else in the cast. It's also a Gloria Grahame signature role. She gets to pout her way coyly into our heart as the good-bad girl she was so good at. Still, I wish make-up had taken a second look at that tacky burn-patch that must have come directly from Goodyear Tire and Rubber. And in an easily overlooked, but really well done part, Dorothy Green is the ill-fated barfly, registering just the right amount of sweet and sour.Actually the Glenn Ford role reminds me of a 1950's version of Dirty Harry (1972). He's a cop disgusted with the establishment, becoming a one-man vigilante squad in its place. Grim faced and determined like Harry's Clint Eastwood, Ford makes a convincing avenger. Note, however, that 50's sensibilities don't allow Ford to shoot Marvin and walk away. In fact the screenplay is careful not to implicate him in an illegal act, which allows for a typical 50's redemptive ending. Contrast that finale with Dirty Harry's of 20 (Vietnam) years later, where he shoots the bad guy and tosses away his badge. Also, like Harry, this movie was condemned for its violence and brutality, the scalding coffee scene especially. However, with all the exploding heads and gallons of blood in today's features, times and standards have indeed changed.Note too how the movie has a Mr. Big (Alexander Scourby) who's behind the crime syndicate running the town. This was a standard feature of crime dramas of the early 50's, reflecting the widely publicized Kefauver investigations into organized crime. So if it wasn't the commies, space aliens, or mutant critters threatening newly burgeoning suburbia, it was organized crime. I guess there was more unease behind the spreading prosperity than met the eye. Anyway, the movie remains entertaining mainly for its strongly drawn characters, even if much of the original impact has been eclipsed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The price of "justice"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Big Heat is a film with some of the most unlikeable characters, even the protagonist is hard to root for. The film begins with a cop's search for justice and truth but quickly spirals into a full-blown vengeance movie with an impressive body count. The Big Heat departs from the stereotypical film noir in that the protagonist himself could be considered the "femme-fatal," destroying the lives of literally every woman he comes in contact with in his search for justice (rather than the woman destroying the lives of those men she interacts with.) The film lacks any sentimentality, each character seeing their acts of violence as necessary and insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Even the protagonist sheds no tears as his wife is murdered with a car bomb and his new female friend, who helps him take down the mob and catch his wife's killer, is first disfigured facially and then shot numerous times. In the end, I was left feeling unfulfilled by the film's violent and message, rather than any of the characters evolving they remained untouched; completely apathetic to anything but themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Big Heat" -The "Dahlia" brought it down like rain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fritz Lang's THE BIG HEAT is one of the most shockingly brutal film noirs of Hollywood's Golden Age. A tale of the post-war concrete jungle, its been called "a film filled with brutality, sordidness, and the seaminess of the unlawful."Sex, sudden violence and moral questions and dilemmas are never far away in THE BIG HEAT, a treatise on urban humanity during corrupt times encompasses familial love, hate, fear, rage, revenge and tenderness. Contrary to most interpretations of the film, the revenge aspect comes more from the Gloria Grahame character than Glenn Ford's. Ford wants justice done. Who wouldn't -and although he takes things to the extreme, a corrupt metropolis is the better for it. It's Grahame that goes "an eye for an eye": having a return engagement coffee-klatch with Lee Marvin is nothing if not pay-back since she was going to plug him anyway. The passivity of everyday folk is also explored, along with greed and corruption (political and otherwise) -and the possible corruption of one's own soul if vengeance is not left to God. But should we stand and do nothing? There's many "mirrors" and "reverse negatives" in THE BIG HEAT -the home-life of Det. O'Bannion vs. crime czar Mike Lagana's as well as the two sides of Gloria Grahame's scalded face that she presents to the world -and that's just for starters. The sudden and horrific violence is still shocking (Grahame and that hot coffee -and Carolyn Jones' dice scoop) and the only ones willing to help Glenn Ford are the disfigured Gloria Grahame (wonderful here), the lame (the old lady in the junkyard who risks all), bar-girl Lucy, the elderly, and an old friend or two -society's so-called weakest links. The men suffer (and some even die or get exposed as corrupt and cowardly which is just as bad for a male) but it's the female of the species that get slaughtered wholesale. With the exception of Glenn Ford's little girl (who's only a child and not a woman) and Lagana's mother &amp; daughter, every woman in the film gets tortured, mutilated and/or killed. Lucy Chapman (the B-girl who doesn't believe her married policeman-lover killed himself) gets tortured, burned with cigarettes, executed and thrown from a car. Gloria Grahame (gangland moll) gets scalded and takes a bullet. Jeanette Nolan (crooked cop's widow) takes a bullet. Carolyn Jones (B girl) gets burned with a cigarette. Jocelyn Brando (Glen Ford's wife) gets blown up. The sole survivor is the helpful old lady who's crippled -but she's already damaged goods. Makes one see what a cold cruel world noir can be... William P. McGivern's source novel was a roman-a-clef involving "The City Of Nets" (Los Angeles, California) and the notorious "Black Dahlia" murder case.The real-life city it depicts was just as deadly as the cold, cruel noir universe. The similarities between Donald Wolfe's "The Black Dahlia Files: The Mob, The Mogul &amp; The Murder That Transfixed Los Angeles" (2006) and Fritz Lang's explosive, shocking tale of a Syndicate corruption that hold an entire city in it's lethal grip are too many to ignore. In the reel world, the crime czar Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby) is a Lucky Luciano/Jack Dragna composite. The brutal and psychotic hoodlum Vince Stone (Lee Marvin) is Bugsy Siegel and his moll, Debbie (Gloria Grahame), is a composite of Marie "The Body" McDonald &amp; The Countess Dorothy Di Frasso -good-time gals who don't know or care what their boyfriend Bugsy does outside the bedroom. Bertha Duncan (Jeanette Nolan) is a composite of Syndicate vice queens Brenda Allen &amp; Virginia "Sugar" Hill.Life Imitates Art Department: LAPD Captain Jack Donahoe, in charge of the Black Dahlia case, epitomized the corruption within the police department and a cop's suicide is what kicked off THE BIG HEAT. Donahoe's real-life death mirrors his film counterpart, Bertha Duncan's husband. Donahoe died on June 18, 1966, of a self inflicted gunshot wound. He was found dead in his living room chair by his wife. In 1949 Governor Earl Warren appointed a California Crime Commission to investigate the infiltration of criminal elements in Southern California including an investigation into the unsolved "Black Dahlia" murder along with alleged underworld payoffs to the L.A.P.D. Mob Madam Brenda Allen actually had a strong box with incriminating evidence implicating her high-powered lovers in the Police Dept. and City Hall for "insurance" -and produced it behind closed doors. Allen &amp; Co. were not charged but the one honest cop who got the ball rolling paid a heavy price:"Ironically, the only officer to be publicly punished as a result of the 1949 Grand Jury investigation was Sgt. Charles Stoker -the honest cop. Reduced in rank and placed on the street as a traffic cop, Stoker was subsequently framed..."Sgt. Stoker later wrote a book about his bitter experiences: "Thicker 'N Thieves" in 1951 and later "L.A. Rogue Cops". Glenn Ford's Dave O'Bannion is, of course, Sgt. Stoker. B-girl Lucy Chapman, burned with cigarettes, tortured by Vince and executed mob-style for making trouble and threatening to talk was none other than Beth Short, aka "The Black Dahlia", who, in real life, was one of Brenda Allen/Bugsy Siegel's escort girls. The un-named city in which the story played out was the "City Of Nets" itself, Los Angeles, California in the late 1940's.HIGHLY recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Fritz Lang's noir crime thriller The Big Heat(1953)is highlighted by the performance of leading man Glenn Ford as Detective Dave Bannion. Ford's strength and humanity allow the audience to get firmly behind the lead character and gives us a reason to become personally invested in the story. Ford's early scenes with Jocelyn Brando are absolutely outstanding with Brando portraying a good humored and supportive spouse to our leading man who is not just Det. Bannion's wife but is also clearly, his best friend.Unfortunately, after a sharp turn in the story, Gloria Grahame's Debby comes front and center and the more time we spend with Debby, the more annoying she becomes. Ford's performance keeps the film afloat, but just barely and I was happy when it was over. The first third of the film was absolutely outstanding but the rest of the film failed to live up to the first 30 minutes.</fullReview>

I love the role he played as the tough cop, and how everyone was always against him but he was always right. The lighting changes were great, and the suspense throughout the movie was also excellent. When i was watching i felt like i knew something was going to happen but i wasn't sure what and i liked that i wasn't to sure what was going to happen. For example when Dave Bannion's wife went out to the car and the car exploded, i felt like something was going to happen but i didn't know what. Overall a great movie to watch even in today's time, i would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not My Favorite of Lang's Films, But Solid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tough cop Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford) takes on a politically powerful crime syndicate.Bosley Crowther described Glenn Ford "as its taut, relentless star" and praises Lang for bringing "forth a hot one with a sting." Variety characterized Fritz Lang's direction as "tense" and "forceful." Today, "The Big Heat" is considered a classic: Roger Ebert lists the film among his category of "Great Movies"; he praises the film's supporting actors.David M. Meyer states that the film never overcomes the basic repugnance of its hero, but notes that some parts of the film, though violent, are better than the film as a whole. "Best known is Gloria Grahame's disfigurement at the hands of über-thug Lee Marvin, who flings hot coffee into her face." I think Meyer nails it. The film as a whole is good, but does not reach the level of Lang's past work, including his noir films like "Woman in the Window". The coffee scene is the most memorable part of the film, even if the makeup used for the burns is pretty shoddy. The movie does capture the noir essence, though, with women wearing fur coats (which looks odd with two ladies side by side), and lots of pistols with the bad guys sporting Lugers (subtle suggestion of thugs = Nazi?).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I wouldn't rank it among the absolute noir masterpieces of the 50s (such as "Touch of Evil" and "Kiss Me Deadly"), "The Big Heat" is a remarkably effective example of the beloved genre. It has a compelling and quickly paced story, truly reprehensible and sadistic villains, and a gritty street-style atmosphere. It falls a few notches under the best film noirs of the time, if only because it isn't nihilistic enough for my likings (like the previously mentioned films were). Still, if you want a fascinating crime story, this is highly recommended. Fritz Lang's skilled direction makes this ninety minutes zip by completely.The film is very ahead of its time as far as its damning portrayal of corruption is concerned. It shows that the main bad guys are often interconnected with politicians and part of a whole web of corruption. I wouldn't be surprised if the makers of "L.A. Confidential" were heavily influenced by this film, because there's a remarkable number of similarities.What makes this work ultimately is the cast. Glenn Ford, known for his roles as nice guys in romantic comedies, is effective as the brutal yet heartfelt police officer. The presence of two noir favorites Gloria Grahame and Lee Marvin is a major plus. Grahame is both sultry and sympathetic as the gangsters moll who helps out Glenn. And in a star making role, Marvin shines as the sadistic bad guy who hurls hot coffee into Grahame's face (in the films most infamous scene). "The Big Heat" is recommended for all fans of hard boiled noirs. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before Dirty Harry, There Was Dave Bannion!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tennessee Democratic Senator Carey Estes Kefauver became synonymous with the Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce that he convened in 1950. Kefauver's interest in crime grew out of his conversations with mayors who suspected that criminal rackets had become so entrenched that local authorities could make only minimal headway against these criminals. The Kefauver hearings took place in 14 cities and 600 witnesses testified. Prominent gangland figures, among them Willie Moretti, Joe Adonis, and Frank Costello, appeared before the committee. Not only did these televised hearings wreck some political careers and advance others, but it also publicized for the first time a criminal syndicate referred to as the Mafia. The Kefauver hearings exerted considerable influence on Hollywood, too. Revelations of organized crime's pervasive corruption of America's justice system furnished filmmakers with new inspiration. The Kefauver hearings forged a subgenre of crime movies about Mafia corruption in city hall, including "The Enforcer" (1951) with Kefauver appearing in a forward, "The Mob" (1951), "Kansas City Confidential" (1952), "Captive City" (1952), and "Hoodlum Empire" (1952). Fritz Lang's "The Big Heat" (1953) concerned Mafia domination of city government and escalated the levels of brutality and violence. The Austrian-born writer &amp; director had invented the character of the elite criminal mastermind in the cinema with his silent German thriller "Dr. Mabuse" (1922) and its sequels. Later, he depicted a city-wide criminal organization in "M" (1930) that responded to police harassment by flushing out a child murderer that the authorities cannot find. Lang's crime movies paved the way for directors like Don Siegel and Robert Aldrich. As a tough-talking, two-fisted, homicide police sergeant bent on revenge, Glenn Ford's Sergeant David Bannion in Lang's superlative thriller "The Big Heat" serves as a prototype for Clint Eastwood's "Dirty Harry" character. This seminal saga about police corruption and metropolitan crime syndicates in the fictional town of Kenport appears a little dated by today's standards with its obvious studio sets and its black &amp; white photography, but it still packs a wallop. Indeed, many film critics complained about the brutality and violence. "Mystery Street" scenarist Sidney Boehm based his screenplay on William P. McGivern's "Saturday Evening Post" serial. Before veteran records bureau cop Tom Duncan commits suicide, he leaves a detailed letter about his corrupt dealings with big-time hoodlum chieftain Mike Lagana (urbane Alexander Scourby of "Seven Thieves") for the district attorney. Duncan's greedy wife Bertha (Jeanette Nolan) wants the payoffs to continue, however, so she hides the letter in a safe place and blackmails Lagana for $500 a week. Sergeant Dave Bannion appreciates the magnitude of his latest case. "When a cop kills himself, they want a full report," he says to a fellow cop at the scene of the suicide. Bannion generates a lot of hostility in compiling that "full report" not only among the paranoid criminal figures but also with his superiors--some of whom are on the take.Everything comes to a head one evening when Bannion and his pretty wife Katie (Marlon's older sister Jocelyn Brando) are bound for a movie. Katie cranks up their car while Dave tells their young daughter Joyce (Linda Bennett) a bedtime story about the three little kittens that lost their mittens. Interestingly, before Dave tells the story and Katie leaves, he tried to help his daughter build a house out of blocks and he winds up knocking down the house. Metaphorically, Joyce's little house represents the Bannion household that our hero destroys. Anyway, Katie is going to drive off to pick up the babysitter. Unfortunately, Katie never leaves their driveway. Several sticks of dynamite attached to the ignition explode and kill her when she starts the car. Of course, the criminals had planned for Dave to die in the explosion. Dave survives and sends his daughter off to live with some friends while he starts smashing heads. Lagana isn't happy about this blunder. Meanwhile, Dave's superiors turn up the heat on him to cool him off, but he refuses and quits the force to take care of business. Along the way, he crosses paths with a mink-clad moll, Debby Marsh (Oscar winner Gloria Grahame of "The Bad and the Beautiful"), and they chat in his motel room. Word reaches Debby's thuggish boyfriend, Vince Stone (up and coming Lee Marvin) who is Lagana's right-hand man; he takes a terrible toll on his garrulous girl by splashing scalding coffee on her face. Earlier, Stone burned a bar girl, Doris (newcomer Carolyn Jones), with his cigarette and attracted Dave's attention. Actually, Dave turns into a rogue himself and he isn't much different from the scum that he wants to put away for the murder of his innocent, defenseless wife.Altogether, "The Big Heat" resembles a film noir thriller, but Lang and Boehm violate one of its chief tenets. Instead of women destroying men, the opposite occurs. Bannion, who is warned by a colleague about his "hate binge," winds up destroying four women, including his wife, in his crusade for justice. Ironically, the hero doesn't kill anybody. He comes close to strangling Bertha and swaps lead with Stone in a shoot-out on the terrace of Stone's apartment. Lang directs "The Big Heat" without any pretensions, and it is better for this treatment. The only complaint of mine is that we don't visually see Lagana suffer as a result of Bannion's investigation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When your dead the "Big Heat" follows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) Having had enough of being blackmailed and controlled by the mob Sgt. Tom Duncon puts all that he knows on paper about the top Mafioso's Mike Lagana's illegal operations, and who of the city's top political and law enforcement officials are in his hip pocket, and then takes a gun and blows his brains out.Mike Lagana gets the call late at night from Duncon's now widow Bertha about her husbands sudden and unexpected death and then starts to cover all the bases with the help of his top henchman Vince Stone. Making sure that what Bertha found out from her deceased husband is kept under raps Lagana goes so far even to pay her a million dollars to keep Bertha's mouth shut. Beartha has cleverly put Tom's suicide letter, that exposed the extent of Lagana's control with a list of payoffs to city officials, in a safe-deposit box only to be opened and read in the event of her death, violent or otherwise, so it was to Langna's best interests to have her kept alive.Det. Sgt. Bannion who had filed away Duncon's death as a suicide is later contacted by this B-girl Lucy Chapman who tells him that there's a lot more to Duncon's death then what his old lady, Beartha, told him. Sgt. Bannion is told by Lucy that Bertha's husband was suffering from an incurable disease and that's the reason he offed himself. Duncon, Lucy tells Bannion, was actually living high off the hog, on the salary of a policemen,and was just about to leave Bertha for her when he was found dead from a gunshot wound.Lucy herself is later found brutally murdered and it's after that incident that Sgt. Bannion goes all out to not only find her killer but almost without any thought to himself, as well as his wife Katie and eight year old daughter Joyce safety. Bannion crashes into Big Mob Boss Lagana's mansion and brazenly intimidated both him and his family and then lays out cold Lagana's bodyguard George. All that George tried to do was peacefully escort, the now what seemed like a totally crazed, Sgt. Bannion off the premises!Action like this on Sgt. Bannion's part called for retribution and it came swift and deadly with his wife Katie getting blown to bits when she started up the family car. That lead to Bannion himself getting kicked off the force by being a complete lunatic in verbally assaulting his boss who was nothing but totally understanding to the grief that he was suffering, in Katie's tragic death. Bannion, now a private citizen, goes on a personal and vigilante-like crusade with no one, in either the police or mayors office, lifting as much as a finger to stop him in cleaning up the town of not only Lagana's mob but the police and politicians that it controlled.Tracking down his wife's killer (Larry Gordon) Bannion with the help of the secretary Miss. Parker, of the owner of Slims Junk Yard, finds where Larry had Bannion's car rigged with explosives that killed Katie. Gordon gets the hell beat out of him by Bannion who has him spill, besides a pint of blood, everything that he knows about the Lagana Mob with Bannion then letting the world out to Lanana and his boys that he talked. You can only guess what happened to Larry after that.Bannion later gets involved with Debby the air-headed girlfriend of Lagana's right-hand man the vicious and sadistic Vince Stone who, like he did with Lucy, Bannion leaves out in the cold by having her spend some time at his hotel room with a jealous Vince Stone. Stone later rearranging Debby's pretty face with a glass pot of scalding hot coffee. Bannion had by now figured out that the only reason that Bertha Duncon was still alive was because of the suicide letter, that's kept in a safety-deposit box, and goes to her place with the intent of killing her so that the letter, and it's contents, would be made public. The letter would sink not only Lagana but all the crooked city officials, including Police Commissioner Higgens, along with him. Stopping just short of ringing her neck Bannion is interrupted when the cops suddenly come to Bartha's rescue.Debby who now has her face in bandages is determined to make Vince pay for what he did to her is then told by Bannion how with Bertha's death it would be curtains for Mafia Boss Langana and even more satisfying, to Debby, his top stooge Vince Stone. Debby going to Bertha's place an hour after Bannion left and after a little chit-chat with Bartha, just blows her away and with that the only thing that's keeping both her former boyfriend Vince and his boss Langa from serving a long long stretch behind bars. Debby later goes to Vince's penthouse and surprises him with a face-full of hot coffee doing to him just what Vince did to her. Mad as a hornet the crazy and deranged psycho guns Debby down only to have Bannion barge in and work him over and leave Vince to face the bar of justice instead of, like Vince begged him to, finishing him off with a bullet between the eyes. Having single-handled cleaned out the city of the mob and the corrupt officials that it had control of Bannion is back at the homicide bureau taking calls and giving orders with a precinct-load of smiling and admiring policemen including the captain looking on. You would think that Bannion would at least get a promotion for the great job that he did but as the the film ends we see on the letter-head on his desk that Sgt. Bannion, despite everything that he did, is still a sergeant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being directed by Fritz Lang, The Big Heat is a rather undistinguished film noir that I found disappointing considering its reputation and its director. Lang is a master film maker whose film M remains one of the most powerful and disturbing films of the 20th century, but The Big Heat lacks distinction; there's nothing notable about the plot or style of the film. Even the much talked about scene involving Lee Marvin, Gloria Grahanm and a coffee pot is hardly shocking or unforgettable. The acting is fine, but the behavior of the characters is often too recklessly and unbelievably naive, and overall the film has a perfunctory air about it. Gloria Graham is fun and much more Oscar worthy here than in The Bad and the Beautiful, and Jeanette Nolan's performance as Duncan's widow is genuinely chilling. Overall, The Big Heat is rather pedestrian and no threat to Aldrich's noir masterpiece, Kiss Me, Deadly(1955).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected more from this. Probably because it's from Fritz Lang. I imagined a top-shelf picture with some major set-pieces. Also after recently admiring Glenn Ford in Gilda, I wanted to see more of his range. Instead I felt this was a B movie with little heft to it. The sets are pretty junky and the premise is by now exhausted. I also don't feel a very strong directorly hand guiding this. I preferred Where the Sidewalk Ends, which is kind of similar to this. Glenn Ford is just P.O'd for too long here.And I would personally offer to dig a grave for the film that introduced the "wife-and-child-in-peril-initiating-the-hubbies-grudge" volition. I cannot stand this plot, and to this day every half-assed director uses it at one point or another in their career. The only movie earlier than this where I saw it used, was Hitchcock's The Man who Knew too Much with Nova Pilbeam in which viewers were somehow spared looking at the hubbies annoying self-righteous anger for the entire running time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big Heat, The (1953) *** (out of 4) Hard hitting, if familiar, crime drama from Fritz Lang has Glenn Ford taking on the mob in a one man war. Here's another film I had been meaning to catch up with for quite some time. I thought the story of a cop finding himself alone going after the bad guys was something we've seen countless times but Lang certainly brings some style along and Ford is on fire throughout the film. Ford really did a great job with his stone cold performance, which certainly seemed to influence the likes of Charles Bronson and perhaps even a tad bit of Eastwood. It's always fun seeing Lee Marvin in these smaller roles but I thought he was a tad bit over the top in a few scenes. The film also manages quite a few shocks including the "explosion", which certainly caught me off guard. The coffee scene was also very memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little heat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to confess that I find most films made before the late 1960s difficult to appreciate. They may have some merits; but I tend to see acting, scriptwriting and camera-work that falls far below modern standards. 'The Big Heat' has a Chandler-esque feel, but without Marlowe's wisecracking or intriguing misanthropy: I found it very flat and obvious, and the central character's response to the death of his wife utterly unconvincing; moreover, he risibly tells his daughter that her mother has gone on holiday! Fritz Lang is widely regarded as a giant in cinema; but in my opinion, the monstrosity of modern blockbusters aside, film has come a long way in the last 60 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins with the suicide of a senior policeman but Sgt. Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford) is alerted to something deeper lying behind the incident. He pursues his instincts even though he is warned off the case by his superiors. The result is that his wife Katie (Jocelyn Brando) is killed in a car bomb. From this point, Dave quits the police and goes after the gang that he believes is responsible. Along the way, we meet various gangsters - Larry (Adam Williams), Vince (Lee Marvin) and Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby) - as well as Vince's girlfriend Debby (Gloria Grahame) who goes through a transformation from dumb-ass to heroine.Its a good film but I'm not sure that I like it! The women in this film get a raw deal - Debby (Gloria Grahame), Katie (Jocelyn Brando), Lucy Chapman (Dorothy Green) and Bertha (Jeanette Nolan) don't make it to the end! That's the 4 main female characters all wiped out. Certainly Katie's demise is disturbing and Debby's end is also sad. Added to that, we have already sympathized with Debby after she has had boiling coffee poured into her face scarring her permanently. On a personal note, I found that Glenn Ford was quite a difficult character to identify with, although I could feel that underneath his no-nonsense approach, there was depth to his character. I just didn't like him.The violence is disturbing and not needed. I don't want to keep a film in my collection which has boiling liquid scarring people's faces - TWICE! Its a good film but I don't want to watch it again. I felt slightly hollow at the end of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Big Heat, mediocre predictable film, more of a melodrama than a noir.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before you read a review that pans a respected film from 1953 by a respected director, Friz Lang....you should know something of the reviewer. I'm a big fan of classic Hollywood films and of Film Noir.The Big Heat was a disappointment. The characters motives and actions were two dimensional, there was no guts to them, nothing made them stand out. The story line is cliché and uses a cheap ploy to motivate the main character into action.Glenn Ford did a fine job of acting but the script and director left him with little to go on; I didn't care about his character. Gloria Grahame, a staple in Film Noir is a capable actresses but plays her role more as a cutie doll, no guts, no believability in her actions. If you want to see Gloria Grahame in a tight well made noir, check out 'In a Lonely Place'.I would have expected Fritz Lang to show some of his German Expressionist styles in this film but the lighting is flat studio light, the compositions uninspired. The music score is sappy, romantic and diminishes any impact this film could have had.The Big Heat is more a melodrama and hardly qualifies to be called a Film Noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge noir film fan but I'm sorry, Glenn Ford doesn't do justice to this role. I tried to watch his performance and didn't buy any of it. I love The Killing. Asphalt Jungle, Kansas City Confidential. Strange Love of Martha Ivers, He Walked by Night. The Hoodlum and Only the Good Die Young to name a few. These all have a quality in acting that draws me into the movie. Ford's performance drew me out of the movie. I just didn't believe the guy's quiet, strong presence. Not one of the top noir films in my opinion.The supporting cast was fine. It was classic noir quality which did no justice to Ford. He was out manned in this movie and is better suited for a more light-hearted movie in which he plays an American business man with a family and small kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and was disappointed. It is suppose to be a story of revenge but Glen Ford never really takes any. He leaves it up to a dame to take care of his business and only jumps in at the last minute to save himself. I suppose this has something to do with the morality of the times...after all you could not have the hero bumping off low lifes...that is not an issue today. Still the Ford character does more talking and drinking than action. Today we would have seen him throwing the coffee into Lee Marvin's face.The movie was entertaining but hardly thrilling. It would be interesting to see what a remake would like like. If you have ever seen Rolling Thunder or Death Wish you have an idea of the tone that would be taken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has Moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall this was a bit of a dissapointment coming from the director of Metropolis, M, Fury, and You Only Live Once. The film does have its moments. The moments of explosive violence are certainly unsettling, as is watching Ford's character sink slowly deeper into obsession. The first scene and the big shootout are both remarkable, although brief. But for the most part, Lang fails to create any genuine tension. Too well-lit for noir, the film at times feels almost stagey, something I would never say about any other Lang film that I've seen.In fact, the whole film feels demoralized, as if Lang is simply not trying. Perhaps the weakness of the material or the meddling of the studios simply wore him down, but he also fails to elicit any good performances, even from Gloria Grahame and Lee Marvin.Anyway, it's a decent genre film, worth watching if it's on TV, but there are much better Lang films and noirs out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.It is possible to make a film that has a soul, is entirely coherent (a rare thing) and competent... and yet be uninteresting. No one doubts Lang's ability to create a whole vision, even successfully tell a story cinematic ally.This one may have had some novelty when new, in terms of the actual story: cop's wife killed, revenge sought, powerful forces. So many better films (and worse) have rummaged through this. Though it has some theatrically drawn characters, and each part is connected to every other part, it doesn't connect to the viewer. It doesn't inhabit that space between it and us. It is merely a dated sculpture.More interesting is why people call it noir - why Lang himself thought it was.Noir has as a central notion the existence of a fate outside the control of the space we share with the author/narrator. Usually we know that we have no control because bad things happen, often things that have no apparent logic, things we spend time trying to fathom.When you have the noir fate, you end up with inhuman camera angles and lighting, because the narrative stance is half in our world and half in that world of the unknown beyond. I saw this on a double bill with 'Kiss Me Deadly.' Now that's noir. So far as jilted clarity, this is a walk in the park.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>
