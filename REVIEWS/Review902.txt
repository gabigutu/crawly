		<shortDescription>Horrible movie, full of clichés.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a complete waste fo time. Here are the main reasons:1. The performance by the main characters was very poor and artificial. 2. The director did a bad job, as did the editor. 3. The main story is weak and uninspired. There are clichés all over the place. Dialogue is poor and boring. The whole story is completely dubious and it is hard to take the movie seriously. 4. Historically speaking, the film sacrifices the real events that occurred for the sake of extra special effects. The fact that two cities were destroyed before anything got to Pompeii is ignored completely. The 'fire rain' on Pompeii also never happened, as did the tsunami. It simply made no sense to add everything but the kitchen sink into this movie. 'The Gladiator' was fictional, but it never claimed to be anything else. This film claims to be based on real events, when it clearly isn't in the most important aspects of what happened that day. In Pompeii, people died because they inhaled the smoke, not because fire rained down on them or tsunamis washed them away. The arena (stadium) was never destroyed by the earhquake and it still stands in Pompeii to this day. Dubious to the extreme.Overall very very poor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It all depends on your attitude</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can take this movie from two different sides.As somebody who is very much interested in history and geography and has studied both for many years, this movie is obviously full of mistakes and wrong stereotypes. It is almost as inaccurate as the "Spartacus" series. And this is never an original movie. We have all watched movies with very similar story lines about the evil Romans who want to control everything, the poor gladiators who stand up against them and the forbidden love between a rich young woman and a foreign slave. I can understand why many people are rating this film down. If you really want to watch a sophisticated movie about that time, go for the classic "Ben- Hur".What I think is strange is that all these stereotypes were highly predictable from the trailers only. I am asking myself why people even went to watch this movie if they were going to hate it for the reasons mentioned above. Some people just want to bash a movie and seem to have a very sad life if they waste their time watching movie they dislike so much.I went to watch the movie for something different. I wanted to watch a colourful movie with impressive sets and costumes and stunning 3D effects of an exploding volcano. I was eager to watch a fast pace flick with a lot of fighting scenes, some tension here and there and maybe a few love scenes with beautiful actresses. And I exactly got that. In addition to this, the acting was just good enough and included a few interesting characters. I really liked Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Jessica Lucas in this film even though they played stereotypical characters and could have had more screening time. If you are going to watch this movie for Carrie-Anne Moss or Kiefer Sutherland, please do not. They have been much better in other movies in the past.In the end, it all depends on you. If you want to watch an original and profound movie and learn something about the Roman Empire, just forget it. If you want to watch a effect ridden action adventure, you are going to like this. It is not the movie of the year but I surely had a great time watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3D first, Movie second</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Pompeii was obviously thought-up and directed around the 3D effects. The plot, acting, and script must have all been after-thoughts to the 3D fireballs shooting off the screen, 3D ashes floating in front of your eyes, and the 3D objects being hurled around by tidal waves.It was watchable, but don't be expecting a fabulous plot that you haven't seen dozens of times in other better movies. The bad writing had most of the actors come off sounding like lifeless wooden statues that would say and do very unbelievable things just to keep the story going. Everything was very predictable. So predictable, in fact, there were a couple of moments I could have sworn I did see it before!This was a good example why I typically do no like 3D movies. Having some good 3D effects is not a valid excuse for making a bad movie!! This definitely could have been much better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a piece of crap wannabe blockbuster . If it was not by the fact I got free tickets for the premiere, I would be p***ed off to waste my money in vain. Well, my time was wasted anyway...The plot is the epitome of stupidity: shallow characters and a predictable story made me wonder what the director was thinking. The history of Pompeii and its fate was completely ignored (I have visited Pompeii myself) - the tsunami scene was only one of the non sense historical goofs. The movie end is absolutely stupid and I was relieved it finally ended. If you want to waste your time, this is the perfect opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Princess Bride, but played straight, with no self-awareness or humour. "My name is Milo. You killed my father. Prepare to die!".Avoid. The fight scenes are entertaining, but so prolonged that one is taken out of the movie to think "Yeah, but there's no way he'd be able to *keep* fighting for this long".The whole audience (in Paris) laughed at the final utterly ridiculous frames. This was meant to be poignant/heartbreaking - like Titanic. The audience by then just wanted it to be over.There are a few wooden performances, but I suspect it's hard not to be with this script and direction. Even so, Sutherland should be ashamed of his showing in this. He must just have been counting his pay the whole time.Also: 'Milo' the Celt ?? How about using Celtic name?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the disaster you may have heard the movie to be, this uneven mix of a disaster movie and a 'Gladiator' action-romance is great on the former and terrible on the latter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul W.S. Anderson has never been a director of story or character; instead, as he had demonstrated with five chapters of the 'Resident Evil' franchise, it's all about giving his audience the most bang for their buck with pure action spectacle. And just as he did with zombies previously, Anderson spares nothing in recreating the destruction of the ancient Italian city laid to waste by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 72, so rest assured that it does deliver genuine spectacle as it promises.The only catch? The volcano only erupts an hour into the movie, which also means that Anderson has to grapple with his twin Achilles' heels of story and character for that same duration. We won't kid you - the wait till fire and ash rains down from the legendary mountain is quite literally a slog. The fault isn't entirely Anderson's; though the leaden direction is to blame for the cliché-ridden melodrama, it is the screenwriters Michael Robert Johnson (Sherlock Holmes), Janet Scott Batchler and Lee Batchler (Batman Forever) who are responsible for the utterly pedestrian script and some truly cringe-worthy dialogue.What they have done essentially is to take a gladiator drama and throw in a 'rich girl/ poor boy' romance in the vein of 'Titanic' as a pretext for the inevitable eruption, with the former relatively more fleshed out than the latter. To set the stage, we see a young Celtic boy watching his parents being murdered by the ruthless Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) and his top soldier Proculus (Sasha Roiz), both Roman guards whom you know the same older boy will come face to face with later on. Fast forward to seventeen years later and the boy named Milo has developed into a strapping gladiator known as 'The Celt', picked out amidst a grubby Londinium arena for the big league in Pompeii.Milo's meet-cute with his romantic interest Cassia (Emily Browning) happens en route to Pompeii, when the latter's carriage becomes stuck in the mud and causes one of her horses to suffer a severe fall. In an act of kindness, Milo kills the horse with his bare hands to put him out of its misery, and immediately earns Cassia's fondness. Back in Pompeii, Cassia's father Severus (Jared Harris) and mother (Carrie Anne-Moss) play host to Corvus and his Roman entourage, whose favour they depend on to fund their plan to revitalise the city by building aqueducts. Turns out however that Corvus is only doing so to force Cassia's hand in marriage, whom he unsuccessfully courted while the latter was still back in Rome.In the meantime, Milo forges an acquaintance with Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), one of the fiercest fighters who is according to the law just one fight away from earning his freedom. Needless to say, Atticus soon finds that his masters have no intention of honouring the law, and instead of being opponents, Milo and Atticus team up to rebel against their captors. All this culminates in a nicely shot showdown in the town's coliseum, where Milo and Atticus take on an entire Roman battalion in order to simulate Corvus' invasion of the Celtic homeland.From that time on, Anderson's best instincts as a filmmaker take over, injecting the moribund proceedings with a much-needed shot of life that immediately jolts his viewer out of his seat. The sight of Vesuvius starting to boil over is a truly humbling one, even more so when it starts to rain fire, rock and lava down on the hapless citizens of Pompeii, not excluding our protagonists. Anderson skilfully cuts between wide shots offering birds-eye views of the scale of the devastation and close-ups of the disaster from the point of view of its victims, and it is to his credit - as well as that of his cinematographer Glen MacPherson and VFX supervisor Dennis Berardi - that we are simply and surely transfixed.Lest you think it's all about the volcano, well the calamity turns out to be much more multi-faceted. Besides watching out for fire and rock from above, those looking for a way out of Pompeii are also either swallowed into the ground as the earth underneath them collapses or are swept away by an enormous tsunami precipitated by the tectonic forces causing the same eruption. As if that weren't enough, our star-crossed lovers also have to contend with Corvus' relentless pursuit, while Atticus proves a more than worthy ally against Proculus. Anderson channels his best inner Roland Emmerich to ensure that his disaster movie never has a boring moment once nature's tragedy strikes, and let's just say the last 45 mins is tense and exciting stuff.Even so, Anderson threatens to be undone by a perennially weak link in his movie, and that is the quality of the acting. 'Game of Thrones' star Kit Harrington is no less wooden than he was in the HBO miniseries, and there is almost zero chemistry between him and 'Sucker Punch' actress Emily Browning. Though '24' star Kiefer Sutherland looks out of place in a sword and scandal epic like this, he proves more entertaining than our leads in a borderline campy manner. The best of the lot is without a doubt Adewale, who brings unexpected dignity and gravitas to his role in a movie that generally demands much less from its performers.But really, one should not expect differently from 'Pompeii', which as we said at the beginning is no more than an opportunity for Anderson to leverage on historical events to deliver an action-filled disaster movie packed with visual spectacle. As long as you can get past that first hour, the prolonged cataclysmic climax will grip, astound and awe you - and since this is meant to be a disaster movie first and an action- romance second, the priorities are just right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Eye Candy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's pretty much impossible to say that "Pompeii" is a flawless film. It's love story is clichéd and and its lighting at times leaves much to be desired. On the other hand, I believe the term "guilty pleasure" fits perfectly here, as I certainly enjoyed this movie enough to recommend it. "Pompeii" tells the story of the legendary natural disaster that covered the Italian city of Pompeii and its residents in ashes, preserving their bodies for eternity. Like "Titanic," "Pompeii" mixes in a star-crossed lovers story into the disaster genre. Following the rich- girl-loves-poor-boy trope, a wealthy woman named Cassia (played by Emily Browning of "Sucker Punch") falls in love with an enslaved gladiator named Milo (played by Kit Harrington of "Game of Thrones"). When Pompeii's volcano erupts, it is up to Milo to save Cassia from being left to die in the eruption (there is more to the story but I don't want to give anything away).Admittedly, the love story is by far less convincing than the one in Titanic. The two leads Cassia and Milo spend a bare minimum of time getting to know each other and their relationship lacks development. However, in a disaster movie that focuses more on providing audience- pleasing thrills, this is much less of a problem than it could have been.On the contrary, Milo's relationship with a fellow slave named Atticus (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje of "Thor: The Dark World") is surprisingly well developed throughout the film. In the first act, Milo learns that he must face Atticus, a man who has been promised freedom after one more battle. Several scenes of dialogue in a prison cell and action in the arena they are forced to fight in give the audience a good feel for who these characters are and give a good enough reason to root for them. Considering that this is a disaster movie made by Paul W.S. Anderson, both characters have a substantial amount of substance to them, and the actors give good enough performances to make their friendship believable. On the subject of Mr. Anderson, I have never really been a fan of his work. "The Three Musketeers" was mediocre at best and his "Resident Evil" movies are absolutely dreadful. Here he seems to have improved his ability to tell a story, though there are a few flaws here and there that carry over from his other works. Much like "Alien vs. Predator," Anderson struggles to properly light a few nighttime scenes, casting what could have been a great looking shot into 50% blackness. In addition, his editing can occasionally be choppy, but compared to something like "I, Frankenstein," it's nowhere near as jarring. To his credit, which I believe is often overlooked, Mr. Anderson certainly knows how to stage and take advantage of an action setpiece. One scene involving gladiators fighting soldiers chained to a spiked pillar made full use of its environment, and will likely have audiences entertained. Something else worth nothing are the special effects; they are very well done and it is clear that the VFX team put a lot of effort into bringing the legendary eruption of Mt. Vesuvias to the big screen. What's even better is the 3D; lately 3D has been sorely mediocre in Hollywood films, but in this case it is very effective. From volcanic ashes to falling beams of wood, "Pompeii" succeeds in taking full advantage of the 3D technology with stunning results. The last act of the film is among one of the most thrilling disaster scenes I have ever scene in recent years. Fans of disaster movies will likely be pleased by all of the mindless carnage and destruction, and like "2012," the visual grandeur is seat-grippingly epic."Pompeii" is nowhere near a high-quality film, nor is it free from typical Hollywood clichés. However, this was not a film that left me feeling insulted or just jaded. Rather, this was actually a memorable disaster/action period piece that I could easily recommend taking some friends to see. The experience alone is pretty damn cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got dragged to see this. I knew it was going to suck. It sucked in a "it's so bad it's good" kind of way. I was never bored. Mostly laughing and saying, "You know nothing John Snow."But you know a movie is bad when it ends with a scene that is supposed to be emotional and tragic, and the whole theater bursts out laughing.I feel like there's no point in me going over how poorly written the characters were, because I'm sure everyone else has already done that. The romance was extremely random. It's like they didn't even care about the story.To be fair, the visual effects were great, but really, today there are so many movies with great visuals, this one does nothing new. Although it turns out that the filmmakers did their research for this film and the set designs and the eruption were very true to fact (except for the lava bombs and the tsunami) and even the ash-figures we see at the end were based on (stress on based on) actual figures that were discovered. So that raises the film a bit in my respect.Also,Atticus: Which bastard will be the one I kill today? Me: Ned Stark's bastard.Sorry. :P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review at IMDb, and I cannot withstand from warning the people reading the reviews: this movie is very bad. If I could give a zero, I'd do that. I've read so many reviews that really helped me a lot to choose the movie I'd like to watch. Pompeii (2014) is one of a few movies I didn't inspect properly before watching. And that was a big mistake. This movie has no sense, no story, actions are amateurish, emotions are artificial, dialogues are brainless. We laughed a lot during the movie on how stupid many scenes and dialogues could be. Paul Anderson should really retire. I read his books and I liked them, but as a movie director, I'm sorry it's probably not for him. After two hours watching this movie and after the last sequence of scenes, I really wonder what all that was about? Even if considering a love genre, this movie doesn't belong to it either. Love between the main characters was very funny and superficial. Please, don't waste your time on this movie. It's completely worthless.P.S. By the way, the volcano eruption was so funny. Most of the time it shoot fire bombs instead of producing lava. And the shoots were really bully. I think Paul Anderson took this from Starship Troopers where the huge alien insects shoot the similar bombs in space.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pompeii" is cheesy and okay. Just okay. The special effects are good enough, and the cast is very good, so it could have been a much better film than it is. Ooooh well. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje stood out for me as Atticus a noble, undefeated gladiator. I couldn't help but think that this guy should be a bigger star, and that perhaps his difficult name stood in his way. Kit Harington is charismatic and believable as Milo, a sensitive, horse- loving Celt who is forced to fight as a gladiator. He charms Cassia, a rich Roman girl (Emily Browning) and their love is believable. Kiefer Sutherland is an evil Roman Senator. Sutherland camps it up, doing a Boris Karloff imitation throughout the film. Not sure why he picked Karloff; perhaps just to see if anyone would notice. Sasha Roiz, who is from Israel, has a face, head and hair right off of a Roman mosaic, and he's good as yet another sadistic Roman officer, Sutherland's right-hand man. This movie is obviously thrown together with little thought or heart, and it's a shame that more was not done with it. There's a scene where Milo and Cassia escape on horseback. That scene could have been classic ? you've got a handsome slave who faces nothing but death in the arena, a beautiful maiden being menaced by a predatory Roman senator, and a nighttime escape on a gorgeous white horse: so much to work with! Instead their escape is just plopped on screen with no artistry at all. You're watching a rehearsal, not a real movie. Special effects include aerial views of ancient Pompeii, earthquakes, cracking villas, sinkholes, volcanic eruption, and a tsunami. These are all okay, but I bet you could see equally good footage, if not better, on televised nature documentaries. There is lots of gladiatorial combat. I'm not qualified to judge these scenes. I usually squint my eyes and grimace throughout them and I have no idea how accurate they are. Somehow the consistency with which Milo and Atticus are able to defeat many more, and better armored opponents didn't convince me. While watching this movie I couldn't help but reflect on Cecil-B- Demille-style sword and sandal movies from the fifties and early sixties. Those movies had special effects, but they also focused on gripping storytelling, larger than life stars like Charlton Heston, Yul Brynner, and Richard Burton, and they had some larger point. Even without the CGI, those movies were often more satisfying than more recent films who sink everything in special effects and ignore more old fashioned storytelling craft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How to waste a 100 million dollar budget:1. Ignore history completely because you're sure your audience is stupid and won't notice. 2. Make sure all the gladiators look like steroid refugees from a West Hollywood gym. Amp up the homo-eroticism with lots of oiled pectorals and a weird "bromance" between not only two gladiators but the evil Roman senator and his faithful-unto-death boyfriend / bodyguard. 3. Create a paper-thin romance between a slave and a noble lady that's laughably unconvincing because they have about twenty lines of dialog between them. 4. Give the slave killer abs and the ability to whisper sweet nothings to horses so that they'll calm down while a volcano explodes. 5. Include every freaking cliché from every disaster movie ever made. Make sure the noble black slave runs back to save that child who fell down and is being trampled. 7. Throw giant hot rocks at the audience via 3D. 8. Include a tidal wave! 9. Make the audience wonder where all the Pompeiians went during the last twenty minutes of the movie. Suddenly they all vanish. 10. Give Kiefer Sutherland lots of close-ups of his false teeth. 11. Burn up everyone as prettily as possible. 12. Run away from lawsuits and copyright infringement because your screenwriters ripped off "Gladiator" and "Titanic".Luckily, Vesuvius only destroyed Pompeii once, so there can't be a sequel...but don't count on it. Hollywood is probably doing post-production on "Return to Pompeii" right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst films i have ever seen. A rehash of Conan and Gladiator. Good guy Celts are slaughtered by bad guy Romans led by Bad Actor Kiefer Sutherland. A little boy is the lone survivor. Taken to Londonium [ London ] and trained to become a Gladiator. Conan. He is so good, he is sent to Pompeii to fight in the arena. On the way he comes across a damsel in distress and helps her with her wounded horse. Love at first sight. A Roman legion arrives led by guess who? yes bad guy Kiefer Sutherland. Good guy Gladiator wants revenge. Bad guy Kiefer Sutherland has his eye on the damsel in distress, who happens to be the daughter of the headman of Pompeii, but she is in love with good guy Gladiator. Gladiators in Pompeii were the celebrities of the period. Not held in dungeons like in this movie. Also the citizens of Pompeii were Romans themselves,also unlike in this movie. I won't continue with the rest of the story, as i think you should see for yourselves. The acting was terrible, especially by Sutherland. He started with an American accent and then later an English accent. The bad guy characters were like something from an English school Pantomime. As for the disaster itself. Even with the 3d effects, it was not edge of the seat stuff. Unlike Titanic. The story in Titanic was a romance around a disaster, but without the 3d effects, you were glued to the screen. All you see as soon as the eruption comes burning rocks raining down, nothing else. Also it shows people panicking straight away, which is nonsense, because as i was told by the guide, when i visited Pompei, the populace had no idea of what was happening and just stood and watched until the lava started to flow down and even then, they tried to save their belongings. That is why so many perished and also why Versuvius was mistaken for a mountain and there is no word for Vulcanoe in Latin. Also once the smoke connected to to the sky, light pebbles rained down on the city. So for a while, they thought there was no danger. Hollywood has gone downhill in the last 20 years. They blame DVDs for people not going to the cinema, so they make more films in 3d.The standard of acting has gone downhill. There are no stories to their films any more, so they put all these effects in to compensate for this. If you want to see a good DVD about Pompei buy the DVD BBC documentary drama with Tim Piggot Smith called Pompeii The Last Day. On with it is the story about the Colosseum, called Colosseum A Gladiators Story.If you want to see a good fictional story centering around the disaster, get the TV Miniseries The Last Days Of Pompeii starring Lawrence Olivier, Anthony Quayle, Ernest Borgnine, Barbera Carrera and a host of others. I hope i have not bored you with this review, but i don't like to waste money and i am sure you don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>at how incredibly awful 'Pompeii' was. Sheesh, it was such a cheap rip Ripoff of 'Gladiator.' It seems as if Hollywood assumes the 14 to 24 year old kids have never heard of or seen 'Gladiator.' So they do a cheap "Cliff Notes" version of it.But in the new extremely dumbed down version, they start with the scene in Morocco where Russell Crowe kicks butt in the arena.Then they introduce the "high class" girl that falls in love with the cute slave guy.Then they veer off into the teen soap opera BS.Good God Man!!!! The hero and the African gladiator start off as enemies. But what do you know? After the little cute guy Orlando Bloom look a like that is 5 foot 4 earns his respect, they become best friends. Who could have predicted that? It's a cotton candy film with bad CGI. Pathetic really.If they had wanted to make a good film, they'd of had the volcano erupt at the beginning and made it 'Pompeii, Zombie Apocalypse.' I would have watched that until the end, unlike this piece of trash.Oh, my cat that was sitting next to me told me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Canada should really stop making movies. This was a shockingly poor affair. A big budget and some good actors does not make up for a feeble script, confused and muddled plot, limited characterisation, totally inaccurate history for a historical film, and a surfeit of political correctness.Like most Hollywood epics, the Roman Empire's heart seems to be in Britain. And that was where this film commenced. But it was nothing like the real Britannia. A clichéd damp English weather, and assorted rebelling "horse tribes". A pointless massacre of said rebels, and a boy left inexplicably alive. This was apparently a major military campaign to "open the Northern trade routes". Sounds more like a amateur attempt to paint Romans as evil from the outset, and set up a revenge sub-plot. A child could come up with a better plot.The mysterious "Celt", having survived against the odds becomes not a horseman like his father, but a gladiator. Having overcome all competitors in Britain, he is sent not to Rome but to Pompeii.This Pompeii is nothing like the real city. Its residents do not regard themselves as Roman. Odd that, as Pompeii was part of the Empire, its citizens were Roman citizens, and the city was a Roman resort. Rather like the citizens of Bournemouth hating Londoners and not regarding themselves as British.Pompeii is dominated by a huge active volcano, which disturbs the locals from time to time. The real volcano looks only half the size (I have been in Pompeii) and it was not known to be active until the eruption itself.I know modern audiences like gladiators, almost as much as Romans did. But what is entirely omitted from the movie is that gladiators were part of a religious rite, and that the fighting was both drama and intended to honour the Gods. Real gladiatorial combat did not always result in death. In fact gladiators were too valuable to kill swiftly. Most combat during the course of the day was not lethal. This movie represents gladiatorial combat as simply a form of mass murder, as brutal and swift as possible. Dozens killed in minutes. Even during the most costly games in Rome itself gladiators were not "used up" so swiftly.The eruption of Pompeii looked impressive, but was completely wrong. The real mountain released clouds of pyroclastic material that suffocated and buried thousands, and collapsed buildings. Rather like a build up of snow on buildings. Most residents escaped. In this version there was a preternaturally hot pyroclastic flow, incendiary missiles, tsunami and other mayhem. No one survived, and in fact nothing of the city would have survived.Culturally the movie got it wrong too. Apart from the erroneous view of the city of Pompeii, the role of slaves was misrepresented. In this version of history they were either "animals" and treated as such, or friends and companions whose status was only shown by the use of "master" from time to time. No sign of manacles or of slaves being whipped, no sign of social classes at all.The young girl Cassia was for some unexplained reason sent to Rome to grow up, accompanied only by a slave. No chaperone, and no reason why a young girl would be parted from her parents. She returns only to avoid the snares of an evil senator. Convenient plot device, but highly improbable.The emperor Titus is implied to be a degenerate despot, uninterested in the cities of Italia, much less the Empire. The real Titus was a soldier, and a popular and good emperor.Many people do not believe that historical accuracy matters in a historical film. To a degree they are right. However history should not be changed unless it fulfills a purpose in the movie. The departures from historical accuracy in this film just make it confused, illogical and a bad film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 79 A.D., a Celtic tribe of horsemen is slaughtered by the Roman Senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland), his right-hand man Proculus (Sasha Roiz) and their army. The boy Milo is the only survivor that is captured later and sold as slave. Seventeen years later, the slave Milo (Kit Harington) turns into an invincible gladiator in a province and is brought to Pompeii to participate in the games in the arena. While walking to Pompeii, the noble Cassia (Emily Browning) and her chaperone Ariadne (Jessica Lucas) cross with the path of the slaves and Cassia is fascinated by Milo. He shares the cell of Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye- Agbaje), who is near to get his freedom depending on winning his last fight. Meanwhile Cassia meets her parents Severus (Jared Harris) and Aurelia (Carrie-Anne Moss) and learns that she has been betrothed to the corrupt Senator Corvus that is pressing her parents to marry her. During the games, the Mount Vesuvius erupts and Milos and his friend Atticus succeed to escape from the arena. But Milo wants to save his beloved Cassia in the middle of the chaos and the Romans. "Pompeii" is a full of action and dull romance in the tragic environment of the last days of Pompeii. Disaster movies were popular in the 70's ("Airport", "The Towering Inferno", and "Earthquake" among others) and Paul W.S. Anderson returns to the genre after "Titanic". The entertaining story is silly with poor lines and dialogs, but never boring. Kit Harington, the "Jon Snow" from "Games of Thrones", makes it worth to see at least on DVD. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Pompeia" ("Pompeii")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absurd and Ostentatious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The captions on the poster on Pompeii, reads "No Warning, No Escape" - a fair warning for audiences entering this mega-turd. A shiny Hollywood steamer, "Pompeii" is comically absurd. It is amongst the turkeys of movies for 2014. Director Paul W.S. Anderson is certainly more focused on look than substance, and the direction is egregiously poor - which follows in kind with poor acting. It is a shameless money-grab hardly worth the free library check-out. The storyline and look steals a good deal from the markedly better "Gladiator"; the other side of the story is a big, dumb D- quality effects disaster flick with the Mt Vesuvius volcano. The fact that characters are ignoring the pending doom is chief among it's inadequacies. Logic is thrown away in favor gloss. The music only added to the aburdity, blaring and grand amplifying the ridiculousness. I had heard from a co- worker that it was bad, and it was completely that. Not Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator Meets The Titanic... and sinks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having travelled to Pompeii, and very much enjoying history... I was looking forward to this movie. Plus, I'm a Game of Thrones fan and look forward to seeing some of these actors thrive on the big screen.At the 8min mark, "They call him the Celt". We see Milo nonchalantly enter the ring, cut up three gladiators, dump his sword, and walk nonchalantly out. I can't imagine very many gladiators actually wanted to be in the ring, but they way in which this is all done is a mirror image of... "They call him Spaniard". You guessed it... "Gladiator". The more I watched it, the more it seemed like a very cheap over-priced ripoff of a far superior film. Whether it be the writer, the producer, or the director... someone had to know they'd crossed the line into "Gladiator" at some point. Milo meets a seasoned gladiator who at first opposes him, but they become friends - kinda like Gladiator. They even re-enacted the Celtic rebellion and the Governor says, "I don't recall the battle going quite like this", just like the Emperor does in "Gladiator". To start this Celtic Rebellion re-enactment, Milo has the men form a line and raise their shields like Maximus does re-enacting the Battle of Carthage. And when the copycat couldn't get any worse... the governor, Keifer Sutherland, thrusts out his fist as the crowd chants "Live! Live! Live!", and he gets the thumbs up.There wasn't a shred of Pompeii in this film until the final 20mins. Sure, we saw hints of the earth trembling here and there. The whole Pompeii 'thing' seemed to be JUST a setup to payoff with the two lovers at the end, encrusted in ash for eternity.Poor films, are poor films, but at least the majority of them are original poor films - and we can commend the attempt at creativity. With "Pompeii"? Shame on you people. It's as if you flipped to Wikipedia to get the geography and a little history, watched Gladiator, and then studied the "Titanic" to see how to create tension in a 'no escape' environment.I wouldn't given the film a '5', but there is no excuse for blatantly ripping off at least one other film. I would've preferred a character flick. Show us the culture, the every day life, the people... FAIL!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minor flaws throughout, but otherwise a solid thrill...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would want to say that this film feels different, yet somehow it felt familiar. The film felt different thanks to the climactic volcanic eruption, which added an extra dimension to the final act, yet in every other minor plot detail, it felt as if I've seen the act many times before. Overall, though, it is a joy to watch, despite the minor flaws throughout the film. One strong point in which I enjoy the film were the action sequences, which mostly are very practical sword fights, that turns out to be quite fun and enjoyable with the fast &amp; swift hits. And then throughout the end, the suspense of the danger can be felt, which I attribute mostly to the decent soundtrack. Soundtracks which are supportive towards the appropriate situation is always a great thing to have. And while the visual effects were not perfect, it didn't really matter in terms of the overall experience. Yet the film is dragged down by minor flaws along the way. There was no humour in the mix, and while there is no deep emotional drama as well, at least I can still feel for the character. There are times where I felt that the scenes were not supposed to happen yet, although in the end, I could at least care about what's going to happen to these characters. And the closing scenes were too abrupt, where they could instead have added some finishing lines/quotes or maybe give some aftermath/future scenes. These minor details kind of let down what would otherwise be a solid thrilling disaster film. VERDICT: Good: Great action sequences, Decent soundtrack &amp; suspense Bad: No humour, Lack of emotional touches, Abrupt ending, (Minor flaws) SCORE: 7.0</fullReview>

The millions funded the creation of this trash were wasted. The purpose of the film was to show artificial digital effects, not so successful, and cruelty because this is the way to make money in our time. Cruel, mediocre, cliché' fairy-tale. By the way ? there were no black slaves in Pompeii. The director blindly followed the rule in Hollywood to put one black person in the main character at any cost, ignoring the content of the story. It is really pity to waste money for such a tasteless, incompetently created film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always been fascinated about the history of Pompeii. This movie totally ruined an event that was catastrophic and turned it into a boring story. It made the plight of slaves into a cliché. A ridiculous love story. And, the actual eruption into a blase event. The acting is horrible and you got the impression that the actors were doing it to just get a paycheck. The 1980's T.V miniseries The Last Days of Pompeii was done better. If you can't find that to watch go on Netflix and watch a documentary of Pompeii. You will enjoy it more so. Skip this one and if you did watch it try to forget it. It shouldn't be difficult.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dialogue &amp; acting - repackaged as old English (18th century) by Hollywood for it's lyrical movieness (and to fit Hollywood stereotyping). Acting was daytime soap TV level. Characters - noncreative, plug and play characters e.g. gladiators (one black &amp; soon to become friends with adversary - been done before); other gladiator sees parents die at Roman hands and is now old enough for revenge - also been done before; really bad Romans acting badly; aristocratic pretty daughter (still has 21st century make up, eye liner, etc.) falls for slave gladiator (of course). Action scenes - good gladiators defeat dozens of Romans as brunch (I was waiting for one hand tied behind the back and blindfolded but the writers copped out). CGI - flashes of CGI volcano every 5 to 10 minutes to remind us of what the movie is about. Familiar scenes of water rushing over the city - already used in many tsunami movies and is getting old. Looked like the same wave used in several Indian Ocean tsunami films recently, but not as well done as say in "The Impossible". Fireballs came off as comical fireworks effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disaster Movie ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why waste money on 3D when the characters and the story are 1D? What annoys me the most is that all those ravishing effects (and I didn't even see it in 3D) were spent on nothing. Pompeji and its destruction is such a great backdrop for drama, but here it was all sacrificed for a string of predictable clichés. While being excruciatingly bored during "Pompeji," my mind wandered back to "San Francisco" from 1936 with Jeanette MacDonald, Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy. By the time the earthquake struck near the end of that old film, I was so engrossed in the plot and the characters that I had almost forgotten about the disaster and didn't mind at all that it looked very much like what it was: a lot of papier-mâché. In "Pompeji," the plot and the characters were so tiresome that I was looking forward to Vesuvius putting an end to my sufferings. Notwithstanding the spectacular special effects, "Pompeji" is indeed a disaster movie but in the wrong sense of the word. The silliest stuff that ever I saw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Actually Good Disaster Movie That's Not A Disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pompeii is directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, and centers around the character of Milo, who is a man that stands against the Roman empire after he is put into slavery and becomes a gladiator in Pompeii. He befriends a fellow gladiator and slave Atticus, who helps him fight back against Rome and also ventures to save Cassia, who is to be married to Senator Corvis, a corrupt official.The movie is actually not as bad as i thought it was going to be. Sure, it is still not an award-winning masterpiece like Gladiator, but for a CG-filled action-fest about Pompeii, it actually worked well. The visual effects were very good (the effects that were made for 3D weren't as much), the musical score by Clinton Shorter was great (echoing the greatness of Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven and even Game of Thrones), and Anderson's directing, i personally would say is his best here. Now, the acting, i have mixed feelings for. Emily Browning was good as Cassia (nothing amazing), Kiefer Sutherland was great as an antagonist, and Kit Harrington was (sadly) not as good as he is in Game of Thrones, but still good. The show-stealer is Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Atticus, who is very similar to that of Djimon Hounsou in Gladiator, and for me, his performance brought tears.Pompeii is not a classic in any sort of way, but is one i would definitely see again and own when it's released on disc. I never would have thought this movie would be actually good, but i hope they have an extended cut for a disc release because they could have made the movie longer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hate Pompeii the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul W. S. Anderson, I really hate you.I have seen this movie last winter and oh my god what did I just watch? First off, who the hell thought it would be a good idea to have Paul W. S. Anderson as the director for Pompeii. He deserves to be fired.I don't see him as the director. I see Guillermo del Toro as the director for this movie, but not Paul W. S. Anderson. Now you wonder who the hell is Guillermo del Toro? He is the director that made Pacific Rim and that was awesome.This Pompeii movie was directed by Paul W. S. Anderson. The guy that did the Resident Evil movies, Mortal Kombat, Alien vs Predator, The Three Musketeers, and Soldier. The writer of the script for this movie really needs to be fired as well. Same whoever did the casting.Pompeii is just a combination of Gladiator, Titanic, Dante's Peak, Volcano, 2012, The Legend of Hercules, 10,000 BC, Romeo and Juliet, and may I need to go any further? Now that I made that list, let me give you a few minutes to let that sink in.Pompeii is basically about this slave turned Gladiator who was taken to Pompeii to fight. He kills Babydoll's horse to put it out of it's misery and she gets turned on by it. Does that make sense to you? Anyway, he befriends a gladiator named Atticus. This senator came to Pompeii to take control of the city and wants to marry Babydoll. Why the heck Kiefer Sutherland was cast as the Senator? He is not British nor he acts Roman. There were too many plots to follow. The characters are not interesting and boring. Kit Harrington acts just like Kristen Stewart. Imagine Bella Swan from the Twilight movies as a man. Disturbing right? Basically, Paul W. S. Anderson decided to cast very good actors and made them acted like there are just there for appearance. Really? No one was acting, that was how bad this was. The dialog was so bad that I wanted to vomit in the movie theater. Maybe vomit on Paul W. S. Anderson's shoes and see how he likes it.I was waiting for that volcano to blew up and destroy everything. And it did.This movie is 100 percent inaccurate. Here are my reasons, the eruption happened at 1pm at 79 AD; the eruption blanket the sky with ash and rained down tons of pumice; there were no volcanic bombs shooting out of the sky; most of the people were poisoned to death by the toxic gas from the pyroclastic flows at the other sides of the volcano; some people stayed thinking that it would be over within an hour; there were no tsumanies that destroyed the harbor of Pompeii; no one can survive a pyroclastic flow because it has an average temperature of 2000 degrees Fahrenheit; the bodies had been buried and their tissues rotted away leaving casts for archeologists to pour in plaster and dig them out and they are not mummies. I have been to Pompeii on my vacation many years ago and I have seen the bodies, I have seen the volcano, and I seen the famous buildings that were in textbooks. I know a lot about Pompeii and volcanoes because I have a BS in Geology and I can tell that movie is very offensive to the Geology world. It also made Dante's Peak a B+ movie. There is a BBC film called Pompeii: The Last Day where they reenacted that day of the eruption and it was based on the actual victims. It is on youtube and it is so much better. Another thing is that the movie has too much CGI, so many plots in one movie, too much 300 fighting, no accuracy, poor director, and there might be poor acting as well.Dante's peak by far is a better volcano disaster movie than Pompeii.I love geology and ancient history. I have been studying and researching that stuff ever since I was 9 years old. I got interested in volcano and Pompeii when I was in 4th grade in school. I have watched a series of documentaries about it. I love learning about it so much that I went to see the city itself and saw that volcano. I love Italy, I love Mt. Vesuvius, I love reading and learning about Pliny the Elder and Younger, I love Ancient History, I love Rome, I love Geology, I love Volcanoes, I love rocks, I LOVE ALL THAT STUFF!!! I just can't believe that Paul W.S. Anderson, the director of the resident evil movie taking one of my favorite stories and turning it into garbage.XXXX YOU PAUL W. S. ANDERSON!!!!!! XXXX YOU!!!!!!!!!!! I want to give this movie a zero out of five! Worse movie I have ever seen! I can't believe that Paul W. S. Anderson made it into a piece of XXXX! Paul W. S. Anderson, GO XXXX YOURSELF!!! Guillermo del Toro, I am begging you! Please make a Pompeii movie and make sure that it is better than Paul W. S. Anderson's Pompeii! If you want to make it based on Pompeii by Robert Harris, go ahead because that book was so much better than the movie! I just finished reading Pompeii by Robert Harris. I thought it was really good! The book did a great job portraying the image and scenery of Pompeii and around the Bay of Naples. I enjoyed it more than the movie. The book showed more of the activity of the volcano before it erupted. This story was more relevant to the event than the movie. That is the kind of movie they should have made.? If there are going to make another Pompeii movie, I know it would be better than Paul W. S. Anderson's.That is all I have to say! 0 out of 5!</fullReview>

John Snow ends up in an eighth kingdom, taking on and beating all comers, regardless of their size and, just like Kiefer in 24, absorbing endless punishment with no lasting effect apparent for his next fight. Where is truth in film nowadays? Like Orlando Bloom in Kingdom of Heaven, Kit Harrington lacks the machismo to make his character's role believable. He is not a Crowe (no pun intended for GoT fans) and certainly not a romantic lead. The acting is wooden, the script cliché ridden and dire, being a series of unlikely cameos interspersed with Saturday afternoon movie destruction. Go mow the grass instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, after watching "Pompeii," I think I will stick with the Doctor Who episode that shows that the Time Lord was responsible for the eruption of Vesuvius. Besides, I'm sure that one is a little more historically accurate?right? The Doctor is real, right? RIGHT?!?Anyway, the overall feeling I had with "Pompeii" was boredom?followed by a brief moment of excitement when the volcano exploded. But, in all honesty, that was the whole point of the film. Yes, Paul W.S. Anderson made it very clear that the film was all about the cliché disaster film ending and all hell breaking loose in a raging inferno of smoke and fire. How else would you explain the story that just lazily moves forward and performances that only see the bare minimum of dramatic expression (except for Kiefer Sutherland?that man was clearly having the time of his life in his role)? There's really nothing special about this one. The story feels like a watered-down "Gladiator" and the story was clearly just twirling its thumbs until it was time for Vesuvius to step up to the plate and knock it out of the park. And, while the eruption looks very good and these scenes are filled with all kinds of predictable excitement, the movie is still pretty forgettable and doesn't have anything going for it beyond a single sequence. The film should have been just a short adventure that just shows the mountain blowing a gasket?and it still probably would have had more compelling drama and better character development.Hi there! Feel like reading more of my rants, ramblings, geek references, bad jokes, and other movie reviews (including a more in-depth look at "Pompeii" and other films that are, thankfully, not directed by Paul W.S. Anderson)? If you said "yes," you can head on over to my blog; revronmovies.blogspot.com. If you said "no," that's okay and please don't hurt me. I'm weak and scared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator with pyrotechnics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most violent eruption of Vesuvius has inspired many depictions of the destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum. There are plenty of stories to be told in this event, the volcano undermines the Romans belief of their infallibility, and the eruption is spectacular.However, instead of focusing director Paul W.S. Anderson instead assembles a collection of television actors (Kit Harrington from Game of Thrones, Kiefer Sutherland from 24 and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje from Lost) to play out a dumbed down version of Gladiator.The first half of the film is desperately contrived; a slave witnesses his family killed by Romans, and years later encounters the man responsible in the arena of Pompeii. The derivative plot could be forgiven if the fight scenes were up to much, but they are edited so frenetically that it's impossible to keep track of what's going on. Even the death of one character in the arena is identical to that of the emperor's in Gladiator.On the plus side, the eruption itself is impressively handled, even if the 3D is not. The film is at most enjoyable when Vesuvius is bombarding Pompeii with huge igneous chunks of rock or smothering it with a pyroclastic surge. The tidal wave that sweeps back escaping ships is less convincing (particularly as no ships were discovered in the ruins).Spectacular though the eruption is, there is fatal lack of energy and storytelling, leaving Pompeii as a sword-and-sandals adventure is little more than a guilty pleasure.</fullReview>

Having that out of the way, everyone knows where this is going, so why watch it? Is it the 3D then? Maybe. I don't expect it to be the actors (even though you have Jack Bauer ... I mean Kiefer Southerland in it).The pretty young lady then, that must be it? No? The "Spartacus" (TV-show) inspired Gladiator sub-story, that must be it! Less bloody not as exciting. No can't be that either. The predictable story (apart from the volcano eruption at the end)? I guess if you want easy ... but to be serious for a second, the big draw can only be the special effects (though they haven't managed to put emotion into actors faces yet ... not believable ones at least).So if you're in for a "fun ride", you might feel comfortable, even with the paper thin story you get served, the family friendly love story, the "violence" and the Uber villain, who normally wouldn't spend 2 minutes of his 24 hours doing things like this ... your choice!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pompeii Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Thoughts: First off I am not even going to talk about the historical inaccuracies of this movie. For those that know me personally know that I have a love for Roman history. So I could spend a whole post talking about those inaccuracies or invite a good friend of mine who has done extensive research in this area but I won't do that. I am going to try to focus on the movie in general.So lets kick this off. This movie has been getting labeled "Titanic with a Volcano" and I have to say that is pretty damn accurate assessment for this movie. First and foremost we know that the volcano explodes we know that it killed nearly every person in the area, these are all facts so if you are going into this movie rooting for people to live you are going to be sadly disappointed.If you are going into this movie thinking that you are going to see a historical movie detailing the days leading up the the destruction of Pompeii you will also be disappointed. Pompeii and 99% of the citizens are only background noise for the story of Milo (Kit Harington) and Cassia (Emily Browning). Milo is the last of the Celtic Horse Men that got slaughtered by the Romans who were lead by Senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland). Milo survives but then gets picked up by slavers and of course gets trained up to be a gladiator and not just any gladiator but one of the best at least in Britannia and this leads to him getting sent to Pompeii for the games being held there. En route to Pompeii Milo helps out Cassia who is on her way back home from spending a year in Rome with her slave Ariadne (Jessica Lucas) and of course it is love at first site. And this is pretty much the whole movie, we flash back and forth between Milo preparing for the games that are happening within two days. Then we flash to Cassia who is dealing with her family and the unwanted attention of Senator Corvus who has designs of his own for Cassia and Pompeii. And when I say that is it that is it people this storyline is so thin and boring that they through some action into it to try to keep the mens attention throughout this movie but even that doesn't help it out.And sorry to tell you but this movie is PG ? 13 so if you are looking for eye candy moments you are not going to find them in here either. Their is no nudity or love scene to be had in this movie.And Paul W.S. Anderson wants to make sure you realize this movie is about the eruption of Mount Vesuvius so he gives you all these cut aways of the Volcano in the background so it never leaves your mind that no matter what happens in this story this volcano is going to blow up and bring everything crashing down on these people.My Recommendation: I really wish I could give you some positives in this movie but I can't. Maybe if you are looking for a mind numbing film with the bare minimum of action and love story then this might be for you. Or if your girl wants to see a semi romantic movie with a killer ending go for it but I for one can't warn you enough to not waste your money on this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review: Although the movie looked impressive, the acting is terrible and the storyline isn't much better. Right from the beginning, you know how the storyline is going to pan out and as soon as you see the erupting volcano, you know that Pompeii didn't stand a chance. On the plus side, it did look quite good, except for the terrible green screening at the end, but the director should have spent less time on the CGI and more time on getting some decent actors. The love story was really corny and I don't know how the leading characters thought that they could ride through lighting bolts and fire. The only actor that showed any professionalism was Kiefer Sunderland because the rest of the cast was pretty bad. I wouldn't totally blame the actors for there performances because the script was complete rubbish. Basically this is a bad attempt of a Gladiator/Spartacus type movie which was a total waste of time and money. Disappointing!&nbsp;Round-Up: This is the first leading role for Kit Harington who has become popular from his part in the Game Of Thrones. Personally I don't think that he is ready to play a leading role because he hasn't got that much screen charisma or wit. That's why movies like Gladiator and Spartacus really did work because Russell Crowe and Kirk Douglas are able to carry a whole film with ease. As for the annoying love interest, played by Emily Browning, I just thought that she was a bad choice by the director. For a $100 dollar movie, I was expecting some form of entertainment, but I just found the movie boring and way over the top.&nbsp;Budget: $100million Worldwide Gross: $108.5millionI recommend his movie to people who are into there historical epic movies about a man who becomes a Gladiator after losing his parents and ends up fighting for his freedom while a volcano is erupting. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>awful remake of "Gladianic".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is full of clich? and bad stereotypes. They could have told more about of a flourishing city/civilization; instead the decide to follow the same old story plots over and over again mixing a bad copy of the Gladiator that meets Titanic seasoned with the typical natural disaster movie. Stereotypes:-The good poor Celtic kid that get his family killed and village destroyed by the evil uncivilized Roman legions that enjoy exterminating tribes and peasants. -Any ancient Rome movie has to begin in rainy Britannia right? -Romans are depicted As Nazis. -The black man (gladiator) is the first to die. -The nanny of the rich dame (who's also dark) is the second to die. -The Evil Senator who also fights as a warrior that wants to marry the girl who of course fell in love with the gladiator from Britannia. -the city of Pompeii is not spectacular at all in some parts it even looks like it's made of plaster and carton boxes -the disaster is not even realistic: the city survived 2000 years because it was covered by dust and the temperature together with gases killed the entire population that didn't even had the time to realize what was happening; there were no scenes of assaulting ships, Tsunami or packing running citizens. (Romans soldiers are depicted again as The Nazis of the past killing civilians to get a place on the sailing ships).They could have told the story of a magnificent city and of one of the greatest and most advanced civilizations in history: with public baths, fast foods, theaters, aqueducts, sewers, universities, civil engineering, commerce and the most advanced law code of all.The only concept they should have borrowed from the Gladiator is: "...I've seen the rest of the world and is dark, cruel and brutal. Rome is the light.."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kit Harington, the brooding raven locked bastard son in Game of Thrones, brings his smolder to Paul WS Anderson's Roman disaster epic. He's was an orphaned child of Rome's brutality. Now older, with a major chip on his boulder-like deltoids he's a champ gladiator headed for destiny in the wrong city. One that's about to be ash-fired in a volcano pizza oven. Unfortunately that's about it. Rounded up, we have possibly fifteen minutes of Kit's sculpted abs, yum ladies, Kit's drilling glare and Kit in tunic riding a steed. Some fancy gladiatorial sword play and brilliant CGI of Vesuvius laying waste to the city - not much else. Oh there is some feeble sentiment about the corruption of Rome offered by a mollycoddled Cassia (Emily Browning), daughter of the keeper of the city of Pompeii. If its sword and sandal pathos you want, you could find more in Ridley Scott's arena sand - re-watch Gladiator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing bad reviews about this movie, I wasn't expecting much and I didn't gain much from it either. Kit Harington was the main reason I wanted to watch this as I love him in Game of Thrones but his character in this I found to be a little less convincing. The love story was like any other but there was no real connection between them and the ending was completely expected and came as no surprise. The movie should have made the love story better and concentrated on the volcano more. Overall I gave this a 4 as the story line was good, the a few of the action scenes were decent. The main reason for a 4 is Kit Harington. Without him it would have either been slightly better or a lot worse, depending on the actor. It had all the wrong focuses and I will not be watching it again in a hurry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah - the film includes a lot of stereotypes - but I don't care that much. The characters are also pretty unsurprising - as the plot. I care a bit.But being so lucky - against the eruptions of a volcano - and a natural disaster, which just plays so well to a plot and the story, this is definitely too much to take. I have to be honest - if they would have brought some mystique into it - where the gods are ruling... I wouldn't be that tough to rate. But the movie just isn't cohesive and is just too predictable and unbelievable.Thanks - but no thanks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One does not simply walk into Pompeii. Read the cast list. It is the best part of this entire film. From there it goes down hill faster than a pyroclastic flow. If you only expect a 60's styled B- movie gladiator Shake'n'Bake then you will thoroughly enjoy this film. However, unlike some really horrible movies out there, this one at least is not impossible to watch so don't pass this up if you have some time to kill. But when you do, suspend everything you have ever watched about real volcano eruptions we have witnessed in real time during the past 40 years. It is just a moderately interesting love story set amongst some Mordor-like CGI. And like the movie Titanic, we know how this story ends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They should've just called it Gladiatanic. Obviously.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is either a 1 out of 10. Or a 10. And I can't decide which.Firstly, for those people comparing it to Titanic and Gladiator... That's one of the main problems with this film. Or it is the stroke of genius that lifts this film out of obscurity.I wasn't primed with the Gladiator/Titanic idea before watching Pompeii, I hadn't read any reviews. But I soon thought of those two films as more likely source material for Pompeii than the writings of Pliny the Younger. And I can now see that I am not alone.Hence I shall now refer to this film as Gladiatanic.Now, I'm not going to be overly-critical of Gladiatanic for its historical inaccuracies. Those are merely superficial issues which arise from trying to put the historical gloss on what is a new and exciting cross-breed of film.The main problem is that if you were to take the film Gladiator and then try to crowbar in a love story and disaster, a la Titanic, there would just be too much going on unless you have a veritable genius in charge of script.I don't know why I'm talking about this idea hypothetically. That is actually what they've done here.Bad acting? Not really. The actors do remarkably well portraying completely unrealistic characters. I started to feel a bit sorry for them as they tried to remember at any given second whether they were pursuing revenge, love, freedom or survival.Good effects? Yeah, but they never feel realistic or perilous. But that may be because I couldn't bring myself to care about the main characters. I did try to care, I promise. But the poor sods never felt like anything other than meaningless puppets designed to act in whatever way required to bring about their ultimate fates.Gladiatanic does almost conjure up some really good imagery. Almost. Like the bit with a couple of bodies being slowly covered in ash. But it felt far too contrived to hit home.Bad script then? Well, perhaps. But, again, the problem is that there is simply too much going on and when you stop and think about any one thing, it seems just far too convenient for the purpose of the plot.I mean, take the scenes where Milo and Atticus become friends. The script isn't awful. But the whole time I'm wondering why on earth these two are bunking together when they are supposed to be fighting to the death the very next day.Yes, everything in movies is contrived. And you don't go to watch boring stories. So suspension of disbelief is not something I am incapable of. But there's only so much I can take and that example is a pretty small one.The main example of this overt contrivance is the main love triangle.He's a slave and she's a citizen who meet through a chance encounter? OK. Some senator from Rome is interested in her too? No problem. That senator happens to have murdered the slaves parents a long time ago in a foreign country? Erm, that's a bit convenient. And then the slave happens to annoy the senator without realising that the senator was the person who murdered his parents? Talk about unlucky...So, yeah, you start to notice the little things.The other thing about that triangle is the antagonism between Milo and Corvus. Does Milo act for revenge or love? It's never really clear - it is both in varying measure according to who is watching Gladiatanic. But it's not totally for love. And it's not totally for revenge.It's for lovenge.Gladiatanic is ultimately a very confused film, as you might expect it to be. I suspect it's because they've tried to please as many demographics as possible.And perhaps, being cynical, it works in that respect. This lovenge story has enough love to please those who want romance and enough revenge for those who want action. But you have to really really want it to be one of those things and not the other.And, quite frankly, it could easily be neither.I don't think Milo was that bothered about saving Cassia. I don't think he was that bothered about killing Corvus.And in the end it shows (SPOILER) 'cos he didn't actually do either.It's not surprising I'm confused about this film and what score to give it. As Pompeii, a love and revenge disaster action drama, it failed at the concept stage. For me, at least.As Gladiatanic, an existential lovenge story about the inability of men to multitask, it is an unmitigated triumph.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pompeii? the home of establishing shots and unnecessarily oiled up men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The special effects were good; the acting wasn't too bad but the film itself? stupid. I honestly believe that our protagonist Milo (played by Kit Harington) was one of the fastest and luckiest men to ever exist in the history of Pompeii; it could actually be the story of maybe one of the earliest versions of the Flash. Milo is somehow able to travel far distances in a mere matter of minutes, if only his horse Shadowfax (crap I mean Beaures) was as fast. He may also be the luckiest man alive as well! Decisions were made just in time for him to live, the ground stopped breaking and tumbling just before it was enough to make him fall and die, he was somehow not able to be hit by massive flying rocks and not fall from big earthquakes - that somehow are able to destroy building and arena's but not a human being- and yes, in the end he's also luckily able to kill the man who was running away with the girl he fell in love with and risked his life for -after a total amount of probably spending 10 minutes together- and who also killed his family, finally allowing his revenge. This film then ended perfectly, Atticus was able to die a free man after all his hardships, Milo had avenged his family and got to eventually kiss and be with the girl of his dreams right in front of impending doom whilst in his head was wishing? "By the old gods and the new?I wish I was Daenerys Targaryan". Performance wise Kit Harington was very good, the fight scenes were entertaining and well choreographed, I just feel sorry for Kit having to have his first real Hollywood solo appearance as Milo in this film. He really could have done a lot better. Still we at least know he worked very hard on his appearance, what with all the oil he was wearing, it's in fact pretty hard to miss.In summary, for a film with a very basic story line, simple minded and relatively boring characters, a whole lot of action whilst really knowing the ending anyway (we get reminded enough around every 10 minutes of the film) along with a whole load of beautiful scenery shown by a ridiculous amount of establishing shots so you can say "ooooooh so that's what Pompeii would have looked like" this is the film for you. But, if you want a film with more depth, detailed characters and a much more thought out storyline, look for the film Gladiator, I think Maximus Decimus Meridius would be slightly insulted and disappointed with this film. I mean seriously "are you not entertained?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Titanic" meets "Conan", with an iconic disaster thrown in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Oscar, it's time for some indulgence in guilty pleasure. "Pompeii" is actually quite decent pleasure. The fighting scenes are better crafted than most and the special effect at least passing grade. I am also grateful to the comforting words of a critic who confirms my suspicion that this one is not worth seeing in 3D.Not much needs to be added to the plot than what I alluded to in the summary line, so I'll go directly to the cast.As one critic aptly puts it, those who have watched "Game of thrones" need no introduction to Kit Harington, and those who haven't probably don't know him. I belong to the former category and I think he is very good here. Emily Browning I remember well from "Lemony Snicker's a series of unfortunate event" (2004) where at 15, she played a girl slightly younger. Not a conventional glamour beauty, she exudes her own special charm that comes with her vivid spirit. She is well cast as high-born Cassia.I must congratulate the movie makers for making history ? absolutely the most wasted star. I don't expect to see Carrie-Anne Moss in her Trinity's tight leather or gravity-defying movies but for the nothing part of Cassia's mother in "Pompeii", they could have cast the tea lady and not lose much. Ditto Jared Harris (Professor Moriarty to Robert Downey Jr) as the father. Keifer Sutherland will always have a special attraction for me as one star that I have seen live, on a production of "The Glass Menagerie" in Toronto's Royal Alex. He at least gets to do some standard main villain stuff here."Titanic" in my summary line, by the way, does not allude to its disaster which is, after all, substantially dwarfed by Vesuvius. The allusion, rather, is to the cross-class romance. In "Pompeii", however, not much time is given to developing the romance. Still, Harington and Browning work nicely together and are particularly good to look at in the riding scenes when she sits behind him with her arms around his waist. Somehow I like it better than "I jump, you jump". But that's just me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Did Not Upset Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm just in disbelief that it actually exists.I'll never understand why someone would make a film that 1) Is so dumbed down a 6 year old can easily follow it, 2) Is so dumbed down anyone over 11 will be insulted by it, yet 3) includes enough violence that you have to be 13 or older just to be allowed to watch it. What could possibly be going through the minds of the filmmakers?I'm well aware that sometimes movies are produced to capitalize on whatever is popular at the time. In this case, Kit Harrington is popular, period pieces are popular, especially those that include swords and armor, and gladiators are popular. And when it's one of those kinds of movies, the entire production process will be as rushed as possible because doing that saves money, and in the case of movies like those, making money is the ONLY thing that matters.But that's not what happened here. There simply isn't a point to making a film which has small children as its target audience, when small children aren't legally allowed to view it. It's completely possible to rush a film and churn out a stinker without dumbing it all the way down for the absolute lowest conceivable common denominator. That is something that is done intentionally.So it's not just a matter of poor execution, whether forced or otherwise. It's a mystery that will never be solved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and at least that was MEANT to be funny! Supposed to be an epic tale set around a major historical even... but seriously, this is nothing but a piece of over-hyped horrendous crap! The visuals of course are great but you just wish that they had taken 1% of the effect cost and spent it on plot writing. Even early Van Damme movies have deeper story lines than this epic mess, that has no idea what it wants to be, and ends up failing grossly as a disaster movie, as a gladiator movie, as a historical movie, as a love story, as a revenge flick and even as a simple action movie.Almost every single scene is absolutely ridiculous and unbelievable and many are downright laughable. There is little need to go through the "story" because it makes very little sense and character building is non-existent.I honestly cannot recall every seeing a movie containing this many clichés. It is really annoying considering the major budget but I strongly advise against anyone wasting their time on this - even out of curiosity.Peace!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been obsessed with Pompeii for a while, and I am a big fan of action movies, so I thought I would absolutely adore Pompeii the movie. There were so many things that were pretty awesome about this movie like the costumes, the scenery and the effects, and then some really bad things. The most horrendous atrocity in this movie was Sutherland's acting. First of all, he doesn't translate to historical pieces to start with (not his fault), so he should have never been casted. Second, his lines were delivered so awkwardly, you could hear the audience's confusion. Any emotion was drained out of every scene he was in. I think if Kiefer Sutherland was not in this movie, I could have overlooked most of the other issues, but he was in this movie, so here we go. Next off, there were many lines that just didn't work in the movie and they were forced into the movie for some odd reason and it was obvious (such as the "Why so serious" line). I also wish they changed the whole opening, rather than show Milo's background, which tired and overused, just introduce him as a gladiator of Pompeii and friends with Atticus. This would leave more time to build relationships within the city and not seem as crazy of reach that he would die for a girl he literally just met (he could have been in love with her for a while). Also, it would have been neat if they used some real life stories to make the movie more well rounded. And my last complaint/note, the audience shouldn't have to yell "Finally" for the action scenes of an action movie. Took too long to get to any real action. The could have had much more interesting gladiator scenes to add to the action, but they were all pretty flat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought I'd say this, especially after understanding the story, seeing the trailer and the bad ratings the movie got, but ? Pompeii really isn't that bad. If we also keep in mind that it was directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, who directed stuff like Alien vs. Predator and the Resident Evil movies, it might be even more surprising that this, mostly ignored and avoided, February release actually turned out to be fairly good. Of course, Pompeii is predictable and its many flaws will make you laugh quite often, but that shouldn't be a bad thing. Yes, the movie fails when it tries to create drama and the audience laughs instead, but at least it's not boring. It's just frustrating if you expect it to be historically accurate.Pompeii is about a Celt named Milo (Kit Harington), whose horsemen tribe is slaughtered by the Romans when he's very young and, left alone, is taken as slave by a group of men. First of all: you call an ancient Celt Milo? Seriously? Why can't people just google "ancient Celtic names", pick one from that list and avoid cutting such a poor figure? And yes, I am aware (and I already said) that this movie isn't historically accurate, but this thing with the name really bothered me. Anyway, as he grows up, Milo becomes a gladiator in ancient London, where the slave owner Graecus (Joe Pingue) sees him fight and decides to buy and take him to Pompeii. There Milo meets a rich patrician, Cassia (Emily Browning), by accident, and they fall in love instantly, but an evil and corrupt Senator (Kiefer Sutherland) wants to marry her instead.Many have noticed (as it's not really subtle) that Pompeii reminds of Titanic a lot. Just like in Titanic, here the disaster is just the background for a love story involving a rich girl and a poor boy who can't be together. The love between Milo and Cassia would have benefited from more screen time: it's difficult to believe in love at first sight if the first meeting lasts 2 minutes and only a few words are spoken, and two of them meet only once after that, before the volcano erupts. Also, since the movie is mostly about Milo and Cassia and their relationship, it's strange that much more time has been put into developing the relationship between cellmates and fellow gladiators ? Milo and Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Still, it was pretty well done, especially thanks to the good performances of the two actors.The rest of the cast was good, too, and none of the actors delivered a horrible performance. The main problem with this movie was the dialogue: very basic, repetitive, filled with clichés and oscillating between ridiculous and cringe worthy ? just like some scenes, that were supposed to be dramatic but left me laughing. The CGI was all right, and perhaps it's worth paying more to see Pompeii in 3D, since its focus is almost exclusively on action, but I can't really tell since I didn't see it in 3D. All in all, I'm not sure I'd recommend Pompeii. It's one of those movies you can watch on TV, one evening, if you have nothing better to do. It will entertain ? if you can withstand the bad dialogue and overall ridiculousness ? but won't teach you anything about the true tragedy and how it all really happened.Rating: 6/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly, this is not the full-out disaster you might have expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films have looked more terrible than Pompeii in the months leading up to its release. Its overblown, ridiculous poster - boy and girl kissing passionately as the world erupts in flame and fire around them - was matched only by its overblown, ridiculous trailer. Everything blows up! Everyone dies!! Nobody cares!!! And yet - against all odds - Pompeii isn't actually all that bad. In fact, it demonstrates more narrative complexity than anyone might dare to expect, paired with truly interesting characters who must live out their sombre fates in the boiling shadow of Mount Vesuvius.The film opens, of all places, in Ye Olde Britannia, where we witness the diabolical Senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) massacring a nomadic tribe of horsemen. Milo (Kit Harington of Game Of Thrones) is the sole survivor of the carnage, a wee lad who grows up to become a fierce, battle-ready slave. On his way to Pompeii to fight in its arena, he meets Lady Cassia (Emily Browning), a wealthy heiress who's returning from Rome, weary of the politics and men she has encountered there.Obligatory love story aside, Milo is also forced into a life-or-death situation with Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), an honourable black slave who's one death-match away from winning his freedom. As matters both personal and political swirl through Pompeii, the looming volcano - taking its name from Vulcan, the Roman god of fire - sends tiny shock- waves through the streets: a promise of the horror and destruction that will soon seal the city and its inhabitants into the very earth upon which they tread.The minor miracle of Pompeii is that it takes this faintly silly premise - the fact that Milo is a honest-to-god horse whisperer is an actual important plot point - and makes it work. Paul W.S. Anderson, director of schlocky, vaguely terrible films like Mortal Kombat, Alien Vs. Predator and Resident Evil, juggles character and action surprisingly well, allowing one to reinforce the other. The spiky, grudgingly respectful relationship that springs up between Milo and Atticus - two men who have every reason to loathe and resent each other, for one cannot live while the other survives - is particularly delightful. As they trade insults, threats and advice, the duo go from mortal enemies to something else entirely - and it's a wonderful transition to watch.Anderson even cooks up some great drama with his love story, which could easily have been a soppy, grossly under-written romance. The relationship itself boasts a fair few groan-worthy moments, due largely to Milo and Cassia forging a connection via her most favourite horse in the whole wide world. But what's considerably more intriguing about it is the political web that's woven around it: her parents (played in dignified, doomed fashion by Jared Harris and Carrie-Anne Moss) must negotiate with Corvus, the evil personification of a corrupt, greedy Rome. When Vesuvius blows, so too does the class system: the wealthy die as easily as the poor, and it's a point well-made as Pompeii shudders to pieces around and beneath its populace. Oddly enough, the film's cracks only become more evident when the literal fault-lines start to appear. As the volcano spews smoke, then bursts of lava and showers of ash, Pompeii becomes an enormous disaster epic that struggles mightily but ultimately fails to shrug off its mediocrity. The special effects are mostly good - there's a cracking moment when a ship crashes through a channel of houses - but, because the scale of the disaster is so terrifying, it's hard to take it seriously when characters stop in their tracks, engaging in dramatic confrontations and sword-fights rather than running for their lives.Even then, there's some perverse fun to be had in watching Milo's entire life boil down to one spectacular, ash-strewn battle with Corvus - it's blatantly and completely ridiculous, but this is the point when the brain you thought you had to switch off at the start of the film can take a nap. It certainly helps that, instead of cowering in the corner, whimpering or unconscious, Cassia leaps into the fray as well. In this day and age, we shouldn't have to single out a strong female character in an action-packed disaster epic - but, unfortunately, we must. Apart from a couple of damsel-in-distress scenes, Cassia is pleasingly spunky, running circles around Corvus at every available opportunity.The cast is mostly agreeable: Harington has a limited selection of facial expressions from which to choose, but he's suitably steely and noble as secret equestrian Milo. Browning is quite charming, and Sutherland has the time of his life as raving villain Corvus. But the real scene-stealer here is Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who plays the tragedy and triumph of Atticus so powerfully that he almost - almost - makes you believe it when he delivers a speech to an uncaring, unlistening... uh, volcano.Strictly speaking, Pompeii falls short on many counts. The ending of this slightly silly story is a foregone conclusion, and it's sometimes hard to care as these characters flounce about in the throes of their personal drama when chaos is about to, quite literally, explode all over them. But it's also unexpectedly entertaining: a guilty-pleasure film that's actually got quite a bit more going for it than its special effects.</fullReview>

One, Keifer Sutherland played a perfect bad guy, but he tried way to hard to have an accent and it didn't sound right.. Two, I wish Milo and Cassia could've gotten a little more time together. I hate crappy endings, even if I knew no one would survive in this movie... But to continue, I'm sure there were a lot of problems with this movie, but I loved every minute of it, and wished it was longer...

		<shortDescription>A colossal flop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A colossal flop" - not only serves as an assessment of this movie's performance at the box office but as a valid assessment of the movie's overall quality.With the exception of outstanding CGI, the plot, characters, acting and dialog are each seriously flawed. Intended tone filmed as a love story against the backdrop of a historic catastrophe, I have no doubt that this was patterned after the mega-success of "Titanic." As with Titanic, everyone knows the general story of the disaster so the ending cannot be a surprise. And as with Titanic, Pompeii tries to create a romance between an upper class woman and a man well beneath her standing. But unlike Titanic, there is no chemistry between the two romantic leads here, and there is no grand gesture of sacrifice which immortalizes the love story in our mind - and without these elements, the film is just another expensively filmed epic with nothing new to offer. Additionally, there are many historical inaccuracies regarding the volcano's eruption and the devastation of the city that the movie suffers from the attempted over-dramatization of already one of nature's most dramatic events.To see my other movie reviews, please visit:https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com</fullReview>

But it was epic every minute of watching that film was painful.The hole crew of the movie fail directors,editors,actors,writers, everybody did a bad job.The main story was so weak ,silly ,uninspired and cliché.The hole crew were so lazy that they did the movie "Gladiator" with vulcan.This is dull that you can't even take the movie seriously.This so boring and dumb that with every minute i are wondering why are you watching this movie.The actors were soo poor i can't even understand that maybe it's because of the plot but they did everything wrong the most important part of one movie the end they totally destroy it.When "John Snow" hug the girl and they get burned by the smoke that was epic i laugh my a** it's suppose to be tragedy and sadly but i told to my self "Is that the end is that really the end WOW that's stupid ...". If you are thinking to watch this movie just don't do it don't do this to your selfs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a stero-typical romance set in the destruction of Pompeii</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, Kit Harington is a rather petite fellow, to be playing a kick @ss gladiator. The casting was not good. And why did it seem like everyone was trying to pull off an English accent. That was the silliest part of all. But get past these major blemishes and you have a typical Hollywood romance.Milo's parents are killed by the evil Romans and he becomes a slave. He wins his way to Rome because he can easily kill gladiators 3 times his size. Then he's transferred to Pompeii and catches the eye of the Lady Cassia because he kills a horse. Keifer Sutherland plays the evil Roman senator whom still is mean after the volcano erupts. Of course Keifer uses evil tactics to get the hand of Cassia but before he take off with her, the volcano erupts. So you have the escaped gladiators, including Milo, whom must save Cassia before going to the harbor. But the harbor, gets wiped out but Milo still has Keifer to deal with. No one seems to care that lava and explosions are just happening everywhere. It's like I'm a Roman and you're a slave so we must fight.FINAL VERDICT: Silly accents, special effects, over the top love story, bad casting. It's one of those movies that people love because it's so bad. I say check it out, it makes for great background noise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A history lesson in CGI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little known fact is that, two thousand years ago, everything was computer generated. In ancient Rome computer generated people lived in computer generated buildings in computer generated cities set against computer generated back-drops. Or at least they did until computer generated disasters befell them.Or at least it seemed that way if you've just watched Pompeii. Wow, there's a lot of CGI in that film. But then that's the least if it's faults. I could have lived with the amount of computer generated sets if it wasn't for the fact that everything going on in front of it has been done to death a million times.Someone else described it as 'Titanic meets Gladiator.' If only, but I can sort of see where they're coming from. It's a completely factually inaccurate account of a British native (I call him 'Jon Snow' as I only know his 'Game of Thrones' character and he's basically the same surly loner) whose parents are killed by the (typically horrible) Romans and he's taken away to be trained as a gladiator for their savage amusement. On his way he just so happens to meet the one rich princess who falls instantly in love with him within ten seconds of their encounter. The only trouble is? she's only bequeathed to the evil Roman senator responsible for poor ol' Jon Snow's family's demise.I found it quite hard to believe that, after all this time, that plot line is still being used. It comes across like a Disney film with live actors (and much CGI scenery). It's not the actors' fault ? they've hardly been given an Oscar-worthy script to work with. The plot is predictable and the dialogue just about passable.But you're probably not watching it for its deep and meaningful plot line ? you just want to see things explode. And they do. But only really in the last twenty minutes. As in all the old accounts, Pompeii gets sacked and everything gets blown up, albeit here computers do the job of the real volcano etc. It's not that inspiring. If you're really looking for destruction, watch the Avengers or any other big budget film where a city gets destroyed in a PG sort of setting, meaning you hardly see any real death and destruction.However, despite Pompeii's many flaws (and I haven't even touched n Kiefer Sutherland's weird accent), it's not that bad. It's a film to watch and remove your brain. Just sit there and eat popcorn. If you're expecting something amazing then you're always going to be let-down. It's an average film, but if you set your sights low enough then you'll probably stay entertained for nearly two CGI hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great effects film, but poor on storyline and characters...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pompeii" is a rather dimwitted experience. The movie is sort of a mutant hybrid of "Gladiator" and "Volcano", and the end result is nowhere near as great as you would have initially hoped it would be.Let's break the story down, first there is the part that is basically a clone of "Gladiator", where the Romans kill Milo's family and entire people, and force the young boy into slavery, where he ends up becoming a gladiator with the might and ability to challenge the mightiest of Romans. Sure, cliché anyone? While this is essentially almost the same as "Gladiator", that part of the movie is actually good enough for what it is worth.Then a little over halfway through the movie, "Pompeii" takes a twist from being your average "Gladiator" clone and turns its heading towards a take on "Volcano". Again, this part of the movie actually is good, in fact it is the best part of the movie compared to the sappy "Gladiator" rip off.What makes "Pompeii" watchable is the effects that are brought to the screen during the natural disaster part of the movie. And they were great indeed, with the flooding, tsunami, exploding volcano, flaming meteoric rocks and pyroclastic cloud.As for the characters in the movie, well they were about as predictable and stereotypical as could be for a movie such as this. And you don't really invest anything into the characters, because they are wooden and one dimensional.The acting in the movie was adequate, given the limitations of the script and character development. But Kiefer Sutherland was really poorly cast for the role of Corvus. His acting is as forced, rigid and over-dramatic as that of Jeremy Irons, and it was like watching a parody of a Roman senator on the screen. Not the best move on the casting part.One of the better parts about "Pompeii" was the sets and wardrobe. The city of Pompeii looked really interesting and had a very realistic feel to it. But more impressively were the costumes, outfits and armors seen throughout the movie, especially that of the Roman legionnaires. I was blown away by their armors and gear.All in all, you know what you get here right from the very beginning, and there are no surprises or plot twists along the way, making "Pompeii" for a very streamlined and cruise-controlled movie experience. The ending to the movie, was at least better than if they had actually managed to outride the pyroclastic cloud."Pompeii" doesn't move any boundaries for the movie industry, nor does it bring about anything revolutionary or impressive. It is a mind dulling simplistic movie that is running on effects more than on storyline and characters.A mere 4 out of 10 stars from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Paul W.S. Anderson is basically a big budget Uwe Boll. You don't watch one of his films expecting anything but B-movie spectacle, and we certainly get that in 'Pompeii', a sword and sandal mash-up of other--better--films such as 'Gladiator' and 'Titanic'.'Game of Thrones' star Kit Harrington makes for a noble, but ultimately dull hero, and his lack of chemistry with co-star Emily Browning dooms the already thinly drawn love affair long before Mt. Vesuvius begins erupting. Kiefer Sutherland hams it up as the villain, but even that's not enough to breath any life into the story.'Pompeii' isn't terrible, but it's the sort of movie you watch only when every other option is exhausted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seems happy to tick the boxes without ever aspiring to do more than that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having spent a few weeks annoying my partner by muttering "you know nothing John Snow" every time we saw a billboard for this film, I thought I may as well give it some more of my time ? plus I do like Harrington as a presence, which is what it looked like his main thrust would be here. The narrative is in two parts and both of them are pretty generic fare. In the first we see Milo sold into local gladiatorial combat in London, where he impresses so much they ship him off to Pompeii to fight in front of larger crowds. Here he meets and (rapidly) woes the daughter of a wealthy man, Cassia, who just so happens to also have the attention of a Roman senator who, many years ago, also happened to be the Roman who led the slaughter of Milo's people. From here we see Milo (rapidly) win over the people but before the film can replicate the entire basic elements of Gladiator, Mount Vesuvius erupts seeing the city crumble while survival, revenge and love all flow together.While watching I did get the feeling that the film was pretty content to do the basics. It had enough budget to give the summer audience the bang for its buck that it wanted and it pegged a story around it that they knew would work since it more or less had already in Gladiator. On top of this it manages to take a very popular character from a very popular show and put him in the lead role. After this there is not much to do ? the film rushes through the basic plot steps, ticking boxes as it goes without really being too concerned about the details, which means none of it rings true ? perhaps if it had done it better the disaster-crossed lover thing would have meant more, but really it is never more than a plot device and everyone knows it. The tone of the film is all fine though, with entertaining swords action (even if it again rips off Gladiator) and decent enough effects to do the job even if it a passive affair to watch.Harrington really has little to do but be "Jon Snow offa da telly", which is what he is bringing along with his abs. He really has very few lines of dialogue but physically he is a good presence. Browning has zero chemistry with him though, but to be fair she seems disconnected from everything anyway. Sutherland hams it up without a care in the world and at least is funny albeit unintentionally. Akinnuoye-Agbaje is fun in a period-version of Adebisi. Harris is always welcome while Moss appears to have graduated from "hot love interest" into "hot mother role" ? and they say there are no good roles for women anymore. Generally the cast feel like the film ? happy to tick boxes, deliver what people expect in a siple and unfussy way but not make any effort beyond that.As such the end result is a rather empty film that doesn't bring too much to the table that you don't get in the poster. Harrington looks good, there is some decent action but the plot is familiar and lazy at the same time, meaning that you really don't ever care about any of it ? which the film is totally fine with as long as you've bought your ticket already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Spartacus meets Gladiator", and oh yeah there's a Volcano</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why would you completely change a story that was already so compelling and well known? And why would you avoid being at all historically accurate, and replace the majority of the story with one that is poorly written and directed, and containing characters and events that were never there? Toss in plenty of cheap dialog, and then at the end we'll do a volcano that does things completely differently than what actually happened. I suppose if you know absolutely nothing about Pompeii and Vesuvius then you might watch this movie and thing it was OK. But even then, it's only OK at best. But this is such a well know story these days, and the actual history was so well documented, I doubt there are too many people that could watch this and not notice some incredible inaccuracies. Then there's the fact that the real story is one that wrote itself - the actual events were far more compelling and gripping than the ones in this movie. So you have to ask - what were they thinking? A one hour show on the History Channel was far better, and more gripping. Pass on this one.</fullReview>

But bloody hell it was such a waste of time. And I learned one thing, never trust a guy with movie review who doesn't know what he is talking about!! Ending of the movie is absolutely stupid and I was relieved it ended finally and I laughed when it ended. If you want to waste your time, this is your opportunity. To be honest, the visual effects were good, but that doesn't change anything, when you have a poor story; but really, today there are so many movies with great visuals. Most of all they did not really care about the story.</fullReview>

It was lack performances of the lead-characters and none character development. It felt like they only focused on good-looking people then good actors. Very bad editor and special effects. What I didn't like that it was very short scenes. 10 minutes in the movies it was like 5 scenes that was 2 minutes long and that is so boring. It was to much cheesy-love-at-first-sight thing. They probably only had the boring love story so they could get more girls to watch the movie, but it was to no help when the movie turned out very bad. The whole Pompeii-drama, with the volcano and earthquake and that was just a short time in the movie. It was maybe only 1/5 of the movie and I think they should put more on the whole "destroying Pompeii" than on the love story that was to cheesy. You could predict the whole movie within 10 minutes in to the movie. No. This movie was just a waste of time and please don't watch it if you don't want to get enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow was this bad. It seems that Jon Snow has only one possible emotion a subtle emo-looking petulant scowl (just like in Game of Thrones)but his abs are in better shape here, though they do look like they could be plastic. Or CGI. Remember when everyone said the abs were CGI in 300? Sort of like that.Anyway it's no spoiler or anything but the big volcano erupts. And everyone runs toward the sea carrying a small canvas bag of something. I mean, everyone. They must have passed them out at Pompeii Disaster Central - get your canvas bag now and run to the sea everyone before you lie down and hold hands in the ashes that will be here for 2000 years!But then the harbor has issues, like the ocean recedes and turns into a big tidal wave! Oh no, head for the hills!I read somewhere this was in 3D which makes sense (since I watched it in 2D) why all this stuff was being thrust and flaming rocks were falling from the sky and they were flying right into the cameras.There is no plot, well OK, a feeble plot that seemed to take part of Gladiator and that Clive Owen version of King Arthur and that LA Volcano movie with Tommy Lee Jones and create a hella mashup with Jon Snow and Trinity in a bit part (I mean Trinity, from the Matrix - how long since she's been on-screen - in a word - whoa).She gets about the lamest death scene ever because the coliseum in Pompeii falls on her. Keifer Sutherland meanwhile, who seems to be wearing an ill-fitting set of false teeth is mugging around trying to be evil which fails miserably. Not for anything but even with his mugging and terrible bit of acting he still seems like he could bitch-slap Jon Snow into next week.Jon Snow is not much of a hero. He is a good fighter but it's a little hard to buy his baby face as the Harbinger Celt of Doom. His love interest (the girl who was in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events who seemed to finally grow into her lips)has nothing to do but cling to his abs (Thank you Jon Snow for rescuing me with your CGI abs)and then gets kidnapped by Keifer and driven in a chariot to where? He thinks he's going to outrun the volcano and get to Rome in a chariot? At one point there is mass destruction, the volcano is erupting and these two idiots are having a sword fight. What is the point of that? To die a couple of minutes sooner? I mean this is bad. I don't think I even made it to the end, or possibly I did but I can't remember. I did like Jon Snows abs. I think he will be very hot when he finishes growing up. Meanwhile I prefer keeping up with him on Game of Thrones where Jon Snow can be the moody, scowling bastard he is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roman pleasure suburb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pompeii may very well have earned the title as the first suburb albeit it was some miles from Rome, near where Naples is now. It was a pleasure city where the rich and powerful of Rome came to relax and indulge the vices. Being near Mount Versuvius it was warm there all the time with thermal like heat underground. But in 79 AD Versuvius erupted and the place was destroyed.If you're expecting to see something like a remake of The Last Days Of Pompeii I'd forget that notion. The last third of the film Pompeii comes down and Versuvius erupts with some nice computer graphic spectacle. But the plot is a skimpy one, about a slave boy turned gladiator and the patrician woman who thinks he's something special in those gladiator tights. Boy and girl are Kit Anderson and Emily Browning.Villain of the piece in a truly classic Snidely Whiplash is Kiefer Sutherland who chewed the scenery which is what you do when in a turkey. He's a corrupt Roman Senator who wants to take Browning back to Rome as a trophy wife. Not if our gladiator hero can help it. Then the volcano erupts and everybody's got bigger problems.You'll like the spectacle, but the story is a ball of corn.</fullReview>

Everyone has seen the events of pompeii on screen many times and hence the plot and ending are no surprise, so we must be entertained by only the visuals and some sort of love story. The acting and directing were mostly fine. Kit Harrington and Emily Browning were passable and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje put in a noteworthy performance. The visuals and effects were by far the best aspect and kept the film very watchable and enjoyable to an extent throughout. The script was poor and most of the usual disaster movie clichés appeared at some point or other but in no way was it as awful as in say, 2012.

		<fullReview>Hollywood deals with an ancient catastrophe.The above phrase contains all one needs to be aware with regards to Pompeii. Brilliant and breathtaking spectacle marred by superficial storyline.We live the last days of Pompeii leading to the eruption of Vesuvius. A slave arrives in town in order to fight for his life as part of a spectacle for a senator from Rome. He befriends another gladiator and the daughter of the town's governor falls for him.On the one hand, a great job has been done to escalate the audiences tension as we await for Armageddon to hit and the visual climax does not disappoint. The effects are spectacular and the destruction is displayed to its full core.Sadly, whilst these men who were treated like animals and were an object of sport for their slave owners had a chance to escape they put everything to jeopardy for a girl crush who was also part of the system that oppressed them. Had this been presented from the angle of a friendship between two men that were to fight one another to death it would have some resonance but for some cheesy romance it proved a major anticlimax in the otherwise impressive high point leading to sheer indifference as to whether any of them survived or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fans erupt, Pompeii is buried. It was a disaster movie, alright. It wasn't that good, but not the worst. It's watchable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pompeii had everything going for it. It was a great concept that hasn't been used for years. Sadly, the movie was a bit disappointing. It wasn't the worst Pax Romana or Volcano movie ever, but I really hope for a better movie. I wouldn't have mind, if the movie was based of the Robert Harris's novel Pompeii. At less, the Pliny the Younger quoted at the beginning of the film, would had made more sense. Honestly, I thought, at less what they could had done is add some of the real life accounts of people that was there into the fictionist story. Why quote Pliny the Younger if most of the audience have no clue, who he is? The producers could add him and his Uncle, Pliny the Elder. He was a key character in the story of Pompeii, yet he makes no appearance in the film. I found the characters in this film, one-dimensional characters including an unreasonable villain who just evil, because he just is, playing through a formulaic plot line. Directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, the movie is about a young man, Milo (Kit Harington of Games of Thrones fame), is the last surviving member of a Celts nomadic horsemen tribe that was wipe out by an evil Roman Senator named Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland). Escaping death, he only to find himself force as a slave and train as a Gladiator. When he finds himself in Pompeii, he strikes a romance with the lady Cassia (Emily Browning), only to find out, that Corvus has an eye on her as well. The movie is very similar to Ripley Scott's 2000's hit Gladiator to the point, that Milo got a black gladiator friend in Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). The only different is that the movie turns deadly with the eruption of the volcano Vesuvius. I'm not entirely certain as to how historically accurate the film is; I have seen the Pompeii ruins some years ago, and I don't think the film got it alright. Yes, the Festival of Vinalia was going on, but, it wasn't like Bloody Olympiads. The eruption last about three days, not 24 hours. Hints why records suggest many people escaped before the city was destroyed, most of those who died were probably killed by heat shock from the pyroclastic flows. Unlike Pompeii, when the pyroclastic surges hit Herculaneum, people there were instantly killed whereas most Pompeiians slowly suffocated, although some died instantly. The movie makes it seem like it all happen in an hour, and nobody survives. I love most of the action and the special effects in the movie, but gees? that's kinda a downer to invest into getting into a movie, only to have most of the character die. It was pretty pointless when you think about the corny depressing ending scene. The film poster pretty much spoils it. It's sucks more, that the movie doesn't give enough time, for us to enjoy Pompeii and its characters. We rarely see much of the city, beside one small scene where Cassia and her maid check out the street. We can't feel emotional to the people that die there or care much about the city with a short movie. Most of the film is play in the dark, where we can barely see anything. Darkness doesn't work well in 3D. Even in action scenes, we can barely see what is happening due to quick cuts and fast motion. It was so annoying. The CGI disaster part of the movie is nothing new. It looks like Roland Emmerich's 2012 in Ancient Rome. The acting in this movie is just awful. First off, Emily Browning can't put any emotion in any of her scenes. No sense of fear, remorse, or even a sign of caring is a bit off. Her character is just a Damsel in distress stereotype. Kit Harington is basically just Jon Snow in this movie. A slave since age 3, alone and horseless, hero still mastered his people's gift of horsemanship. Huh? Kit Harington can only show that he looks like Orlando Bloom and how to act uncomfortable. Kiefer Sutherland sounds like evil Peter O'Toole with a lisp. His over the top smugness is just laughable large hamming. He seem out of place jarring. Everybody play it with the Queen's Latin. Everyone speaks with a British accent except Atticus. The music and the imagery are the best from this film. The opening shot of the pre credits were pretty good. I did like the music score by Clinton Shorter. I think 2003's TV Movie, Pompeii: The Last Days probably did the movie concept better, but at less, this movie is better than 1959's The Last Days of Pompeii. Overall: Pompeii was full of clichés, lack of emotion, and miscast stars. The film isn't too bad. It can even be quite enjoyable if one doesn't expect too much.</fullReview>

Here's and actor comparison Gladiator vs Pompeii:- Russell Crowe = Kit Harrington (John Snow from Game of Thrones) - Joaquin Phoenix = Kiefer Sutherland - Oliver Reed = Joe PingueJust as the actors don't hold a candle to those in Gladiator, the fight scenes are a blow by blow replica - albeit on a smaller budget. They also copy key script lines from Gladiator but John Snow can't deliver them like Russell Crowe.At least we can all agree that we think Kiefer Sutherland is an idiot, and so we can hate the bad guy, just as we rallied against Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator.Because the acting is so wooden, they had to add in a bunch of special effects about earthquakes and volcanoes at the end.The only saving grace is they didn't have the music from Gladiator in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pompeii is wonderfully trashy, a 3D mash-up of all the gladiator movies you've seen and then some. Wearing its inspirations on its sleeve, the film is entirely predictable and derivative, but that doesn't mean that the film itself isn't any fun! Without giving too much away (as though the poster isn't obvious enough), I caught myself enjoying the film, feeling almost a little embarrassed as I chuckled at the melodramatic feel of the enterprise, watching the volcano erupt and wreak havoc as the film tried to make time for youthful love AND revenge. Kiefer Sutherland of 24 (and 1993's cinematic landmark Three Musketeers? No?) fame hams it up as the lead villain, a Roman senator named Corvus who loves to chew scenery and be despicably evil. Jon Sno-er, Kit Harington is perfectly serviceable as the lead, a rebellious and vengeful gladiator known as the Celt. His cheese-grater abs and smoldering looks at the female lead, Emily Browning (as Cassia, daughter of Pompeii's "ruler"), amount to a whole lot of nothing, however, as the film's prospective love story never really gets off the ground, with most of their romance conveyed through extended eye contact and longing looks. The rest of the supporting cast turns in acceptable performances with adequate deliveries of the corny, clichéd dialogue, with Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as the powerful, axe-wielding gladiator champion Atticus standing out from the rest of the pack. This is shallow fare, and if you go into the film expecting a cinematic wonder on par with, say, a Ben-Hur (OR pick an epic sword and sandals flick you love), you will be quite disappointed at the end result. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, known best for his work on the Resident Evil film franchise, is no maverick, though he seems to be knowingly shooting for a film on par with other guilty pleasures he has created (the first Resident Evil film, for example), striking an old-school feel that ensures he film has no aspirations for higher cinema "glory." The fight scenes are cut up a bit much, with editing ruining some of the impact of brutally quick swordplay making this a mostly bloodless affair, and the mostly humorless narrative never coalesces into a satisfying love story, but if you go into the film with adjusted expectations and leave your history lessons at the door, the blaring score, heated arena battles, and overwhelming, destructive CGI spectacle may just make you smile. It doesn't hurt if you want to see Jack Bauer and a Game of Thrones hero (and a volcano?!) square off either! The rating is: (a decidedly weak) 7!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as some would make out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read many very negative reviews for this film, and to be honest i'm a little confused. It is by no means the next 'Gladiator' but it is an entertaining telling of a true event that I for one, have never seen on screen. The movie set the scene of Pompeii very well. It looked like a cross between Rome and Sparta to me. The characters were all likable, and had their place in the narrative, but my main issue with the story was the classic 'Love Triangle'. I couldn't understand why a story of the famous Mount Vesuvius eruption in 79 A.D needed a sub-plot of a slave (Kit Harrington) who falls for a beautiful daughter of a wealthy merchant(Emily Browning), and ends up having to fight for her and his freedom against a corrupt Roman Senator (Keifer Sutherland).I guess you couldn't have a full movie about the eruption itself, but at the end of the day, that's all i was waiting to see. I didn't really care to much for what else was happening.When the mountain finally erupts it is spectacular. Pompeii is in deep sh*t. I liked the way the movie showed this, everyone just panicked, but there was no where to go...An entertaining end. Worth a rental in my opinion, and not really deserving of 1/10, 2/10 reviews!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>connierounsaville completely missed the point in my opinion. Those lines he's talking about were MEANT to be funny. And for every reason he disliked this movie, I liked it. I liked it because it was stupid and mindless, because the movie didn't care about being historically correct. It was just cool to see the special effect work their magic and the bad story take its course. Kiefer Sutherland saying that line that he wanted to invest, I loved that. But he didn't want to invest, he had other motives. I give it a 7, because it's great fun from start to finish, but also forgettable. I will not remember this movie in the years to come. And that's OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Explosively Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole town goes up in smoke!!! Gladiators galore!! A doomed romance!!! A great actor with a very strange affectation!!! This and more is part of the new disaster epic with plenty of sandals, muscle, and some cheesy dialog, but don't expect to leave the theater disappointed. I have seen worse come out last year and be praised to high heaven, and here is a movie that sets out to show us an interpretation of one of the most famous natural disasters in history and it delivers with plenty of fire, action, and some powerful special effects.We meet the Celtic Horse warrior in his childhood days when he is witness to the massacre that takes his parents and 99.9% of his village away. It's sort of a PG-13 version of the stuff we're used to seeing. The lines are marked, and on one side are the evil Roman soldiers, on the other the mythical gladiator. We know we'll see a match in the future.20 or so years later, the Festival of Vinalia is going on, and it is like Bloody Olympiads. Rabid audiences are there to see one monstrous warrior dispatch another, and over these festivities royalty and ambassadors from Rome come to be honoured. As deities are invoked to bless the festivities, something goes wrong with the communication, and the volcano decides to reactivate itself. Its task: to obliterate the famous town.People are soon avoiding fiery projectiles, plenty of poisonous fumes, cracks in the ground, earthquakes, treacherous soldiers, even a cool tsunami. One major character says: "it's the end of the world!" It might not be completely accurate, but it is pretty bad, and it's pretty entertaining, something that Irvin Allen used to bring back every other year. Some of the effects look quite CGI, but a few pieces are quite outstanding, and much of their success relies in some clever editing and sound effects.Be ready to enjoy a good old fashioned disaster, one that was meant to look like this. Not one that you was told was a cinematic gem was ended up being a total disappointing turkey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable...violence borders R territory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure what movies have to do to get an "R" rating nowadays but the violence in this movie certainly pushes some limits. I knew there would be a fair amount of swordplay but for a PG-13 rating it's quite violent. I'm a fan of disaster movies and I think for most people it will do just the trick for some great weekend movie fare.Along with the scenes of mayhem and destruction there is a clichéd love story intermixed. Some nice sword fighting with blood and brute fighting to the death. The movie seemed rather short to me or perhaps it was entertaining enough that I didn't notice the time passing by.Overall, a great disaster flick, not the best, a little too much CGI, but all in all definitely worth watching on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very satisfying disaster presentation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been trying to come up with a good reason as to why "Pompeii" should receive something less than a "10" but after giving much thought, I couldn't come up with anything. There wasn't anything about it I didn't like. You have to have your obligatory love story, with intrusion by the villain who wants to ruin everything so this must be expected. The acting was very descent and big name stars were not needed to carry it, though Kiefer Sutherland does play a convincing Roman senator, determined to take our Princess heroine back to Rome. She's not interested as she has the eye for "The Kelt", the gladiator who seems invincible and also determined to claim his love interest. All the while, the famous eruption is building and when all breaks lose, it's a feast for the eyes. The special effects crew deserves special credit for their work on "Pompeii". Some of the finest effects I've seen. Nothing hokey, just a good old fashioned disaster flick that leaves no room for cheesy humor. The movie wasn't overly long, running at about 1:45 hrs so things moved along at a good clip. I will not share the ending as you must see for yourself. All in all, I'm thrilled to have this on Blu Ray.</fullReview>

Hollywood filled this movie with nothing but pointless drama and was terribly directed and even worse written with lines and actions from the characters that didn't even begin to make logical sense... Wouldn't the roman politician have bribed her with marriage? *shakes head* Not that that part even came close to belonging in the film at all! Even the special effect of the volcano erupting was incorrect half the time! I could have written this better, had character development here and there of TOWNSFOLK and every day citizens, make you attached to them, then show the turmoil they went through trying to escape making you care about them rather than: Let's put a love story in with lame ass politics cross with gladiator fights and maybe then show 1/4 of the movie or less with the volcano erupting while continuing the pointless love triangle where the bad guy doesn't give up...

		<shortDescription>Should be awful but it works...for the most part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will make one thing explicitly clear about Pompeii, you CAN really enjoy yourself but you have to turn your brain off, sit back, get your popcorn ready and just have fun. Yes, its one of those movies. It isn't Gladiator, it isn't Titanic...its crazy, sappy, cheesy fun. My expectations for this were extremely high though the horde of bad reviews probably brought them down to a slightly more reasonable level. I kept trying to go see this and for one reason or another didn't get to so I was pretty excited to finally catch it on its last night at the local theatre. I didn't see it in 3D which is fine by me because 99.9% of the time I find this new 3D fad a complete waste though I can see in this film where they certainly made it a point to make sure it was 3D capable. As many other reviews have said, the film is a blend of ancient Roman gladiators and a disaster flick. Anyone who knows even the slightest bit of this story knows how its going to turn out. The story is decent, certainly entertaining enough, but so many of the characters and performances are downright cheesy. Fortunately sometimes campy can win you over and in this case I ended up enjoy it despite those performances or because of them in at least one case which I will mention shortly.Kit Harington is a relative newcomer and someone I wasn't familiar with. The work he put into his physical performance cannot go unnoticed because he looks incredible and his body is ripped. Fortunately for him he actually turns in a pretty darn good performance too as our hero. The character in many ways is almost a carbon copy of Russell Crowe's hero in Gladiator but Harington pulls it off and keeps your attention and I don't think this film will do much for his career but I think we will see him in something big eventually. Emily Browning also gives a pretty solid performance as the girl that falls in love with him. Their romance is a little rushed and very Titanic-esque but it isn't too rushed and makes sense and their chemistry is very good. Its not epic but it works. This is actually one of the better performances I've seen from Browning, especially lately. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje seems to be the one thing from this film that comes out unscathed by poor reviews and for good reason. He is mesmerizing and fantastic as slave-champion Atticus. In fact, this would have been a whole different level of film had he been the star. He absolutely steals every scene and is literally magnificent in an otherwise "okay" movie. The relationship between him and Harington drives this story to new heights. I adore Kiefer Sutherland and was excited that he was in this. He is the aforementioned "terrible" performance that I loved. He is beyond campy in this. His fake (and poor British accent) and he just looks awkward and out of place and yet he was an astoundingly evil villain. It was like a cartoon villain but a great one complete with one-liners and truly evil like glaring and cackling. He would have made an awesome 80's action villain. The rest of the cast were mostly filler and some did better than others. Jared Harris was good in a small role as Browning's protective father whereas Carrie-Anne Moss was atrocious as her mother in a thankfully small role.I am a big fan of the Resident Evil Series and there is no doubt that Paul WS Anderson loves to balance spectacular special effects and tons of action with a decent story. Some of his films are truly top notch in my books (The Three Musketeers, Resident Evil, Event Horizon.) It seems sometimes he focuses too much on the special effects and Pompeii is partly one of those projects. Some of the CGI is poor at best. Some IMDb reviewers rave about the Volcanic eruption scenes looked cartoony to me (perhaps because they were meant to be in 3D.) However, there are some strong scenes of CGI too. The build up in the film is to the apocalyptic eruption so I found myself waiting anxiously for it to happen and when it does, its a little bit of a letdown. Still I realized walking out of the film that I enjoyed myself. It was a little bit of mindless fun and certainly not meant to be a historical epic. I will watch it again and enjoy it for what it is. It won't change historical epics but have some fun! 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For those about to die...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last few films directed by Paul W.S. Anderson have been universally-hated, so I was skeptical about him directing a historical epic. His telling of the Pompeii disaster definitely emphasizes spectacle over substance, but I actually expected a lot worse than this.If nothing else, I enjoyed the film. There are quite a few gladiatorial fights and battles in the film's first half, which are pretty well-staged and just fun to watch. Then, when Mt. Vesuvius inevitably erupts, the mass destruction fills up the screen and provides a somber backdrop for even more outrageous action scenes. It gets pretty ridiculous, maybe even too much for more serious-minded viewers, but even during the melodrama in between, the film rarely dragged for me.However, the film's story leaves something to be desired. The opening scenes, which lay out the Celt's backstory, seems to mirror the origins of Conan the Barbarian exactly. The dude's progression through gladiatorial combat is a story that's been covered well enough in films like Gladiator and Spartacus. As I've seen other viewers mention, the actual love story is pretty much the same situation as Titanic. And, just like Titanic, we all know how the story of Pompeii will end. There's nothing terribly original or groundbreaking in this story.On its own merits, the story gets the job done though. It expends the bare minimum to establish a cast of one-dimensional characters (including an incredibly unreasonable villain) playing through a formulaic plot line. I'm not entirely certain as to how historically accurate the film is; I have seen the Pompeii ruins some years ago, and what I saw on film regarding the street-level views, the amphitheater, the shops, the homes, all generally looked the part. I imagine more informed viewers could nitpick a lot about the film's portrayal of geography, politics, historical background, and culture. With my own knowledge of Roman history, however, I didn't notice that much really wrong. At the very least, as the volcanic eruption went on and on, it became more and more unbelievable that these characters could run around, dodging flaming rocks and debris, and jumping over countless chasms that suddenly appear, without dying.This film is made with some solid photography. In fact, I was pretty impressed by some of the imagery; I thought the film's opening shots, showing figures coated in ash with Clinton Shorter's music score and Pliny the Younger's words, is decently invoking. Editing is good, although a few of the fights might have been cut a little too fast. Acting is nothing to scream about; Kit Harington is a pretty average tough guy here. I enjoyed the performances of Emily Browning, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Kiefer Sutherland. Writing is simplistic and clichéd. This production uses some really great-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are good-but-not-great. The music score is really good, and might be the best thing about the film.It's a story that's been done before, full of clichés and flat characters, and it's historic accuracy is questionable. However, it is an entertaining thrill ride, and the film has its earnest moments. You might enjoy this film if you just want to see some big-scale effects and swordplay; if you're looking for something deeper, you might be disappointed.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Pretty Good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review: Pompeii</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pompeii is the type of epic disaster movie with a story-line centered on the brief and wholly unrealistic love story of a couple who just barely meets, a type of movie that is typically expected of directer Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, 2012, The Day After Tomorrow, Godzilla). Instead, surprisingly, Pompeii is directed by Resident Evil chief Paul W.S Anderson who visits the ancient Roman town-city with all the expected clichés of the disaster movie format that have become all too predictable. Thankfully, Emmerich hasn't been able to deliver in a genre that he practically moulded as of recently, and Anderson gives audiences a fine, entertaining specimen of blockbuster proportions, with no shortage of historical inaccuracy. The beauty about the legacy of the ancient Roman city, for Anderson at least, is that there has yet to be any sort of blockbuster feature film centered on it. Pompeii, a small port city which is located not too far from the base of Mount Vesuvius, experienced an eruption in or around 79 AD. The catastrophic eruption destroyed the city of Pompeii, as well as the surrounding cities including Herculaneum. However, unlike it's cinematic interpretation, most of the people who died from the eruption did not suffer from flying lava bullets, tidal waves due to shifts in the Earth's crust, or large holes in the street; rather, they died from extreme heat and suffocation as a result of the ash clouds. But we all know no one wants to see a movie where people just drop to the street and die. That's what happened in The Happening, and no one wants to see that again, even if it is set against the amazing city of Pompeii. The truth remains, Pompeii is a large scale, slave-centered, disaster epic with hints of Gladiator and 300 all rolled into an 'end of the world' narrative. For the most part, the film is a satisfying display of Hollywood's fascination with artificially sweetening historical events, making them grandiose and affecting. Like any good looming disaster, there is always hope for love, redemption and justice, which is exactly what Pompeii sets out to achieve. Thanks to the success of 300 and audiences' obsession with fetishizing male bodies, no film set anytime in the ancient period, can have an actor show up on screen without a picture perfect set of washboard abs?an ingenious way to bring young and old female fare to the theatres. You gotta love multi-million dollar Hollywood marketing strategies. This time, the lucky stud to completely transform his body (if only temporarily) is Game of Thrones actor Kit Harington. The film follows the constantly oiled up and über muscular gladiator Milo (Harington). Milo is happily born and raised in a small village belonging to the Celtic Horsemen Creed until one cold night when Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland), a senator under Titus and his Roman regime, comes and rips away everything Milo had come to know including his family, simply for the lust of land and rule. Lost and left for dead, Milo is thrust into slavery and raised among gladiators. Along with a vow to take revenge on Corvus, he grows up to be a lean, mean, gladiator-ific fighting machine. Almost two decades later, Milo's amazing skills are noticed by a Pompeii aristocrat and gladiator recruit Graecus (Joe Pingue) and Milo is sent to Pompeii, where he meets and falls in love with the princess of the land, Cassia (Emily Browning). Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of Pompeii, something disastrous is brewing high inside the mountain leering down on them, ready to deliver a fate that quickly becomes a highly spectacle yet doomed story of honour, family, and love. I am sure that there were many reasons why Anderson took on this project, especially since he is infamous for forcefully introducing 3D into his productions. His constant need for including the over-used movie gimmick is more than enough reason to revive pretty much anything, like Spider-Man for example. But, for the first time in a film made just for 3D, Pompeii surprisingly uses the fancy tool to it's advantage and at times becomes almost unnoticeable, which is something that I haven't really experienced during a film, especially one I wasn't anticipating much from. Although the film's exterior focuses on Mt. Vesuvius and the destruction it is patiently planning, the heart and soul of the film seems to be centered on Harington and co-star Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Never have I seen a film where the two leads bond so much over the discussion of how they plan to kill one another. Sworn to be enemies and destined to fight to the death, the two men also happen to share the same cell, which kind of takes away from the imminent threat of death. But just like anything mass produced and destined for redemption, the two begin a friendship that sees them saving each other's lives countless time; defying Rome and Corvus as well as giving one another a chance at retribution. The scenes between Harington and Agbaje are easily the best in the film as well as the most engaging. Pompeii is populated with a rather impressive cast, starting with it's lead Harington, who like most fragile warriors doesn't speak much yet is still able to get his point across whether in or out of the arena. Harington brings a nice vulnerability to his character and the soft glare in his eyes really shows a peaceful warrior side that most gladiators in other films never fully appreciate. While on the topic of gentle giants, no better term could be used to describe Agbaje, a starkly strong character actor who brings a certain gentleness and charm to his role as well, but one that is not to be mistaken for weakness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent but predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tried to enjoy this movie, even though I knew it wouldn't be anything special. I will admit it was good enough, but had so much more potential. The greatest scenes were ruined by cheesiness and camera shots that have been done so many times in movies that it is made easy to call out what will happen next. However, this wasn't my biggest issue with the movie.This is rated PG-13, so obviously the violence cannot be gory in any way. So a note to the director: when someone slashes another's face with a sword (an act that would be very bloody, as we've seen in many R rated movies), DO NOT show the face! Either keep the face out of the shot and let the audience imagine how bad the wound is, or make it gory and risk the R rating! Instead, the director shows the face after it gets slashed, but there isn't a mark on said face, even though they just got hit with a sword! And this happens several times throughout the movie...it really takes away from the fighting sequences when there's no actual wounds on anyone.Characters are very poorly developed. The only thing I took from this movie was that Mr. Eko from LOST and some really ripped guy are trying to be like Maximus and defy Rome.Enough bad. This movie was an entertaining hour and a half. The length is perfect for the material. The ending came fast but it was fairly well done, a lot better than I assumed it would be. The action was interesting and frequent enough to keep my attention, despite a love story that I frankly could care less about due to the fact that I don't know anything about the characters. It's worth a rent, but maybe not the $10 at theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why DID I like this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people are out there saying it's "historically inaccurate", it's "a remade of gladiator WITH A VOLCANO!" and a very cliché film. but I'm saying it is a really good movie on it's own, considering that this IS A DISASTER MOVIE. And in many aspects this is better than 2012, Volcano, or other movies like these. For starters, there is an actual plot to the movie before the volcano erupts. Other things I liked:- The gladiatorial theme is well presented. You can see people who hate being a gladiator, people who are just waiting for their freedom, people who believe they are gods in the arena, and so on, and you can watch how the majority of Romans loved these shows, but some didn't. You can make yourself an idea of the weather of that theme.- The romance is believable. I mean, it happens very fast, but it's not Disney's "Real Love" They are just two people who LIKE each other caught in the massive chaos of a volcano, not much more. - the special effects are plain awesome! Not only the gigantic explosion and lava bombs, and tsunamis. Also the small things, like the views of the city in the background, and the aerial shots.- The city was amazing. People complain "Pompeii is not a port city" Well, actually it WAS, but the eruption changed the shape of the coastline. And the fact that THAT city shown in the movie WAS Pompeii. They actually shoot in place and then recreated the city out of the remainings using CGI. So the grid shape, the walls and everything is in place just as it was 2000 years ago. Archaeologists have in fact praised the director for his recreation of the city- the volcano. It's the star of the movie without a doubt. It seems to have almost a personality. The way the eruption happened was very close to what actually happened. Some artistic liberties were made for the sake of entertaining. You won't be seeing any clichéd lava river because Mount Vesubius doesn't work that way.- The ending. It was amazing. I can't spoil it for you, but making it in any other way would have damaged the quality of the film.- The acting. It was really good for what I was expecting. Milo surprised me a lot, because I could really believe him as a lead man. The girl also. She seemed so plain in photos, but once the movie started I could say she nailed the part perfectly and was by no means just "miss fanservice", as girls in these kinds of movies tend to be. The real surprise was Atticus. The actor totally stealed the movie for himself in every scene, something that was perfect for an invicted champion in the peak of his gladiatorial career.What didn't I like? The fact that the other famous city in the vicinity of Vesubius(Herculaeum, I think it's called) wasn't showed in the aerial shots. I mean, obviously the movie would be to complicated if we include it in the plot, but an aerial cameo of this other city would have been a fine addition to the movie, and would have improved the accuracy of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've been to Pompeii you'll recognize its landmarks and appreciate their reconstruction here, but like another reviewer noted, this film is little more than a guilty pleasure for those of us who dig Roman ruins. It has a similar storyline to Gladiator but the plot is even thinner, sorry no Oscars for acting here but the volcano is awesome and bombards you with 3-D fireballs and a storm of ash-flakes. This has been called a love story, but what ardor there is is only telegraphed by longing stares at a distance and across the gulf between slave and highborn.(Spoiler Alert) The romance is finally consummated in a single kiss at the end that gets immortalized in one of those famous plasters of Pompeii's moments of death before we go to black. I would much rather have seen Robert Harris' "Pompeii" translated to the screen, at least it had a decent plot. There was a project to make it into a movie, but alas it never materialized.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Perspective on the Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit, I was going into Pompeii not expecting too much. I read some reviews that were lukewarm at best, and I am a big fan of the real tragedy at Pompeii, so I thought that there would be no chance of this film being any good. Well, in short, it wasn't. But that's not to say it didn't have any lasting impact on me as a viewer, or as an enthusiast of ancient history.When I look at pictures and articles of Pompeii, I think of it simply as a tragedy, an event that happened in the past, frozen in time for historiographers, archaeologists, and anyone with an interest to admire and study. That's not to say that I never felt a degree of sadness or disturbance, but like any historical moment, it was simply (for me) something of the past, something that happened not in my lifetime that I can simply view and/or study for my own personal amusement and education. I looked at the pictures of the cast plaster bodies, I viewed the ancient remains of the city, and while I felt, I always admired from a distance. After viewing Pompeii, I can safely say that my perspective on the tragedy has changed and I now see it as a personal and affecting moment in history.If this film did something right, it was placing us within the ancient city and making us feel it. Yes, the characters were pretty terrible and poorly acted, but that's not important to me. What was important was how engrossing the film is. The cinematography was excellent, the costumes grand, and the set pieces magnificent; if anything, it was a great movie for a production perspective. Perhaps it was also because I saw the film in 3D and was therefore more immersed into the city, but I felt like the film itself did a good enough job of situating the viewer within the city and making us feel it, transporting us back nearly 2,000 years ago into the ancient city itself. One of the greatest shots of the film is when Vesuvius first erupts, spewing a huge cloud of volcanic ash into the air while everyone stares in curiosity, amazement, and even fear at the giant cloud. No one knows what is happening, but everyone knows it is bad. You could feel the fear in the air because you felt as if you were there yourself. When the volcano erupts and everyone panics, the film does a great job of portraying how fearful the people of Pompeii must have felt at the time, and through this feeling of fear that I as a viewer felt, it changed my perspective on the tragedy.Once the stones start raining down hell-fire onto the city, things go from bad to worse. You feel the chaos of the moment as people are knocked dead by falling debris, trampled by the large crowds, drowned in a giant tidal wave, and crushed by falling buildings. It was a haunting and beautiful final half hour of the film, and if anything, the film can be proud of its technical and emotional achievement of the last half. I felt as if I was a citizen of Pompeii; I was there watching everyone die and fearing for my life as the unknown rain of fire fell down on the city. Yes, the acting, writing, characters, etc. were all pretty terrible. As an engrossing film, it failed in pretty much every aspects. In other words, don't go into this film expecting an Oscar winning experience. But that's not what is important to me. What my experience was is far more personal. It changed my perspective on a historical event. This film made me realize the true extent of the horror of that day, and it made it more personal for me.

		<shortDescription>A constant barrage of clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has had their share of bland blockbusters will recognize the signs early on. From the very first scene onward, everything in Pompeii is a cliché. It is obvious the creators simply took a template and filled in the blanks, borrowing heavily from other popular sources. Every character is a trope and fulfills its role to the point where it gets ludicrous. I found myself audibly whispering "bullshit" during one particular scene.The acting is straight up bad for the most part. Some of the supporting actors manage to convey a bit of emotion but there is only so much one can do with the superficial and predictable characters. Poor effort from the leads. It doesn't help either that the costumes look cheap. Many of the padding scenes lack cinematic quality completely.The CG special effects are this movie's only redeeming factor. As unrealistic as most of the events are, they do look convincing. The bits that get you excited when watching the trailer hold up on the big screen.Intuitively I'm giving this movie a 3/10 but depending on the individual that might still seem a bit generous. If you are easily bothered by sub par acting, uninspired storytelling or a ridiculous plot you would do best to avoid Pompeii altogether.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In overall a decent movie, yet to those who hate lack of detail will find it worth passing by</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start on this one? The thing is that this movie should cover one of Europe's biggest ancient catastrophes and should be based on actual events. Throughout the film it is clear that it lacks any historical value what so ever.Let's start at the beginning. Celtic village being destroyed, all but one child being slaughtered, he sees the murders faces, runs away from his town, being captured by slave-handlers... Fast forward to Londinium, he became a gladiator, invincible to all and is qualified to go to Pompeii. Fast forward, being led to Pompeii, accidentally meets the girl who falls in love with him, arrives at the arena, meets his opponent, etc etc... You don't have to have seen a lot of films to recognize the base storyline that they want to told. It's a copy of other movies who've chosen this base-story so in a way, this script wasn't as surprising as I expected it to be.Moving forward, the clichés pile up as he meets the girl in her house at a party, he sees the murderers of his village, the "bad guy" wants to marry the girl he loves, he and his fellow gladiator have to fight along against the bad guys, the girl is put in a dangerous situation by the bad guy so Milo has to save her, they both die at the end... You can see the story unfold itself right at the beginning of the movie, so basically, that's a huge spoiler. Yet again, if you don't mind the weak storyline, this is a decent movie to watch.If we have to discuss the eruption and all of the disaster that comes along with it, I have seen more than one mistake pass by. 1) The arena wasn't destroyed during a quake prior to the eruption. Visiting Pompeii you'll see the arena still standing like nothing happened. 2) Continuous rain of fire. When a volcano explodes, a few lava rocks may be shot into the air, but there's no continuous rain of fire. Great effect, but boring after a while and even unbelievable to see them coming bolt after bolt, like some meteor shower. 3) Cracking grounds as they drive along the (suddenly empty) streets of Pompeii whilst buildings collapse near them. No street in Pompeii shows any gaps or destruction marks indicating the ground has cracked open. Yet, great effect but highly unlikely this happened. 4) Gasping for air as she inhaled dust and ashes that dwell in the air. They give her something to drink and she's fine again. Having ash in your lungs it is not advisable to drink since you'll create a thick muddy layer. She should have suffocated instead of running in the streets. 5) Unless you're superman, you can't outrun an upcoming tsunami (which wasn't created by a blast of the exploding top, this should have caused more buildings to collapse) 6) A thin layered concrete rune-stone in an arena with a metal-wired skeleton. Romans were great builders, but that technique wasn't described during roman period... And I have some more minor errors but hey, let's not spoil the fun.But my biggest issue is the use of the casted bodies. Don't make one up. The casted "sculpture" of Milo and Cassea at the end was great for a dramatic ending, but doesn't exist in real life. Why did the director not choose an existing casted body that lies in real Pompeii? There are numeral breathtaking castings he could've used as a final shot. To make one up, along with the dramatic effects that didn't occur in real life, is kinda like making the whole event up. For being based on a real event, it didn't felt real to me, as the whole movie felt plastic, artificial and unbelievable. Despite the acting (which was okay for some and great for others), I didn't buy the story. And I believe that buying the story, especially on this dramatic event, is essential.So, in overall, if you're looking for a mindless evening of movie theater, with a story you don't have to think about and packed with action and drama... This is your thing. For those who we're willing to learn more about Pompeii and what happened, I advise you youtube where there are more suitable documentary's for you to learn something about the eternal city and what actually happened that day. With more depth and even better storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie gave me from start to finish the feeling: "I have seen this before." There was nothing new about this movie. This in itself is not the worst thing, but the main story is very lame, little detailed, not very credible and the side stories are even worse. Each new development was very predictable and did not take me into the "world of Pompeii", rather I had the feeling of sitting in the cinema wishing this ordeal would over already. And then they drag the end yet a little more, probably because they needed about 2 hours worth of movie.The acting quality matched the story's and that added to the feeling of "isn't this over already", because none of the characters are remotely convincing in their role. Since so many people die in the movie, I could only wish that in the end, the director was one of them...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator + Titanic = POMPEII</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POMPEII is a disaster film directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, starring Kit Harrington and Keifer Sutherland.The film revolves around a boy who grows up to be a slave and eventually witnesses one of the biggest volcano tragedies in Pompeii.Pompeii is quite an enjoyable time. I went in the cinema expecting a complete dud of a film, but I came out surprised at how much I had underrated the film. Inspite of the poster and trailer of the film failing to impress, the performances are great, and the action was extremely entertaining. The effects and directing were top-notch, especially after the volcano eruption commences. However, the film doesn't have a GREAT storyline and it does have that 'fake' factor which involves every other person dying and the main hero surviving through all the circumstances. ALSO, a gentle reminder about how the first half of the film is rough copy of Gladiator and the second half is a direct copy of Titanic.A special mention about the 3D effects of the film. It truly is worth its price, because it just enhances the whole experience of the film, and adds to the enjoyable factor of the film.In conclusion, inspite of its flaws, POMPEII is quite a good film. Don't go in expecting the best movie of 2014, and go in with an underrated opinion of the film, like I did, and promise that you'll have a great time.POMPEII- 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's bury this under tons of magma.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How much can be realistic a love story between a slave and a young roman patrician girl? Well, this is not the point. We are going to see a motion picture and the plot could also be something not so original. But falling in love because our hero kills a wounded horse this is just ridiculous. This gave me the strong suspect the screenplay was very poorly scripted. As I saw the first end credit all my suspect were gone and I was sure about that. Unfortunately, the screenplay is not the worst thing in this movie. Kit Harington is totally unfit for the role of a gladiator. The trainer and the nutritionist did their job but his lack of charisma, his expressionless eyes are unable to captivate the spectator. Better performance for Emily Browning but nothing special. With a screenplay like that, she act at the best she can and is the only (with Carrie-Ann Moss) I could save among this mess. The other main character is played by Kiefer Sutherland. Nothing special to say about him. He act but seems unfit to the role. He also sunk within the screenplay. CGI effects are the best part of the movie but I'm not taking it into consideration because they add nothing to the story.With a better plot, better dialogs and with a different ending, this movie could have been enjoyable... but in the projection room, everyone was waiting the Vesuvio to erupt, bury this movie and go home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happens when the director of the Resident Evil franchise teams up with the writing team that brought us Batman Forever? You get a film like Pompeii, which aims to tell a story of star-crossed love in the final hours before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius wipes the city off the map. But in order to get to the inevitable destruction, a bit of background information is in order, and we begin 17 years earlier, when a group of Romans led by the ruthless Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) slaughters a band of Celtish rebels, leaving only a single child behind.That child is subsequently sold into slavery, and grows up to become a notorious gladiator known only as The Celt (Kit Harington). His skills in the arena find him shackled and shipped off to Pompeii, where he will be forced to compete as part of a celebration to welcome an emissary from Emperor Titus. If you guessed this emissary to be none other than the aforementioned Corvus, responsible for the death of The Celt's family, then congratulations: you're already one step ahead of the filmmakers.The Celt, whose name we eventually learn to be Milo (not that it matters), has a chance encounter with Cassia (Emily Browning), the daughter of a local nobleman (Jared Harris) playing host to the Romans. It seems Cassia has recently returned from Rome to escape the unwanted advances of Corvus (this guy really gets around), but her father's political aspirations leave him blind to his daughter's peril. Corvus is willing to make a substantial investment in Pompeii's future, provided that he be adequately compensated, of course.Milo forms an unlikely bond with Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Pompeii's most famous gladiator and his scheduled opponent for the games, and rather than fight to the death for the amusement of the rich and powerful, they band together to wipe out an entire detachment of soldiers, much to the delight of the common folk. This naturally raises the ire of Corvus, but before he can inflict punishment on the rebels, the fireworks begin, and Mount Vesuvius erupts.The destruction of the city is the high point of the film, and not just because it brings the audience closer to the end credits. The set pieces are hugely elaborate, the visual effects are stunning, and the 3D is used to great effect after having been completely useless up to this point. Milo's quest to rescue the damsel in distress and avenge the death of his family becomes a race against time as smoke and fire engulf the remains of the city, and the final 30 minutes are undeniably exciting.Unfortunately, we can't judge the film based on the third act alone, and it's impossible to forgive the one-dimensional characters and stilted dialogue that sounds like it was written by Attack of the Clones-era George Lucas. Harington is not a bad actor, as fans of Game of Thrones can certainly attest, but he's given little more to do than swing weapons and show off his abs. Sutherland's scenery-chewing performance is probably the most enjoyable in the film, if only for its absolute absurdity.Once upon a time, Roman Polanski was attached to a version of the Pompeii story, and I would have been curious to see how that turned out. Instead, director Paul W.S. Anderson has given us a confused mess of a film, a destruction porn Gladiator ripoff that carries as much weight and emotion as the ashy remains of the real life inhabitants of the doomed city.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com</fullReview>

If you've always been fascinated by the story of Pompeii, and you've been looking for a movie that gives you the experience of being there on that day - sorry, this ain't it! In terms of historical accuracy, the Doctor Who TV series episode about Pompeii is far superior, and that assessment would still be accurate even allowing for the involvement of an alien Time Lord. While the sail shading in the amphitheatre did seem to take in some of the latest speculations and discoveries about Roman arenas around the time of filming, the rest ....Appalling writing, direction seemingly concerned only with 3D spectacle. And a pyroclastic cloud - over Pompeii? Plus a tsunami??!!! And EVERYONE dies? But surely, what about that wonderful, tragically romantic moment at the end? Sort of lost its impact when the whole theatre burst out laughing! However, with every cliché, historical inaccuracy and insult to intelligence the audience had been subjected to for nearly two hours, the reaction was entirely appropriate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pompeii is about a slave who turned gladiator (Game of Thrones star Kit Harington) who finds himself in a race against time to save a merchant daughter (Emily Browning from Lemony Snicket, The Uninvited, and Sucker Punch), who has been betrothed to a corrupt Roman Senator (Kiefer Sutherland). He also wanted revenge on for the murder of his family when he was a child.The movie is actually fair but nothing special. The movie is similar to Ridley Scott's Gladiator two gladiator seek revenge on roman leader for killing his family and other thing the only differences is Gladiator had better acting. and Pompeii had better special effects. It had weak acting; Kit Harington and Adewale Akianuoya-Agahaje are all right. Emily Browning can't act and unattractive. She would never be the next Emma Watson (that what everyone think her career would be like after Lemony Snicket)I found her be overrated starlet the actress who play her maid/friend look better than her but her acting is weak. There is lack chemistry between Emily and Kit. Kiefer Sutherland had a lousy British accent and not even he could save this film. Like I said it okay but it too short and more as TV Special or Movie type.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to be 100% honest here and I only bought this movie because it has one of my favorite actors in it, Kit Harrington. I do have to say for having low expectations at the beginning of this film it definitely exceeded those expectations however, it did not have the wow factor behind it. I enjoyed this film for many reasons and I would recommend watching it at home if you're looking for a cozy night in. The beginning of the film definitely had an air of sadness behind it that draws you in and makes you think the plot line will become more complex as the story progresses. However, the plot line turned out to be fairly simple, the characters easy to follow, and it was easy to anticipate what was coming next. Now, these may sound like flaws we look for in films but it made for an easy watch and you didn't have to overthink about the story. The characters were my favorite thing about the film because while they were simple and did not have that much development throughout the story it suit what the film was about. Being that this movie revolved around the Volcano and less about the characters, each one did a wonderful job at making that point and did not over do their roles. We saw their emotions throughout so we were able to see when each one was scared, happy, confused, in love, but they never tried to make the story all about them. Now, a criticism for the film that I was not a big fan of was the dialect used throughout. This film is set in the time period of A.D. but yet the dialect sounded closer to modern day. Yes, you heard the occasional "My Lady" or "My Lord" but for the most part the talk was not very elegant and it took away from set and the wardrobe. I love movies and television shows that take place in a time period such as this and a huge part of that is because of the dialect. This film definitely did not live up to expectations in that aspect especially because all it takes to make that happen is precision to detail. Overall, for being a simple movie I did enjoy it very much. Would I watch it again though? Probably not. So, if you are one for films that don't take a lot of brain power to follow this movie is definitely for you however, if you like the more complex stories keep scrolling until you find another film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That was how Pliny the Younger began his letter to Emperor Titus as he carefully recounted his own experiences on the day Vesuvius erupted, and it is how I begin this review today.Though my mind shrinks from remembering, I will begin. It was an awful work. A mindless film with no redeeming qualities other than some cheap effects. The Vesuvius eruption is overwrought with scene of things that never occurred. Balls of fire, giant tsunamis, buildings razed that still stand today. Historically vacuous. Well, maybe the story was good, you'll say. No, no it wasn't. It was a simplistic story of star-crossed lovers, one a rich maiden, and the other slave. Sound familiar. Of course it does. Some would say it is a ripoff of Titanic, but it is far worse than that. It isn't even good enough to warrant the Harlequin press logo. The villain is a senator who dresses like an Emperor, and does Emperor like things to invoke Commodus from Gladiator. He is played poorly by the otherwise talented Kiefer Sutherland, who can't choose an accent. I can't stress enough that the whole film is drivel from start to finish. The fight scenes have been done a hundred times, and are nothing but yawn inducing. The characters do nothing to cause you to care about them. In fact, as others have said, you can't wait to see how the volcano swallows them up.I don't watch Game of Thrones so i don't know how talented the male lead is supposed to be, but he stinks here.

If you are one of those who is going to go into this film expecting a history lesson, then you'll be disappointed. Then again, show me a historical fiction that pretends to be accurate. Although I like both Emily Browning and Kit Harrington, I do think that Kiefer Sutherland stole the show here. A film of this nature doesn't require an award-winning performance, just something that's good. Or at least so bad, it's good, and that's exactly what Sutherland does here. The special effects are of course first rate and I loved the ending. It really made the film for me.

All characters are so one dimensional they might as well be portrayed by shadow puppets. There is no humour nor ingenuity but I can live with that, but there is no drama either and that's simply unforgivable for a disaster movie! Avoid.

		<fullReview>I always think this movie, Pompeii, looks like a sequel due to the final two letters and in a sense, it might as well be one to Pearl Harbor. Heck, they even mention a harbor a ton in the climax.And much like that terrible Michael Bay WWII injustice, this movie is only good for one scene. Can't hardly spoil this by saying it ends with the volcano erupting, and that's the only thing worth watching in this terrible, no good film. Unfortunately, that's barely worth it due to the characters and their incredibly bad decisions during the disaster.I'm not just talking about people panicking and making poor choices. That's easy and forgiven as we've proved to be idiots in disasters. I'm talking about the spilled over drama, politics and macho-macho men. The moment there's a break in the carnage, the "characters" do so many dumb and clichéd things, the spectacle we all came for was diverted to the D- Class level of the Titanic. Backing up, the poor excuse for a story revolves around a slave/gladiator who loves a fair lady, and there's trouble with the politicians, etc, whatever. Look. I just watched this and barely remember the first hour of this tired and warn-out concept. I understand the movie might not have worked as just the volcano erupting, but the opening scenes of Superman: The Movie and its pending doom of Krypton were far more interesting than the first hour here.In fact, if you must see this, just skip the first hour all together. The volcano's massive attack was pretty good if you can just ignore the main character's dumb fighting. I just wish I could rate this higher for the FX alone, but the rest of the movie ? even with some fine and beautiful actors ? was so bad, it's hard to even recommend the climatic world's end disaster. Fine. A slight recommendation to just begin the movie at the end of hour 1. Dang?I am so glad I didn't see this in theatres or I would've hated life for those initial 60 minutes.***Final thoughts: ?which is what I did for the equally dreadful Pearl Harbor. I *did* see that in theatres, hated life the first hour and a half to get to the title fight and then actually wanted to end my life for the horrific remaining, completely unnecessary additional hour. Man, that movie would never end. Mercifully, this movie wasn't too long, but I was really let down we didn't get to see the aftermath of the volcano or even have the stereotypical, albeit welcomed, end screen notes on: how many died, what happened next, etc., etc. It was really the only cliché they didn't use and it would've been the most welcomed one. Shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disaster movie that doesn't turn out to be such a disaster as some would've expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul W. S. Anderson might not be the most reliable director in Hollywood nowadays, but not the most unreliable either, having under his belt some decent movies too, like for instance: Event Horizon and Mortal Kombat( please don't judge). The movie is about the last days of the eponymous city of Pompeii, whose story I bet you already know by now. The movie is told from the eyes of Kit Harington's character,a gladiator called Milo, who has Celtic origins.(YES!, Kit Harington the guy from Game of Thrones, who knows nothing) This gladiator is on his way to the big city where he will have to face a lot of challenges like love, and a few smaller problems like gladiator fights and an exploding volcano, but nothing can beat love. Kit Harington does a good job in the movie, here I'm not referring just to his six pack, but also to his acting. Don't expect anything Oscar worthy. He has just the right amount of energy for this role and also the right physique :). Through the movie the character makes some bonds and enemies too, and you can feel his motivation through the whole movie. The supporting cast also does a terrific job, especially Kiefer Sutherland as the movie's main villain ( beside the volcano) whom Milo hates so much, having a pretty good reason for doing so. The movie's first part takes place in the yet not stricken city of Pompeii, these thrills are mostly given by the well executed gladiator fight scenes and the bonding that happens between the characters. As the disaster kicks in, the movies quality slowly decreases( or that was how it seemed to me), because for those who know about what really has happened in the city of Pompeii will know that there are some things that just don't belong there and some will notice that the length of the disaster is pretty shortened, but I bet all these things were added/changed for artistic purpose and to make the movie more intense, probably this will succeed with those who are less familiar with the history of the city. Despite the inaccuracy, there is one thing that I have to praise when it comes to the second part, and that's the use of the visual effects and also the use of 3D, which many of us already consider pretty annoying and distracting, but it was a good surplus to this movie. Another problem of the movie is its familiarity, its plot is very generic, as many have already described it, it's just a Titanic set in Pompeii. Everything that's going to happen its pretty guessable. In conclusion I would like to say that despite its problems the movie was an enjoyable popcorn flick, due to its good use of the effects and also the good use of 3D. Those who'll watch the movie don't expect anything Oscar worthy, because it's not, but it's something that you'll be entertained by, and this is what the movie does the best, it entertains, probably that can be owed to Paul W. S. Anderson's previous blockbuster attempts. Also don't expect a faithful representation of the disaster, because that's not what the movie tries to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vapid, overblown mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited about POMPEII the film, that is until I found out resident Hollywood hack Paul W. S. Anderson (he of the rubbishy RESIDENT EVIL films) was directing. What could have been a taut, effects-fuelled thriller along the lines of a historical DANTE'S PEAK turns instead into a CGI fest, a snoozer with a clichéd plot, even more clichéd characters, and an entire lack of the things that make thrillers work: I'm talking suspense, danger, and excitement.The first hour of the film has nothing to do with a volcano at all. Instead we get yet another retread of the usual Gladiator/Spartacus type plot line, in which a fictional gladiator falls in love with a Roman noblewoman and comes under the attention of an evil senator. Kit Harington, so good in GAME OF THRONES, is extraordinarily wooden here, while Emily Browning is one of the least convincing Romans ever put on screen.Eventually the volcano stuff hits, and it's all CGI spectacle as you'd imagine. The effects aren't bad at all, but Anderson remains as bad a director as ever, shooting the action in cheesy, unbelievable ways with his incessant slow motion and the like. The abrupt ending will make you laugh out loud. Kiefer Sutherland's bad guy is straight out of a pantomime, and of the cast, only Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje has anything approaching a half-decent character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much fantasy not enough history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pompeii is such a fascinating story and although this movie was pretty entertaining I found it was more concerned with telling a story instead of portraying the truth. The movie just gave off too much of a gladiator vibe and didn't focus on the everyday events in the lead up to the chaos and destruction. It swiftly moves from one scene to immediate panic and terror. There was no real buildup or suspense.The destruction scene itself had fantastic special effects but by that stage I was a little underwhelmed. So while it's not a bad movie I wanted more. I will say that the cast were fantastic though. They did a great job at carrying the script and were very believable in their respective roles. All in all pretty good but could have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good production design, very good CGI, decent score.Unfortunately, the movie is boring - but what else can you expect from Paul W.S. Anderson? The movie is the story of man who is enslaved and taken to be a gladiator. What does it have to do with Pompeii? Nothing. They needed SOME kind of a story because they had nothing to tell about Pompeii itself.Plot-wise, the movie is "Gladiator" meets "Titanic". Effects-wise, Roland Emmerich would have had an orgasm watching this movie: Earthquake, tsunami, volcano. Basically, it's "2012".PG-13 was never more obvious: Right in the beginning of the movie, Kiefer Sutherland's character kills a woman with his sword without spilling a drop of blood; same goes for all the people after her.Just skip to ~70 min point to watch some Emmerich-type destruction with way too much boring talking scenes inbetween.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A reminder of good old Italian "Sword and Sandal" flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this movie is not rated among the greatest, it reminded me of the Italian "sword and sandal" flicks (in French: "peplums")in the 50s-60s. Yes those with Hercules, Maciste, Goliath, and all those mythological "Gods". Maybe far from the masterpieces "Quo Vadis", "Ben Hur" or even "Spartacus", but hey, those movies made Cinecitta so famous at one point (however, "Pompeii" was shot on my Canadian soil, Toronto).If Mila Jovovich was not there, however, it was mostly a visual feast. Forget the script, the story, the too Shakespearian acting and the improbable scenes (how can you endure the heat and dust so much when you battle in a city of fire caused by volcanic activity ?), have fun and reminisce how you enjoyed those low-budget "sword and sandal" flicks at one point. (and to be honest, even some of them became "cult" classics...)Paul W.S. Anderson might not be a great director, but he puts the word "fun and entertaining" in each of his movies, including the "Resident Evil" series...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your "Average Joe disaster film"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pompeii is probably the best disaster movie I've ever seen. And that's because it's not purely clusterfuck of death and because all the deaths of main characters made sense. There is more to this movie than an exploding volcano, and actually the first two-thirds of this movie are about character development and action. And I liked that most. I was a little afraid when it got towards the end, assuming it'd turn "average Joe disaster film" but it didn't disappoint. It's emotional and is a journey. It has Kiefer Sutherland (he's a bad guy in this movie, who acts and sounds like Lord Farquad, I think this was done on purpose), but besides that you probably won't know anybody in the cast. The acting is good and the characters are believable. The atmosphere is nothing short of wicked and I actually felt a little panicked towards the end. The end didn't make me cry, but I wouldn't be surprised if somebody didn't.It has one of the best musical scores I've ever heard and the special effects towards the end are spectacular.Pompeii gets a 9.5/10. Some parts are a little funny, it hits the nail on the head accuracy wise for the most part, it's enjoyable, and completely underrated imho. I bet contemporary audiences watched this and were like 30 minutes in "Where's the death? 3/10"&#xfeff;Edit to original review: I might've seen a different movie. Lol.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a wannabe Hollywood film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer itself revealed half of the story. Gimmicky, too many 3D effects and total fiction. The adaptation too seems totally out of place and poor in my opinion. Why would you show a love story in the middle of a historical catastrophe? Anyway, thought I might still give it a try but then its just a mediocre movie. In fact, I would have rather enjoyed more a historical account of some families who managed to escape the volcano than some fiction romance, to be quite honest.The story too is utterly shallow. It was the usual 'oppressed gladiator meets Roman lady' romance with every Roman shown as being evil and monstrous. Which makes it even more boring. For some reason, there are too many directors who don't realize that they make a bad movie when too many stereotypes are shown off. There's just too much 'I hate you and now I kill you' stuff in a totally goofy setting. The fighting is good which actually prompts me that this could have been a better movie like Russell Crowe's if all the goofy stuff wasn't included!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only good thing about this movie was Kit Harrington's abs and the special effects. They could have done so much with the story. There were some great scenes (i.e. the escape to the mountain) that they could have developed further and the actors could have developed their characters further, too. The love story was just filled with clichés. I don't know what the director was thinking with this plot. Both the love story and the fact that there is a volcano exploding should have been explored further. All themes were simply touched upon and I was left thinking "That's it?" and I didn't get the usual satisfaction I would from the cheesy romance element. Honestly, don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Such movies are doomed to be either loved or hated vehemently. Well, this is why - a catastrophe, a disaster movie is bound to be clichés galore. You need a love-lost romantic line - you got it. You want a very obvious baddie, here played by Keifer Sutherland, you have him. You want a disaster proper - well, The Vesuvius is here to oblige you. You want a Gladiator-style battles, a theme of revenge, a theme of justice and fairness - here you go! Sure, the movie is not devoid of redeeming features. The performance of Sutherland as well as Carrie Ann Moss is good enough, but then, many others do not persuade that they are here for real. The worst moment here is certainly the awful sack of clichés - all those bad guy's final speeches, all those chases amidst the chaos and death, all those Roland Emmerich-style waves and demolitions, all those quite predictable plot twists and turns. Yeah, the final scene is a tearjerker and does make your heart go boom-boom-boom. This movie can be watched once and then quickly dispensed with</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It doesn't take a genius to work out that this isn't exactly the most popular film. 28 % on rotten tomatoes , 5.6 rating on here. Does it tell you this is a bad film ? Or does it tell you that critics have forgotten how to have a good time at the cinema ? The reality is , I think many people have misinterpreted this film. It seems most people have gone into this with the belief that this is a historical account of the destruction of Pompeii. Evidently it is not. The event simply provides a backdrop for the film. For this is first and foremost a love story , and a revenge story.Even on that basis you could argue that it is a bad film. You could say it's clichéd and unoriginal ; with wooden acting and poor dialogue. But technical points aside ; even the harshest critic can't say its boring. It's colourful , exciting and , at times , dare I say it - fun ! Also , the special effects are excellent and the lavish costumes add to the atmosphere and setting.Don't watch this with the expectations of a historical epic or an emotional roller-coaster , but watch it for what it is , good entertainment , and you'll be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

Also, it is not boring entirely but it has its dull moments.I guess if you watch it in 3d it could be better and you will have the entire different vision. I guess this movie is made because of the special effects. It is probably what saves the movie. As for something else...it is just ... whatever.I know Kit's name in connection to the Games of Thrones, but as I never saw any episode, this is my first view of his acting... and guess handsomeness.

		<fullReview>A friend knew nothing about the story of Pompeii. I explained that a volcano erupted and killed a lot of people. Which is the first challenge for the film maker. Is this a disaster story or a swords and sandals story with a volcanic eruption in it? Director Paul Anderson hedges his bets with indifferent results.The plot seems formulaic and derivative, quite a lot of the Gladiator story is in here, and a love story is bolted in. Kit Harrington (Milo) is convincing enough as the captive gladiator taken from the Horse People amidst the slaughter of his people, establishing a revenge element from the start. Emily Browning (Cassia) is coquettish as the daughter of the Pompeii governor whom he falls I love with, and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is the most compelling character as Atticus, the veteran gladiator who needs one more win for freedom.All in all Anderson gives himself a lot to go at but fails to convince in any particular department. The fight scenes are good, and the volcano broods suitably, but despite the potential he cannot convince as a storyteller. Kiefer Sutherland is Corvus, the baddie, the corrupt Rome senator who demands the governor's daughter for marriage in return for his support for a building project, and never quite gets his performance right. Instead of seeming menacing, he just seems mildly irritated.There is a tantalising glimpse of how the story could have been developed when the ladies are shown buying the services of gladiators the night before in an oblique and obtuse way. Instead we get a strange romantic interlude when Milo steals a ride with Cassia.The eruption, destruction and tsunami are all given the 3D treatment but there are only so many pyroclastic clouds and raining debris that can entertain, and like the eruption, the scene soon runs out of steam.Critics have lambasted this film. That is a little harsh. As a superficial gladiator and disaster film it entertains, but no more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POMPEII was fun to watch, which I guess was its main objective: to "entertain". This is no masterpiece theater and as soon as the movie starts you'll start naming all the films this movie has ripped off: BRAVEHEART, DANTE'S PEAK and (most of all) GLADIATOR. Hell, even TITANIC comes up too! The story deals with a last surviving Celt named Milo, and his slave life as he marches to Pompeii to play Gladiator games. There he meets his enemy-turned-best friend, Atticus and falls in love with Cassia, who is the daughter of Pompeii's big shot mayor. There's also Keifer Sutherland in there playing the meanie; a Roman general hell bent on doing things his way. As much as I like Keifer, his performance is a bit contrived and never quite convinces me. I guess "miscast" should be the right word here.As you all know (and this SHOULDN'T be a spoiler), Pompeii blows up, or its nearby volcano for that matter, so all the "Gladiator Part II" side of the story quickly shifts into DANTE'S PEAK/Disaster film territory as we see our heroes and their enemies trying to escape their inevitable death.Special FX are top notch, as it is to be expected from a big budgeted film like this and the action has a nice pace to it. Acting is a bit below average (there's Carrie Ann-Moss in a pretty forgettable performance). The movie is mainly a vehicle for GAME OF THRONES star Kit Harrington. He pretty much reprises his role from that series here so if you dig that show you're in for some fun.Kick back and enjoy the rip off. At least, it's a well made, entertaining rip off!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Recycled Hollywood Garbage, but I found it funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, this movie is a complete rip-off of so many films, three specifically. The story about a slave turned gladiator was taken from the film, em... Gladiator. The fact that Milo (slave played by Kit Harrington) is seeking revenge on the Senator Corvus who murdered his family during the celtic horseman uprising, who so happens to be hosting the Gladiator event held in Pompeii where the slaves/gladiators are competing. Fine, I can let that slide. But it had too many focus points, the revenge, the love story, the friendship with a fellow combatant, and the destruction of Pompeii. It's too much, and because the love story is the main focus, and a connection with the audience is not established for the two lovers, nobody cares, so it feels like there is not stake in the story. Sure, it established that Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) is a bad guy, and that Milo's revenge sub-plot seems a bit more investing, but I think the writers felt it couldn't be the prime focus - because that would essentially be Gladiator with a volcano.PERFORMANCES Everyone else except from the people I am going to mention just blended into the background as well, no presence.This was the main surprise for me, Kiefer Sutherland. I personally really like him, I think he's always good in whatever he is in. But, this was just so strange. I understand the dialogue he had to work with was abysmal, but some of the line deliveries in this film are some of the strangest I've ever heard in my life. They're extremely camp and out of place. The way he pouts his lips gave it some sort of f****d up lisp and he constantly delivered the normal, inside voice, lines like that. I think he did the shouting lines brilliantly, as it felt like his mouth was more natural sitting and made sense, however when he did them he did break character a few times, so maybe that lip bulls**t was to help him keep an English accent? Kit Harrington did okay as the revenge seeking gladiator lover Milo. I honestly think the standout by a mile was Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Atticus, 'brother' of Milo and freedom seeking gladiator. It really seemed like he was reaching into this bullshit to find the silver lining that is the corn in his lines, and I felt when he was on the screen I was engaged.NOTEWORTHY MOMENTS First, the good. The action was actually top notch. You felt the ferocity from the characters when they were hitting each other and the choreography seemed to make direct sense. It wasn't 'Phantom Menace' b******s it seemed well constructed and thought out. Having said that, the directing in some instances did my head in. the sequences were riddled in slow motion. To make it more 'epic' I presume, but it didn't.The CGI; it was either ridiculously fake looking or very well done, but just far too much. For the first point, that chase sequence mentioned in the last paragraph with Milo and Corvus holding Cassia princess big tits or whatever was hilarious. When the chase comes to a stop, the carriage Cassia was just lying in, not seat belt or rope around, goes over small ledge and flips countless times in the air before slamming into a building at high speed. Milo goes over to see if she's okay, and she's fine with not a single scratch on her.The last point is the ending. Basically what happens is that everyone dies. Milo and Cassia are the last standing and are unable to outrun the destruction. So they both lock lips and die together, which follows the most stupid moment in cinema I've seen for a long time. It shows the pair as solid rock, still locked in their kiss and embrace dead. What? If gallons of ridiculously hot magma swept over you, you'd be turned to f*****g dust. Also, because there has been no established connection between the two characters, myself as an audience member didn't care. The same goes for the general deaths of cast and extras. There's no stake, it just happens. There's no emotional connection so it's just there, happening on the screen.The only time I was sympathetic to a death was when Atticus died. This comes back to the same thing, all he wanted was freedom, he shows to be a true good guy to Milo when he saves his life, twice, and he saves a child from being swept away by Tsunami 2.0, also a stupid scene. But the point is it established an attachment to a character, who died to help Milo succeed, in which case he didn't, but his death was noble and unwanted.FINAL VERDICT The main point is that the main missing factual of the movie was emotional investment. I couldn't feel sympathetic to the two main characters bullshit love story, I couldn't be angry at the evil Corvus because Kiefer's performance was comical for the most part, and I couldn't be emotionally invested in the Mount Vesuvius volcano eruption because it was emotionless, it was a natural disaster that just happened. There was no cause, and that hindered the film. Take these examples of film - Titanic; Captain and crew's ignorance = cause for sympathy, Troy; Greek forces quest for conquering and power = cause for anger and sympathy, Gladiator; a man seeking redemption for his family's death at the hands of a tyrant = cause for hope and sympathy for character. There needs to be a reason to become emotionally involved. It's also apparent in the script, because it's mainly deprived of a recycled love story, Gladiator, and a titanic-type ending.It's recycled nonsense with some good fight scenes and two, at least, passable performances. But it doesn't make up for it. See it if you want to laugh at how bad it is, otherwise, it's a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun guilty pleasure filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was absolutely certain this was going to horrible. This does the Pearl Harbour formula, placing a cliché love story against the backdrop of a famous disaster. Paul WS Anderson has never done anything well received and the trailers looked terrible as well. Surprise, surprise, this is actually a competent historical epic heavy on silliness but also heavy on fun. I'm not going to create some sort of illusion that this is a great film. It's not always clear whether or not this is meant to be a B movie or a more serious epic. It's mostly about as deep as a rainwater puddle and the story goes the motions. The plot has some drama, but in general it's just pure epicness and silliness. Kit Harrington is perfectly good and certainly better than Kellan Lutz in The Legend Of Hercules, as are some of the other actors, but Emily Browning gives a wet and bland performance as the love interest, while Kiefer Sutherland is almost unbearable in full on ludicrous B movie mode. In general, the script isn't the best.Pompeii is surprisingly high on entertainment. The action sequences are directed by someone known for awful video game movies and inevitably they're a bit video game like, but they have a sense of intensity, fun and scale. The special effects are genuinely decent, and the spectacle never ceases to be gloriously insane fun. The love story is undeniably a bit naff, although the ending is clever, but there's a friendship in the film between the main character and a fellow slave which feels real and has some emotion attached to it. Pompeii is just big dumb fun, but provides that far better than 2013's Pacific Rim. It's a pretty silly movie, but it's also a decent and competent historical epic which is best thought of as a guilty pleasure movie. It is better than one would expect, and was a huge surprise for me as my expectations were incredibly low. Many will find it very irritating, but at least it's better than Crash, Zero Dark Thirty, Avatar, Ghostbusters, Paranormal Activity and various other bad films people rave about in a thoroughly irritating manner.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This saga is staggeringly unforgettable ? a true Caesar of the celluloid. I can't believe people did not passionately embrace this exquisite chronicle of romance, intrigue, and iron-age lust. Sounds toga-riffic - right? Just wait ? it gets better. In this breathtaking adventure called, "Pompeii", our hero, Titus Loinclothius (or Milo), is a slave gone rogue. Lingering minutes of training at Planticus Fitnitticus and countless sessions at the local steroidium quickly transforms Titus's into a mass of gladitorial muscle capable of lifting things up and putting them down. Of course, he is not your typical coliseum-hack ? but a superstar of epic proportions. He kicks everyone's glutius maximus and becomes one gladiatorius fantasticus. Not only that, he has time for his girlfriend, Fallingoutus Mytoga Maximus (or Aurelia). Things are beginning to really go good for this couple - et tu funnhappitcus for all. Not really, but I needed a couple of extra lines. Hell, I can only imagine wild beasts were roaming through Toga-town, biting the heads off stray residents. Let's face it, a good day in Ancient Rome is when that crap doesn't happen to you. Sorry, I slipped out of the zone. Stupid Mount Vesuvius blows its stack and the ruckus begins. I probably should not go any farther, but I can't hold myself back. The havoc of lava and magma can really make for a bad day. Our two main characters run from one smoldering horror to the next. While they do all this scene trotting, she screams...and he flexes. I must stop right here and say, very impressive acting. It is not often the bar is lowered to that level. With all these horrible things are happening, the one recurring tragedy that kept popping in my head was the knowledge I would never get my money back. Volcano movies and gladiator movies do that to me, meh. Rarely have I found something so inane, it was worth missing - twice. So inspired was I - I felt compelled to yell to my fellow movie-goers, a roaring, "Veni, Vidi, Vomitorium' Alas, as I mounted an adjoining seat, and readied my voice; some thunderous snore instantly dissuaded any plans of boisterous utterances. All in all ? if you get a chance to miss this ? I recommend you do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit it: I watched this movie only because Kit Harington was in it (yeah, Jon Snow is my favorite in GoT so probably he'll end up killed...but this is another story). I expected an inaccurate, boring, cliché story about Pompeii and that was what I had, but in a weird way the movie wasn't so bad. Actually I liked it. First, I'd like to point out that the acting wasn't as horrid as everyone says: Emily Browning was a pleasant surprise. Second, I'd like to point out the accuracy in which the city was recreated. I found it immediately as I imagined it as I saw the remains a few years ago. Third, the thing I liked the most was the ending. I was half expecting them to escape (which I could like, but that I'd end up hating cause I am really fussy about History and when they mess up with it, I lose control), but the romantic/tragic ending suited the movie well. I found it was a good "twist" of the story since in Pompeii there are lovers giving each other a last kiss. It's sad but moving, cause in the end, after all that happened, they could manage to get together and to be together in eternity. Fourth, I liked the special effects. OK, every movie today has that kind of special effects, but these were really well done. In the end, I can't say this movie is a masterpiece, but all the people that are so negative about it had the wrong attitude in the theater, in my opinion. I expected nothing but a weak story and a sort of B-movie effects and everything, and I had better. So don't expect another Gladiator, but if you have the chance to see it, do it :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing on many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pompeii: Few place names evoke such thoughts of human tragedy on a colossal scale. There are many works of literature and film that capture the enormity of the events of 2,000 years ago. I am afraid for me this film is definitely NOT one of them.I have rarely felt so resentful about wasting time and money on a film. This is my first IMDb review triggered by these strong feelings. The reason for such an extremely strong reaction:- Having read or watched so many good pieces of work about Pompeii the historical liberties taken really jarred- The script was all over the show. It tried to cover multiple plot lines and themes in a rush, did not explore or develop them and thus did none of them justice. It seemed to rely on copying other movies' themes and assuming the audience would settle for an abbreviated version in this movie ... (revenge for killed family, horse whispering, citizen falling for a slave, men due to fight to the death become friends, powerful politician demanding to marry daughter of parents who want to protect her). If Artificial Intelligence software was asked to write the script it would probably be like this - all the components but no soul.- The acting was okay but there were not enough script opportunities for the cast to build real characters. (What was going on with Kiefer's accent? It sounded like he was test driving a new pair of dentures. Was it the old "baddies speak public school English" thing going on?)- The special effects were not very special in 2D but may have been spectacular in 3D. The timing of effects seemed to support the looser plot strands but did not really build the atmosphere. For a disaster movie the edge of my seat was not occupied as much as hoped. Probably suspension of disbelief had been lost before the effects kicked in.- As a love story, this was more casual quick fling between bored students in the second year at college than deep, yearning, heartfelt passion of destinies entwined.- The ending - unintentionally hilarious is probably not the desired effect from "Gladiator meets Titantic" but it was either a laugh or a yawn moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical Inaccuracies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who knows something about Roman culture and Pompeii, this film is difficult to watch.The faults this film makes concerning history are small, but still too present to just be ignored. For instance, the citizens of Pompeii didn't know they were living in the neighborhood of a volcano, because in their time mount Vesuvius looked like a mountain and not like a volcano. It had a top, which blew off when the volcano erupted becoming the debris that hid and covered Pompeii.Another example is the fact that according to Roman law, armies were not allowed to come into a city. In this film, it is clear, the makers do not know this.Also, talk about slaves as 'it' and 'savage' and 'dangerous to be around with alone' are modern projections of Roman life. Romans were fully conscious that slaves were people and made sure slaves could become free again if they behaved well. In fact, in Herculaneum, a town near Pompeii half of the population consisted of freed slaves. Furthermore this also shows an inconsistency within the story because the slave-friend of Cassia is almost shown as her equal.Lastly Pompeii was a Roman city and it is rather unhistorical to depict it as an annexed subservient province or someplace else discontent under Roman rule. Every province had its own representation within the function of a governor and most families, especially the rich ones, would consider themselves more Roman than Pompeian or anything other within the Roman Empire.To conclude, I think that this film is more of an attempt to depict current day populist visions on the Romans and societies of Antiquity ( slaves were not seen as human, women had it almost as bad as slaves, Romans were the big baddies, etc.) than real history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dantes Peak Meets Gladiator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched this movie and in all honesty, in terms of disaster movies I don't really like it even on those merits. I mean I have liked some pretty stupid crap from Paul WS Anderson but even for this I feel almost like Anderson is the one director that SHOULDN'T be doing this kind of movie.The plot is that after Milo's family is murdered by Romans, he is soon kidnapped thereafter and years later becomes a fierce gladiator. He then manages to catch the attention of Cassia while both journey to Pompeii. There he befriends another gladiator who's one kill away from being free, The person he has to kill is Milo. On the day however, the rules are changed a little bit when they must go up against parts of the Roman Army. Then (not to give anything away) but the volcano beside the town erupts. He then is told by Cassia's mother to rescue her because some Roman Senator named Corvus wants her hand in marriage, so he throws her in a room and locks the door. He also turns out to be the person who killed Milo's family.Okay, I just have a question. Why do these disaster movies NEED a bad guy? I mean if Corvus was a developed character as opposed to Kiefer Sutherland imitating Jeremy Irons playing the shifty-eyed, obviously evil bad guy then I'd be fine with it but I don't know if we see more on screen deaths from him then the volcano. Shouldn't a movie about Pompeii have the volcano as the designated villain.Beyond that, the characters are almost literally cardboard cut-outs. You can make parallels with Cassia and the Disney Princess cliché and Milo is pretty much the guy who's insanely good at battle and horse-riding because "shut up he is" with a back-story we'll rarely address. If that's the 2 leads (which by the way the romance is also poorly handled) then how exactly can I really gain interest if the only other character with equal screen time is Corvus.Okay, so what do I like about this movie? Well the cinematography is really good, the actors try their best with the material given (maybe except Sutherland... He should have gone all out goofy) and the volcano effects are pretty good.So will I personally recommend it? No. I guess if you like movies with the aforementioned clichés in the review above while bringing nothing new to any of them then chances are that you'll like it. If however you aren't really into this sort of stuff and think by this point all the clichés will be stale then I will suggest for you not to get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clichéd, but beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected trash, and I got it, but this was nevertheless a highly entertaining movie, IMO. All the usual stock-in-trade characters were present - Brooding Hero (Kit Harington), Man of Principle (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Slimy Villain (Keifer Sutherland) and of course Feisty Heroine (Emily Browning), but they all played their parts with sincerity, I thought, and of course the CGI was fabulous.Minor crit was that I would have imagined Pompeii to have been swamped in toxic fumes, rather than hit by a thousand fireballs, but then again who wants to shoot a movie in a fog? (plus the fireballs certainly looked good).Overall this movie left me wanting to know more about this amazing catastrophic event - hence I have started to read up on the subject.Finally - I LOVED the beautiful poignant ending! Not what I was expecting but TOTALLY right!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Destruction scenes deliver but the story is ludicrous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The destruction of Pompeii with all the fiery rocks plummeting down on the city is stunning and as far as special effects go it doesn't look overdone. The recreation of the city is picture perfect. The story unfortunately is clichéd and takes up too much of the movie absurdly intruding into the destruction part. I know they had to have some back story. A Celtic gladiator falls in love with noble lady and seeks revenge on evil Roman soldier who wants to marry the same lady. The fighting is endless, ridiculously continuing post eruption.The casting is hit and miss. Kit Harington (Game of Thrones) plays the gladiator and he is convincing enough. Emily Browning (Sucker Punch) is the lady. They make a cute couple but the role might have been better filled by some one more classically beautiful. Her mother is played by Carrie Anne Moss (Matrix) who is looks like a lady from a Pompeiian fresco and is the best cast looks wise. Kiefer Sutherland is just wrong as the villain who can't let go.Although the ending is poignant in a way, it felt like all the struggle and fighting was for nothing.Overall watch this for the destruction which is the most spectacular so far of any Pompeii movie or series. Just be warned the story is bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is all right in his genre and atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings! If you look for wisdom and great meaning in a film, you shall not find it here. If you look for great twists and a thriller script, you shall not find it here. But this does not make this production weak. Some history, although it is kind of Americanized, some great special effects,a lot of action and a lot of stabbing is what brings people to the cinemas sometimes, in the same way Romans were brought to the arenas to watch such battles, similar to the ones in this action-packed standard movie. Do not forget also that the actors are great. What Anderson delivers this one time is a genuine spectacle, a gladiator movie with a volcano in the middle of it. This is what a critique thought, I absolutely agree. But forget the volcano, just watch this film for the amazing eyes of the young girl and the swift technique of the Celt. It was enough for me. In the same way one cannot compare the Expendables to Jackie Chan's old movies, do not try to compare this to other films with more style and more meaning. Just HAVE FUN! 6 or 7 / 10 from me. BE Generous, dear viewers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If it walks like Peplum ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a lad in the 1960's, Australian television used to show a lot of Italian Sword and Sandal movies usually on Saturday afternoons ? Peplum was another name for the genre. They were all badly dubbed, as well as being pretty bad anyway, but they were influential. My brother and I perfected the art of unsynchronised speech where the mouth keeps moving for some seconds after the words have come out ? Steve Reeves would have been proud of us.I mention this only because "Pompeii" seems to be a hyped up version of a good old Sword and Sandal flick, but totally in sync of course.A young Celt from Britannia, Milo, played by the Eric Bana-like, Kit Harington, becomes a renowned gladiator in Pompeii after the Romans destroy his tribe. The Romans are led by Corvus, played by Kiefer Sutherland who it must be said has the ham gauge quivering on overload. In Pompeii, Milo gains an arena buddy in fellow gladiator Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and a posh Roman girlfriend, Cassia (Emily Browning).After a lot of clunking around in the arena, Milo, encounters Corvus for a showdown. As far as the gladiatorial combat goes, I think now that we have seen so many on the screen, we are becoming about as jaded as ancient Roman spectators; we constantly demand something new and novel. After Ridley and Russell covered so much arena sand in "Gladiator", and the ponderous "Spartacus" TV series covered what was left, the arena scenes in "Pompeii" aren't all that fresh. Overly stylised and choreographed somewhat like "300", they even owe something to World Championship Wrestling. However, I did like the Greek chorus in the gold face masks commenting on the action.Finally, almost as though the gods could not stand one more timeworn cliché, Vesuvius comes to life and the eruption we have been waiting for takes place. However, even under the threat of a pyroclastic cloud, the whole thing slows down so that the tedious revenge plot can be played out to completion, All the influences that have been allowed free play in the script and visuals make "Pompeii" oddly predictable. Much could be forgiven if the filmmakers had gone for a big dose of tongue-in-cheek humour, but I fear they were deadly serious.Early in the film, when one of the characters is watching what he considers a boring gladiatorial match (he's right, it is boring) he comes out with a line while eating a grape that warned me this film wasn't what I hoped it would be ? "You dragged me from a perfectly adequate brothel for this?" Although it does have a powerful final scene, and some stunning effects with aerial shots giving the city scope and size, the comic book script robs "Pompeii" of comparison with a movie such as "Gladiator". Nevertheless it sits quite comfortably with the old Sword and Sandal set, which are enjoyable enough if you know what to expect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Paul W.S Anderson people, if you haven't liked anything else he's done before then this isn't going to be any different ...I didn't like it. Its like what a ready made meal is to a freshly made meal. Sure the ready made option is OK if you're in a hurry and just need something quick, but when you want some quality you're going to take the extra time to make a better tasting and healthier meal that will give you the most bang for your time. Basically I would rather spend an extra hour to watch Gladiator and be more satisfied when it ended than sit through the ready made Pompeii and still be wanting more by its end.Now the comparisons to Gladiator aren't exactly fair, Gladiator was more in vein of Epic movies like Ben Hur whereas Pompeii was more in the style of big Disaster Movies like Volcano, Twister or 2012. But even then it's impossible not to draw the comparison because Gladiator is practically the be all, end all of Gladiator movies, so much so that I've talked more about it than I have Pompeii, so lets talk about Pompeii.It's predictable and nothing spectacular. Its build up and pay off, it's here's the characters, here's some brief action and now here's a giant volcanic explosion, KABOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BAM BAM BAM, action, action, action, death, death, death and crap, crap, crap. It's so clichéd that I really don't know what to say, just don't expect Gladiator. Kit Harington is a walking, talking, cliché spewing 6 pack. Honestly if it wasn't for the fact he's Jon Snow I wouldn't have been as interested in him but I just decided from the beginning that Milo is Jon Snow. Carrie-Ann Moss is barely in this thing, YOU GOT CARRIE-ANN MOSS AND YOU DID NOTHING WITH HER ....WHAT WAS THE POINT. Emily Browning is damsel in distress and she's hot and yeah thats about it. Atticus played by (insert name here, I'm not even going to try and spell it)is actually pretty great. He's clichéd yes but he just throws himself at the role, he reminds of me of Dwayne Johnson, not the best actor but damn he's got so much charisma that its hard not to like the guy, definitely the best part about the movie. Kiefer Sutherland sucks in this, flat out sucks, end off.The effects and set pieces are also highlights. The city of Pompeii looks fantastic and the effects are spectacular, its definitely the reason to watch the movie because its no ...Gladiator, I'm sorry but it's not. So overall, do I recommend this? No not really, go watch Gladiator or Ben Hur if you're looking for a film like this but on an A level, but on the other hand if you have time to waste and want more of Jon Snow while you wait for the next season of GOT, sure give it a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Popcorn Entertainment. Do Not Expect Anything Original or Intelligent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disaster films will always have an audience. There's some sick, twisted, part of us that desires to see thousands of people meet the most horrendous of deaths on screen. One of the most untapped resources of this genre though is the volcano movie, and in addition, the historical disaster movie. So to see Pompeii merge them was a very exciting thought for me. I had always wanted to see a live-action depiction of the event (which wasn't a short 45 minute episode of Doctor Who). The only thing that made me hesitant was the project's director: Paul W.S. Anderson. Anderson is a mixed bag for me; I love the original Mortal Kombat, Alien vs. Predator was fun, the remake of Death Race was cool enough, and Resident Evil 1 - Afterlife are guilty pleasures for me. But his last two films, 2011's The Three Musketeers and Resident Evil: Retribution left such bad tastes in my mouth that I had totally given up on Anderson making enjoyable movies ever again. However, my hope has been restored to believe that the director still has some at least watchable films left in his system.Pompeii is the story of Milo, a young gladiator played by Game of Thrones' Kit Harrington (a.k.a. Jon Snow), who is sworn to vengeance upon Senator Corvus (played by Kiefer Sutherland), a former member of Rome's army who slaughtered Milo's village years ago when he was just a boy. Now, Milo is a man brought to Pompeii to fight in the cities gladiatorial games, but falls for a noble young woman named Cassia. Together, they try to defeat the odds and free themselves from their respective slaveries, all while the ominous volcano prepares to reign down inevitable doom upon the forsaken city. So basically, imagine if Titanic had a kid with Dante's Peak and spliced in some DNA from Spartacus: Blood and Sand, and you have this movie. The plot is interesting enough to make you want to watch it, so I guess I can't complain on that front. It just always feels like it needs something a little more, though.Kit Harrington as Milo is what I guess you could say is the best part of the movie, but it's not saying a bunch. His character is bland with completely cliché motives and no true emotion. And I don't think it's Harrington's fault. Anyone who has seen Game of Thrones knows he can act very well. But the script he's given to deal with is what weighs him down, and it sometimes looks like he's in pain saying these lines. Kiefer Sutherland is basically the only other character worth talking about in the film. Corvus is the most basic villain I've seen on screen in a good long while, but Sutherland somehow finds a way to make him at least the tiniest bit intriguing. And Sutherland does try to take full command of the role, giving it his all. Although his odd accent leaves a lot to be desired. The same with all the other actors, they all have the same problem: they were given such a bland script it seems like it was the first draft. There is no excitement in dialogue, the characters are given the most one-dimensional archetypes and even the action seems like it's missing something. Like there needed to be one more sequence or something to make the film more interesting. I actually tuned out of the movie for a good ten minutes because I got so bored. No movie should do that, especially one about a volcano eruption.One final complaint with this movie: I find in any movie or show about gladiators, there's always one of them who befriends the main character who happens to be black. We've seen it in Gladiator and Spartacus: Blood and Sand. Atticus, the seemingly required African-American warrior in this film, is played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. But his role, I swear to god, was written for Djimon Hounson. And that wouldn't be bad, if he played Atticus. But would it have been so bad to go back and try to change his character just a bit and make him somewhat unique? Oenomaus from Spartacus had his personality and character arcs. I just wish they had dug Atticus' character out from the "Djimon Hounson was supposed to play him" stereotype that I see several African-American actors deal with.So after all that, it would seem that I hated Pompeii. But surprisingly I didn't. The reason I have been saying most of the negatives this whole time is because the positive is simply this: it's a movie where you shut off your brain, lean back and enjoy the disaster. Everything else is fluff that is bearable to watch through, but if your hoping for something as tragically epic as Titanic or Gladiator, then this isn't the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat cheesy and underdeveloped but decent enough Hollywood entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For being a Hollywood attempt at ancient, non-American, drama this is a decent enough piece of entertainment. Unfortunately, as is too often the case when Hollywood tries to make these kind of movies these days, it is also underdeveloped, shallow and somewhat cheesy.The movie have a decent enough cast and I have to say that their performances are generally good. At least as good as the script allows for. The story is pretty straightforward. Young slave is forced to become a gladiator and he is good at it. Beautiful woman enters the scene and Amor gets to work. Bad guy enters the scene and does what bad guys usually does to screw things up. It is a simple story which allows much freedom and which of course is spiced up quite a lot by being set against the backdrop of an exploding volcano.However, the movie could have done a lot more with the story. Even though the special effects are miles more advanced than movies like Ben-Hur with Charlton Heston or works by Cecil B. DeMille it somehow fails to achieve the same impression of awe and grandeur. If you cut out the volcano a lot of the scenes felt just ordinary somehow.Well, it is still a decent enough piece of entertainment. I quite liked the character of Atticus and the gladiator parts are not bad. Some of the volcano effects are reasonably impressive as well. However, why is it that Hollywood producers and directors totally lack any form of knowledge of the subjects they use in their movies? You take an exploding volcano, which in itself should be enough, and then all of a sudden you throw in a tsunami wave which movies towards the volcano. What the f?? That is just so ignorant. I do not expect historical accuracy of a movie like this but Christ, you do not have to slap the faces of the thinking part of the audience like this. The scenes where the ships were coming floating through the streets of Pompeii was also the worst special effects of the movie, regardless of the ridiculousness of the entire tsunami thing.The end? Well, anyone who has read a few of my reviews knows that I am a sucker for happy endings so you can probably guess that I am not overly happy about this one. I guess one have to say that, at least, it was realistic though given that, once the eruption had started, there would be little way to get away from the volcano by any means available at that time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disposable sword-and-sandal epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul W. S. Anderson's "Pompeii" is a throwback to all those sword-and-sandal epics of yesteryear that combined period-piece spectacle with generous dollops of bloodletting, action and romance. This 1st Century soap opera just happens to take place in the shadow of Vesuvius, the volcano that famously erupted in 79 A.D., burying much of the city and its inhabitants in tombs of molten rock and ash.Looking like he barely needed a change of wardrobe from his day job, "Game of Throne's" Kit Harrington plays Milo, a Celtic boy who, after he witnesses his family being slaughtered by Roman troops in the northernmost region of the empire, is forced into slavery and raised to become a gladiator. When he's brought to Pompeii to fight in the arena, he catches the eye of Cassia (Emily Browning), a thoroughly anachronistic, sassy, forward-looking, freethinking type who finds the officials in Rome to be all uncouth barbarians and who has no taste for such popular blood-soaked pastimes as fight-to-the-death battles in the coliseum. A ludicrously miscast Keifer Sutherland plays a foul Roman senator who tries to come between the noble woman and the slave.As befits the genre, "Pompeii" is just chockablock with stock characters, cheesy dialogue and corny plotting, though the movie does earn a few points for its unlikely and, dare I say it, even quite brave finale.But, of course, anyone who checks out "Pompeii" will be doing so strictly to witness, albeit vicariously, all the death and destruction visited upon the city and its thousands of inhabitants when Vesuvius finally blows its top. Apparently, overproduced, CGI-infested disaster movies are our milder, modern-day equivalent to gladiatorial contests. And in that respect, at least, the movie delivers the goods.There's one thing that "Pompeii," fortunately, doesn't have in common with those toga-wrapped spectacles of the past - and that is their extraordinary length. So clocking in at a relatively brief 104 minutes, "Pompeii" has at least one thing going for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pompeii - Or; How Jon Snow taught Jack Bauer a lesson in retribution and age-appropriate dating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul WS Anderson (ergo the one who's made a career of forgoing the privacy of homemade tapes and instead realised all his kinky fantasies for mass public viewing by having his missus thrown year on year at increasingly larger and more salivating zombie hordes while modelling the latest in undead-killing underwear and little else - rather than Paul Thomas Anderson who's made a career of trying to be as little like Paul WS Anderson as possible) brings about more mind forgoing white noise, incorporating all his stay-true ingredients just with the Romans stepping in as the historical roots of the Umbrella Corporation and all the fiery-hot punishment a volcano can lash out with to stand in as the end-of-level boss (well not really, but it's a PWSA flick so that line of comparative just demands milking).Given the reality of this situation I should be a bit more respectful in my commentary but if there was any doubt to be had, this isn't a film looking to deliver the respectful rendering of events, though the wiki does state the layout of Pompeii and aspects of the eruption to be quite true to form, if nothing else in the movie, which has been compacted and blown up where needed to put in for the age-old "slave seeking revenge on parent-murdering historical never-do-well apply within: must have 3 facial expressions or less" ad. Opening on gliding close-ups of the resulting Pompeii "casts" of people pretty much sets the bar here; expect PWSA to forgo the brush of subtlety in realising his vision.Enter Jon Snow, or Kit Harrington, playing a horse-whispering Jon Snow in warmer climes. It's not really his fault, there isn't much for him to make a meal out of here as the plot runs a fairly predictable by-the-numbers playbook where the principle demands of him were probably to supply his own oil for greasing up and crunch till the wardrobe department could rely on his abs as a backup in case of an ironing board emergency. Not a dig, he does fine for as they say: great acting is typically defined as convincingly falling for Emily Browning over equestrian executions and escapes. Which he does, just light on the convincingly part. Elsewhere Trinity and Professor Moriarty ruin their reputations by portraying pushover parents who at one point had me thinking this was '10 Things I Hate About You' ilk when Jared Harris plays "is this all your luggage?!" dad. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje pops up in the gladiator penitentiary and for a moment it seems like he's back in the skin of Adebisi from Oz as he and Kit become frenemies over discourse on how they're going to kill each other, comparing weaknesses, sidestepping shanks and playing at 'winner takes nought, loser gets eviscerated 're-enactment roleplay. Basically the whole mechanics of this film requires no dialogue, it works just as well as a silent movie as you know what everyone's going to do and the who's and when's of character dispatch as the "plot" tired of them and how the trivial nuisance of freshly absent skin at the lash of a whip won't deter Kit. Nah, just pour a bit of merlot on it, right as rain.All that said, I didn't hate this film. It's a 'noisy without saying ought', textbook plotted, tomb pillaging bugger of a film but in that it is an okay brainless actioner.......plus there's Jack.Yes, in some seemingly bizarre casting that had me befuddled as to whether this was complete misstep or magic, Kiefer Sutherland puts in a turn as the nasty, oddly kinda camp, wrong-un that is Senator Corvus. I think it's the weight of being so instantly recognisable for one specific role that had me confused with his portrayal here that the gut reaction is "why Kiefer?! Why?!". However by the end it was pretty much his film through being an unrelenting bar steward in that role and getting gleefully grimy in that guise. This is the real reason Bauer feels the need to keep righting the wrongs and martyring himself up every few years: guilt of the ancestors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Romeo and Juliet in Pompeii with cool special effects and well done CGI added. Kiefer Sutherland is miscast and talks through his teeth with a British accent. This attempt at an uppity accent was very annoying. Personally, after seeing this Kiefer is best to go back to the small screen of TV where viewers they think he can act.Kit Harrington, who had the lead as Milo, had a way with horses. That part of the movie was underdeveloped and could have helped the story line. His acting thought in my opinion much better than Kiefer's as were the others. The special effect at the end were a bit over the top and at some point you wonder how horses are running without fear when projectiles are exploding next to them where as earlier they skittish, but it must go back to the horse whispering of the lead which was as I stated under- developed. Overall there is a lot of Gladiator fighting, but in the end this love story is just another boring chick flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie was pretty predictable and quite unrealistic but still had interesting moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having only known that Pompeii was related to a volcano explosion, I did not know that it was set in Roman times. I'm not really one to watch fight movies and especially ones with gladiators- I opted for this instead of 300. But it wasn't so bad because the fight scenes weren't too gruesome, which was a good thing. The fighting and action scenes were well done, without being too bloody, so that was good.The effects were pretty cool, quite believable. (Spoiler alert- kinda). The thing I had a problem with was the sudden emergence of a tsunami. Firstly, the volcano erupted and shot rocks like meteorites falling out of the sky. That did not seem realistic to me. I'm not entirely sure, but I don't think volcanoes shoot rocks into the air, anywho it just looked more like meteors falling than a volcano erupting. And then just for the fun of it, the directors thought 'what could make this worse?' So they created a random tsunami to sweep half the place, eliminating most of the people who had escaped to the harbour in order to get away from the volcanic eruption. (Question: Was there actually a tsunami when the volcano erupted in Pompeii?)The story and plots in itself weren't so interesting. Though I did not get bored, it just seemed cheesy and really predictable. Also I feel that there could have been potential for more, it just seemed to me like it grazed the surface of the story. It was just pretty basic.I was laughing more at the cheesiness of it and the predictability of the plots than actually sitting on the edge of my seat, engaged. Though I did feel that the last few scenes (not the last) were gripping. That was probably the best part of the film.The ending though. I guess I should've expected it if I had known the full story before going in. My friends and I were just discussing what the point of the movie was because the ending seemed pointless. But now, I guess I know.The acting wasn't so bad. They were pretty believable and got into their characters really well. She didn't get much screen time, but I liked Ariadne (Jessica Lucas). The last scene she was in was pretty epic and really sad. Oh, but they sometimes had accents that were definitely not of Roman times. I detected many scenes where the actors sounded British. And in at least two scenes, they used modern curse words like, 'bloody' and 'bitch'. Sure it made me laugh, but more because it was really weird in that context.Read more reviews at championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is the glass half empty or half full?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pompeii" is a movie that reminds me of the common expression "is the glass half-full or is it half empty," meaning that there are two different ways to perceive something--in this case the film. From one point of view, this movie can be seen as a clichéd, dull, CGI-laded disaster film centered in Roman times with a gladiator-esque backdrop. On the other side of things, it can also be interpreted as a fun, quick-paced, entertaining flick with decent characters and a rather realistic depiction of the destruction of a nearly lost city. It hurts me that many people (both paid critics and the average moviegoers) take one glance at a film and instantly rate it harshly. I am not saying that "Pompeii" is without faults, for there are plenty, but it is not a complete waste. The plot is not entirely about the catastrophe of Pompeii. The orbital force is a young man (Kit Harington), an individual who has seen the Roman brutality at age when his family was murdered by a merciless Roman officer, turned Senator (Keifer Sutherland). Molded as a gladiator, he journeys with a slave caravan to Pompeii where he meets a beautiful woman (Emily Browning) and another gladiator (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) whom is bound to the principles of honorable combat. When Mount Vesuvius erupts, chaos breaks out in the city as everyone desperately tries to find a method for survival. Unoriginal, yet effective. The audience is more or less put on the edge of their seats as fireballs and boulders rain down from the volcano, and a tsunami and pyroclastic flow obliterate the landscape. We wonder if the characters can outrun the incoming doom and devastation. This alone makes a worthwhile flick.I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. The action sequences are splendid and still intense without the blood and dismemberment from "Gladiator." The performances are actually good, especially by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Keifer Sutherland. Sutherland can play a real bastard. The VFX is well done, though after awhile, they become blatantly obvious. As director Paul W.S. Anderson mentioned in an interview, visual effects can only do so much. They can never fully capture the power and mightiness of an epic, volcanic disaster. Nonetheless, an element of catharsis has been achieved here. Ultimately, this is a movie that a person can choose to like or not. I chose to like it for it's worth. And that is fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re-creating Vesuvius burying Pompeii in 79 AD.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the directors says on the DVD extras, he set out to make a disaster movie, and he did. The 79 AD eruption of Mt Vesuvius that obliterated Pompeii with fire and heat, then covered it with 15 to 20 feet of volcanic ash. The special effects look very good, and the soundtrack made my viewing room rumble and shake. Overall an entertaining viewing experience.But there has to be a story woven through it, and that story starts some 17 years earlier, in what is now called the British Isles. The Romans destroyed a Celtic village, murdering everyone, except a small boy of 4 or 5 who managed to survive. He wandered off and eventually was taken in by a group so that he could grow up.But then the story moves forward to when he was 21 or 22, and a Roman slave, noted for being a good fighter. He was put in with other slaves to fight as gladiators for the entertainment of the Romans and others in Pompeii. Kit Harington plays this young adult Milo.There needs to also be a love story and pretty Emily Browning is Cassia, the daughter of a local politician. Her mother is "Matrix" refugee, Carrie-Anne Moss as Aurelia. Milo's main adversary at first is Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as gladiator Atticus, undefeated thus still alive, and according to Roman law will be freed after he wins one more battle. But eventually Milo and Atticus become friends and cooperate to battle the dishonest Romans.The main bad guy here is Kiefer Sutherland as Roman Senator Corvus, lusting after Cassia, but he is also the one responsible for the murders of the Celts 17 years earlier. Milo recognizes him and makes him a target.The story is fictional but the earthquakes and destruction of Pompeii are historical. This is a well-made and entertaining movie. Unfortunately everybody died in the end, but some choose to die with honor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Revival of the Revival</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Gladiator" and "Troy", the early years of the twenty-first century saw a revival of the classical epic, a film genre previously believed to have become extinct in the mid-sixties. The critical and commercial failure of Oliver Stone's "Alexander" meant that this revival was shot- lived, but with "Noah" and "Pompeii" and a film about the legend of Hercules to come, 2014 seems to be the year that sees a revival of the revival. The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD is one of the best-known natural disasters in history, due mainly to the eye-witness account of the Roman writer Pliny the Younger and to the once-famous novel "The Last Days of Pompeii" by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. The plot of "Pompeii" is essentially that of "Titanic", another film based upon a famous historical disaster, with a volcano standing in for the iceberg. Poor boy loves posh girl, who is also loved (or at least lusted after) by a rich upper-class bastard. Can poor boy and posh girl escape when disaster strikes? The Jack Dawson figure here is Milo, a Celtic slave from Britain forced to fight as a gladiator. (And what Roman epic would be complete without gladiators? Well, perhaps "Ben-Hur", but then that film featured the equally exciting sport of chariot racing). Milo's bit of posh is Cassia, the daughter of a wealthy Pompeian businessman, and the upper-class bastard is Corvus, a corrupt and arrogant Roman Senator. Quite apart from their rivalry over Cassia, Milo has good reason to hate Corvus. Seventeen years earlier, when Milo was a young boy, Corvus was the commander of the Roman army which wiped out his tribe, killed his parents and captured him and sold him into slavery. In a nod to the greatest gladiator film of all, Stanley Kubrick's "Spartacus", Milo is befriended by a black fellow-gladiator.The above synopsis might suggest that "Pompeii" also incorporates a "Romeo and Juliet"-style story about young lovers drawn from two hostile camps, but the scriptwriters seemed so keen to make all Romans into the villains that they insist that Cassia and her family are not Romans at all but "Pompeians", a quite separate ethnic group living unwillingly under the Roman yoke. The historical accuracy of this is doubtful; by 79AD distinctions between the Romans and the Samnites, their Oscan- speaking rivals who had at one time inhabited this area of Southern Italy, had become blurred- all the graffiti found in Pompeii are in Latin rather than Oscan- and there is no evidence of opposition to Roman rule from this period. The script is often hackneyed and clichéd and the acting tends to be serviceable rather than distinguished, with the one exception of Kiefer Sutherland, who is lip-smackingly odious as the villainous Corvus, although I should perhaps point out that Kit Harington and Emily Browning, who play the two young lovers, are better than Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet were when playing the equivalent roles in "Titanic"- and look what heights Leo and Kate have gone on to since 1997. This is, however, a film where the real stars are not the actors but the fight arrangers and the special effects people. The gladiatorial combats are as exciting as those in any previous epic, including "Spartacus" and "Gladiator" itself, but even they are outshone by the marvellous scenes of the eruption itself. Granted, these scenes are not always justified by historical accounts of the eruption itself- the eruption was not accompanied by a tsunami as shown here and Pompeii was not subjected to bombardment by fireballs- but that does not detract from their raw, heart-stopping emotional power. This is one of those rare occasions where I feel that the special effects justify a higher mark than I would otherwise have given. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it is not difficult to criticize it. mixture of Gladiator and Titanic, it is only a piece from a long chain of movies in which only virtue is 3D effect. so, nothing surprising in a film who has as lead character a volcano. fight scenes, romance, a lot of clichés, few good actors in sketches of roles. and, sure, for the fans - Kit Harington in a heroic character skin. far to be a bad film - the impressive images are the heart and that could not be a surprise - , it is a show. not remarkable, more technical than artistic but decent in large parts. it is one of films for precise public and that fact does it more than waste of time. because are not surprises. only clichés. and splendid fireworks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's "Titanic" Set In The Roman Empire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost from beginning to end I was having feelings of deja vu while I watched this. Think about the story. There's a disaster a-comin'. We know that. There's no mystery about it. Pretty much everyone knows the story of Pompeii being destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The story of Pompeii's last days gets told through a romance that brings together boy and girl from different classes. In this case it's the slave turned gladiator Milo (Kit Harington) and Aurelia, the daughter of Pompeii's leading citizen (Carrie-Ann Moss) who ignore their difference in social status and fall for each other. One problem, though, is that she has a powerful man who she doesn't like but who expects to marry her in her life (Sen. Corvus, played by Kiefer Sutherland.) Wait a minute. Basically, that's the plot of 1997's "Titanic" transplanted to ancient Rome. OK. It loses on the originality scale."Pompeii" has some strengths. The sets work, and it seems to be a reasonable portrayal of ancient Rome. The special effects around the eruption of Vesuvius are well done. There's even an interesting and still relevant political reflection about the opposition to centralized government. The movie opens with a rebellion against Roman rule by Celtic tribes in Britain, and even though Pompeii is a stone's throw from Rome, you get the impression that its citizens are less then enamoured with the Empire's capital. And this is mercifully short. Most blockbusters these days (and my sense is that this was intended to be a blockbuster) seem to feel the need to be stretched out to at least three hours. This comes in at less than two.The length, mind you, demonstrates the movie's biggest weakness: a weak story. It plods along, it's not especially exciting, and the romance didn't draw me in. I didn't much care about these two - or anyone else. That's a huge weakness. I'd frankly rather just watch "Titanic" again. (5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>History vs. plain love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high expectations from this movie so overall it was a slight disappointment. Amazing history of ancient Pompeii is overshadowed by a cliché love story. Nevertheless,for those who like cliché love stories this one is worth watching. 3D and sound effects are very strong and have a decent quality. The ending is expected and a bit predictable,but emotional. Acting is solid even though there are some obvious mistakes. With such a good cast,and such a good budget I expected a lot more.Kit Harington's dashing appearance covers his pale acting while Emily Browning's acting has surely improved.All in all,it's a good movie but nothing more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, if you really expected a historically accurate depictation of Pompeii - you should watch National Geographic. I had really low expectations for the movie, and; therefore, was pleasantly surprised. The actors were miscast (Jack Bauer as an evil Roman Senator!!!!!! - He did not even whisper once in the movie.) The plot was 100% predictable - dialogue was poor - as historically inaccurate as you can get BUT: the special effects were terrific. The exploding volcano - spewing fire balls (Gladiator rip off - opening scene vs the Germans) - the coliseum crumbling - the African slave saluting the fire storm as it rushed to his doom - all great. Lots of sword fighting - pretty typical gladiator stuff. I really enjoyed it overall (gave it a 6!!!!!)Now why did I go? My wife wanted to go to a movie so I offered her the "low quality" route and we went to the Dan ($3.50 for both of us) - there were 4 people in the entire theatre - (Only us 2 in Pompeii) - and she didn't like the movie!!! Well, lots of animals get dispatched - lots of fighting - some torture (50 lashes without uttering a cry - he should have been a Navy Seal). She thought the casting was poor (it was) - hid her eyes a lot in the "bad parts" - but we enjoyed being together and she did not even object when I made comments throughout the movie. (But then she loves me). So we had a good time. Glad I went.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love in the time of Destruction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pompeii is a great movie spectacle with good direction acting and a good deal of special effects having all the ingredients to be a very good movie which it is.The love story itself is forgettable and cheesy. But that is only incidental compared to what you can watch this movie for - its fight scenes and cataclysmic climax, both produced and recreated in good detail. Anderson cleverly cuts to the increasingly ominous rumblings of Mount Vesuvius whenever the story is in danger of dragging, to re-focus on the movie's focal point. It's not a great film, but it makes for a decent hour and forty minutes of entertainment. It's a huge improvement over THREE MUSKETEERS 3D (thankfully modern slang is mostly absent here) and will probably satisfy genre fans who just want eye candy. Keep your expectations in check and you should have a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Some prayed for help. Many wished for death. But in the city forever lost, the greatest secret still waits" Milo (Harington) was just a boy when his parents were killed in a raid on his city and sold into slavery. While on his way to the city of Pompeii to take part in gladiator fights he sees and instantly falls in love with Cassia (Browning), a wealthy merchants daughter. She feels the same about him but they must hide their feelings. What starts off as a gladiator fight for survival against other warriors becomes a fight against mother nature when the mighty volcano blows. He will stop at nothing to find a way to escape the city with Cassia. I have to admit I was not looking forward to seeing this at all. I am not a big fan of gladiator movies at all. I don't know why but I have never found them interesting. That said I did like the movie much more then I expected to. The movie in a way is like Pearl Harbor to me. The first half is a cookie cutter love story and the second half is one long action sequence. I will admit that the eruption effects were really neat, especially in 3D but for better or worse that's what the movie should really be seen for. Even though it's nothing amazing it was much better then I heard and I expected. Overall, a movie worth watching if you want to see stuff blow up and people fight. That said it is pretty entertaining and I'm glad I watched it. I give this a B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's be fair the movie is good. I mean you won't be regretful about watching the movie and it won't disappoint you. For me it's just an amusing movie that I enjoyed watching. The first 30 minutes are good to see and make sense. The mid 30 minutes are a little (or more than a little) boring but don't haste! The last 30 minutes are very promising and we'll undoubtedly entertain you. Visual Effects are amazing and in my opinion they're far far better than the extremely absurd 300: Rise of an Empire. Colors are vivid. Pompeii is beautiful. Emily is pretty and she acts good. Kit is cute but his performance isn't that sexy at all. Kiefer somehow disappointed me. His performance is lost and he's just a simple villain! Trinity (from the Matrix) does fine. I give it 6 out of then and it deserves it for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good disaster scenes and little else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pompeii looks like how it is advertised: Titanic with a volcano instead of an iceberg. It follows that story beat for beat that I'm surprised James Cameron isn't dragging his lawyers out to sue Paul W.S. Anderson. However, unlike Titanic which is entertaining, this one is just vastly mediocre.Good: The effects during the volcanic eruption were good. The disaster scenes were done well and it added some much needed energy to the movie. I will say Sutherland hamming it up as the villain was entertaining with his snare and Malcolm McDowell like accent. The sword play is pretty cool as well. The movie moves quickly also.Bad: It's like Titanic to a beat so there's no real surprises. Kit Harrington and Emily Browning have no chemistry together much less any real scenes together aside from one really. The love story is non- existent. The sword play while cool relies too much on that gimmicky 300 slo-mo that seems to be required in every sword and sandals film.Overall, it's fast food. Good effects with lots of destruction, but little else. Not Anderson's worse, but still just a mediocre disaster movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gods would be Ashamed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So here we are with the latest film from Paul W S Anderson. If you didn't know the director's name when entering the cinema, you will when leaving it. In the first five minutes his name is shown on the screen twice; this seems an odd move to me at least. I would have thought that he would have left his name for the end credits knowing that so many people get a bitter taste in their mouth just thinking of what he did to the Resident Evil series when adapting it to the silver screen.What we get from Pompeii is hardly worth the time or the effort from those who created it. The whole film reeks of decay and clichés by the barrel load. It seems Anderson was aiming for the glory of the Gods bestowed upon him when making this film; on paper it would appear to be an epic in size and scale, how then could it go so terribly wrong? With Anderson directing of course. I am sure the template when pitching it was 'A cross between Gladiator and Titanic'. Obviously the former being why it is set in Rome and deals with a slave, the latter the love story which takes place through the disastrous event of the volcano in Pompeii exploding.Most of the trouble and my problem with the film is the dialogue and the way in which the main characters deliver their lines. The dialogue feels so wooden and unnatural (sometimes laughably bad), that even the A grade actors like Carrie Ann Moss and Kiefer Sutherland, cannot help but be hindered by it. I lost count of how many times Sutherland yelled the line "Kill them, kill them all" which completely lost the intended impact I'm sure Anderson was going for. No surprises here that it will only drag their careers down. Another promising star such as Kit Harington (Game of Thrones), sees himself in a film that is actually below him. Emily Browning tries her best but even her sweet smile cannot convince us otherwise that we are having a good time. Their charm and good looks cannot stop this from plunging into the catastrophic dark and dreary depths of film making, not unlike that of the actual Volcano itself.To worsen the insult to injury there are blatant rip offs of themes from Gladiator; one scene shows ten or so slaves fighting off an army in the coliseum, something that was done in Ridley Scott's film yet that had the dramatic heft and power to ensure it was no aforementioned travesty like this is. One character says "No this is not war this is politics", which is about the only mention we get of politics in the film, and would seem that Anderson added in that line after seeing Gladiator; a film that actually knew the power and what politics actually means to the people.Perhaps then the only saving grace (or more appropriate wording would be half decent element) is that the musical score is more dramatic than the film itself. When this is the absolute truth you know that your film is bad, the score is supposed to give more tension to the film, not in this case outshine it! The funny thing is that what would be a further good element is not. The destruction of Pompeii is so overdone with obvious splurges of CGI and no emotional attachment to any of the characters that you cannot feel anything, and begin liking the volcano for ridding us of these one dimensional characters. By the end you'll wish that the volcano exploded upon Anderson as well, just so that you can be saved by anymore of his catastrophic disasters; it is in fact ironic that a catastrophe in history ends up being the same in celluloid. If this is what a trip to Pompeii is like then I would take the Titanic any day of the week.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film for disaster movie junkies, it ticked all our boxes, with one fatal flaw. The story is more about the hero Milo and fellow slave Atticus (played brilliantly by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) than the romance it's billed to be, as Milo and his high-born lady barely have any time together. Great special effects (we saw it in 2D, it would have been much better in 3D) but you have to wait for the entirety of the film for them, until then it's mostly bloody fighting. That brings me to the fatal flaw.

		<fullReview>Milo is a slave, who witnessed His family killed by Jack Bauer of all people, when he was just a little nipper.Years later, he is a gladiator, a very good one, who spends his time smouldering when he isn't fighting.In the way to the titular place, he puts a horse out of its misery, and this causes Emily Browning to fall for him.Then there's all this cobblers about Bauer having to marry Browning, because he is just so darn despicable, just like Billy Zane in Titanic, but guess what? Browning only has eyes for Milo.And the big twist? The iceberg is now a volcano, and their love for each other is going to erupt.....Well it's a load of old rubbish really, Sutherland is terrible as the bad guy, but he is funny, in a really 'you know what to expect sort of way'.And this is why the film entertains so much, you know what to expect. It's by Anderson who gave us Mortal Kombat, Shopping, AvP, and the Resident Evil Franchise, so if you expect something epic, watch The Towering Inferno.The film is unintentionally hilarious, from the shaking of the city every five minutes, and people saying 'oh it's alright, it does this all the time', to the final third, which in all fairness, is very impressive.We get Milo chasing Sutherland, who has Browning, and it plays out almost like the end bit of the Wacky Races, who's going to make?And Anderson must have thought there was only one road out of there, because everyone, literally everyone, goes down the same path.If you want to switch your brain off from the world, for 100 minutes, and just want a silly popcorn movie with great effects, welcome to Pompeii.If you expect something great, and marvellous, you are clearly deluded.Good for all the wrong reasons...</fullReview>

With a mix of other historical/fantasy/disaster films thrown in for good measure and last but not least a good old sprinkling of cheese !!! Yep it was a cheese fest from start to finish there was really nothing original here at all really, Good Guy, Bad Guy, Girl, Enemy turned Buddy, Bad Guys sidekick etc etc Romance, Bromance, Sword Fights e.t.c and of course an exploding volcano !! The Acting was kind of OK really, the dialogue was pure B movie disaster flick though but I kind of liked it. The FX were good as was the 3D and there were moments when I flinched when things came out at me so thats a good sign.The staging of Pompeii was a little Hollywood and nothing really looked or felt anywhere near historically accurate but I wasn't expecting that anyway.Overall it was a good fun popcorn flick in the 70's or 90's style disaster movie and it is paced to keep you entertained rather than build up much character background or affability.7/10 from me !!</fullReview>

Yes it may be inaccurate,but so what its a film..if you want accuracy go to the history channel. If you're open minded and able to see passed that then watch the film because its actually pretty good.

		<shortDescription>Not the Pompeii I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watch this movie and have to say it is just an average disaster movie which could be another classic like Titanic. The GoodThe music score in this movie is just so captivating and illustrious. I think the music is much better than the movie plot. The special effect is great and maybe the main reason you want to watch this movie.The BadNow, this is what I think the let down, too much focus is being put into the grudge between the Celt and the Senator that put me wondering if this is an action drama movie or disaster movie. The movie opens with a thrilling history note about people of Pompeii, but then the movie shows only the revenge of a man. They can do better with some scenes of from the perspective of common Pompeii people for a more dramatic yet realistic disaster movie, for instance that family whose remains are found buried together in a room. But instead, when the whole city is engulfed in the greatest disaster before their eyes, two men prefer to wrestle each other.Also, Kiefer Sutherland is too nice to be a heartless antagonist. He should be the protagonist.SummaryAnother disaster movie great for the visual effect which has the potential to be a classic. Instead, just turn into another action movie, like the 2012.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's hear it for the Special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2 May 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza, Dorchester Tonight - Pompeii. Well this dis a story that is never going to end well so no spoiler alert here, but this film was taken in a different direction. It wasn't so much the setting of the scene for the grand traumatic finale, it was more the tales of the political battles between a tyrannical corrupt Roman Senator played with absolute pompousness by Kiefer Sutherland, and the gentle merchant and his family from Pompeii. It was the same battles as seen in Gladiator, for example, how could it not be given the subject matter, and don't expect to see a classic script being acted amongst the splendid special effects. This is a film produced mainly with a view to show what you can do with special effects these days, and it did it well. Not sure it will make the transition to DVD terribly well, unless your TV takes up half your living room. Now when did Kiefer Sutherland fit in time to make Pompeii bearing in mind Jack Bauer is about to hit our screens again within the week.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Titanic happens, there's a volcano for a little bit, roll credits. No, really. To flesh that out, slave/horse whisperer(!) Milo(Harington, with at most one emotion on his face during this) falls for Cassia(Browning, the closest of anyone to come out of this with dignity intact, her role defined by? something) and vice versa. Thankfully we're told this, because they don't sell you on it? at all. She's marrying senator Palpatine?I mean, Corvus(Sutherland, Jack Bauer with a strange British accent). And there's an eruption(well? see above), which represents the only arresting visual and composition(if you do subject yourself to this, definitely go for 3D, it is immersive, with fantastic depth and rare use of gimmicks). At no point does this give us a reason to care(or stay awake, other than the rubbernecking at a car crash kind of thing), have more than one or two inspired moments that aren't lazily lifted from a much better film(Spartacus and 300 added to the notable ones)or have anything going for it other than great production values.I am in awe of Paul W.S. Anderson. He must draw an audience, he keeps being given a budget(and it shows), and he continues to waste tremendous talent in front of the camera, and he still gets work. This does make more sense than other recent works by him, presumably he's charging up for the next burst, saving it for yet another wrong-from-the-word-go Resident Evil movie, fuelled by the salty tears of fans. There's less slow-mo, and this certainly is the first time that he could not choose between two genres so he combined them, so there's that. Yeah, a gladiator piece and a disaster flick, neither of them compelling. Of course, he still has build-up not match pay-off(too much of one for the other, in both ways), for easing up on Alien, he refuses to leave Ridley Scott's films alone and "kill your darlings" is a foreign concept to him. No real fun is had, nothing goes anywhere and hardly anything in this will stick with you ?we're talking, maybe a handful a full 60 seconds out of the seemingly insurmountable 97 minute running time.There's a lot of violence and disturbing content in this, particularly awful for how distinctly it's neutered to be a PG-13. I recommend this solely to anyone else compelled to gawk at the trainwreck that can be attributed entirely to the substantial incompetence of its conductor. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It will get you through a rainy weekend afternoon. Do not expect magic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Emily Browning and Kit Harington (Jon Snow) are the two fated lovers in this very TV looking, and all karmic payback movie. This is a great weekend afternoon popcorn flick, but that is all you get here. The fight scenes are really good, and the over all production is top quality, it is just like any other fantasy film though everything crashing down all over the place, but somehow not until our protagonists have past, or are passing them. Most of the first 2 3rds of the movie are really just blah blah filler, and the real money was spent on the final battles, and the eruption of course. The champion of the moment played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje&#xfeff; is really the best acted, and most fleshed out character in the movie even though "Milo" should be. Kiefer is just cashing a check, and he gives just enough to get the job done. Over all I Enjoyed watching most of this movie, it is an OK option for passing a couple of hours, but I only recommend it if you are caught up on the Spartacus TV series from Stars as it is just a lot better all around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately, I preferred Frankie Howerd's Up Pompeii (MINOR SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit there are plenty of flaws with the movie and it does lack some of the complex plot lines of the 1971 original (Ooooh!) Firstly,what's going on with Keifer Sutherland's accent? I know he can't be Jack Bauer, but that was just bizarre (I am Senator Attius Corvus and this is the longest day of my life) Emily Browning (who I know is a decent actress) needed better lines than what was on offer here. Carrie Anne Moss had such a small part in this film, it wasn't worth her time &amp; expertise (she must be desperate for a paycheck). I found the character of Atticus (Mr. Eko from Lost) was one of the few that I was rooting for in the film (the other was the lanista/gladiator owner just because he had some sense in trying to escape) - a good performance from him. Kit Harrington put in a competent performance as the slave Lurcio (renamed to Milo for this reboot) but I don't think he was tested any more than what he does playing Jon Snow (he even looks identical). He did take his top off for the ladies quite a bit (hence my friend's attendance) and gets 15 lashes if you are into that thing. To sum up the positives in this film, it didn't bore me and the effects were good. I also didn't hate the ending, but it was a bit cheesy! The scenes in the arena were good but nothing that rivals Ridley Scott's Gladiator . However, there were lots of detractors including people running away from a tsunami and surviving (how many people would have been saved in the last 10 years if they had done that?) Also, you can't outrun a lava flow from a volcano on a horse!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2012 meets Spartacus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With too much 2012, and too little Spartacus.The Story itself is nothing new. This is, after all, one of the oldest stories to be put to screen. I remember finding the black and white version in the Video store, I remember finding the series... somewhere, and I am sure there are a handful of other depictions out there.But seeing it, I entered the theater with some hope in my heart. It had everything to become an epic, something to launch Harington's career past Game of Thrones. The plot is there, the actors are there, the setting it there.I mean, how the f*** can you f*** up Gladiators, Roman Empire, disaster love epic? Seriously?The first impression that I get from it is that it is way too rushed. They are covering too much time in too little time. The work of the Romans over the Celts is instantly forgettable, despite the constant attempt to remind us of it, lighting and editing sucks, acting was just barely average, and the love interest is, again, rushed. You only find out the Main Character's name halfway through the movie, for crying out loud. I get the feeling that it is supposed to make the main character mysterious in some manner, which is half the battle, but it just seems like a oversight. The characters can be likable, and I promise, I tried, but if you have to try to like a character, the movie has already failed.Of course, this movie wasn't all bad. The acting, again, is average. The sweeping views of the countryside, while suffering with the poor lighting, is neatly done. CGI is well done, and despite my spoiled nature when it comes to fight scenes, either having to be epic, ala 300, Spartacus or Wuxia/Jet Li movies, or Jason Statham types, with quick, brutal and realistic. Pompeii nails that last one to bloody perfection. Some people might complain of them being a little confusing, but it is quick and not always easy to keep up with, having to run your mind back over it once you've seen the effects.So, Kudos to the stunts and Choreographers.Another thing that I like about it is the ending. Not what you would expect and, in my humble opinion, how the Titanic should have ended. So, nothing new, nothing epic, nothing classic. I wouldn't recommend it, but I cannot honestly say that there is nothing good about this film.4/10, not being skimpy or generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to begin with this abysmal movie? Appalling script coupled with some of the worst performances I've seen in film. Not sure how they managed to turn what could have been a brilliant disaster movie into what seemed like the discarded draft pages from the Gladiator script. It's so derivative of Gladiator that it's almost a parody, calling the main character 'The Celt', having the downtrodden princess fall for the protagonist, the Gladiatorial battles and even the token African sidekick. Such a bad movie, not that you'd actually be rooting for such 2 dimensional characters but the ending made you wonder why they bothered with the characters in the first place. Kiefer Sutherland should have been credited as Alan Smithee to save himself the embarrassment of having his name connected to the biggest waste of 100 million dollars of the last ten years. The handling of the project was so inept and so ridiculous, that it wouldn't surprise me if a sequel was in the works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Disaster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.5/5 starsCompared to the usual shtick Director, Paul W.S. Anderson (the "Resident Evil" series, "AVP", "Mortal Kombat") is renowned for, "Pompeii" comes as a revelation. The writers do a fairly good job in recreating one of the most tragically cataclysmic events in history against the backdrop of exciting action sequences and a simple, innocent love story. Mr. Anderson thankfully sticks to the screenplay on hand while narrating the story. He directs the film in a straightforward manner and ends up pleasing the audience with 95 minutes of simplistic entertainment.Kit Harington, Emily Browning, and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are dependable in their respective roles, while Kiefer Sutherland is astounding in his hideously wicked act. What really stands out are the set pieces, editing, and cinematography, specially during the disaster sequences. All in all, "Pompeii", fulfills two main promises it set out to achieve. Firstly, it competently recreates a historical cataclysmic disaster with amazing visual razzle-dazzle. Secondly, it allows us to relax with some easy-on-the mind entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, what did you expect???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pompeii is a type of movie one goes to watch if huge amounts of explosions, fights and typical love stories are expected. When I saw the trailer for the first time I was intrigued. I didn't expect much and that is why the movie was entertaining to me (besides - that is what movies need to be).I will try to focus only on the good elements in my review.1) The volcano. Absolutely brilliant. Exactly what was expected: big, powerful, evil, destructive. A force no one could have reckoned with. Nature's way of saying - The Roman empire needed a punishment. Every one of these elements is so vividly presented that no metaphysical or philosophical discussion is needed for these elements to be seen.2) The music. I was really surprised that the music was as good as it was. It was epic, it was heartbreaking, it fitted perfectly into the scenes. But the most important part is that it's original. I could hear no attempts to copy any other similar music, and that is why it works perfectly.3) The storyline. Actually, not so bad. The idea of a love story is good (bassed loosely on true events), a bit clichéd, but one grows so fond of the main characters that the ending hits so emotionally hard it almost hurts. A story to be watched with your girlfriend/wife. But, do not mistake this for a chick-flick, it is not! The second storyline that is presented is also interesting, but it has one major flaw. The actors who had to present it. The acting overall is good, the problem are not Harington or Browning or Agbaje but Sutherland, Harris and Moss. I understand that these actors were names that had to carry the movie, but there performance was so weak (especially Sutherland - I had no idea what got into him) that one could hardly bare to watch them. Harris and Moss are better than Sutherland but still, a bit more was expected from them (especially Harris).4) The ending. Of course an ending similar to the one presented was expected but the way Anderson evaded a clichéd ending, giving the movie a so emotionally sad ending, was a bit unexpected. This was warmly welcomed.Unfortunately the movie has one flaw that exceeds all others - directing. This was directed so catastrophically that halfway through the movie I had a feeling my father and I would have done a better job. His utmost disturbing lack of talent for directing is noticeable when the volcano erupts and he loses the possibility of leading simultaneous story lines.The technical details (camerawork, the noticeable CGI etc.), the run- time of the movie, the underdeveloped characters, etc. all of these flaws are tolerable in a movie like this. The acting presented by Harington and Browning, the music, the true romantic love story, a great ending, and a hell of a good time is what make this movie really good. It is not award worthy, it will not be a huge box-office hit, but it will be a good movie to watch from time to time on Valentine's day, or any other day with one's better half.</fullReview>

I like corrupt Senator very much, just as I like most corrupt of Roman Emparors like Caligula, Nero, Commodus and other twisted minds. Rome would of not of been Rome if it was not so corrupt and body enjoyment prone. Romans really knew how to enjoy life. So did this Senator. I was so sorry that the slave won and not him. In the real life in ancient Rome I doubt that love story like that could of developed, of a noble woman and a slave. Noble woman would use slave and then threw it away like a garbage. Who is he, to win over Senator? Acting was OK, but not extraordinary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The disaster movie is a staple of the cinema and the genre reached its apex in the early 1970s with films like "The Towering Inferno", "The Poseidon Adventure" and "Earthquake" (which introduced is to the short-lived 'sensurround'). Here an actual historic catastrophe - the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD - is the backdrop to a series of bloody battles in a Roman arena and an unlikely upstairs/downstairs romance which makes this story "Titanic" meets "Gladiator". The effects might not be on the scale of James Cameron's sea-born epic, but the 3D works well when the volcano blows. And Kit Harington is no Russell Crowe but fans of "Game Of Throne" will be pleased to see him given a big screen role.As so often in this type of film, the roles of the women are sadly underwritten. Emily Browning with her bee-stung lips plays the romantic attraction while Carrie-Anne Moss is her mother. Now these women can kick-ass, as we saw in "Sucker Punch" and "The Matrix" respectively, but here they just have to look pretty and frown. And then there is Keifer Sutherland acting against type as a manipulative and evil senator (Jack Bauer a bad guy?!?) with a really weird accent.Critics have been hard on "Pompeii" but really it is perfectly good entertainment. I won't spoil it for you by telling you what happens to the Roman city at the end but the final scene, while schmaltzy, is oddly satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not a bad way to spend 2 hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, anyone giving this film one or two stars is being completely unfair, especially to this genre of big spectacle type movies. Certainly one may argue that some of the dialogue is cheesy, some of the plot lines a little too predictable, but this is still an enjoyable action-filled disaster flick packed heavily with visual spectacle.Did we go to Jurassic Park to hear witty banter? Hell no.At least four things redeem this movie: 1) The villain, Senator Corvus. He is an absolutely vile, intractable enemy. He's on a par with The Joker against Batman, Lex Luthor against Superman.2) While I usually don't care about special effects, they were pretty awesome in this movie, though if I see another scene where people try to outrun a tidal wave (which travels at least 100 mph), I will probably throw popcorn at the screen.3) The acting is really quite good. Few people have even touched upon this. It's not easy acting in these spectacle movies. The dialogue is often on the nose, and there's not a lot of room for artistic interpretation, but the actors were very good in their roles, especially Kit Harington (the Celtic slave), and Kiefer Sutherland, playing Senator Corvus.4) Originality and historical events: there were some good moments of originality in this story. I enjoyed how Rome was portrayed, not just as a military powerhouse, but also as a den of snakes politically. Along with historical inaccuracy were bits of historical fact, and the mix was quite satisfying.So if you read that this movie was lame, cheesy, and a waste of time, consider that they missed the virtues of this movie. This is one of the rare movies where the villain really is wholly despicable. The trend nowadays is to show his complex nature, so that the character doesn't come off as cartoonish. But Senator Corvus is played so well by Kiefer Sutherland, and his role so well written, that he comes off splendidly as someone who really is just a despicable human being. I applaud the writers resisting the temptation to show redeeming characteristics as they do in (really lame) movies like The Expendables. If I see thugs writing poetry one more time I'm going to barf.But nothing in this movie will provoke such a reaction. It's really a good effort. Not perfect, but well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't have terribly high hopes for this so I was very pleasantly surprised. No, it probably won't win an Oscar, but come on, let's be honest--do we really care about that? The effects were good, the city was beautiful, the story wasn't stellar but wasn't awful either; the romance had a couple twilighty lines but overall not too sappy. Honestly, there really wasn't time for sap, and I for one am always grateful for that. the name Milo seemed like a weird choice but who knows maybe it really is a Celtic name. The sets were pretty magnificent and the portrayal of the cataclysm was thrilling and devastating. For anyone who cares, the movie was also surprisingly clean. It was an exciting epic action movie with no graphic nudity or sex. There was violence of course, but nothing graphic or gross. The only thing arguably gratuitous was Kit Harrington's prominently chiseled abs, but no one at the theater seemed to mind. I did some quick research after watching and was surprised to discover how accurate the portrayal was. They of course took some dramatic license with the explosions and lava bombs and the size of the tidal wave, but several archaeologists and historians affirmed that it was overall a pretty decent portrayal of Pompeii and its destruction. The music was also pretty awesome. I bought the soundtrack. A few people commented negatively on the opening and closing frames of the film and admittedly, my first reaction was "huh." But after thinking about it and reading about the real disaster, I understand why they chose to do it. Those were the stories the filmmakers were telling--the people who were left behind. Even the main couple were inspired by a couple found in the ruins. In a nutshell, don't expect Russell Crowe and Gladiator quality and don't expect a documentary either, but enjoy it for what it is. I'll be buying it when it comes out on blu ray.</fullReview>

But what I liked about this movie is that it IS about Pompeii, but they made it about so much more. They made it into a story about Milo and his life and also bits of Cassia's life and the love story they develop in. The volcano part at the end was sad!

It was nice to see Kit Harrington in something other than the Game of Thrones. Is he going to be a typed casted actor with only action roles? Kiefer Sutherland portrays the Roman senator/ villain who will be unscrupulous and nasty. The gladiator/action genre with many sword fights and villains fighting heroes. The volcano is the disaster part with earthquakes, fire balls, smokes, etc. Well acted, directed, with the right mix of the three genres. Entertaining, but no American Hustle.

The action scene choreography and cinematography were stellar. The special effects appeared natural versus over-computerized, and really added to the suspense. Glimpses of the famous ashen corpses are included. The horsemanship and "6th sense" of those animals were delightful. I'd love watching it again and owning it. Fun and entertaining!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I had feared, or at least one critic claimed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I had great hopes for this movie - I wanted to see a recreation of life in Pompeii and, of course, the effects of the eruption of Vesuvius - I was also afraid, since there is no star power here, that it might be a cheesy action/disaster flick, of which there are already many.It isn't that bad, frankly. Yes, the plot is obvious, and yes, the script is strictly paint by numbers. No, there is no great acting here, but no one embarrasses himself, and there are no real stinker lines.The love story has no chemistry and is completely forgettable, but then, who goes to an action/disaster movie for the love story? What's good here? 1) The combat in the arena near the end. (You know the eruption will start during the big combat, right? You've no doubt seen "San Francisco" (1936), with MacDonald, Gable, and Tracy, the model for all subsequent disaster pics of this kind.) Some of it is clever and downright funny.2) The eruption. Actually, the eruption itself is nothing special. But it is fun to watch the principles ride through the streets of Pompeii as the city is being pelted by flaming stones from the volcano.What disappointed me? The death of the Black gentle giant. I thought he should have escaped.What is meant to appeal to teenage girls? The final kiss. I won't tell you what makes it especially romantic.This will probably be a real dud on a TV-sized screen. See it in the theater. No, it's not Spartacus, certainly, or San Francisco. But it's still fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating and Intriguing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an avid movie go-er I was looking forward to seeing Pompeii- and was not disappointed. Many will say it was messy, going back and forth to a love story to a Gladiator themed movie, however it is just what this movie needed. Many are comparing Pompeii to Titanic, while the only similar aspect is a tragic love story. Before seeing this movie, be prepared for both story lines. I did not see the film in IMAX or 3D but I believe it did not take away from my experience. The CGI was flawless, I found myself on the edge of my seat for the majority of the movie. The casting was for the most part exceptional. Kit Harington is finding himself as an actor as he takes on a major lead role. I could see him doing more of these early BC/AC films as it is clearly his forte. He makes an awesome team with Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Their on screen friendly relationship has to be one of my favorites. Adewale's character stands out and easily becomes a fan favorite. Emily Browning as the lead female, I have to be honest. Her acting was fairly emotionless and I found it to be annoying at times, the expressions she made drove me crazy. Keifer Sutherland, amazing actor but not the role for him. He doesn't in the least bit even look Roman and his acting was very dry in this film. As for the story, you will find yourself captivated and intrigued there is no way you'd be able to walk out of the theater. I give Pompeii a 7/10. There were aspects I think could have been done better but overall very entertaining. The audience clapped at the end and several times during the film which makes it fun. I say give this film a fair shot and don't listen to the Titanic comparers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Enjoyable Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having enjoyed all of Paul W.S. Anderson's films from "Death Race" onwards, I knew Pompeii would be another strong addition to his career and, as predicted I thoroughly enjoyed this epic film. It doesn't measure up to other epics such as "Titanic" but its large scope and solid story impresses. A slave called Milo fights to save his true love who is betrothed to a scheming senator whilst the mighty Mount Vesuvius erupts around them, reigning chaos upon the once magnificent city. I couldn't help but notice a similarity to "Titanic", that being the situation of a girl being forced into a marriage she is not committed, let alone interested in, determined to escape her planned future. Either way both films handle the storyline well, yet Pompeii plays fast and loose with it, instead focusing on the stronger subplot of Milo who is a slave with extraordinary fighting skills, determined to escape his captivity and free his beloved. I thought the build-up to the eruption was superbly paced, inter-cutting shots of crumbling ground and tremors echoing through the city, although I would've liked it if the characters showed more concern to the strange activity surrounding the mountain.Kit Harrington is good but a bit too similar in performance to his role as Jon Snow in "Game Of Thrones", but as Milo there's a bit more romance and desperation involved and that's where he really shines. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is one of my favourite actors, whether he's in minor or major roles he compels me and again proves his worth in Pompeii with an authoritative performance as a slave who is promised freedom if he fights his way out. Agbaje actually delivers some humour amongst the chaos and is probably my favourite character here. Emily Browning is believable as Cassia, the city ruler's daughter. Cassia is strong willed and smart and Browning does a good job portraying a young woman with power in her, and of course she excels when scenes of romance play out. Kiefer Sutherland is clearly having a blast playing the corrupt Senator Corvus, he's manipulative and evil but a coward. Carrie Anne Moss, Jared Harris and Jessica Lucas are rather underused yet they still deliver strong enough performances to make an impression, but I think the performance everyone wants to hear about is volcano. When the big beasty finally blows its lid the fireworks truly go off setting off a climax filled with tremendous special effects that end the movie with the perfect bang, one you wait for the minute you press play. Paul W.S. Anderson has always been a master at staging action sequences, check out Death Race, Resident Evil Retribution or The Three Musketeers and you'll see what I mean when it comes to the breakneck pace and hard hitting violence against the backdrop of stunning CGI worlds. Pompeii is no exception, watching these characters stare death in the face as lava and smouldering rocks fall through the sky will leave your jaw agape and eyes widened, the detailed visuals are flawless, especially when the big waves send boats crashing into buildings whisking citizens off their feet. The scale of the eruption matches that of any Michael Bay film, and the last shot of Milo and Cassia embracing each other as the pyroclastic flows soars towards them is heartfelt and powerful. Pompeii is a spectacular show, critics have ravaged it but I think it's a spectacular show, an ideal choice for a movie night and one of Anderson's best films, I just wish I bought it in 3D, but in 2D it still amazes.</fullReview>

This movie is for those of you who like pretty things. The scenery is pretty (gorgeous even). The actors are pretty (Oh my, Mr. Harington!). The costumes are pretty. The locations are pretty. The special effects are pretty. The love cliché is pretty.And despite all these facts everybody must of course know: It's historically inaccurate. It's Gladiator meets Titanic. It's an impossible cliché.But it's so pretty!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't see this film for the story, it is mediocre at best, but see it for the beautiful surroundings, the very vivid effects, the fighting &amp; action, the havoc &amp; destruction and okay maybe a bit for the storyline, just a bit.It is a very vivid and beautiful film, the costumes, the scenery and the surroundings are very well made. It is also a very violent film, not just does our lead man become a slave and later a gladiator and has to fight a lot, but a lot of devastation and havoc does occur during the film and especially when Mount Vesuvius erupts and brings down lava, stones and gravel on the city of Pompeii.It is entertaining, it is fast paced most of the time and has a lot of great scenes, but the story wasn't really that deep and some characters are not that fitting. But I liked it and was entertained for most of the duration of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Pompeii" is Explosively Awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think "Pompeii" is Paul WS Anderson's best work yet. I like his films for the wide shots, the action sequences, the fight scenes, and he never fails to bring a twist (Hello, "Resident Evil" films!). This film under-performed, and I'm disappointed. We live in the cinematic age of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels, and adaptations. If you bring an original plot, the producers should know the risks.I love how glorious Pompeii looks! This is a Roman-centered film for YOLO generation. It's less than 2 hours, so no boring moments. In fact, a Paul WS Anderson has never given me a boring moment. The arena scene is intense and blood-pumping. I like the Milo-Cassia romance brings in the poor boy-rich girl love team, but in a different,refreshing setting. Eruption scenes are superb and like no other. 3D is the best stuff in this film.If you want history, disaster, some romance, lots of action, and 3D, this film works best for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Thrilling Disaster Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I've heard all the nasty things said about Paul Anderson, but I cannot vouch those statements because I have not seen many of his films to this point, perhaps purposely though. I do know that he crafted a beautiful-looking disaster film that is much better than I thought it would be. Maybe because I hold a soft spot for these kind of films, but this is an entertaining film with great visuals, a good score, and great acting. The script could be a little better, but of course I'm not expecting this film to be Gladiator or Armageddon. Paul Anderson's film is an epic tragic love story set amongst the impending doom of the massive volcanic eruption of Pompeii in A.D 79. Milo is a former slave turned gladiator who fights for his true love, Cassia while trying to keep her from the clutches of the wicked Roman senator, Quintus Corvus. The acting is pretty good, which added more dimensions to each character. Kit Harington is a macho man to be sure, but he has more substance than I expected thus making him a fine leading man. Emily Browning is all grown up now as Cassia. Admittedly, Kiefer Sutherland's performance is sort of hammy, but in a good way. I did think Carrie-Ann Moss and Jared Harris were good in their limited roles. Overall, Pompeii is a better-than-average disaster film. The visuals are excellent and the eruption of Mount Vesuvius is quite breath-taking. There are minor flaws, mostly surrounding the story as there were some few things that could be taken away or used some explaining. But I liked the premise. Sure the film is no Gladiator, but it is entertaining in its own way. My Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spartacus TV show and a disaster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Milo (Kit Harington) is the new slave gladiator called The Celt. As a child, his Celtic Horse tribe village in Northern Britannia was massacred by Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) and his right hand man Proculus (Sasha Roiz). He catches the eye of Cassia (Emily Browning) as she travels home to Pompeii. He is to face Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) who is one victory away from gaining his freedom. Corvus arrives in Pompeii as a Senator. Cassia's parents Aurelia (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Severus (Jared Harris) need Corvus' help to build new constructions for the city. Cruel Corvus is obsessed with Cassia and has followed her from Rome.This is reminiscent of the Spartacus TV show except it is a poorer version. The characters are barely compelling enough to keep my attention. Kiefer Sutherland is not a good villain at least not in this movie. The disaster movie doesn't improve anything. It becomes a CGI extravaganza and it overwhelms what's left of the characters. People separate and reconnect out of nowhere. The movie should really keep the group together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Much in Story But Still A Great Film To Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in 79 A.D., Pompeii is the epic story of Milo (Kit Harington), a slave turned gladiator who finds himself in a race against time to save his true love Cassia (Emily Browning), the beautiful daughter of a wealthy merchant who has been unwillingly betrothed to corrupt Roman Senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland). As Mount Vesuvius erupts in a torrent of blazing lava, Milo must fight his way out of the arena in order to save his beloved as the once magnificent Pompeii crumbles around him.From the description, Pompeii sounds like some crappy soppy love story but, even though there is obviously an element of love attached to the story, thankfully it's not mainly about that and it doesn't get all chick flick-ish. In a way, it actually reminded me of Gladiator but I didn't mind that because I enjoyed Gladiator as well.OK, first off, Pompeii as an absolute feast for the eyes as the visual &amp; special effects are amazing and superbly done. From the collapse of the Colosseum to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, it was all fantastic to watch. Secondly, the action and fight scenes were also really well done and well choreographed. When you watch some fight sequences in some action films they just look robotic and staged so to speak, but here they all looked natural ....they were done smoothly and seamlessly. It was all really enjoyable to watch.I think two of my only real complaints about Pompeii were...1) I felt it was a wee bit rushed. I think it would have been much better if it was drawn out by about another 30 minutes or so 2) Kiefer Sutherland played a good "bad guy", but his English accent was a tad off-putting because it was too posh sounding. He sounded like a guy who would have been going to join his "old chums" for "afternoon tea" instead of playing a Roman Senator. I half expected a "pip-pip cheerio" at some point.Anyway, in saying that, Pompeii is an enjoyable roller coaster of a film and is definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Up Pompeii.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a poll being held on IMDbs Classic Film board for the best titles of 2014,I started to make plans on catching up on Bollywood movies from the year.As I got nearer to watching the Bollywoods,I began to hear a surprising amount of praise from fellow IMDbers and a family friend over a sword &amp; scandals epic which had suffered a painful death at the box office,which led to me getting ready to pay a visit to Pompeii.The plot:After his family are slaughtered in front of his young eyes by Senator Quintas Attius Corvus,Milo is taken as a slave,who is trained to become a gladiator by his slave owner.Decades later:Having made his name as the most successful gladiator, Atticus is told by his owner,that after he wins his next match,he will finally be freed from slavery.Suspecting Atticus's final match to be a big draw,the slave owner decides to put Atticus against a young up &amp; comer,who the crowd have nicknamed "the Celt",but is known by his slave owner as Milo.Walking with his fellow slaves from Rome to Pompeii,Milo has to kill a horse,after it fails whilst pulling a carriage containing the rulers of Pompeii.Killing the horse in the most humane way possible,Pompeii ruler Cassia is taken by the kindness that Milo shows towards the horse.Determined to finally be free,Atticus ignores Milo's hand of friendship.and sets his sights on freedom.Catching his fiancé Cassia starring at Milo for a little too long, Senator Quintas Attius Corvus decides that he must show his iron fist,as he sets his sights on a power-grab of Pompeii.Getting set to face each other one on one,Atticus &amp; Milo suddenly find their owner to turn on them,as they are chucked into a to the death battle royal,which Corvus hopes will kill Milo,and any threat of an uprising taking place.View on the film:Keeping the film moving at a frantic 104 minute running time, (with the studio trimming 20 minutes out of the title)the screenplay by Janet Scott Batchler, Lee Batchler and Michael Robert Johnson unleashes a superb mix of Disaster movie thrills and sweetly done light romantic notes.Whilst Corvus's focus on destroying Milo as Pompeii burns does look a bit petty, (even though we are all about to die,I MUST kill you now!)the writers smartly decide to keep everything down to earth,with the destruction of Pompeii being based around the torn love of Milo &amp; Cassia,rather than a hollow smash and grab destruction.Opening and closing the film with a breath-taking wraparound shot, (which is actually based on a stature in the ruins of Pompeii)director Paul W.S. Anderson and cinematographer Glen MacPherson keeps the action building,at a gradual,devastating pace,as terror waiting to face Pompeii rumbles in the background,whilst Milo &amp; Atticus fight for survival in sharp,tough as Odin fight scenes.Making sure that the stunning action never overwhelms the flick,Anderson and Macpherson give the title an elegant acrylic appearance,which covers the film in a near fairy- tale atmosphere,as Milo and Cassia's romance rises from Pompeii's ashes.For the unlucky souls of Pompeii,the movie offers the tantalising chance to see the leads of 24,The Matrix and a double bill of HBO's Oz and Game of Thrones battle for survival in Pompeii.Giving the character a sense of depth not featured in the screenplay, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje gives a touching performance as Atticus,with Agbaje melting the characters stony heart to reveal Atticus's burning desire to get revenge on his slave owners,and the rulers of Pompeii.Despite his voice surprisingly lacking his distinctive twang, Kiefer Sutherland gives a wicked performance as Corvus,thanks to Sutherland showing a burning insanity in Corvus eyes,as he sets his sights on putting the gladiators back in their place.Whilst he appears surprisingly nervous in the CGI-focused scenes, Kit Harington gives a very good performance as Milo,with Harington slowly turning Milo's fiery thrust for vengeance against Corvus,into a fiery passion for Cassia,as they both watch Pompeii burn.Final view on the film:Two thumbs up!!</fullReview>

Every day I appreciate Gladiator more and more, and I know that all the actor in that film are AMAZING.To the guys that did this film: F*ck you. Go to f*ck yourselves.

		<fullReview>Pompeii an Italian city, full of wealth and busy people. One day a rich daughter returns to her home and she meets a gladiator who is a war casualty of England. When a high ranking officer comes to town, the intrigue starts ... and it's not a spoiler when I write Pompei is destroyed by the Etna volcano. That is history.From a girly perspective, this film was a pleasure for the eye. Kit Harington as Milo is even more sexy than in Game of Thrones. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje didn't have to say much. Very nice role for Sasha Roiz after his sensual role in Grimm. Even Kiefer Sutherland gets away with his accent. For this ... yes ladies and gays, do see the film.Emily Browning as Cassia is convincing enough. It was odd to see Carrie-Ann Moss after the Matrix. She missed strength, either from an intrigue or moral perspective, in this role. Hared Jarris was solid in his acting, a relieve considering the miserable screenplay. Once one has seen the last days of Pompei, series 1984 and 2003, this story line is too thin for words. It could have been copied from Gladiator or Spartacus, the series. The only surprise was the lack of creativity. If you like doom-special-effect movies, yes go see the movie. For me it could have been less. A volcano eruption is overwhelming enough and shouldn't need semi-comets and ground shaking which took most part of the film. The #CostumeDesign by Wendy Partridge was roman good for the men but lacked for the women, in both dress and jewelry. Clearly this movie was made for people who like fire, panic and are not interested in any type of depth. Only the end is worth a positive comment but if the men weren't so delightful, this would have been a 5 rating.</fullReview>

I mean a lot! You can imagine just by watching the stunt list in the end. You will find many many action scenes. It has the best and most modern graphics and effects. A lot of great production teams came together in order for this film to be made!Unfortunately the acting did not amaze me. I had the need to see something better, in both the acting and phrazal part. The worst part is that this movie is really a mix up of other movies and you will start to gradually understand it while watching. Finally, the music is also much much taken from other very known themes of both the movie and song industry. It is not my place to specify from where and what but you will find it out for your selves. Nevertheless you should watch it. For it's purpose it is enough. Thanks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In what can aptly be described as Titanic meets Gladiator, a Briton orphan becomes a full time gladiator, part time horse whisperer, and occasional eye-candy. After meeting a progressive Roman lady, whom is completely unaware of her Roman privilege, our hero discovers the meaning of love and, a reason to live. Enter the magic Negro also doubling as gladiator, who goes from being our hero's adversary to becoming his brother in arms. All dreams are thwarted by a pesky volcano. A tidal wave gives freedom of the seas to the magic Negro character and countless of slaves. But not all is lost, somehow every person who has visited injustices upon our hero is in Pompei too and he manages to kill them all while saving Snow White of Pompeii Valley just seconds before their love is preserved for eternity- this time neither one "ever let go". Their ordeal ends with probably the hottest kiss in history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Celtic horsemen find themselves under the attack of Romans, who kill them all. One kid who pretends to be dead survives. Years later he's a gladiator in some province. A roman talent seeker discovers him and takes him along with others to Pompeii to fight there. On his way his compassion and skill with horses catches the fancy of some rich girl. In Pompeii the ruler is trying to get investment from the emperor to build fancy projects. The emperor sends a senator there to analyze whether the investment is worth it. The senator, Corvus, is the guy who ordered the massacre of the Celts years ago, and he's also after the girl who's the daughter of Pompeii's ruler.Our Celt of course makes all sorts of enemies while in captivity. He shares the cell with the champion who is one fight away from winning his freedom. They are paired up for that fight. But as he's ordered to the ruler's villa and runs into the girl, Corvus realizes that this guy is competing for the girl's heart and instead orders both of the gladiators to fight first a fight which the ruler has envisioned as a reenactment of the massacre of the Celts instead of a one-on-one fight.Meanwhile the volcano starts to act up and erupts just in time for the games. The Celt and his champion sidekick have to fight their way out of the crumbling arena and save the girl, while the entire town tries to escape to the harbor. As expected the Celt and Corvus will face each other.Initially, I wasn't all that thrilled about Pompeii. You've got the usual swords and horses and fire and lots and lots of fights. But I did end up liking it thanks to the friendship between the Celt and the champion and the performances by Kiefer Sutherland and the lovely Emily Browning. Carrie-Ann Moss unfortunately doesn't get to do much. Some of the visual effects are pretty cool, some aren't. Movies like Pompeii benefit from the history behind it but the rest of the story requires a few coincidences too many. Still, it's an enjoyable production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a fan of disaster films, "Pompeii" successfully met my expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pompeii" came and went in theaters while not making much of a splash along the way. Many blame the release of "The Lego Movie" at the same time for this misfortune. Others blame it on poor word-of-mouth and a lack of interest in the subject matter. On the eve of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a slave named Milo (Kit Harington) is brought to the great city of Pompeii to participate in the gladiatorial arena. Upon his arrival, he catches the eye of the daughter (Emily Browning) of the city's ruler (Jarred Harris). As the arena battles rage on, the towering volcano begins spewing molten lava and raining fiery rock onto the citizens of the ancient metropolis. In the midst of all the confusion and destruction, Milo escapes and finds himself leading the ruler's daughter to safety as the city crumbles around them.First off, if you're walking into "Pompeii" expecting complete historical accuracy you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Keep in mind that it is a Hollywood film. Although Director Paul W.S. Anderson went to great lengths to make the eruption of the volcano and the layout of Pompeii as authentic as possible, he himself even admits that the story and other scientific elements aren't completely precise.What Anderson and Writers Janet Scott Batchler, Lee Batchler, and Michael Robert Johnson do is build up a few characters the best they can in a movie with a running time of an hour and forty-four minutes. If this were an old-school 1970's disaster film, they would've made it over two hours long and spent the first hour and a half getting the audience acquainted and invested in all the lives of the people seen on screen. In a world where there has to be an explosion every four to five minutes or viewers lose interest, that's just not possible.The cast of "Pompeii" seems legitimately interested in participating in the movie. Leads Kit Harington and Emily Browning both fit their roles of star-crossed lovers quite well as they gaze into each other's eyes from afar and Harington risks life and limb to save Browning from certain doom. Kiefer Sutherland chews the scenery every chance he gets as the deplorable Roman Senator Corvus."Pompeii" is rated PG-13 for intense battle sequences, disaster-related action, and brief sexual content. Plenty of people die horrible deaths in the movie for all to see. Some die bloody deaths as gladiators while others perish from being buried in volcanic debris. The "brief sexual content" refers to scenes of women shopping for slaves to have their ways with them and some passionate kissing between characters.As a fan of disaster films, "Pompeii" successfully met my expectations. It's not often you can find a way to blend together the destructive elements of "Armageddon," "The Poseidon Adventure," "Earthquake," and "The Day After Tomorrow" into one movie. When you add a hefty spoonful of "Gladiator" to the concoction, there's not much more you can do to satisfy the hunger of action movie fans anywhere.</fullReview>

The story was not deep enough to stir the emotion of the viewers. So the ending is not really heartbreaking. The story should have been longer and focus more on how love develop between the 2 main actors, so it will create a sensational ending!If not for the amazing special effects, this movie would have got a score of 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining and Exciting Guilty Pleasure of a Movie that Never Attempts to be Anything More than a Spectacle. It's All About the Volcano You See and You See it a lot. Everything Else is just Filler and Standard Sophomoric Romanticism and Hollywood History. But it Works.The Move has its Roots Firmly Planted in the B-Movie Matinée Fodder of the Fifties and Early Sixties. it Draws from the Sword and Sandal Bad Acting Imports and the Harryhausen Stop Motion Movies that were All Harryhausen and Little Else, OK Bernard Hermann.The Movie Looks Great and has Enormous Amounts of Action and some Violent Fight and Chase Scenes that Push the PG-13 Rating and when the Volcano Finally Blows its Top it is a CGI Bombardment that Blows the Mind. The Acting is Inconsequential and Mostly Mediocre to Bad and the Script is Non-Existent aside from Clichés. But who Cares?This isn't Shakespeare, Laurence Olivier, Russell Crowe, or even James Cameron. It's just a Movie that is Underrated and was a Big Flop, but is Recommended for Anyone that is a Kid at Heart and just Likes to Play and Never has Anything More on Their Mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First impression review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you can see, I rated it 9/10,so that means I really enjoyed in this movie. It had few of my favorite actors "John Snow" and "Mister Eko". OK, now lets get to the point. What really impressed me in this movie, was Pompeii city itself. I watched some documentary on TV few months ago, about historical fate of that city. To be able to see the entire city of Pompeii like its presented in this movie, it is amazing. And the love story had some of the best endings, it made me to share tear. Special effects are really well done, and acting is good, but it had some unnecessary moments, especially with sound of horses, and entire "horse" background story (I guess they were to lazy into development of the characters) maybe its better, because in the end I would cry for real.Very interesting movie, with some scenes you can fast forward. I recommend it to everyone. It is also great, that we are able to present how ancient cities looked like and what happened to them, I am not sure if everything about city Pompeii is as it is shown in this movie, but looks like it was great city with a lot of people in it, and in this way , this movie is for them. For all those people that lost their lives on that tragic apocalyptic day.As far as I am concerned, they should create documentary series, with Computer-generated imagery used in this movie, and tell stories about other cities, that we used to have back in history, and they are now lost. How they never saw it coming?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 79 AD and Slave/Gladiator Milo (Kit Harrington) must find a way to save Cassia (Emily Browning) who is betrothed to Roman Senator Corvis (Kiefer Sutherland) as Vesuvius erupts.Okay, here's the thing: a movie that will show Vesuvius exploding needs to have spectacular CGI. And, it does. Another thing: a fictional love story mixed with Roman politics needs to hold an audience. And, it does. And, still: the sword fights must look to be very real. And, they are. And, mostly the dialogues need to be spot on. Ditto. The cinematography should have an epic-like feel. And, it does. And, finally the ending should be worthy of this epic-like movie. And, it is. And, it is here you will reach for those tissues in that Kleenex box. Trust me. You will. This is one of the best endings I have ever seen. When I viewed this last scene, I was reminded of those lovers on that Grecian Urn.I suppose if there were bigger stars in here, the movie would be considered an epic blockbuster. Kiefer Sutherland is the most recognizable name and he comes up with a way of speaking with an unknown accent that we actually find enjoyable. Kudos. However, the stars we have are very bit acceptable and do good work. Nice to see that Curry Graham has graduated to movies as we have seen him often in TV shows. Here he was an Overseer of Slaves/Gladiators and did good. Milo is scheduled to meet the Champion Gladiator Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) who will receive his freedom if he wins. (Side-note: what happened to the days when agents gave actors shorter names? Huh?)The banter between Milo and Atticus is pure gold as they tell each other how the other will be killed. Very enjoyable. You almost feel they won't relish killing the other and they will miss talking like this. Pure gold. Kudos.Now for the question you all have: how does a slave get next to Cassia the daughter of a wealthy merchant? Suffice it to say a horse brings them together. Isn't it always the way?When Vesuvius is doing it's worst, Cassia asks: "Why do the gods let this happen?" Good question. But, it is that very last scene that makes you forget all about the lovers on that Grecian Urn. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far more enjoyable than it should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a young boy's family are murdered and his village destroyed, he becomes a slave. Later as an adult and accomplished fighter he is taken from Britain to Pompeii's arena (on the backdrop of Mount Vesuvius rumblings) to compete where he falls in love with the city rulers daughter.If you took a mixing bowl, added one part Conan the Barbarian (1982), two parts Gladiator (2000) and one part Titanic (1997) you'd come up with something pretty close to Pompeii. Sadly there is no Frankie Howerd which may have made some of the clichés more palatable. That said, Pompeii is fast paced, with some wonderfully realised visuals by director Paul W. S. Anderson.There are some interesting historic titbits in Janet Scott Batchler, Lee Batchler and Michael Robert Johnson's screenplay. The word 'savage' is continuously used, like it's going out of fashion as if another adjective could be found. The characters are functional and the secondary players are likable. Kit Harington while a good actor and even though ripped his casting is questionable given the gladiator angle and his stature. It's good to see Kiefer Sutherland bang his lines out in an English accent and have a ball as evil killer and philanderer Corvus. Strong actors, Sasha Roiz Carrie-Anne Moss and Jared Harris add some back bone to the investment sub-plot. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is notable and really steals the show as the gladiator Atticus due his freedom after his final fight.Even though a derivate mix it is entertaining throughout. And to its credit compared to Renny Harlin's, The Legend of Hercules (2014) this is an historical epic. Anderson's take on Pompeii's disaster is far more enjoyable than it should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About a history followed by a fictional tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of Paul WS Anderson movies were awesome and some were not, mixed bag to me. It is always a tricky to choose his movies to watch. Anyway, I went for it which was based on the historic disaster subject. Something like the movie 'Titanic', only theme was based on the real, but the story was a fictional. I was curious about the merge of newly written story than what I heard about Pompeii in history books.Todays graphics on the fingertip is the reason to recreating the historic movies. The second century after the motion picture was invented is on course to right direction. Many filmmakers utilised it very well and some are overly whelmed with too much graphics like the movie '300'. But still those were awesome to revisit ancient time just like we assumed it to be while reading history books. So my expectations were usual to see men with beautiful costumes and to know more about our extinct cultures.This was the romance tale with lots of actions and adventures. This movie badly missed the star powers. Since it was a German-Canadian collaboration the cast was recruited from everywhere to make it an international product. Well, I thought the lead actor was a little short though his performance was good. The others like Emily Browning, Kiefer Southerland and Adewale were better, but the pace of the movie did not give them more opportunity to exhibit and develop their respective characters.Yes, it was the story which rushed too fast towards the ending. Another 20 minutes of drama in the initial parts would have been the perfect setup for the story like this. Especially the character Cassia needed it and also a bit Atticus before all these three meet at one point. So it seems the movie maker's plan was commercial purpose than quality of art and presentation. Anyway the entertainment was there, but not the value and standards. A slight disappointment movie, though it can be watchable at once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PompeiiThe best part about living next to a volcano is that it doubles as a garbage incinerator.Unfortunately, it looks as though the civilization in this disaster movie have overextended theirs. Brought to the great city as a slave turned gladiator, Milo (Kit Harington) makes a name for himself when he comes to the assistance of Cassia (Emily Browning), the daughter of Pompeii's ruler (Jared Harris).In the area Milo must face Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), a warrior with only one more fight to win his freedom.Observing the match is the Roman Senator (Kiefer Sutherland) who murdered Milo's mother years earlier.When Mount Vesuvius erupts, Milo gets his chance at revenge and love.Disrespecting the many lives lost in AD 79, this Paul W. S. Anderson effects laden epic earns points for the devastation but not for the simplistic delivery.And to think, it could've all been avoid with more virgin sacrifices.

		<fullReview>Blow - referring to how much this movie flops over its own fumbling feet.Where to start... with the costumes of course. One would think that one of the key aspects for not only bringing the actors into such a time piece but also the audience would be impeccable costumes, with meticulous detail. Costumes that told a story of another world, another time and a forgotten era. But instead we are served stiff organza in colours reminiscent of luminescent bile. Glitzy gold that looks fresh out of a plastic wrapper. Chiffon that flowed like cotton, and cotton the moved like wool. Perpendicular leather straps and even spaced buckles on folk that look peasant like. Their hair was pretty good though. Especially Kit Harrington. In fact Kit was perky and the most pleasant aspect about Pompeii.There is a gladiator contest which kinda blows.The stadium crumbles in the most cheesy fashion.Mr Sutherland manages to embarrass himself with his physicality and accent.Carry-Anne Moss will never be believable as a useless sub servant woman.The eruption is not as compelling as one would hope.The destruction is cheesy and lame.The couple kinda give up in the end.I would not recommend this. In fact I would warn against it. I tend to believe that a film that relies too heavily on spectacle can never really massage the cognitive aspect I so crave from storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's just like a porn ... you're waiting for the action and the eruption ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Only death is freedom for a gladiator."The movie "Pompeii" isn't really a disaster. Of course, it is not in favor of this film that the unraveling is already known in advance. So it's not so that you are going to look up surprised as the end credits are scrolling over the screen and you look stunned at the screen, stammering and muttering in yourself "Damn, I really didn't see this coming !". If you are going to enumerate the disaster movies, you get a long list . Of course, the content of such films is already known in advance. In "The Poseidon Adventure" and "Titanic" the ships in the respective films run into some trouble. In "Twister", the twisters made a mess. "2012" was about the year 2012 when the world is experiencing a major flood. "Earthquake" was, you'll never believe it, about a huge earthquake and the aftermath. And recently, "The Impossible" shows a realistic picture of the 2004 tsunami that flooded Thailand. There is in other words not a disaster in the world where there is no film about .I suppose that anybody who reads the title and looks at the movie poster immediately realizes that the main subject of this film is the eruption of Vesuvius in the year 79. An eruption that caused the city of Pompeii, a prosperous town with all the utilities, infrastructures and wealth, was covered with a meter thick layer of ash. This fact alone is not much to fill a 100-minute film. The success of this film depends on the ancillary stories that are spun around it. But in the end the perception of a disaster movie such as "Pompeii" is like a porn movie. Nobody cares about a decent storyline in such a movie. Usually, it absolutely makes no sense at all. About performances we won't make much fuss. The important thing is that it has an attractive and appetizing appearance. It's then just waiting for the action to start and we witness a discharge in ecstasy where each slit,cavern and hole is filled with a hot substance. This movie is "almost" similar.The side story is twofold. The story of the surviving Celtic Milo (Kit Harington) who lives as a slave in London, where he fights in kind of arena battles in the slums and finally ends up in Pompeii to deliver a heroic battle against the giant gladiator, Atticus. The second part comprises a romantic theme. Cassia (Emily Browning), the daughter of a wealthy developer in Pompeii, falls in love with this muscled barbarian. She finds herself also in a difficult situation because she might be forced into a marriage with the cruel, corrupt senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) who arrived with a regiment in Pompeii to inspect the building plans.Eventually, it wasn't the storyline I disliked. It's not that bad. Even the corny love story. It's an impossible love since the gap between their origin is so unbridgeable. The gladiator part and the eruption of the Vesuvius guarantees this being an action packed film and was quite enjoyable to watch. What really bothered me were sometimes the terribly exaggerated situations that arose. Pompeii wasn't founded at the foot of Vesuvius. It was miles away from it. That's also the reason why it was excavated in such good condition. There were no lava floods and there weren't rocks catapulted on it. Pompeii was covered by a layer of ash caused by a pyroclastic cloud. But then again, it looked damn spectacular in this way.I suppose Milo also has well-developed calf muscles, because the distance between the arena and the villa where Cassia was imprisoned was huge. The tsunami that followed the eruption, was abruptly stopped after a boat was crammed into the gate of the city wall. So ridiculous. And it's totally stupid to assume that you can escape a pyroclastic cloud riding a horse."Pompeii" still was action-packed and a sparkling sandals movie where the graphics of the catastrophe were sometimes excellent but not realistic visualized. A mix of "Gladiator" and any known love story about an impossible love, finished with a bit of "The horse whisperer" and "Dante's Peak". The love story didn't quite appeal to me. The gladiator/action/disaster part did. From the opening scene of the massacre of a tribe of Celts by the Romans and the fights between gladiators in the arena, to the devastating eruption of Vesuvius with a mass hysteria as a result. The feeling that I had however, was as going to look at a grand fireworks : it ends with a huge, impressive blast that resonates for a long time in your ears, and the next day you already forgot what color and shape it was. A storm in a teacup. BOOM!More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>films like these have been made before by many directors like Ridley Scott for example films like these are about historical events on Rome &amp; there maybe some fictional events in them but Pompeii 2014 focus more on natural disaster then actual theme itself we all remember 2012 2009 Starting John Cusack that film was hilarious while this one is little serious the use of cgi is heavy here specially when the mountain explodes &amp; lava looks like a giant fireball thrown from some comic book character like Surtur or Dormammu from marvel universe.the plot:Milo is a slave who just became a gladiator in 79 A.D a tournament is held by Corvus soon in the middle of a fight the Mount Vesuvius erupts as chaos spread everywhere Milo must get Cassia his true love out of the hidden area where she is locked away before its too late.the cast:Keifer Sutherland accent was weird he looked out of shape,Carrie Anne Moss gets wasted,Kit Harington did show some skills but script never allowed it,there is only one actress who looked so beautiful here is Emily Browning its quite possible the only reason one should watch this film.more then the acting the visual scenes take over everything i wanted to see some more acting &amp; good dialogs but the lava is one important cast member you just cant wish it goes away or stops for some minutes there maybe flaws here &amp; this comes from director Paul w.s Anderson we all know who he is the famous video game films director this is a bit overdone on cgi but worth watchable at least once.overall if you like a simple film thats worth your money just do not raise expectations &amp; you will like Pompeii 2014 my rating is 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In writing reviews I try to be honest and state my feelings, even when they are contradictory.This film is of very low value. The plot is the most predictable one: I wonder who did not foresee the end from the very beginning. The love story is the least moving you can imagine: I wonder who could possibly feel in love with Emily Browning or Kit Harington at the end of the movie. The catastrophe is rendered in the most unbelievable way: I wonder who hasn't had the same thought during the endless final scene. And since the film is PG-13 I wonder how many spectators could actually have not seen 'the Gladiator' (which was released in 2000) and have not drawn the due comparison.On the other hand I had fun, even though for the wrong reasons maybe. And in the end fun is the aim of entertainment.Amen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find this movie struggles with its identity, it starts out as what looks like a forbidden love between an aristocrats daughter and a down trodden gladiator. This plot line in itself was a movie, and I was finding the love story very engaging and the battles reminded me of an episode of Spartacus. About 45mins in, one wonders why this movie is even called Pompeii as it is rattling along nicely without any involvement from the volcano looming in the background.Just as this little sub-movie reaches its climax, the director decides it's time he introduces the main character. This is the point where to movie looses me, it goes from good story telling and a nice amount of suspense to a six year old throwing a tantrum and destroying everything in its path. The explosions are ludicrous, the tidal wave doesn't even make sense, I think the director got volcano confused with earthquake but worst of all the protagonists die. I am not always for a happy ending, but the story was so diluted by the time they actually die that the sadness of it all was lost in the stupidity the preceded it and I was just glad it had all come to and end.If you've got nothing better to do and you're all out of good movies to watch, then give this a go. Or just watch the first 45mins and treat it as a pilot episode to a TV show that never aired.Stars **</fullReview>

Although I must admit that the action packed fight scenes and some occasional shots of perfectly sculptured abdominals definitely compensated for the obvious flaws.If you remove the twenty or so minutes of actual fighting within the film, what you're left with is about a hundred minutes of what could essential be a fairytale. Though the entire thing was littered with improbable scenarios, I found that there were three scenes so ludicrous that I could not help but laugh.Read the full rant I did on this film, clearly stipulating why this film failed to impress me. http://thatgirlreadallaboutit.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/pompeii_7.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay my apologizes for presuming in the title that viewers and fans of this movie also have seen the famous Starz series 'Spartacus'. Btw if you like this genre and have not then you should.Back to Pompeii - certainly have a nice thread of a story of a destitute boy turned slave turned gladiator. And then as icing throw in the angle of revenge and romance. Was a great setup hell even better than Spartacus. However the movie lost it as trying too hard to play on the lines of the Starz series and therefore being overshadowed by it. To add to the watering down was some poor acting by the lead actor, actress and his gladiator buddy. Matter of fact the villain camp starting with the corrupt senator did a much better acting job. The fights were a complete miss in one instance a gashed neck produces no blood! Better acting and rock solid production would have made this movie a classic but alas it was not to be.</fullReview>

I mean the guy sounded like and acted like the B*stard son of the Great Frankie Howerd and Kenneth Williams, whilst, at the same time, trying to act sinister by sucking his upper lip over his teeth every time he opened his mouth. If they ever made Carry on Transylvania he make a great camp Dracula.Then there's the hero - The Celt........WWE anybody? His whole village massacred before him aged 3 or 4. We don't know what happened to him between the ages of 5 and 25......a bit like Jesus. What we do know is he develops Jedi like abilities in horse whispering and sword fighting.He also forgets his "savage" ways and becomes a love sick puppy.Im not sure if the production crew ever went to Pompeii either as it appears that apart from the pyroclastic ass whooping Pompeii received it also took a good kicking from a tsunami.All in all that is 2 hours of my life I will never get back.</fullReview>

Not as bad as you'd think but that's provided you already expect it to be generic, the obvious flaw is always the easiest to slide to the side.It is a bit like a heavy metal gig: the imagery cannot upset as it has nothing to do with life, the dumb lyrics can be waved off, this isn't a time for thought anyway, so it becomes all about the crunching sound that you can tap a foot to. It's not pure enough, they tried to mix in a bit of a plaintive Gladiator tone, shoehorn a love interest, a commentary about inhuman Romans (somehow the film expects us to believe the kindly father innocently amassed a fortune), freedom from oppression; boring. Our placement in history is cartoonish anyway: there's even the digital shot that rises high above rainy Londinium into a map of the empire and travels down to Italy to descend on Pompeii.The anticipated climax is the burst of cinematic energy that tears through the stage of trivial drama as if the gods had enough with the nonsense of plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For such a good cast with clearly a good budget I'm surprised how the managed to make such a bad film it's not terrible but it's not brilliant either. I love Kit but I don't think he's commanding enough in this role he's up against Russell Crowe's performance in gladiator and that's one tall order. I think Kit will be a great actor but he's not authoritative enough in the role he doesn't have Crowe's presence yet. The script is weak with weak dialogue. This isn't a patch on Gladiator or Rome the TV series I would watch both before watching this. I think Kit needs to be more assertive but he's still young doesn't project the power that Crowe so masterfully delivered and I think a role like this would of probably be better in a few years and films time. That being said if a few years time. I can't tell if it's the framing to editing but the whole thing feels a bit too much like a sci-fi channel made for TV movie, obviously this quality is in the cast and the sets and general presentation look like a good quality but somehow what should be a good movie just misses the mark. Oh yeah and what's up with Kieffer's accent lol it's comical</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the movie, the Gladiator, around 180 AD, there was General Maximus Decimus Meridius, Rome's finest military commander, in line to succeed Emperor Marcus Aurelius and become the empire's regent. Treachery and skulduggery ensures a fall from grace, the murder of his family, followed by slavery, and his rise as a gladiator and leader of Rome. At the other corner in James Cameroon's Titanic, it is 1912, there is Rose DeWitt Bukater, who boarded the fateful ship and stole a million hearts. What if these two fictional characters undergo a change in scenery, travel back in time, to 79 AD, just in time to see the Vesuvius erupt in dramatic fashion? You get Pompeii.Pompeii is the epic tale of Milo, a slave turned gladiator, who is in a race against time to save his love Cassia, the daughter of a Roman merchant who is betrothed to an evil Senator, as a once grand city crumbles all around him. Replace the most famous iceberg in history with the most famous volcanic eruption, spend big bucks on admittedly out of the world visual effects, but take away all the conviction, emotion and sense of occasion of the sources, lather the script with clichés and put in hopelessly miscast actors- lo you have Pompeii, the most beautifully boring picture in 2014 till date. Make no mistakes though- the recreation of the ancient town is exceptional, the gladiatorial fights are excellent, and when Vesuvius unleashes a mother lode of pain, it is an eye popping spectacle. Admittedly, with Paul WS Anderson at the helm, one could not expect too much. He does not have the gravitas to make an epic. Look what he did to Three Musketeers. His resume after all also includes the Alien vs Predator, and Resident Evil series, among other turds. Giving him a history based movie without authentic material is the first mistake, and then the fact that he resorts to every dramatic cliché- revenge, love, sacrifice is to be expected. 30 minutes into the film, you kind of want the dramatics to be done by and the volcano to explode, which it does in style. Kit Harrington as Milo is coming straight off Game of Thrones Jon Snow. While he is industrious in the action sequences, he does not have the charisma to pull off a larger than life character well enough. Emily Browning and Carrie Anne Moss have always played strong willed characters, but here they are reduced to damsels in distress. And a smirking Keifer Sutherland as the villainous Senator Corvus just goes through the motion. 16000 people died, and two whole cities were obliterated. There itself is pathos enough to create an involving tale. But then it is about Rome, and so there has to be a forbidden love story, gladiators, corrupt senators, amphitheaters, and lashings galore. Little more than the visual effects to enjoy in this one, which in turn is a just about adequate guilty pleasure in itself. Unlike what the movie poster says, you have been warned. There is escape. Watch it in blu-ray! 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Again Hollywood execs decided to redo some scenes of Troy, Gladiator and Titanic. First step was to find an Orlando Bloom lookalike, second find a script written by some high school kids and finally... use an Apple II for special effects. There you have it, a disastrous disaster movie.Certainly a movie using Pompeii as location should use in its scenes places that former visitors can relate to, not just the colliseum. I kept waiting for the flour mill &amp; bakery, the frescoes and the bath houses. If the script writer had taken the time to visit Pompeii before writing this movie his work would be a lot better... oh, I forgot, the kids were at school an the script was just a weekend homework.A horse joined Milo and Cassia, then Cassia's horse rejoined them again, hey!, it's a love story, what happened to Cassia's horse. Milo should have it on hand to save her in the final scenes, celluloid is an expensive thing to waste when your'e filming clitches.So folks, don't waste your time, if you pay to watch this movie you are sending a wrong signal to Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pompeii tells us the story of a slave-turned-gladiator that races against time to save his beloved. Already a cliché...but it keeps going. Pompeii is a cliché-fest. Every cheesy moments, lines, plot twists you have seen before in the last 20 years are present in Pompeii. I don't want to give any spoilers, but I don't even think that's possible...because you've seen all of it before. The loved one is promised to another man, falls in-love with the slave, the slave defies the masters, then...disaster movie: the Vulcano erupts, stuff exploding, fire balls falling and even the tsunami...come on. It's so basic and predictable, that it looks like the movie was made to be eye-candy. Watching it in 3D is kind of fun, but it isn't great also, because the special effects are good, but not mind-blowing. The acting is as expected:Not good, not bad...decent. It's a mediocre film trying to hard to be an epic. It's watchable, but, chances are, you will be bored and annoyed by the cliché-fest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Titanic Volcano</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can just imagine the pitch for this movie: Titanic meets Gladiator. A love story against the backdrop of a volcano eruption. Those 2 previously mentioned films where hi-budget classics made by 2 of the most capable visual directors in the industry. And although Paul WS Anderson also did some great work (Event Horizon, Resident Evil) he isn't on the same level and great films are not something you can just clone by replicating the same elements. Pompeii on paper has everything to succeed: great sets, production design and costumes. Superb VFX (the destruction scenes look magnificent) and great (yes Gladiator-like) music. The lead is played by John Snow (Kit Harington from Game of Thrones) and Emily Browning (Sucker Punch) who both deliver decent performances. Kiefer Sutherland is the somewhat stereotypical baddie (cfr Billy Zane's part in Titanic) who stands in the way of their forbidden love (slave &lt;&gt; roman noble / Titanic: poor boy &lt;&gt; rich girl). The gladiator fights are well done but lack the visceral quality Gladiator's fights had. It's difficult to say what makes films art, what makes them work. Pompeii is a great product but it's not art in the sense that it lacks to connect on an emotional level. The drama, the human element is underdeveloped and you need to care for the characters enough to identify with them. With all that said, it really didn't deserve to bomb this bad and it surely deserves a chance on your home screen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a director like Paul W.S. Anderson you kinda know what you're gonna get: eye candy, devoid of any emotion, characterization, or logic. But it's usually nice to look at. Same here. I enjoyed the establishing shots of Pompeii before the volcano eruption, and I certainly enjoyed the mayhem during the eruption. There's a fine 15-minute demo reel in here somewhere. Unfortunately the visual effects are far more convincing than any of the human characters, who are suffering from cliché-ridden dialog and wildly inconsistent, borderline ridiculous behaviour; Kiefer Sutherland is fearlessly over-acting, while Kit Harrington does not act at all, he just pouts and gazes into the camera with his sick-puppy-look. I won't even begin to list all the historic inaccuracies, as there are way too many and there's a maximum of 1.000 words for this review. So if you want to watch this movie, go ahead. You could do worse. But then again, there are so many better movies out there, why waste your time with this dribble?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Volcanic Titanic - Anderson's budget blockbuster crashes and burns on a bonfire of tired clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rare case of a film that's even worse than its trailer suggests, this heavily hyped high concept disaster movie proves that some directors, even talented ones like Paul WS Anderson (whose dumb but fun B-pics I've always loved) should not stray too far from their comfort zone. It also sadly recalls 'Titanic"and "Pearl Harbour" in that it turns a true life human tragedy of unimaginable proportions into an effects ridden extravaganza that ignores the real tales of suffering and sacrifice to focus on a cheesy and unrealistic romantic melodrama instead, thereby proving both a gross insult to the dead and the audience's intelligence!You can already imagine how the pitch meeting went, "Sword and sandals is big at the moment! Why not do a movie based on the destruction of Pompeii, but in 3D! And since its set in Rome we can bring some stuff from "Gladiator" in, plus being a real life disaster we can riff on "Titanic"! too! You know, pretty spirited girl from the nice side of town falls in love with the poor bad boy who captures her heart and they have to flee from the evil moustache twirling pure evil suitor she's promised to?. While we're at it we can mix in a bit of 'Brave heart' too with a Celt hero whose family were slaughtered by evil foppish nobles growing up to get his convenient revenge! Its a sure fire hit! What could possibly go wrong?"What indeed?The obvious problem is that you have a film that strives for meaning, pathos and human tragedy while consisting entirely of shopworn clichés and hackneyed conventions that people were already laughing at in the 1850s! Add to this dialogue so awful and tired that you'd swear this was a Monty Python parody and a pair of lead 'actors' (allegedly) with no presence, character or passion and whom together have less chemistry than an average British school leaver and already things are floundering. Why not compound the problem with pedestrian direction (from a director who is anything but) and absolutely no sense of building tension, urgency or import at all? OK? So the story bit stinks, but people didn't come for that, did they? They came for the exploding mountain and the devastating eye candy carnage, and surely that rocks, right? Surely we wouldn't' just get some cheap fireballs, ash clouds and unrealistic CGI tsunamis for ten minutes after an hour plus of pointless bull sheet filler, right? WRONG!! And as a final finger to those with any knowledge about Roman times at all it offers up historical, social and political inaccuracies so chasmicly vast that they make "300 Rise of an Empire" look like a documentary!Blame cannot be apportioned too squarely on the makers who clearly did the best they could with what they had to work with. The biggest problem is that this isn't a multi million dollar Hollywood blockbuster but a Canadian-German low budget B-movie from a team who specialise in fun video game popcorn actioners writing a huge cheque it cannot possibly cash.The over reach is painful and it seems everyone was aware of it. Anderson uses none of his visual inventiveness nor the spark of wit and cleverness that made flicks like "Mortal Kombat" "Event Horizon" "AvP" and "Resident Evil" so memorable, and the few talented stars roped in for an easy payday just coast and hope for the best. This is particularly true of Jared Harris and Carrie-Anne 'Trinity' Moss playing heroine Cassia's merchant parents who smile and walk through like guests attending a party they'd rather not be at. Kiefer Sutherland actually plays his evil suitor-guy who killed heroes family Villain as a running Boris Karloff impersonation! Obviously he did it to make his risible part bearable (that or they originally wanted Hank Azaria and he was the sub?) But It speaks volumes that Anderson LET him! Kit Harrington and Emily Browning look good (though nothing like a Celt or an Italian) and that's it. Its not cruel to suggest they stick to modelling! Only the ever dependable Adewale Akinnuoye Agbaje invests any energy or élan into his performance as the "black best friend/Gladiator with just one more day on the job before he retires' and as with other movies he outshines the jobbing cast around him and provides the only human being in a world off cardboard cut outs.Looking to its 'inspirations' it tries to achieve a tragic poignancy, a Gnostic victory in death over a corrupt and cruel world, yet (for us at least) it was just the final rotten cherry on the burnt cake. Perhaps after having watched "Amazing Spiderman 2" and Sam Mendes London stage production of "King Lear" in the proceeding days we were comparing it unfavourably with shows that can do tragic endings properly?An amusing incidental irony is that the star of the real 'Gladiator' headlines another classical disaster blockbuster in cinemas at the same time as this, and while 'Noah' has its flaws it still achieves everything 'Pompeii' tries and fails to in droves.Not a total disaster it can be enjoyed if you know what you are letting yourself in for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad film, but entertainingly so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Evil Roman Senator Kiefer Sutherland, overdosing on ham, wipes out an entire tribe of British horse whisperers except for a small boy who grows up to be someone I've never heard of playing a character called Milo. Milo gets sent to be a gladiator in Pompeii, where he impresses rich girl Emily Browning by killing her horse. Imagine his surprise when evil Senator Kiefer Sutherland turns up to do evil things. Imagine everyone's surprise when Vesuvius decides to have a bit of a coughing fit.There is an excellent novel called Pompeii by respected author Robert Harris in which the lead up to the 79AD eruption is told through the problems faced by an engineer tasked with solving the problem of why the Pompeii aqueduct has gone dry. Sadly, this film is not based on that book. Instead we get a load of sub-Gladiator nonsense leading up to the admittedly well-realised eruption which, after all, is the real reason for this film to exist.This film is full of bad points - the "story" is pretty rubbish, the two leads are completely forgettable (and Emily Browning looks weirder than usual), much of what happens is just plain stupid (a 4-horse chariot through the ruined streets of a town which is being smashed to pieces by a volcano?), Jared Harris and Carrie-Anne Moss put in what amount to pointless cameos, and Kiefer Sutherland overacts enough for any five other actors - if the Romans had pantomime villain moustachios, Sutherland would have twirled his constantly while uttering "Mwah hah ha!".But the film has what, to me, were two saving graces. One is that same Kiefer Sutherland performance. It is one of those examples of bad acting which is so over the top as to be entertaining - think Alan Rickman in Robin Hood, Prince Of Thieves. And the other is the eruption itself. Oh, and kudos for killing everyone, including the two romantic leads - I like that, even if it does bankrupt any emotional investment you may have made in what comes before.This is a bad film but, for me, it was one of those bad films where the bad is entertaining.The 3D was very poor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Titanic with lava.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part historical epic, part love story, part disaster movie, Pompeii is what you get if you throw Volcano, Gladiator and Romeo &amp; Juliet into a blender and flick the switch i.e. a colourful mess that is vaguely entertaining but not overly palatable.Slave Milo (Kit Harington) has become a formidable gladiator and is taken to Pompeii so he can fight (and die) on a grand stage. On the way he meets a wealthy merchant's daughter, Cassia (Emily Browning), and falls in love with her. She reciprocates but, naturally, their differing class and the fact that villainous Roman senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) wants her for himself, rather gets in the way of true love. And then there's the small matter of Mount Vesuvius threatening to erupt and wipe Pompeii off the map for 1500 years.Everything on display in Pompeii feels copied (badly) from something else and diluted in the process: The friendship that forms between Milo and his fellow gladiator, Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), bears a striking resemblance to that of Maximus and Juba in Gladiator and as for the oik falling for girl above his station and battling her betrothed, what is that if not Titanic with lava? Harrington doesn't cut it as a leading man here and gives a substandard Orlando Bloom impression, though he swings a sword nicely. Browning fares better though she is too often troubled by the cumbersome dialogue to relax and give a fully convincing performance, a problem shared by Carrie-Anne Moss as her mother, Aurelia, and several others.Sutherland chews the scenery as the scoundrel of Pompeii but what is he doing with his lips? His effort to find a villainous sneer is distracting and vaguely humorous rather than chilling. Akinnuoye-Agbaje emerges as the star of the film, managing to be imposing and loyal as Atticus without slipping into pastiche or crumpling under the weight of Lee and Janet Scott Batchler's verbose screenplay, only their second (after My Name is Modesty ? nope, me neither!) since 1995's Batman Forever.Pompeii is an effects-driven movie that pleases the eye more than the soul. The initial effects of Vesuvius expelling plumes of bulbous smoke are great but we never see any rivers of lava; the opportunity for crispy fried human squandered. Pompeii is a visually attractive and vaguely entertaining flick that will engage teens that don't know better, but more discerning viewers will ultimately find it bland.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid entertainment, room for improvement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review on IMDb and I hope this one is well readable despite me not being a native speaker. I've recently watched the movie without knowing what I was about to see, so I could enjoy it without expectations of any sort - despite the fact that this movie should somehow be related to the city of Pompeji. Overall the movie did quite deliver in some ways, but surely not all. The room for character development is already restricted by the fact that the main story part of the movie seems to take place in something that feels like 24 hours or less. While the leadership of Pompeji, the Gladiators and the soldiers of Rome are portrayed quite detailed (I especially like the costumes, which are looking really great!), there is basically no interaction between any of them and the citizens of Pompeji. I would have loved to see some details about their everyday life, how they feel towards the main character. Of course this is a crossover between a medieval drama and a disaster movie, but it wouldn't have hurt to give some more of those many victims a face. The fights seem to be well executed and directed, although the main characters seem a bit overpowered compared to Roman soldiers. By itself the disaster delivered some great scenes - of course it doesn't reprise the original volcanic eruption of Pompeji which would possibly not result in much suspense. They added some more elements which surely weren't happening to Pompeji (to those interested in: it seems like they added up the 1755 Lisbon earthquake to the volcanic eruption of Pompeji).All in all this movie was diverting, but maybe not worth watching a second or third time in the near future. Acting was somewhere between mediocre and decent at average with nobody really excelling. VFX was also OK for a production that size. Nothing too bad, but nothing really special. However, 3D effects were a bitter better than the average 3D effects. I can't say anything about the score, which basically means that it was neither good nor bad. So not as bad as some reviews make it look like, but certainly not a new genre legend.Unfortunately I also have to state that the ending which was meant to be dramatic and epic only worked out as totally cheesy.</fullReview>

What i actually got in the movie was probably the worst love story since Star Wars Episode 2. Totally one dimensional characters and dialogues. Also from the trailer i did not anticipate that the entire film was going to revolve around this pathetic love story. Also, i hate it when films are totally unrealistic.

		<fullReview>There are no prizes for guessing what's going to happen (the eruption is history!) and who's going to make it to the final reel. The final moments actually belong in a much better movie, but getting there is just a low-rent re-run of TV's SPARTACUS with (much missed) less nudity and profanity. Kit Harington (cast because of GAME OF THRONES, obviously) could have been picked off the shelf at Hunks-R-Us; his charisma is no higher than Taylor Kitsch's in the best-forgotten 2012 JOHN CARTER, and there's no chemistry between him and the bland Ms Browning. Kiefer Sutherland looks bored by the whole shoot; his dodgy English accent is almost laughable (alas, not laugh-out-loud funny). The script deserves a Golden Raspberry.The special effects are nothing special - we've seen better in other volcano movies (notably DANTE'S PEAK) - and the 3D doesn't seem to add much. This is another of those disaster movies that turns out to be a movie disaster. Let's hope GODZILLA doesn't turn out to be a let-down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible, Horrible Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I opened an IMDb account just to warn people. This movie is pure garbage. I mean really, this is an awful, empty, idiotic movie. I wouldn't recommend it to no one. the plot is stupid, the acting is embarrassing, there is not a single thing in this movie that is worth watching. There are many good actors in this movie yet none of them, none, do anything to justify the title "good actors". I have no idea why on earth would someone produce such a movie. I decided to watch this movie because of the big names but that was a mistake. I have no idea who are the people who rate this movie with more than one star, but please, let me take whatever they are taking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only two words comes to mind when it comes to reviewing this film, well actually one word. Disappointing. Reason being the plot that I was taught at school was in A.D 79 Mt, Vesuvius erupted and killing with the ashes that whatever position you were in at impact, you were made a statue. Now this all occurred the Mt Vesuvius in the film, all within the last half hour. A most disappointing film. The film took 1 full hour to show the full gladiator fighting slavery etc., Now personally I never knew there was such thing as slavery in Roman Empire time. I knew in US but in Roman???? Nope never knew. As I said to the lads Brendan O' F and Eoghan B, if you want to see swords fighting, gladiator style, go and look at Game Of Thrones or whatever. Funny I should mention Game of Thrones the character Milo plays a character in GOT. What was most poignant thou, was the last scene whereby Milo and the Casaa('Scuse the spelling), died doing what they loved best kissing. It was at that moment that they were frozen to sculpture. Even the review of RTE's Morning Edition his quote "Where is the volcano, he exclaimed numerous times"</fullReview>

Ad writers from such *great* movies like Batman -ForeverYou end with a silly love story without any actual depth - and just happens to occur along a major know catastrophe-- sorry guys but Catastrophe movies are bad for a reason.- End result known. and not much of a villain in the form of mountains or icebergs.... it just becomes settings.- Just like Titanic.To garnish this dish: copy almost directly gladiator fights, settings, even bloody ad-verbatim dialog!from the Gladiator movie. = end result bad shrimp cocktail - that will make you sick- or spit it out.Highlights... : Kit- still Knows Nothing. Emily- could have made this movie kick ass if she pulled out a few guns and started shooting Steam Nazi Zombies near the end---- around midway I started to nod off and dream of this. Kiefer- got to practice a seriously interesting accent- never heard before and kept me curious throughout the movie. Considering a fair budget and fair actors... I can only blame writers and directors for making this.In our time; are writers really the thing to get from the discount bin? seriously? There are /fic writers out there with higher skill..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Titanic but with a volcano</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am funny this way - sometimes I love movies because of the action and the entertainment and sometimes I dislike movies of the same reason. When you name or base a movie of an event that is of interest to me and the world with the interest itself, such as "Titanic" or in this case, "Pompeii" you expect to see a bit of a disaster. In a way, both Titanic and Pompeii might as well have been a documentary from National Geographic simply because we want to know more about the disasters and nothing else. I just don't care about Rose and Jack and their Romeo and Julia-like love for each other and in Pompeii, I don't care about a love story that is made up in a Hollywood-esque way. My interest lies in the title of the movie and nothing else. Of course this means that up till 1:10 of the movie I am playing with my mobile phone, tweeting, reading news and with a quarter of an eye watching what's happening on the screen. I have no interest what so ever in love stories and political feuds - I am here to see the volcano erupt and to see how "they" managed to capture the horror of the event. Which means I could easily fast-forward an hour because that's when the "action" starts. Some might now think of me as a dull and boring movie enthusiast that isn't even worthy of reviewing a movie like this one. So be it. And perhaps a NG documentary would have suited me better, since I don't care about made-up love stories that are more or less invented for the Hollywood feel of it all. Okay, there is a build-up to get to know the main characters and you might get emotional and close to them in a typical Hollywood way, but focusing on this when you name a movie after one of the world's most known disasters, is fooling your audience. And at some point I am sick and tired of this. Picturing an event known for certain things, should focus on them, nothing else. So yes, I might go to National Geographic or Discovery Channel next time to get the real idea of what happened. Because this is just pathetic. But that's what you are dealing with when wanting to base a movie on an actual event - stay true to the known events or make up you own story.I prefer the first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pompeii Clich?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had hopes walking into this film. Not high hopes, but hopes none the less. With a reasonable cast attached to this project, I was hoping for a solid story line attached to a history lesson. What we got was a bunch of clichés thrown together that, if you've seen Gladiator or any of Roland Emerich's disaster films, you'll feel like you've seen this movie before.Of course, if you've heard of Pompeii, than you probably know of its demise at the hands of an erupting Mt Vesuvius. The Roman town's final days are the backdrop for a love story set in the time of swords and sandals. Milo (Kit Harrington) is a skilled gladiator, sent to the doomed coastal city on his master's behest, to entertain the crowds in battle within the colosseum. He of course attracts the attention of Cassia (Emily Browning), daughter of the town's rulers (Jared Harris and Carrie-Anne Moss, both horribly underused), who, in turn, is being pursued by the conniving Senator Corvus (Keither Sutherland). Corvus, in typical movie story overlay, is responsible for the death of Milo's family when he was just a boy, and his clich?d bad guy ticks all the usual and predictable boxes. As a clash between Milo and Corvus comes to a head, Mt Vesuvius performs its party piece, and the movie turns into a survival quest for all its leads, with Milo and Cassia doing everything to escape the impending doom raining down on the city, as well as the wrath of Corvus and his cohorts.As I mentioned before, if you've seen Gladiator or any disaster film of recent, than you can pretty much take a guess at what your in for here. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if director Paul W.S. Anderson had a few viewing of Ridley Scott's Gladiator before making this film, as some of the scenes are almost taken verbatim. There was one section of this film where I took a guess at a spoken line that was coming up, simply because it looked like a remake of a scene from Scott's classic. Sure enough, a few seconds later, up it popped. The storyline is so disappointingly stock-standard, and you can't help but feel that the studio executives wanted to make a movie about the destruction of Pompeii, and simply threw a half-hearted effort of a script at it.The performers do what they can, but they're given precious little to work with. Harrington, looking ultra buff I must say, does OK with his lead role, but doesn't really test himself away from his Games of Thrones typecast. Its disappointing, as I've quite liked Harrington's effort in GOT, and I hope he gets another chance to prove himself on the big screen. Sutherland is disappointingly clich?d in his bad guy role, and his attempt at an English accent is rather cringeworthy at times. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje stands out as the best performance from this, with his role as Milo's gladiatorial compatriot, Atticus, the only shining light on what is mostly disappointing.But I suspect the cast have been let down by what really is a rather cut-and-paste script. There's no twists, no real drama built. All the characters story lines are just sideshows to the main event, which is the eruption. The effects of mountain's final display and its subsequent destruction of Pompeii is pretty impressive, and is by far and away the best part of this film. However, its not enough to rescue this flick. Anyone hoping for a history lesson from this film will be sorely disappointing, as precious little is garnered about life in Pompeii, and, from memory, I'm not even sure the name of the mountain is mentioned even once.This isn't a terrible film, but its just such a disappointment that Anderson and Co. decided to make such a routine effort of a film. I can't remember the last time a blockbuster film genuinely gave me a mental workout, or provided a plot twist that shocked or surprised me. Pompeii didn't do the job, and I didn't exactly learn anything either. Some originality here would've been much appreciated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a mixture of 'GLADIATOR', 'SPARTACUS: WAR OF THE DAMMED' and 'TITANIC'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'POMPEII': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Director Paul W.S. Anderson's new $100 million flick is a 'sword-and-sandal' romantic disaster film. It's loosely based on history and set during the destruction of an ancient Roman town (Pompeii) in 79 A.D. Britannia. The movie stars Kit Harington (of 'GAME OF THRONES' fame), Emily Browning, Kiefer Sutherland, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Carrie-Anne Moss and Jared Harris and was written by Janet Scott Batchler and Lee Batchler (who also co-wrote 'BATMAN FOREVER') as well as Michael Robert Johnson. It's definitely not high quality entertainment but unless you're a really big film snob (or just hate the genre) you should probably find it (at least mildly) amusing.Harington plays Milo, a slave-turned-gladiator who witnessed his mother and entire people (a tribe of Celtic horsemen) murdered by Corvus (Sutherland), and his Roman army, when he was just a young boy (Dylan Schombing). 17 years later he's boughten by the slave owner Graecus (Joe Pingue), for his gladiator skills, and taken to Pompeii with other slaves. He meets Cassia (Browning), along the way, while putting her fallen horse out of it's misery. They're immediately drawn to each other but their love is forbidden as Cassia is the daughter of Severus (Harris) and Aurelia (Moss), the city rulers. She's also the object of Corvus's affection, who is now a Senator visiting Pompeii. Milo (known only as 'the Celt') is to do battle with a champion gladiator named Atticus (Akinnuoye-Agbaje), who is seeking his freedom (through what is supposed to be his final fight), all for the amusement of Corvus. Things become more complicated when the volcano, Mount Vesuvius, erupts.The movie, like almost all of Anderson's films (who should never be confused with the great Paul Thomas Anderson), is what I'd consider a guilty pleasure. I found it to be pretty cheesy but highly entertaining. It looks great, the effects are cool and the action scenes are amusing. The acting is decent enough and the characters are mostly, at least somewhat, likable (especially Atticus). It does feel like a mixture of a lot of other popular films and TV shows (like 'GLADIATOR', 'SPARTACUS: WAR OF THE DAMMED' and 'TITANIC') but that's what is kind of fun about it. A 'B movie' at it's most grand!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-G3-O3wYgs</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . sank (according to Hollywood), half the population of POMPEII were sword fighting and chucking spears at each other while coughing up ash and dodging raining rocks, meteoric fire boulders, and threatening tsunami waves. Since gunfire erupted between the three main cast members followed by the movie TITANIC, among others, one can extrapolate that at least several hundred of the lost souls succumbed to "lead poisoning" BEFORE sinking beneath the waves. Similarly, at least half the population of POMPEII was run through by sword or spear PRIOR to being preserved by ash and lava. Thanks to Tinsel Town, each of these disasters can now be seen as only HALF the MASS death events history books suggest. Apparently, whenever people are caught up in a mini-Apocalypse, THE PURGE rules take effect, and all their pent-up anger breaks forth. Slaves kills masters, pursers kill passengers, kids kill parents, spouses off each other, and so forth. You should ask yourself now (before it's too late) WHICH of YOUR own coworkers, neighbors, friends, and relatives will be "breaking Jack Bauer" next time you get stuck in a TITANIC-like or POMPEII-style situation. NOW is the time to formulate your own plan of attack. Thanks, Hollywood, for provoking this train of thought BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Movie With Stunning Visuals... But Not So Stunning Leads...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pompeii is basically just Titanic with a volcano instead of a ship. But despite it copying various scenarios from Titanic, (Like the "bad guy" paying money so he can get on one of the boats to escape before anyone else) it is still a very thrilling and engaging ride. From the brutal opening scene to the sappy lame ending, it will grab a hold of your attention. Filled with stunningly beautiful visuals and well choreographed gladiator fight sequences, Pompeii has a lot of heart. It's too bad that the two lead characters were so wooden. But it's not the characters that are wooden, it's the actors. Kudos to Adewale Akkinouoye-Agbaje for giving the best performance in this movie for his portrayal of Atticus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pompeii</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pompeii narrates the story of a slave turned gladiator who finds himself in a race against time to save his true love, who has been betrothed to a corrupt Roman Senator. In the mean time Mount Vesuvius erupts, so he must fight to save his beloved as Pompeii crumbles around them. At first sight the story could appear the easiest plot ever made, in order to embody the city Historical events. A Classical-Tragic love story run through the film. Likely to be an Antique- Tragic version of Romeo &amp; Juliet. Where a beautiful romance happens to be frozen in time for ever. The damsel in distress surprisingly need a hero. But in fact, it's a little bit more complicated than that. This young woman, starring Emily Browning, is actually politically sharp, very clever, well educated and much more stronger than she seems. On the other hand Milo, starring Kit Harington, is in a dead wish. He saw Roman soldier exterminated his tribes when he was younger. As a result he don't care to live or die, he only intends to kill as many Romans as possible, until he met Cassia, then his vision changed steadily. Moreover, Pompeii deals with themes such as love, freedom, revenge, power and most importantly: class system. This last theme is highlighted by Milo and Cassia relationship, an impossible love. But also by the contrasts, the corner point in the film: the eruption of the volcano. at this particular moment each one of Pompeii's citizen are at the same level, facing death and loss. A reel microcosm story emerged throughout the film; with a great combination of characters, stories, love and action. Indeed, some bigger films often forget about the story, but here, Paul W.S Anderson knew how to use technology in the background, supporting the Historical facts. The only drawbacks of Pompeii would be a very slow beginning until the real point of the film: the City. Plus 3D is not compulsory till the very last 20 minutes of the film. Overall still a very good action disaster movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Man, A Woman, and A Volcano</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Resident Evil" director Paul W.S. Anderson must have loved both "Titanic" and "Gladiator" because "Pompeii" appropriates the template and tropes from those blockbusters. Nevertheless, "Pompeii" is not primarily a chick flick. "Game of Thrones" actor Kit Harington plays an enslaved warrior who lost his entire family when sadistic Romans slaughtered them in Britain. Harington is cast as the impoverished, but virtuous protagonist, while porcelain-faced Emily Browning plays Cassia, the pampered daughter of an affluent Pompeii entrepreneur. Cassia has had enough of Imperial Roman society and repellent Romans, specifically the wicked Senator Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) who displays no qualms about killing not only the enemy but also his own if the mood strikes him. Aside from an invincible African-American gladiator (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) already imprisoned at Pompeii, Anderson and his three scenarists confine themselves to this handful of characters, with a few loitering on the periphery. Indeed, characterization is kept to a demographic minimum. Not surprisingly, you'll sympathize with our tragic lovers while you'll abhor Corvus with a passion and applaud his comeuppance. If you've seen either "Titanic" or "Gladiator," you'll know what is going to happen to these characters before they do. "Batman Forever" co-scripters Janet Scott Batchler and Lee Batchler plus "Sherlock Holmes" scribe Michael Robert Johnson have recycled all the usual clichés. Anderson doesn't let anything interfere with the headlong momentum that he generates."Pompeii" unfolds in 62 AD in Britannia. A long-haired youngster, Milo (Dylan Schombing), escapes death from the swords of ruthless Roman soldiers. Corvus and his army annihilate Milo's tribe of Celtic horsemen. The Romans mistake young Milo for one of the dead and add his body to a pile of corpses. This is the familiar scene where the villains think our hero is dead, but really isn't dead. The last big-screen movie that used this trope was "The Lone Ranger." Nevertheless, the 'mistaken for dead' trope works dependably for "Pompeii." Eventually, after he proves his mettle on the battlefield as a superb horseman, Milo is enslaved. Years later, a Roman slave trader, Graecus (Joe Pingue) spots Milo, who has since acquired the moniker 'the Celt' for his fearless pugnacity. Milo is the equivalent of William Wallace in "Braveheart." Milo makes mincemeat out of all his adversaries. He winds up in Pompeii where he will clash swords with the undefeated champ, Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje of "Congo"), a bold combatant both agile and confident. Opposites through and through from pigment to pugnacity, these guys will have each other's back before the fat volcano sings.Our hero and heroine meet on the road to Pompeii. One of the horses drawing Cassia's carriage collapses. Milo intervenes despite the protest of his captor. As a member of the aristocracy, Cassia shields Milo from charges of insubordination for putting the horse out of its misery. She was on the way back from Rome where she had spent a year. Apparently, Cassia had a romantic relationship that ended awfully for both parties. Now, it is love at first sight when she sees Milo. The love that Milo feels for her will prompt him later to defy death. Meanwhile, Milo must battle lethal opponents in the arena. Eventually, Atticus and he become allies in the face of surely insurmountable odds. "Pompeii" boasts several exciting combat sequences, and the one in the arena against many Roman soldiers is reminiscent of something from his "Resident Evil" epics. Anderson orchestrates these close quarters combat scenes with agility and style. The actors parry and thrust in ways that bring out the ferocity and eloquence of the sword fights. Naturally, Cassia reacts with horror when Corvus demands she marry him or see her parents ruined. Jared Harris of "Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows" and Carrie Moss of "The Matrix" are relegated to secondary victim roles as Cassia's father Severus and mother Aurelia. Sadly, Moss models apparel without any gravity-defying martial arts moves."Pompeii" is predictable, but exciting nonsense. About an hour into the action, Mount Vesuvius erupts, and comparisons with "Dante's Peake" are inevitable. An alien attack couldn't be any more devastating than the multitude of fireballs catapulted from the combustible crucible of Vesuvius. Anderson and his CGI team have forged a spectacular fireworks show. The scenes of people scrambling chaotically to reach the Bay of Naples and the sanctuary of a ship at sea are exhilarating. As it turns out, even the ships aren't safe from these fireballs. During the third half-hour, our hero and heroine run desperately for their lives. Atticus is battling his adversaries in an effort to reach Milo, and Corvus is struggling to break through a mob of citizens who have him mired down in the streets. Simultaneously, Vesuvius unleashes one barrage of fireballs after another. Anderson really accelerates the action during the third half-hour.Surprisingly enough, at least to me, I enjoyed this Tristar Pictures release, but I have a soft spot for gladiator movies. "Pompeii" qualifies as more of an actioneer than a chick flick. Notably, our lovers are young, but they never consummate their soulful relationship which makes their love all the more chaste. The slam-bang ending that audiences may not buy because things end tragically is probably the strongest thing about "Pompeii." Mind you, Anderson has made a gripping little sword and sandal saga with a love story to sweeten up the shenanigans. The heroes are virtuous; the villains are vicious; and the wrath of Mother Nature is vast in its fury. Mount Vesuvius grumbles ominously in the background until it explodes and earthquakes rock the city. Clocking in at a Spartan 98-minutes,"Pompeii" never wears out its welcome, and its breathtaking CGI reenactment of Mount Vesuvius blowing its stack is lavishly larger-than-life. Naturally, the CGI imagery here surpasses anything three earlier movies, such as the 1913 silent version as well as the 1935 as well as 19959 versions of "The Last Days of Pompeii," offered.Altogether, despite its tragic finale, "Pompeii" will keep you captivated with its volcanic pyrotechnics and its gladiatorial conflicts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pompeii - a blast from the past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for a movie night out with a strong, complex story with well layered characters and where you build up an emotional bond with those characters, well then you better skip this one.. One the other hand, if you're just looking for a fun and thrilling movie with lots of fighting scenes, the reconstruction and total destruction of an ancient Roman city and outstanding special effects, I would say just sit back and enjoy the spectacle.Of course this movie won't win an Oscar, duh.. we all knew what direction this movie was going to take with Paul WS Anderson in control. But unlike many of his movies, I must say that I enjoyed this one. To go even further, this might be his best film up to now. Yes I know, that's not saying much looking at his repertoire, but comparing to the crap (like the three musketeers) this guy made the past few years, this one is a pearl. Let's start with the cons: 1. the characters aren't worked out well, they're not dull but you can feel there's missing something. 2. The story is far from perfect and we've seen it many times before, but nonetheless it's entertaining. Beware however for a lot of clichés. 3. The destruction of Pompeii depicted in the movie isn't historically correct. The same applies to the depiction of the gladiators, who were in fact not all slaves and above all good gladiators were treated very well. 4. The love story is a bit mealy, but overall didn't bother me that much. The pros: 1. The visuals are truly stunning. The eruption of the volcano, the destruction that it brings, the fights are a feast for the eye. 2. They really did an amazing job reconstructing ancient Pompeii. People who love ancient Roman civilization and architecture will love seeing the reconstruction of this ancient city in her former glory. 3. It's also nice that they put some details of daily life of pompeii in the film, like the insulea, the viae (streets) with stepping stones, the funerary monuments outside the city gates, the termopolia (snack bars) etc. etc. 4. The acting is not the best you'll ever see, but it suffice. Especially Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje does a good job. Kit Harington's acting isn't great, his expression is rather monotonous, but he stood his man in the action scenes. 5. The movie doesn't shy away from violence, which in this case is a good thing. However it's not as brute as I would've wanted it to be for a disaster movie with gladiators..Overall I really enjoyed this movie, just don't expect too much of it and you'll probably have a great time. It is what it is, a fun popcorn- movie, not more but also not less. I normally would give this movie a 6/10, but because I have a weakness for historical movies I'll rate Pompeii with a solid 7.7/10 ~ Review by GlenBender</fullReview>

It' a very capable period disaster movie with really, great effects. Typical for this kind of movie we spend the first half getting to know the characters and the second half with the disaster. The Story about the young boy who sees his family murdered by the power hungry Kiefer Sutherland (don't ask me about his character name) and grows up as a gladiator whilst falling in love with a woman of high class and influence that Sutherland is interested too. Even the story is interesting enough to make a good movie and when the disaster finally hits, you see amazing effects you haven't seen since "2012". Luckily Anderson didn't push his wife in this movie (Mila Jojovic). I can wholeheartedly recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why people rate Pompeii so low. This is the best sword and sandal movie since Troy(2004). There are some people who state that the movie was not historically accurate. The molted volcano lava covered the city and there was no way we could know what actually had happen with the historical figures who were there. The only unaccured event in the movie was the fact that the fumes did not kill the population long before the flames, but killing all the characters in the first half an hour wouldn't make the movie better. Pompeii is not so boringly long like the rest of the genre, it is dynamic without needless scenes, stunning visuals( it is amazing to see how the city is falling apart in 3D),and un epic ending.</fullReview>

Pompeii was a phenomenal waste of time and money and talent (except for Kit Harrington).

		<fullReview>if you want clichés aplenty, people outrunning tidal waves, out galloping lava flow, a respite from hurling molten rocks so our gallant heroes recreate the Errol Flynn sword fight on convenient debris clean stairs, this is for you. Some of the worst acting I've seen, so bad thought i'd begin writing film reviews, Emily Browning with golf ball cheekbones and a botox look of horror stares upon Mount Mordor, or whatever it was after we have put up with an hour of the cheesiest Kiera knightley-esque diction with staccato and often monotone recital. Kiefer Sutherland with ill fitting teeth makes you wonder if its actually Eddie Izzard playing the role who wisely erased his name from the face of the credits. Jon Snow, that's Kit Harrington tries to put some effort into it but fails miserably when allied with Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje who is so wooden he shouldn't have been called Atticus, when Attic would do.It's not just a bad film, its an analogy for Hollywood, it's overblown tripe. If you want more enjoyment in 3D, throw a banger into a box of fireworks and run.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painfully bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>God where do you start with this movie? Its bad, painfully bad! My biggest complaint with it was the performances and the badly written characters. As a fan of Game Of Thrones i think Kit Harington's character John Snow is ruined for me for ever. It left me thinking he is the type of actor who needs to be surrounded by other great actors to look half decent. He is not totally to blame for his performance. It is neigh on impossible to ask an actor to show real emotion if there is nothing for them to connect with in their characters. And there is nothing! The dialog is utterly terrible. I myself tried writing scripts years ago and looking back on them they were just montages of all the most clichéd and obvious lines from movies i remembered off the top of my head. This movie does no better than me. Seriously! Its so bad it was funny then not funny then funny again finally i settled on just wincing and clenching my arse cheeks every 2nd line. All this while waiting for the bloody thing to erupt. Which finally does one hour into the movie. From there its just OK. But they could have given the Volcano a bit more personality. Other disaster films have managed to do it. But here it is very detached bar the odd tremor. They could have gone into the volcano to show it happening beneath the surface, it would have added to the suspense. At the end of the movie i had to take a shower, not to wash off the ash but the stench of Hollywood garbage. The ratio of bad blockbusters to good ones these days is a joke given the money invested and the price of a ticket. Give this movie a wide berth and rent Gladiator and Independence Day instead you'll have a much better time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gladiator knock-off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD is one of the most famous natural disasters in history and synonymous with Roman history. But in the hands of director Paul W. S. Anderson and writers Janet Scott Batchler, Lee Batchler and Michael Robert Johnson this event is turned into a clichéd historical epic.In 62 AD a young boy (Dylan Schombing) witnesses his parents and whole tribe murdered by the hands of Roman commander Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) and his troops and the boy is sold into slavery. 17 Years later the boy grows into a gladiator known as The Celt (Kit Harrington) and because of his growing reputation in Britannia he is sold to fight in the big leagues in Italy. In Pompeii The Celt meets a wealthy woman, Cassia (Emily Browning) and both instantly fall for each other. Corvus, now a Senator visits Pompeii, seeking business and a wife as the volcano starts to cause earthquakes, foreshadowing the doom that is set to inflict the city.Pompeii is a clichéd ridden film, works as a poor historical film, romance and disaster flick in one go. Pompeii lifts many ideas and story elements from Ridley Scott's Gladiator as well as other films. The backstory of The Celt is the same as Conan from the 1982 version of Conan the Barbarian with a little sprinkling of William Wallace's childhood in Braveheart. Pompeii clearly lifts from the classic epics Spartacus and Ben-Hur. There are scenes that taken from Gladiator such as when the gladiators have to fight in a recreation of a battle and the Spartacus' spear throwing scene.The screenplay is predictable, plot points can be seen from a mile off. Anyone who has seen any films of a similar ilk know the different story elements, the star-crossed lovers, the female lead being betrothal to the antagonist, the slaughter of a family in front of the protagonist and their revenge storyline. Subplots are predictable like the initial animosity between The Celt and an older gladiator (Adewale Akinnoye-Agbaje) which evolves into grudging respect and then friendship. Even the use of The Celt is taken from Gladiator as Maxius Decimus Meridius was dubbed The Spaniard.Pompeii is very contrived as many characters are connected to each other, servicing the plot then thinking about any organic storytelling. A real suspension of debrief is required to buy the connections between characters and there are many juicy moments of bad dialogue as Cassia ogles The Celt and a cringeworthy moment when an older woman wants to examine the African gladiator and his 'weaponry'.Anderson is in PG-13/12A mode so the action is neutered, over edited and shot so closely that it was hard to tell what is happening as the fights took place. There was little joy to have from the gladiatorial contests. Even the 3D effects are disappointing from Anderson with the effects only coming into full force after Vesuvius erupts.Pompeii is Harrington first leading man film since finding fame in Game of Thrones and he is playing a Jon Snow-esque character, a stoic type who is skilled with a sword. Most of the cast do not come off well, with Sutherland's performance being entertainingly bad, playing a pantomime villain and gives one of worst attempts at an English accent you will hear in a long time. This is made even weirder when Carrie-Anne Moss keeps her natural North American accent.It is easy to criticise most of Pompeii yet Clinton Shorter does supply an excellent music score, using plenty of a percussion instruments and choir singing, giving Pompeii a more epic feel and the music is much better then the film deserves.Pompeii is a dull affair, bringing nothing new to the sword and scandals genre. Gladiator, Spartacus and the romantic-disaster film Titanic have little to worry about.Please visit www.rocknreelreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mindless fiery doom is counted as a release from plot so old, it may have been written before the actual event,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It squanders the potential of its cast and relatively fresh visual for cheap imitation of Titanic's plot. The story of Pompeii is about the titular doomed city which was erased by a disastrous volcanic eruption, somehow this translated into a pauper boy and noble lady forbidden love plot with average gladiatorial bouts. Trying to utilize many popular elements and mix it with thin script, the movie only succeeds in making the inevitable destruction more enjoyable because its story is so shallow, mindless fiery doom is counted as a release.Pompeii actually has good assembly, such as Kit Harington (Jon Snow), Emily Browning (Elder sister from A Series of Unfortunate Events), Carrie Anne Moss and Keifer Sutherland. In a poor choice of decision, the movie gives them a vanilla script instead of more profound content. The main offender is how blatantly mediocre its love story is, anyone who ever laid eyes on any soap opera would immediately realize the two main characters would fall in love within two awkward eye contacts, might as well make them bump each other while carrying stacks of paper.The two lovebirds act in tedious manner, the actors are capable of so much more, but here they almost seem as if they're phoning their lines. It goes on to incredibly familiar territory of a longing, passionate romance barred by social prejudice and angry tyrant, which is played by Kiefer Sutherland, who oddly delivers his painful fake accent. He sounds very uncomfortable, not to mention doesn't exude any menacing threats. If any, his character in 24 was more intense as a angry protagonist than this half-hearted excuse of a villain. His Roman battalion could've been random extras from Spartacus.Gladiator subplot is also present, but don't expected weighty aspect of slavery or social difference. Pompeii has very simplistic ideas about sword-swinging slave versus vilified Romans. It almost creates some decent backstory in Atticus character, but the love triangle plot proves to be more important. Action is rather lackluster, another wasted opportunity considering its big budget. Fights tend to be similar to others periodic movies or TV shows. It doesn't offer tricky choreography or smooth transition, the combat is merely there, unimpressively.Lazy story aside, the movie redemption lies in its CGI destruction. While throwing a bunch of money in this department bears fruit, the effects are not different much from what disaster movies have done in recent decade. This unfortunately doesn't overcome its uninspiring script, the lack of vigor as actors try their hardest to look interested and any cliché convenient screenplay, so old they may have been written before the actual event of the movie. Pompeii is a disaster by any means.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an hour and forty five minutes of my life I'll never get back. This is every other 'historical fiction' movie (titanic, gladiator, etc) with a different disaster in the background. It had absolutely nothing to do with Pompeii at all, really, and could have taken place anywhere in 'historical Italy'. The characters were transparent, and throughout the movie I'd wondered if they asked the lead to 'act like Christian Bale in Batman' (those guttural whispers throughout). Near the end, I thought, maybe it's not that bad. Then I saw the ending. I was wrong. It is that bad. The only good part of this was the special effects, otherwise, I could have saved ten dollars. I would have felt ripped off even watching this on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a very good movie if you ask me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Making a movie to relive a disaster doesn't really give enough space to focus on the disaster itself, especially if the disaster happened so long ago before adequate technology and records about it are insufficient. Yet a film about the demise of Pompeii is worthy to be anticipated to have a good depiction of how the eruption of the super- volcano Vesuvius happened.As history recorded it, the site where Pompeii was is now the location of modern day Naples, or Napoli in Italy. Before Napoli and Ancient Roman city of Pompeii, there was also an Ancient Greek city on the site. So Napoli now lies above the ruins of the two cities, right beside the still dormant Vesuvius.But then again, who wants to see Vesuvius rocking out Ancient Roman city of Pompeii from the start? it's indeed a feature film, not a documentary. Thus the addition of romance and action is quite anticipated. But unfortunately, from my point of view, the execution is not so good. The movie builds up in a pace too slow even for a 90 minute feature. The deal only gets exciting once it gets to seven tenths part of the movie.At least the gladiator scenes are far more better than the ones in "The Legend of Hercules". The hill fight scene, though not as epic as expected from a gladiator movie, is still to best the other fighting sequences.The acting of the cast overall is not to be expected highly due to most of the casts are either newcomers or "B-list" or the ones specializing in supporting roles rather than leading or significant roles. Kit Harrington in the lead role as Milo didn't really develop his facial expressions, so Milo appeared somewhat like a robot. While on the other hand, Emily Browning uses her face too much in playing her role that her character doesn't really portrays well.The addition of Kiefer Sutherland's senator character is nice on the escape scene. It adds the flavor by showing the real nature of a selfish man trying to find his own safety by killing others who stand in his way. In the escape scene, the addition of volcanic debris falling like meteors are also neat.Sadly, I must add the that the editing quite suck for a feature film aiming for the scale of epic. The camera changes too quickly, Viewers will get a hard time discerning all the details altogether. This is the worst even on the fighting scenes, and on the part when the sea level shrunk before the tsunami. The tsunami depiction is quite good, utilizing well done Visual Effects. But when it cuts back to live action sequence, the direction of the water is not set well enough. And again, the editing is just plainly being stupid by changing cameras too fast.And at the end, the ending is quite stupid for me, as romantic as it is. For me it's not really a good movie. A 5 out of 10 score for this one. Though I don't really recommend it to you due to the boring first half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pompeii is being called another Titanic movie and rightfully so. Both movies contain the same formula of lets take a real life historical human tragedy and put Romeo and Juliet in it. It even contains a lot of the same characters. The only difference between the two films is that one is far more superior to the other. I'm talking of course about Titanic. Titanic did it right where Pompeii just did it wrong.Pompeii annoyed me to tears. My whole experience in the theater was me rolling my eyes and groaning inwardly. Poorly developed love story, poorly developed characters that behave stupidly, and a climax that was just meh. Im going to make some comparisons of my experience watching Titanic for the first time to my experience of watching Pompeii. I went in to both movies looking forward to the epic climax; for Titanic it was the iceberg and the ship sinking and in Pompeii it was the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. Both had a love story but what Titanic did right and what Pompeii failed to do is get me invested. The purpose of the romance in Titanic was to make you care and to get you emotionally involved so that by the time tragedy happens you're concerned and you hope they survive. In Pompeii we have our lovers Milo (Kit Harrington) and Cassia (Emily Browning) who are brought together by the fact that Milo is an enslaved Celtic gladiator who's out for vengeance against the man who killed his family and did I mention he's a horse whisperer. Seriously, Cassia likes Milo because the first time she met him he took a dying horse out of his misery by breaking its neck and the next time they see each other he's taming one and taking her on a magic carpet ride?.sorry, a beautiful moonlit horse ride that was short lived and lasted a whole 5 minutes. Then it's oh my god I love him. Two scenes people! With very little exchange of dialog! I mean their whole screen time together is at least ten minutes tops. And we're supposed to believe that these two are in love? Hell they don't even kiss until the end of the film (which I will get to in a moment). I don't think these two even knew each other's name. I didn't care about them and I didn't care about their "love". Titanic made me care, I was concerned, I was invested so invested that I forgot that I was on the Titanic and everyone was going to die. Pompeii just had me wishing the volcano would hurry up and explode. Another thing that pisses me off about this film is the movie mustache twirling bad guy Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) who's purpose is quite clear. He even has an evil henchmen named Proculus. Corvus' job job is to make you hate him until he gets whats coming to him in the end. Corvus wants to marry Cassia but Cassia doesn't want to marry him cliché. Now when Mt. Vesuvius erupts things start to get stupid. All hell is breaking loose people are running for their lives Pompeii is being destroyed you would think everyone's biggest concern is to get the hell out of there right? Wrong. Instead we have Corvus playing the villain for the sake of staying the villain by killing innocent people, kidnapping Cassia in a chariot forcing Milo to ride after him on horseback seriously I'm surprised he didn't let out an evil laugh as this was going on. The fact that the whole world was coming apart around him was like an afterthought and not of the least bit of a concern. Secondly we have this fight between the slave Atticus (Adewale Akkinouye-Agbaje) and Corvus's henchmen Proculus which was totally uncalled for because HELLO the city is being destroyed by a volcano get the hell out who cares about this fight?! As for the climax, it happened kind of fast and I was kind of rooting for the volcano.Watching all the death and destruction didn't faze me in the least. If proper time had been devoted to the audience getting to know these characters I probably would've felt more sympathetic . I will say this though, the build up to the volcano erupting was really nice, the massive quakes, the rumbling, the animals acting weird. The foreshadowing and the rising tension of the upcoming danger really gets you excited for what's coming. It almost kind of teases you making you ask "oh no is this it is it going to happen now." I will give the movie that much credit. The final shot of the lovers embracing in a kiss as a giant ash cloud swallows them was visually appealing however it failed to leave an emotional impact because again I don't care about them. Think about Titanic when Jack died that really struck home with a lot of people because the audience cared about them and wanted them both to get out of there alive. We knew who these people were, we cared about their relationship therefore there was a greater impact. In Pompeii there was no time to develop the story. The director could have even showed us the lives of some of the citizens just so we could feel something! All in all was it a good movie? Sadly not really,no. I really wanted it to be. It is watchable just don't go expecting something spectacular better yet just wait for the Netflix release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Idea is hurt by bad direction, disconnected design and silly performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When was the last time we got a decent disaster movie? Wouldn't it be great if Pompeii filled that void? Combining the sword-and-sandals elements of Gladiator and Spartacus with the man-vs-nature appeal of films like Twister and The Impossible is a noble concept with the power-tripping of kings being rendered useless by Mother Nature's wrath. Pompeii ventures to do all of this on top of being a serious action thriller; instead it's an over-serious and ultimately silly outing, brimming with corniness (ubiquitous slow motion, posturing speeches) where sincerity was attempted. The story is simple: poor boy meets rich girl, they fall in love, then disaster strikes. Sound familiar? Because it's the same as a little movie called Titanic. But instead of having the regal gravitas of Titanic, Pompeii opts for storytelling and character motives that are about as subtle as the spewing mountain itself. Now Pompeii isn't without merit. Anderson has a keen eye for action sequences; in particular, the main arena battle is full of lively originality. The effects are pretty decent as well, especially once the lava starts to flow. Otherwise, Pompeii slogs along, struggling to find its place. Notably, the love story, the crux of the film, is entirely unbelievable, rivaling the likes of Twilight in shallow romance and charisma-less performances. Look, when it comes to action movies, dullness and stupidity can each be forgiven, but it's hard to rectify both simultaneously, which Pompeii asks us to do. So while combining the basics of two tired genres (sword-and-sandals and disaster) breathes fresh air into both, Pompeii never quite reaches the peaks of either genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Titanic in a Toga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like forever since Kiefer Sutherland played a jerk, something he did quite well before beating time on a television series ? and right off the bat he's the really horrible Roman who kills our future hero's family? But the kid is much too young to do anything about it, for now? If this sounds like the opening of CONAN THE BARBARIAN, within the next half hour POMPEII becomes more like THE PRINCESS BRIDE and eventually morphs into a GLADIATOR version of TITANIC? And yet with all these influences, it's still an original and surprisingly worthwhile motion picture that resembles an epic but thankfully keeps focused on a basic storyline.Milo, played by Kit Harrington, is the grownup version of that unlucky little boy, and as a slave he's destined for something much better than trudging around in chains. As fate would have it, after being able to mentally bond with a dying horse, he catches the interest of a beautiful young lady, Cassia.In the love-interest role, full-lipped Emily Browning is lovely, chaste, and, like most sheltered ingénues, downright mopey? but not on an annoying level. Her father has a connection with a Roman ruler, Sutherland's evil Corvus, visiting Pompeii for a gladiator match the following afternoon. And he really wants Buttercup's? or rather, Cassia's reluctant hand in a forced marriage.Meanwhile, in a murky dungeon beneath the coliseum, a battle champion named Atticus, played by a tough, slowburn Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (try reading that five times fast), is set for his final bow? so he's promised? before being set free. And that death match will be against the newly captive Milo, who might be his only equal: not in strength but cunning agile.Beyond the unrequited romance of Milo and Cassia, the real dynamic occurs between these two fighters. With all the threats and bravado, and the eventual kinship, you'll be anticipating this matchup... only there's a problem? make that a really big problem in the form of a rumbling volcano, shadowing the entire region, threatening to turn this gladiator flick into a bonafide disaster film.Thankfully there is one chaotic coliseum battle before the historic volcano goes completely haywire. But how each character remains fighting for their lives while still viciously pitted against each other (ala TITANIC) ? even when flaming lava rocks are plummeting to the earth ? keeps the story character-driven, trumping the desperately futile situation? Too bad there weren't more scenes, as Bob Dylan once wrote, "spent inside the coliseum, dodging lions and wasting time." Because director Paul W.S. Anderson created a pretty neat stage only to let it melt away during most of the second half. And while it really would have been terrific to see the two unlikely friends fight each other? just to see who'd win.... eventually there's enough closure for every character to make POMPEII a satisfying action-packed melodrama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supposedly Pompeii was based on the novel by Robert Harris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was supposedly based on the Robert Harris novel Pompeii, but the only real similarity between the two is the name Pompeii. In the novel the hero is a hydraulic engineer, not a gladiator. In both there is a love story and an evil villain, but the circumstances are completely different. Pliny the Younger is quoted at the beginning of the film, but in the novel his Uncle, Pliny the Elder, is a key character. Pliny the Elder makes no appearance in the film. In the novel the hero and his love make their escape via a aqueduct, but in the film the couple take a different route. In the film the gladiators are treated rather harshly, but in reality, gladiators were the pro-football players of the day and treated rather well. They were an expensive investment. Of course, in both,Vesuvius does erupt, but I hope I'm not giving away the end</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are film that really haunted me this is one of them, knowing that this really happen in history must of been so frightening to those poor people that are still in-cased in ash today in the ruin city of Pompeii still with the last look on there face starring death in the face God rest their soul's. I find this film brilliant done as it set the tone of the film with these haunting word's along with haunting music "In the darkness you could hear the crying of woman,the wailing of infants &amp; the shouting of men,Some prayed for help,others wished for death,still more imagined that there were no gods left &amp; that the universe was plunged into eternal darkness. Pliny the younger 79 A.D. I believe these words gives the haunting eye witness as they saw the city of Pompeii in gulf-ed in fire &amp; ash,which was is apart of the darkest history."Pompeii" tells the story of the legendary natural disaster that covered the Italian city of Pompeii and its residents in ashes, preserving their bodies for eternity. Like "Titanic," "Pompeii" mixes in a star-crossed lovers story into the disaster genre. Following the rich- girl-loves-poor-boy trope, a wealthy woman named Cassia (played by Emily Browning of "Sucker Punch") falls in love with an enslaved gladiator named Milo (played by Kit Harrington of "Game of Thrones"). Keith Sutherland acting in this film is good although i found his voice a bit weird but kid of suited the character but dam his character is an evil bastard.Atticus (played by Adewale Akinnuoye - Agbaje of "Thor: The Dark World") is surprisingly well developed throughout the film. In the first act, Milo learns that he must face Atticus, a man who has been promised freedom after one more battle. Several scenes of dialogue in a prison cell and action in the arena they are forced to fight in give the audience a good feel for who these characters are and give a good enough reason to root for them. Considering that this is a disaster movie made by Paul W.S. Anderson, both characters have a substantial amount of substance to them, and the actors give good enough performances to make their friendship believable. Though most of this fim it's surprisingly entertaining it does feel slow &amp; it plays at a steady pace with a bit action &amp; scene where you get to know the character, i think Emily brown is coming of age to be a brilliant actress as she plays the cute love interest milo, also doing a fantastic performance also a little short screen time Jared Harris &amp; Carrie Anne-Moss who play Pompeii major i believe who built Pompeii, Milo played by Kit Harrington does a brilliant job of making his character believe this is, playing gladiator on a revenge path of his mother&amp; his people, a big step up from the small screen of TV to the big screen we can see more of him in the future. The most frightening thing about this film is when the volcano blow's, because after that its complete chaos, the visual effect &amp; C.G.I is amazing as you see the volcano throwing everything it has at the city, but you cant help to have tears in your eye's seeing all these people suffering. I would hazard to say this is very close to history on what happen apart from the love story but this is no ordinary love story its more of a tragic but beautiful eternal love story with the way this film ended but its very though provoking when you think about Pompeii all those soul's lost in-cased forever. This is a film i highly recommend as this isn't a mediocre film in fact this is a film that will leave you thinking way after the credits role.Dislikes : Keith Sutherland voice seem a little forced to me but apart from that if you can see past that this film is good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got dragged to see this film. I didn't know anything about it but would have preferred something else; you just know it will be quality when it is offered in 3D ONLY, and the lead baddie is Jack freaking Baur.The first half of it wasn't too bad, compared to the second half at least. I hadn't seen a 3D movie before so I was tripping a bit, and one of the good guys was that big black dude from Oz, the one who always had that crazy hat that somehow never fell off. I haven't seen him in anything else but I like him as an actor.Its a pity then that the dialogue sounded like a year 12 project, and the last third of the film is a complete CGI sh!t-fest along the lines of '2012'; I might as well have been watching avatar.The ending could have looked so much better; if real buildings were destroyed, if they had gotten creative and planned a massive scale demolition to be filmed. I am sure that for whatever it costs these people to fart out CGI-code, they could have actually built something truly creative, and most importantly, realistic!! But that isn't the trend. That is for old people it seems.Michael Bay's 'Ninja Turtles' look like aliens more than turtles. But it obviously sells, to younger males predominantly I am guessing, as that was the demographic that dragged me in to watch this film in the first place.AVOID. This should have been a straight-to-TV-movie, and 2/10 is being generous. But, I somehow feel that a movie could manage be worse than this one. How, I don't know, but I'm sure it is possible.</fullReview>

Terrible acting, pathetic story line, boring, boring and not even boobies. I love fantasy but seriously there has to be a line between fantasy and bullsh!t. This crosses the line. OK so the rest is just to pad the above to get to my ten lines. Do not waste your money on this, in fact don't even download it, it will be a waste of bandwidth. Did I say the storyline was unbelievable, and full of cliché's? And the funny thing is that the movie could, with a little effort, have been half way decent. Go read a couple of history books for a start and then we can chat further. As to the audacity of one reviewer to compare this movie to Titanic, what a joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I like Game of thrones star Kit Harington, I had the feeling he wasn't exactly appropriate as main character in a movie.The story is very predictable, but that wouldn't have necessarly been a problem if it was well made.The first part of the movie is very slow, but suddenly towards the end there's a lot going on.The main character doesn't speak much and if he does he's not very convincing.Plus, between him and the main female character there is no chemistry.The funny thing was that the other gladiator has a funny accent, kind of like Jamaican. It could've been a great movie, because the story line was pretty interesting, but that's a missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting, 3D at its best, and a love story to boot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have waited for this movie since I was a kid after seeing HOUSE OF WAX in 1953 by Andre de Toth. This is truly an "entertainment". Done with a solid creative, structured, and approachable level. The 3D cinematography is at once expansive and at the same time beautifully intimate in its close-ups. it is truly one of the finest 3D action films I have experienced. The script kept me engaged throughout, with good character development and story pacing. The music score is thrilling. The sound fx and surround mixing exceptional. Well timed were surround fx with negative parallax (off screen) 3D effects. I will see this film again at the XD Cinema in Monterey California. Their presentation was exceptional. Highly recommended for families.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome epic. Does what it says on the package</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first heard about this in my latest issue of Empire magazine and then watched the trailer at the movies. Immediately I was captivated and my girlfriend felt the same and I new I had to see this. My girlfriend and I went to see it last night and my first word was "wow".The plot really worked and kept me hooked through out the whole film. Predictable? Of course, but it doesn't matter. There are a lot of similarities to Gladiator (and maybe to Titanic) but the mix between the two I actually thought they mixed brilliantly. The slow stages of the signs of the volcano being active worked beautifully. Instead of the whole volcano erupting all at once, it starts off with fountains boiling, one speck of land collapsing, constant small earthquakes etc. This all happened in the space of a day or two and you knew it was going to happen because of the original story, but it was still gave out the tension.Of course there were clichés but who cares, they were great fun.The character development was great and they were very believable. The acting also helped this a lot. Kiefer Sutherland was of course brilliant and his English accent was very convincing. The rest of the cast did brilliantly, it's great to see Emily Browning again from Sucker Punch. I hope to see her in more movies.The cinematography and special effects were outstanding. I was literally blown away on how fantastic everything looked in every shot and how superb the framing of them were.So overall, the film is entertaining, emotional and jaw dropping. I'm a huge fan of disaster films and this is one of the best I've seen. Well, really, its disaster and epic, what more can you asked for.I have read most of the reviews on here and a lot of them were very low. I completely understand that disaster films aren't for everyone. Yeah they're not perfect but they are so much fun. Then again, no film is perfect.So, disaster fans, i fully recommend you go and see this. Trust me, it'll be worth your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie I've see in a long TIME</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm disappointed to see all the negative comments that people are giving to this movie. I thought it was one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. The editing and graphics were AMAZING! The plot was involving romance and action that was simply keeping my butt on the edge of my seat and me staring up at the screen with a stupid grin. The reason why people give so much hate cause it doesn't follow "exactly" what happened at the actual Pompeii. I know it's obvious that there was no meteorite shower, hailing rocks, or a freaking tsunami lol, but it made the movie better than I ever imagined it'd be. The graphics of everyone running and exploding back and forth made it so realistic.Even before the apocalyptic event of the eruption, the movie was already great and fast paced with action. I already fell in love with it and then realized that the big thing that I was waiting for hasn't even happened yet. I'm not giving away the ending but I thought the ending was awesome as well, no cliff hangers.I know that it was unrealistic to the actual Pompeii but where does it say in the description, "Based on True Events" id say that if they did do exactly how it happened, where a big cloud of ash just came down in two minutes and buried everyone, then it'd be really boring. The apocalyptic part lasted at least the majority of the movie which was great!!So to conclude this, I have to disagree with all the hate and ask other viewers that this is actually one of the best movie out now and I totally recommend it to everyone. 9 out of 10 stars all the way!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weak film, despite some positive aspects.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the recent The Legend of Hercules, Pompeii is a bad imitation of Gladiator, with a bland hero and an insipid romance which doesn't evoke any emotion. On the positive side, we have a good production design which portrays urban life during the first century on a credible way; on the other hand, the action scenes aren't very well filmed. However, the weak melodrama is mere filler until the epic eruption comes. And the special effects technicians didn't disappoint, because the destruction scenes have the precise balance of realism and exaggeration. Unfortunately, that doesn't make Pompeii a good movie, but a flamboyant reel of special effects I would undoubtedly want to see again on HD, in the comfort of my home... after having made fast-forward during all the boring scenes. So, I can't recommend Pompeii, because even though I liked its production design and special effects, it fails as a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be the first to admit, I'm not a fan of Paul WS Anderson. His later Resident Evil films are all quite horrible and I prepared myself for the worst.The beginning gives us a Conan-esque start, with a small child the only survivor as his village is massacred. I was prepared for cheese and, to be fair, the movie is pretty predictable. I mean, you know Vesuvius is going to blow its top at some point and the love interest and villainy is fairly heavily telegraphed. Even the acting is a bit weak.Yet despite all this, somehow the movie just works. It's all things to all men attitude should spell a disaster worse than the aforementioned eruption. Yet it doesn't.So why does it work?You get the obligatory "love conquers all" storyline. You get plenty of gladiatorial action. You get Kiefer Sutherland, who only lacks a moustache to twirl to be a classic villain. You get deserved vengeance.In short, it has all the elements of a good movie, in just the right amounts and just a little short of cheesy, to make a decent, rip-roaring adventure.The real star of the film, of course, is the eruption of Vesuvius. It's clear a great deal of the budget went on this and it shows. Starting at about the one hour mark, it signals a change from the measured pace which preceded it to almost non-stop action for the next forty minutes.I think the main reason why this disaster seemed more entertaining and visceral was entirely down to the change of scenery from the usual modern-day disaster flicks such as 2012. The Roman setting somehow just seemed more real and immediate than watching skyscrapers toppling.In the end, whatever makes the movie work, it does it well. It's a salient reminder that, no matter how many duds a director turns out, they are still capable of surprising us from time to time. The final judgement on any movie, of course, is whether we leave the theatre feeling good. And in this case, I certainly did.SUMMARY: Really decent Roman/disaster/gladiator movie. Shouldn't work, but does. Worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pompeii: Thumbs UP!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into Pompeii with basically zip expectations, having read the story outline, and all of the negative posts here on IMDb (and elsewhere). In truth, I had decided to give it a pass. Well, what with one thing and another (just couldn't pass up the opportunity to see Vesuvius blow it's top in 3-D).And then it began. And you know what? Much to my surprise it sucked me right in. I ended up enjoying it immensely! I'm not going to do a synopsis of the film, but I am going to mention what I found that was really good about the film (approaching excellence!) And what was not so good (actually - not too many complaints in this department).Good: Opening Credits were moody and ominous, with a quite complex and wonderful score that assisted the action sequences throughout. Opening sequences draw the viewer in. The spare introductory sentences written by Pliny the Younger that appear without voice-over on screen are a nice touch.Cinematography and set design were both top-notch, with the city of Pompeii lovely and all that one might expect a posh coastal resort town to be circa 79 AD.3D added a notch up to the proceedings, without being distracting, in an Avatar kind of way. I only ducked once, when a lava bomb (Google it) seemed to be aimed at my head. Acting was actually quite good, particularly the two leads Kit Harrington and Emily Browning. I don't think I have ever seen Ms. Browning in anything before, and the only thing I had seen Mr. Harrington in was was a single episode (it wasn't for me) of that strange middle-earthy-only-with-sex TV thing that seems to be all the current rage.Kit Harrington. A very big surprise here. When he first appears, all moody and six-packy, one can't help but notice how physically small he is in stature compared to the other characters.Although camera angles and character positioning goes a way to disguise this, it is still fairly obvious that most of the other characters are taller than he is.This really bothered me - for about three seconds or so.It was immediately established that he may be height-challenged, but damn! is he fast on his feet, in a give-no-warning, take-no-prisoners, David-and-Goliath kind of way. And this makes sense: it is actually (at least to me) quite logical that a smaller, leaner person can move faster than a bulked-up Arnold wannabe.Harrington, quite frankly, and quite quickly, made me totally buy that he wasn't someone to mess around with. At all.Although the script does not give him a lot to do, besides grunt and sweat, when he is on screen he is very watchable. Which surprised me again, because in the aforementioned television show he seems mostly just to pout from under his rug (or whatever it is that he wears in that show). In the quiet bits of Pompeii (and there are not many of them) he is, quite frankly, tragic. Even when he smiles (which he doesn't do often here). Tragic, and, somehow, for all of that, with a kind of lost sweetness underneath.Emily Browning pretty much has even less to do here than does Kit Harrington, but she does it well. As the damsel-with-a-backbone-in-distress (why are her parents such wimps, anyway?) she is believable.The other standout is unpronounceable-name guy (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) as the frenemy of the Kit Harrington character. He almost stole the show. Almost, but not quite.Special effects are all that I hoped for (no flowing lava, thank goodness - lava didn't flow from Vesuvius) but some really nice to watch pyroclastic flows (Google it).Have read something to the effect that the eruption CGI was "overdone". To that I say: Er. . . what!?! With the possible exception of Krakatoa the 79 A.D. eruption of Vesuvius was perhaps one of the most powerful eruptions that humans have ever witnessed and still lived to write about.The pyroclastic flows and surges, and the ash fall, buried Pompeii and the surrounding countryside (not forgetting Herculaneum) to a depth of about 20 feet or so for the next two thousand years. The two cities were buried so deeply and so completely, that it could not be determined afterwards where they had actually been, and the names of these once vibrant cities were soon forgotten by history.So, yes, it was a bit of a deal. And I'll take all I can get! Not so Good SPOILERS AHEAD.if you haven't seen the film, proceed beyond this point at your own risk.The CGI horses (and people) at the end. During the mad chariot dash through the crumbling city as it is being bombarded by molten chunks of flying magma (I know, I know - magma is not the correct term here, but I like the way it rolls off my tongue - or, in this case, my keyboard) at the end of the film. Why is it that the lobby poster for the film that shows the lip lock is also basically the very last shot in the film - practically the last frame? What's up with that? The embracing lovers turned to stone. Had a flow traveling at 450 mph hit the standing lovers in a field (a pyroclastic flow moves pretty fast) at 1,000 degrees F there likely would have been nothing left.However. . . on second thought. . . the lovers-in-stone was a fitting final image of the film.I like it.And I even misted up a bit at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but with flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to see a historically accurate film about the eruption of the Vesuvius in 79 AD that destroyed Pompeii, then this is not the movie for you. If instead you want to see an entertaining sword and sandals picture, well, then you might enjoy this movie. Milo (Kit Harrington) is a Celtic warrior imprisoned by the Romans during the Invasion of Britain and turned into a slave. Having seen all his family killed by the invading Romans, he is thirsty for revenge. Slated to fight as a gladiator in Pompeii just before the explosion of the volcano, the unexpected events might make his dreams come true.This movie looks like an extended, lesser chapter of the TV series Spartacus. Kiefer Sutherland is a very good villain as a nasty power hungry Roman senator. Unfortunately, not the same can be said of the uncharismatic actor portraying Milo, the Orlando Bloom look alike Kit Harrington. His love interest, the Roman Cassia, played by Emily Browning, does not impress much. But Adewale Agbaje does a fine impression as Atticus, the African gladiator that becomes Milo's ally (this character clearly mirrors Doctore in Spartacus, that was played by Peter Mensah).The fight scenes are fine, and so is the volcano explosion (though the use of computer imagery is a bit obvious at times). The photography is sometimes too dark and murky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was PROFOUNDLY horrible!! 1 Star- and that's only for Kit Harington's chest.My husband and I both love historical drama and the cataclysm at Pompeii seemed a good enough backdrop. But the project was written and green lighted by people who clearly didn't bother to consult a historian. Or an archaeologist. Or Wikipedia. There was a clear and fundamental absence of understanding of Roman history, culture, social structure, and politics, of Roman combat methods and formations, of vulcanology, of the facts and history surrounding Pompeii, of the way the people of Pompeii died or of the quickness in which they were overtaken- even of the differences between Rome and Greece, or of the fact that Pompeii WAS in fact part of Rome. It was a shocking embarrassment with perhaps the WORST script and storyline ever. (Seriously- the script was SHOCKINGLY BAD!) We truly have no idea why this movie was made. Was it to tell a compelling story? No. To share a romance? No. To highlight great scenery? No. To showcase the awesome power of a volcano? No. To impress the audience with great acting, beautiful costuming, talented scriptwriters, or coherent action scenes? No, no, no and no. It was an incoherent mess that even Jon Snow, Jack Bauer, &amp; Trinity couldn't save. On a scale of rotten tomatoes, you can at least laugh at the campiness of Plan 9. By the end of Pompeii, we were laughing at the STUPIDITY of lines that weren't meant to be funny and at the poor fool who actually said, "why yes! I'd like to provide financial backing to this endeavor." Horrible in EVERY WAY!! I will never get those 2 hours of my life back. The best part of seeing Pompeii is ragging on it afterward with the people who shared in the torture, in some state of mutual PTSD.Man. I REALLY wanted to love this one!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The modern-day classics student toiling under the Italian sun, finds Herculaneum to be rather small, but on the other hand, finds Pompeii to be a large sprawling site, that needs most of the day to get around. Ancient Pompeii was big and epic. So too is this movie.This film tells the famous tale of Pompeii, though our story starts on an island at the extreme north of the Roman Empire. It should be said that this swords and sandals epic follows in the footsteps of 'Gladiator' (2000), and thus also of 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' (1964) and 'Spartacus' (1960). Familiarity with these films will not spoil your enjoyment of this one, unless you go expecting anything different. The first half of the film is very familiar if you have seen those films, though that will not spoil your enjoyment.The film is different in the second half. Here, it is, plain and simple, a disaster movie. A good one too. The first half of the film tells of the lives of the humans living in Pompeii and their hopes and fears. The second half of the film makes those stories pale into insignificance, the humans themselves too. Roman power dominated but Roman power was not all powerful. Some things were more powerful than Rome.Pompeii was a large city with a large population. This is shown well in this film with it's large cast.Kit Harington playing in the leading male role, has played swords and sandals before, as well as having done some sword-fighting, and so is a good fit for this movie. Emily Browning plays a fragile-looking creature, but one who is also strong-willed. Kiefer Sutherland plays a toff, an upper-class character with an upper-class accent. He acts and sounds like Leslie Phillips or Terry-Thomas. Most enjoyable! Tremendous support also from Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje.There are decent sword-fighting scenes. However at it's heart this is a disaster movie, and these scenes are shown well thanks to what seems a cast of thousands of extras, and good special-effects. Some good chase scenes but film is really a bit of a geography documentary.While 'Pompeii' is a story about a city that was next to a mountain, there are other elements too. The political scene is referenced, but only slightly. There is a much larger dollop of romance in the film. Hearts beating faster under those smart, and not so smart, togas, as the passions rise, and love and lust break out."Owww Missus, this is ... What? ... Up Pompeii?" as Frankie Howerd might have asked.Director Paul WS Anderson has done a fine job. He made some very brave and correct decisions, and from start to finish, this film is a perfectly crafted and completed whole.This epic, and sumptuous, swords and sandals, disaster movie, is suitable for classics and geography students, as well as young lovers.Worth seeing in 3D. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this film months before the film was to be released, it looked like it was going to be one of the big blockbusters of the year, I was definitely up for seeing a historical disaster movie, from director Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, AVP: Alien vs. Predator, Death Race). Basically, set in 79 A.D., Britannia, Milo (Game of Throne's Kit Harington) as a child witnessed Celtic horsemen kill all in his tribe, and their Roman leader Corvus (Kiefer Sutherland) murder his mother personally, he was captured, and seventeen years he has turned from slave to gladiator. Slave owner Graecus (Joe Pingue) takes him and fellow slaves to the city of Pompeii, on the journey he catches the eye of Cassia (Sucker Punch's Emily Browning), the beautiful daughter of merchant and city ruler Severus (The Quiet Ones' Jared Harris) and his wife Aurelia (The Matrix's Carrie-Anne Moss). The city, compared to being like a "summer holiday resort", is situated near the base of volcano Mount Vesuvius, previously the city has only experienced light earthquakes and rumbles, but unaware to everyone the mountain is warming up to make a significant devastation, starting with a quake opening up the earth outside the city and killing servant Felix (Dalmar Abuzeid). At the gladiatorial arena Milo meets and shares a cell with fellow slave and champion gladiator Atticus (Lost's Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), at first the two are rivals, but they form a friendship, and Milo gets another opportunity to see Cassia, taking her for a ride, it is obvious they are holding back potential feelings, they are interrupted, but he is not killed, she pleads his life is spared by Corvus, but he is lashed as punishment. Milo's punishment continues as he and Atticus along with other gladiators are chained to rocks in the Amphitheatre of Pompeii to battle against Roman soldiers, Atticus realises his promise of freedom will not happen, and while watching Cassia is forced into agreeing marrying Corvus, or her parents will be killed as punishment for treason to the Emperor. She again defies the order from Corvus to have Milo killed, more powerful earthquakes occur, he calms the audience down and has his officer Proculus (Sasha Roiz) face Milo in a one-on-one fight, this is interrupted when Mount Vesuvius finally explodes, the powerful quakes cause the stadium to collapse, and everyone is panicking in the devastation. Milo and Proculus retreat to the jail levels of the arena, Milo releases Atticus and all gladiators opening their cell gates, giving them the chance to attack their captors, Proculus escapes and wicked gladiator trainer Bellator (Currie Graham) is killed, Corvus is trapped under a fallen beam, Severus tries to kill him, but Corvus stabs him and then manages to escape. Balls of fire are unleashed on the city and everyone is fleeing to the harbour, Graecus is killed on one of the ships by a fireball, before dying Aurelia tells Milo that Cassia is at the villa, he races to rescue her and her servant Ariadne (Evil Dead's Jessica Lucas), she saves his love interest but the servant is killed when ground collapses below her into the sea. While Corvus and Proculus kill civilians getting in their way of reaching safety, Atticus is also trying to reach the harbour, but a tsunami created by the volcano rushes towards the city, destroying everything in it's path, he barely rescues a little girl from the tidal wave as the people reenter the high walls where the water stops. Milo and Atticus are reunited, and knowing that they cannot escape by sea they decide to search for horses to ride to the south, so they return to the stadium to find them, Cassia finds her dead parents, and then Corvus appears and kidnaps her, Atticus tells his friend to chase after her while he faces Proculus, the Roman manages to mortally wound the gladiator, but he rises up and stabs him in the neck with his broken blade and kills the soldier. Barely avoiding the falling fireballs and collapsing ground, the chase goes through the falling Pomepii streets, the chariot crashes into the Temple of Aollo, Cassia managed to release herself before this, the temple is destroyed by a fireball as Corvus and Milo battle, Cassia chains the corrupt leader up and the couple ride off and leave him behind. The volcano makes it's much bigger explosion and creates a pyroclastic surge that races toward Pompeii, Corvus is incinerated, Atticus proudly meets his fate proclaiming he will die a free man, and at the outskirts of the city Milo and Cassia are thrown of their horse, he tells her to ride off on her own, but she does not want to spend her last moments running, they passionately kiss as they are engulfed by the blast, their bodies are plaster casts locked in an eternal embrace. Harington makes good of being the young horse whispering slave hero, Browning is a good choice as the beautiful heroine, Sutherland is lovably cheesy with the naff British accent being a near pantomime villain, and Akinnuoye-Agbaje is always the reliable character actor and was my favourite as the gruff but good-hearted gladiator. It does the same as Titanic, you stick a fictional love story and other bits and pieces in a true and devastating event in history, in this case the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, and there you go, we all know that it is not going end happily, the story is predictable and full of camp stuff, but in a good way, and of course once the disaster propels it does not stop, the special effects to create the explosive volcanic activity is fantastic, a most entertaining action adventure. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanna say it was not a pleasant experience to watch this movie on a honeymoon.The plot is silly and laughable. At the beginning, when the leading actor was boy, his family and clansmen were killed by a Roman senator. Yes, it is a historical action movie, and the boy will get his revenge. When the boy grew up and was sent to Pompeii as a slave, he met the leading female character. Well, a poor boy and a rich girl, the hero and the beauty, it would seem that there will be an happy ending where the hero will get his revenge and live with the girl forever. But unfortunately the volcano erupted, earthquake and tsunami attacked the city. The ridiculous thing is, even though the two successfully escaped from the whole difficult situation, hugging each other at what seems to be the end of movie. Unexpectedly they were buried and killed by the ash! The hero and his girl were dead! Everyone was dead! We were supposed to feel sad but we just couldn't help laughing.The performance was just mediocre but the visual effect was not that bad.You can watch it but don't expect much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pompeii is no longer a high-quality movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pompeii is a below average movie directed by Paul Anderson. The plot is built upon a fragile biblical story that questions both the historical evidence and the expectations of the viewer. The background of the movie is set in 79 ADs. The life in the city of Pompeii during that period was ostentatious. The protagonist, Milo, dreams of the day when he can redeem his freedom and marry the daughter of his master. Because of the severe debt crisis, his master promised his daughter to a Roman Senator as a refund. Milo decides to risk his life as a gladiator and try to find his beloved. At the same time, the city of Pompeii is going to take up one of the greatest natural disasters of all time. The movie tried to portray the value of true love, tragedy and recovery, but failed pathetically. The leading characters, Milo and Cassia, did not even get time to know each other. Viewers can also notice the lack of development in their relationship. In short, Pompeii is no longer a high-quality movie. The movie director stuffed the movie with the typical Hollywood hackneyed. However, those who appreciate 3D effects and other movie gimmicks should watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Spoilers But Necessary for Support of Statements*** Those who criticize the movie because of geologic inaccuracy (you know, fire bomb complaints, tsunami complaints, gee, where's Herculaneum) clearly miss the point of movie-making. If you want geologic accuracy, take up the History or Discovery channels. Since the movie by and large is scientifically accurate, a few fire bombs and a gigundo tsunami for effect are more than tolerable; they're great visuals. The movie excels in its depiction of the city and in the special effects. Acting is so-so following a so-so script which has a couple of moments. I'll give the story writers credit for trying to create a somewhat unusual situation; starting a Pompeii movie in Britain takes one aback initially. I was surprised that the movie was historically accurate in representing tension between the Romans and the Pompeiians. With a better script and better acting, this would have been a first rate ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only the studio didn't put a boy to do a man's job.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the special effects are up to expectations, the storyline is some sort typical but still bearable. Character development was deep enough though.Kit Harington in my point of view was a disappointment. Some said he was charming, maybe his curly hairs but he failed to charm me, not once. When Milo (Kit Harington) stands next to Atticus, oh my, you can clearly see a boy and a man. Atticus is every bit a masculine character. He is tall, dark and mighty, and that deep voice. As for Milo, he looked tiny compared not just to Atticus, but to most of the other warriors/gladiators. Never mind his size, Kit Harington however did not deliver a hero. He might have some muscles here and there and some fancy fighting moves but that's not enough. He does not have those eyes. Those eyes that tells you that he is the hero, and that he will make your time and money worthy. He does not have the edge, the charisma, the energy to lead the show. He does not speak like a hero. Let's not compare him with Brad Pitt in Troy, but I find myself wanting to see more of Atticus than Milo. Harington should just play Cassia's brother instead, riding a pony together. That would suit him a lot more.The movie is overall bearable if only the studio didn't put a boy to do a man's job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrifying Chain of Events Converted to Romantic &amp; Thrilling Saga !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You all might know that Pompeii has a historic value not only for it's representation of culture, villas, erotic art or town planning, but also to remind us all that we all live on mercy of nature.Movie is wrapped in similar chain of events and consequences leading to horrific end of Pompeii. Interesting part though is how it is represented by the director. I do not blame people who say it is worse disaster movie or has a gladiator feel to it. The fact is, it is neither a disaster movie nor a mix of Titanic and Gladiator.This movie is all about relationships, love and human endurance to nature's one of the biggest blows. Depth of it touches different classes of people in same society and the division and unrest among the community during time of Roman era. Movie also questions moral decisions over gladiator fights and killing of our own race to display superiority. Which is still going on even after 2000 years. Among this hard won battles and blood socked bodies lies an unconditional love showcasing a devotional perspective of one for betterment of other half. Though death is an inevitable part of our life, there is a value attached to it, and the movie hold itself to it.CGI in the movie is very good and does impress on some of the scenes as I saw it in 3D. Sound editing and background score are excellent and so as sound effects.Acting is also very good and keep you in grip. There are no shuffles of scenes and all important characters are given enough time to bond with each other.Overall, it is surely a watchable movie with an open mindset without expecting it to be a end of the world or gladiator type.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Anyone Who Has Ever Been in Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies where people dress up in togas and pretend to be sophisticated, exotic Roman citizens. Keefer Sutherland makes a pathetic and annoying attempt to play a Roman senator. But this movie isn't too bad.The main character watches his village destroyed by Romans. He escapes but is later captured and is made a slave. Somehow he acquires combat skills and becomes a gladiator. A Roman senator, played by chronic over-actor Keefer Sutherland, is visiting Pompeii, and the gladiators are to put on a show. He meets the daughter of the leader of Pompeii played by the lovely Emily Browning, who should definitely send a Christmas card to the costume designer and the make-up artist because she looked incredible in this movie. Throughout the movie the soap opera heats up (just as the volcano is heating up). You wonder whether the slave and the princess are ever going to get together as battles take place in the gladiator arena. Anyone who is able to googly "Pompeii" knows how the story ends.I didn't think I was going to like it. Anyone who has ever been in love will like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a sad derivative of several disaster movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening minutes this movie is a poor copy of the movie "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe. That was the overwhelming impression I received from the start. As the movie continues, there are elements of "Earthquake", "Braveheart", even the "Poseidon Adventure" incorporated into this plot.The similarities are everywhere to several movies, and I'm not simply talking about the disaster elements. There is the progressive theme of a white man and a black man uniting to become friends in the face of shared persecution and suffering, a noble brotherhood of warriors which transcends race, custom, and social class. There is the commonly portrayed and yet highly unlikely coupling of a noblewoman with a slave based upon some sort of special trait (kindness to horses!) which draws her attention. There's nothing new here. There are CG effects that show the city of Pompeii and the volcanic eruption and subsequent tsunami, but this is not enough to save the film. I didn't fear the volcanic eruption! Maybe not enough lava or people incinerated?The writing is weak and the script predictable. The violence that is portrayed in the film is not realistic. Many of the fighters in this film suffer serious traumas early in their fight scenes that would disable or kill most people, yet they continue fighting. (You can't smash a man's face and head into concrete and steel and believe that he will "shake it off" to fight and vanquish his opponent). This film simply didn't move me or surprise me or make me feel empathy for the people who were victimized by the Romans or the volcano.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pompeii is worth a watch simply because it boasts of one of the most bad-ass characters in modern cinema. The other characters try desperately to assert their superiority but the bad-ass character simply has none of this. So let me introduce you to the most bad-ass character of all time *cue drum-rolls* Mt. Vesuvius. Check this out.. - One guy manages to escape on a ship and heaves out a sigh of relief, the volcano burps out a fireball and wipes out the ship - A gladiator manages to kill his superior and earn his freedom. He stands in the hail fuhrer pose and proudly proclaims that he is free. The volcano gives 0 f*cks- The antagonist, Keifer Sutherland, himself a f*cking bad-ass, states his title with pride and declares that none may touch him, the volcano says b*tch please - finally the two leads declare their undying love for each other to which the volcano soundly reacts "I am still erupting b*tches"So totally worth a watch. I am eagerly waiting for the sequel "Pompeii 2: Son of Vesuvius"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel like I've seen the "Gladiator who's an underdog" movie too many times. And while this movie tries to be something different, it couldn't quite get me to look past it. Sure the ending of it all is different but the main story of this young guy who wants revenge on the people who killed his family is a bit overdone in my opinion.Then you have the young girl who almost instantly falls for the young boy even though he's a slave and she is of high stature. She barely knows him but between both of them there is something there. Things go bad for the young man when he comforts a horse of hers and then takes her on the horse running away from the city.Then of course is the volcano that is bound to erupt at any moment but the people didn't really believe that it would. So during a pretty intense battle sequence in the arena, which was a pretty good fight scene, the mountain erupts and things go haywire.The special effects weren't very well done at all. It ruined parts of the movie for me. Overall, it would be better off waiting to watch this on TV sometime. Not worth the ten dollars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Pompeii", starring Kit Harington-Game of Thrones_t.v., Silent Hill: Revelation 3D; Emily Browning_Sucker Punch, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events; Carrie-Anne Moss_Silent Hill: Revelations 3D, The Matrix movies; Adewale Akinnvoye-Agbaje_Bullet to the Head, Lost_t.v. and Kiefer Sutherland_24_t.v., The Three Musketeers_1993.This is an exciting, action-packed disaster movie that is based on a true event in history. Don't get too excited, if you are a historian, because it is not a historical account of the last days of Pompeii. It is more of a gladiator/love story that just took place in the wrong city at the wrong time. The movie does end with the infamous Mount Vesuvius erupting in AD 79 and destroying the city of Pompeii but most of the movie is about gladiators, and a little love story thrown in for good measure. Kit plays a young boy that witnesses his whole family massacred by Kiefer, a Roman senator. When Kit grows up, he becomes a slave-not because he wanted to-and has to fight in the gladiator arenas. He also meets Emily, a daughter of wealth, whom he falls in love with. Kit also meets Adewale, another slave that has only one more fight to win before he is a free man, or at least that is what he is promised, and as everybody knows, the Romans always kept their word. Guess who that fight is supposed to be with? Carrie-Anne plays Emily's mother. It has great special effects, lots of gladiator fights and is directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, who directed Mortal Kombat and the Resident Evil movies. It's rated "PG-13" for violence, language and some sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 38 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jon Snow vs Jack Bauer With a Volcano</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pompeii is an action packed visual feast, that contains a form of acting that I would expect from any other disaster flick, wooden and bland but it is forgiven because no one goes to these type of movies for the performances. Kit Harrington shows that he has a future in the movies but strictly for action films only. The film's biggest positive is it's fight scenes in the arena, you can tell that much time was put into the choreography/training but during these scenes there are many quick cuts back and forth which will easily leave your eyes in a blur at times. The story is nothing special, it is a formulate vengeance plot where little of romance is involved which is a positive. Now I hate to hear this complaint but this film could have really taken an advantage of an R rating by being able to push the levels of blood or gore which would of brought the audience into the time period.Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's character was a surprise to be by being the most charismatic element in the entire movie and providing some comic relief. I was always a huge fan of Kiefer Sutherland but his performance was filled with cheesy lines and stale acting that consists of only of one emotion. The real highlight is the volcano itself, when it erupted it sent shivers down my spine and the effects were beyond amazing. As for the director, Paul W.S. Anderson, this will most likely be the highest quality movie he'll achieve. Overall, you should take this as a 90 minute joy ride that will entertain for every one of those minutes but also leave your mind as you exit the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2014's first bona fide dud.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Paul W.S. Anderson isn't know for his subtlety; The Three Musketeers, Alien vs Predators and the Resident Evil franchise are pictures that deal in nonsensical plotting, B-grade action and hilariously ham-fisted acting. Pompeii does not break the mould. Unfortunately, even on the Anderson-scale-of-guilty-pleasure, this sword and sandals blockbuster struggles to entertain. The gigantic set pieces are disappointingly dull, the gladiatorial battles are pedestrian and repetitive, and the CGI is horrendous, which is unforgivable in this day and age. Kit Harington (Jon Snow from 'Game of Thrones') has to contest with some truly horrible dialogue in a role that requires very little acting, but his charisma sees him come out of this disaster of a movie relatively unscathed. Emily Browning, Jared Harris and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje do their lively best as, respectively, Harington's love interest, ruler of the doomed city and a champion gladiator, however Kiefer Sutherland, as a malevolent Roman Senator and the snarling villain of the piece, is utterly diabolical and all bar seals this flick's doom. If it weren't for Harington's natural charm this would be a 1 star bomb, as is it's still 2014's first bona fide dud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul WS Anderson brings us a spectacular Roman film! One of the best I've seen. I really don't know where to start with it, so I'll say the negatives first. I thought it was a little Clichéd. The characters said and did things that definitely would only happen in movies. For example, when Milo is chasing Cassia and and Corvus on his horse, when he nearly gets covered in ash, we all knew he was gonna come back out... The next bad thing would have to be, i thought they totally forgot what happened to Phoenix. They also seemed to forget about the Volcano erupting at times. (I don't wanna say I know how Volcano's erupt...)Right now onto the positives. 1 word. CGI. The CGI in this film is some of the best, it tops Gravity. OK it tops GRAVITY. In this film they recreated the eruption of Pompeii perfectly. I couldn't have asked for anything better. Also I thought Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje gave a great performance as Atticus and definitely deserves recongition. Kit Harrington could have given a great performance but failed to deliver. But it doesn't matter because I loved the CGI so much.Anyway to sum up 10 out of 10 because the CGI has blown me away, i struggled to believe it was fake. DEFIANTLY WATCH IN 3D!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Average Movie with full credits to its Visual Effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POMPEII REVIEW:For general audiences:- PAUL.W.S. ANDERSON (Dir. of Resident Evil series) has crafted an AVERAGE, ONE TIME-WATCHABLE movie with BRILLIANT, OR EVEN BETTER CGI VISUALS which would keep you holding on to your seats (IN 3D) for the last HALF-Hour and YAWNING from the first till then. If you're a CGI,ADVENTURE, and a 3D Movie fan, POMPEII will suit you better. For others, do wait for it on torrent.FOR FRIENDS WHO WANT TO KNOW MORE:-STORY &amp; SCREENPLAY- It is the imagination of the Real twin disaster, TSUNAMI AND VOLCANIC ERUPTION, which stuck the the city of POMPEII and destroying the entire population, estimated to be around 15,000 people, on AD 79. Add to this, the audience-loving Romance and that's the story of POMPEII. Screenplay had its flaws, though. It was loose till the action begins, not enough to get me into the mood of the movie.VISUAL EFFECTS- It's obviously astounding. It's not a child play to create such destructive scenes,of the eruption and also the Tsunami. I can clearly see how the 600 Cr Budget is spend. Hats off to the Visual Effects Supervisor of the movie. Hollywood has clearly improved its status and grip on CGI IMAGERY. I wonder when is the time of US, India??ACTING- POMPEII is the first movie for Kit Harington. The GAME OF THRONE star showed no nervousness on his first on-screen venture. Instead he clearly rocked the show with great supports from Emily Browning (of Sucker Punch), Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Carrie-Anne Moss. It's a great effort from these actors to act inside a studio with all the GREEN SCREENS and other stuff.BGM:- It's not that punchy, but it clearly brought that old-fashioned feel in the movie. But it clearly showed its class, in the last hour of the movie, setting the emotional and thunderous pitch for the movie.SOUND MIXING- I should say all the Technical aspects of the movie,including Sound Mixing is top class. POMPEII would not be a colorful movie, if not for CGI, BGM AND SOUND MIXING.Emotional Aspects of the movie: From the beginning itself, POMPEII has tried to become a Romantic, Revenge , Political Movie. But it failed in all these things. Most of its emotional scenes are predictable. Even the school students beside me could guess it. But what makes it watchable is the Visual Effects and Visual Effects alone. The destruction of the POMPEII is heart-breaking as well as Top-Class.Rating- 3 for movie and 4 for CGI.</fullReview>

The screenplay was awful and the special effects mediocre.Kit Harrington and Emily Browning's "acting" if that is what you want to call it consisted of blank long-lost love stares into each other's eyes. After the first 50 shots of them staring at each other it got creepy.I only gave it 3 stars because of Keifer Sutherland and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul WS Anderson. Before the 'Resident evil' shame, and 'The 3 musketeers', this was one filmmaker I wanted to follow throughout, just on the basis of 'Event Horizon'. But that was not to be. He, IMO, sold out; or, never had the talent in the first place (EH was a fluke if this is true). Either option's possible. Now, he chooses Roland Emmerich / Michael Bay's route, and though he's found wanting once again, by no means is this a bad movie. It just checks all the boxes one needs, and is a standard, template-based summer blockbuster, and that's not always a bad thing. Kit Harington, Jon Snow of 'Game of Thrones' headlines, and is serviceable, selling the role of a Hollywood action-star, but doesn't quite cut it. Emily Browning - this talented star (if one considers 'Sleeping beauty') looks bad, acts worse, and any runtime devoted to her seems a total waste of runtime. Adewale Akinnuouye-Agbaje, on the other hand, lives the cliché, and along with Kiefer Sutherland, takes the entire thing ultra-seriously, making me wish that he was not hidden behind a mask during most of 'Thor: The dark world' (but that's a topic for a different time) - seems to me like he's this generation's Djimon Hounsou. Kiefer Sutherland glowers, yells and tries to make us hate him, and is about as good as one would expect from this kind of an effort. It also doesn't help that I kept thinking of 'Conan the barbarian' during the (supposed to be affecting) opening. How difficult is it to come up with an original opening to ensure the audience doesn't go into spasms of déj?-vu? Just lazy writing, IMO. In any case, the CGI is pretty decent, and though the movie is dark, the 3D's serviceable too, but I'd recommend a 2D viewing, and definitely on the big screen (nor the TV/Laptop/Pad...). Jared Harris and Carrie-Ann Moss' roles are relatively better etched, but also run outa steam quickly.It's not as bad as PWS Anderson's 'Resident evil' movies, and not as bad as his interpretation of 'The 3 musketeers', but it doesn't serve his CV well either. And oh, PG-13? I don't know whether to castigate the MPAA for the (totally!) wrong rating, or the makers for pussyfooting with this rather than going for a hard R - I'm seriously torn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Serviceable storyline between two average characters around good recreation of a natural disaster during an ancient time that could be better represented and fleshed out. The background of characters and storyline is as simple as it can be to let viewers be familiar with the subdued and monotone tone throughout the movie. The movie rest on its laurels for far too long in certain parts, without much of a surprise and highlights to look forward to and leaving the viewers to wait for the movie to come to its conclusion that can already be seen coming from miles away. As far as the special effects are concerned, there are parts that were done well while others left a lot to be desired. The cinematography are also inconsistent with beautiful panoramic shots and blurry action shots. Based on the director's previous works, it would not come as a surprise. It's a serviceable B-movie grade viewing experience and would not justify a higher praise than that. Watch it just for a nice break from your life. Turn off your mind and enjoy the visuals. Believe me, there's not much to digest intelligence-wise. It's a middle-of-the-road movie for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ads for this movie play up the love story similar to Titanic, but set in the Roman Empire days and replacing an iceberg with a volcano. That made me hesitant to see the film, but considering it was set in the Roman Empire (and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, of Death Race and Resident Evil fame) you got to figure it's going to have a battle or two, right? Right! Our Hero, Milo (played by Kit Harington from Game of Thrones) plays the last of his Tribe who were taken from him as a boy. Force to survive on his own, he becomes a slave with some wicked fighting skills (that's what happens when they kill your people in front of you, Look at Conan the Barbarian) and is forced to use these skills in a pre WWE gladiator arena. Like Leo did in the James Cameron flick, Milo falls for a chick with cash. Although their relationship is lacking development. I think the chicks will get more out of seeing Jon Snow's new buff movie body than from the "Two lovers from different sides of the tracks" story, And as gay as it might sound, the relationship that Milo had with his fellow Gladiator, Atticus(which rips off Gladiator, weather they met to or not) is far better played out. It does not help that Milo's love interest, Cassia had a servant that I found far more appealing. Less love story of course met more Gladiator battles, which for me was the butter on the bread. Everyone was just so bad ass even the bad guys. I'm surprise how many cool one liners there were that act as verbal chest pounding letting the opponent know how much more awesome I am than you. So you have a love story and some good on camera battles, you don't need anything else, but the filmmakers tossed in an erupting CGI Volcano to become the ultimate antagonist. Honestly, it was a great concept, and I understand (somewhat) the need for so much CGI, but It is a little too overwhelming, not too much in my opinion, but too overwhelming. CGI can do that too you. Overall it was worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

The story line is similar to Titanic in how gentle it is until about an hour in, I don't understand these people who say it's too slow paced. I Went to see it yesterday, (The 1st day of release in the UK for some reason), and it exceeded all my expectations, truly a beautiful piece of film.On another note, the audience I saw it with were brilliant, silence from everyone except one woman who got too engrossed and appeared to forget she was in a cinema. I would definitely recommend you see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely worth for your money. Looking at the rating i was in a doubtful mind whether to go to the movie or not, but finally decided to go as I took off for the day from office. Director made sure that you will not get bored for a single minute during the movie run.Plus points: 1. 3D effects are awesome. Mount Vesuvius eruption was shown superbly and ash combined with fire looked like real. 2. Emily Browing looks fresh and well suited for her role. 3. Finally Kiefer Sutherland got a good full length role in a movie. 4. Gladiator's fighting scenes are highlight for the movie.Negatives: 1. Very less emotion quotient. 2. A famous hero might have attracted more audience to the theater and more ratings. 3. Few scenes are obvious and can be predicted. 4. Finally in India break was given in the middle of the fight scene in amphitheater which killed the momentum of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Volcano the star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Volcano is definitely the star of this movie. It rumbles and belches, horses know it is going to erupt, people take time to realize it will eventually destroy them. It does. It wins. It takes no prisoners.I liked the movie. I saw the whole thing, except covering my eyes during the most gory parts. If I sit through an entire movie, I usually give it a 10 -- and I am doing so now.The good, plus comments: pretty princess lady. Cute, curly haired savior/gladiator/boyfriend. Nice father. He didn't want his daughter to marry that good-for-nothing Roman senator. Still more good. Let's see. Smart horses. Milo can communicate with horses. Excellent. Princess (Cassia, I know) very nice to her lady-in-waiting. Cassia's mother very nice. Atticus a true-blue friend, and would make an excellent bodyguard in any situation. Awesomely-designed triremes; miniatures, I would guess. Guy who tried to escape on the boat looked like Dom Deluise.More good: Beautiful interiors of the home of Cassia and her family. Breathtakingly lovely set and furnishings. Milo and Atticus can whip the socks off everyone in the entire world; at least, the world of that time and place. They can both be my bodyguards. Tons of special effects; I know it costs a fortune in production costs, however, but the effects were astoundingly good and exciting. Great makeup for all the bloody gore; I could not watch that part, but I know as an acting student that fake blood and jellylike blood can look pretty gruesome. Kudos to makeup department.The bad and mediocre: Not much. I thought this would be a guy movie. I went with a guy, who picked the movie this time. The fact that there was a love/like story made it more interesting for me. Spoiler: the end -- the lovers turned to ash/concrete while in kissing embrace -- just was heartbreaking. It was hard to watch. They got enveloped with all the fire and brimstone before turning to stone -- and this was gut-wrenching.The cool part: the triremes/ships dancing down the streets of the town, on water gushing.I saw large numbers of names of stunt women and men when I watched the closing credits (I always watch closing credits and look for production information). I was astounded. It was a lot of hard work.These names are not known to most of us. In the opening credits, I saw cast names, and I knew I had not heard of most of them, either, except for Sasha Roiz from "Grimm" and Kiefer Sutherland. I thought, "Hmmm, tons of money spent on huge theatricals/special effects/explosions, and hardly any money for name stars". I think, at the end, that I also saw animation and CGI, and I also saw the part about animals not being harmed.I figured Milo would ride Cassia away on the horse, which happened up to a point, but I really wished the horse had grown wings like Pegasus ("Winter's Tale") and had flown them away from the inferno.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved It and I Will Not Apologize For It!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the movie and yes it was a guilty pleasure but I was impressed with the cast. Exception Kiefer Sutherland looked absolutely uncomfortable in this role and his speech was like a tongue in cheek caricature villain but carried off so poorly it made me wince. Being a huge fan of Game of Thrones, the draw was Kit Harrington and I thought his understated performance was absolutely perfect. Speaking with his eyes to convey his emotion was believable and made the romance thus. His emotional scars did not make him a smooth talker which it seems other reviews were casting a negative spotlight on. I loved the ending! I thought the cast of actors I had never seen before did a terrific job, Cassia, Atticus and Kiefer 's right hand man and Cassia's maid servant in particular. The focus on lack of historical accuracy is not fair and this is certainly not the first nor last film to be in this category . I highly recommend this film as A showcase of a person 's resilience to overcome tragedy, an understated romance which is actually refreshing and old-fashioned and a friendship between Milo and Atticus which was I thought heartfelt. And of course the special effects! See the movie and judge for yourself! I loved it and if just a different actor for Senator Corvus... even more so! And what Kit did physically amazing and puts him in the same league as Christian Bale, Jarred Leto etc!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Stunning!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pompeii is today's generation Titanic with a beautiful and romantic story. I liked everything about the movie and I would suggest you see it in 3D because the special effects are great. Emily Browning did a great job and looked stunning on the big screen. Usually disaster movies are all about non-stop action but Pompeii throws in some romance combined with "possibly" a true story and makes you wonder if such a romance did really exist when the city was destroyed. I wish the movie was a little bit longer but overall I'm really satisfied and can't wait to own it on blue ray. For everyone who didn't like the movie I would suggest that you look at this movie from a historical perspective because it's an eye opener. Watching how the city is destroyed and what people went through during that catastrophic event is reliving a part of that ancient history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My name is Jon Snow...nah its actually Milo!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised, pleasantly so to some extent, that the movie wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I actually liked the beginning and middle of the movie, but then the over-the-top third act kicked-in and pretty much killed it.Paul W. S. Anderson just can't help himself by adhering to the Michael Bay/Wolfgang Petersen/Rolland Emmerich school of cinema, thinking that the bigger the explosions, the more the screen is loaded with visual effects, deafening sounds and a bombastic score, that that will keep his audiences attention. My senses were overwhelmed,and not in a good way, by all the noise and the overly busy screen. The movie literally became a visual cacophony combined with a deafening sonic orgy, all neatly wrapped in a layer of the preposterous...all of which amounted in the end to my being underwhelmed as a viewer!Had the eruption of the Vesuvius and the destruction of Pompeii been handled with more restraint and focus, and even some modesty, I think the movie would have worked much better. Instead the special effects completely took over and overwhelmed the characters as well as the storyline, which was to the detriment of the movie. I was more interested in the movie when it focused on the characters and the story rather than the build-up to the final diarrhoea of the senses which Anderson unleashed at the end.I didn't go in expecting award winning performances or a movie that would make a killing at Sundance! I am fine with a popcorn movie, but I can at least expect an enjoyable one!I liked the set-up of the story and some of the characters (NOT Kiefer Sutherland). I also liked the look of the city, the set designs,the costumes were pretty good. All in all it had relatively high production values, especially for a movie that everyone expected to have some degree of cheese in it!It didn't bother me that "Pompeii" resembled "Gladiator", "Spartacus: Gods Of The Arena" and "Spartacus: Blood and Sand" with even some "300" undertones, but I could have done without the "2012" and "The Day After Tomorrow" clichés...For a PG-13 movie it is quite violent, which in this case is a good thing. I am sure there will be an unrated/extended cut once the movie is out of theatres, which shouldn't be too long a time.Also, you know what? I really wish they had used the voice narration that was present in the trailers for this movie. When I first saw the trailer and heard that voice and the set-up of the movie...well it got my attention!A lot of people pooped on "The Eagle" or "Centurion", but those were decent movies. "Pompeii" is an alright movie and that is stretching it a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Movie... I will suggest go watch at least once.. Direction is good, Director tried his best to show case reality of Pompeii on big screen. Dialogues are good. *****10/10**** from my side. I do'not write reviews but for a super work I won't mind. I created this IMDb account just to write review for this awesome movie. Go for it guys, Go watch it once.I Checked Wikipedia for details of Pompeii, Its awesome how director showcased all the things in 1 hour 35 minutes.Screenplays are good. People were applauding on dialogs like "Gladiators don't beg". No second thought on this one.. If i can i would definitely go watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best I've seen in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really was a good one, reminding me of Titanic and Gladiator put into one. The special effects of this film are outstanding, I'd say my third favorite after Pacific Rim and Transformers 3. The story is identical to Titanic, but as we all know, no romance can match its credentials. However, Pompeii comes closest to matching it, with amazing special effects and a real true connection is made with the audience, making it a very emotionally felt movie. The background music adds even more suspense to some scenes in this movie making it not only emotional but also interesting and nail-biting at times. Overall a fantastic movie made, great acting, great editing, and just great everything! Overall Rating- 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts Slow, Then Kaboom!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is something I expected would be a huge disaster film from almost the start of the movie like other volcano disaster movies have been that we have seen, such as Volcano with Tommy Lee Jones and Dante's Peak with Pierce Brosnan. But instead of that this movie actually starts out pretty slow and was a bit boring, I was not really drawn into the story that much by the actors. Once the action does really ramp up with the volcano starting to erupt there were a lot of great visuals but this movie still was not anything special. It's only worth seeing on the big screen if you really like disaster effects etc. The romance story is just all right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable but worth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unless being a total prick, a real dumb, don't expect here any surprise. Especially if you have seen the trailer. Expect many many fierce fights, in the line of GLADIATOR, love, romance and vengeance schemes, that we have seen not a million but a billion times before. Many beautiful athletes physiques, some bodybuilders of course, a real mean, evil Roman leader - played here by a surprising Kiefer Sutherland - and a batch of many more details foreseeable at the most. But it is a perfect time waster. No length here. The black actor, whose I don't remember the name, and every body who has watched OZ TV series knows, is terrific here, as the hero's friend gladiator.No surprise in this feature, I repeat.The extreme ending is expectable and it is not...A happy ending whilst not being a happy ending...But I like it. Somewhere it changes and leaves me a good taste in the mind.</fullReview>
