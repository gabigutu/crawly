		<shortDescription>"There's no crying in baseball!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A League of their Own, another classic movie that I grew up with. I have to admit it, I'm a girl, I totally fell in love with this movie. But I'm one of the rare girls that loves baseball with a passion, I was raised in a very baseball oriented family, we live in Chicago, we kinda have to enjoy sports, lol. But growing up you wonder why baseball, football, basketball are more for the boys vs. the girls, girls can play but are not famous for it and if they are an athlete are accused of being manly. It's a tough world, but when I was 7 years old A League of their Own was released in theaters, my family saw this movie together and my life changed. Sounds silly, but this was the movie that reminded me to stay strong, at the time when women were expected to stay in the kitchen, as hard as they had to work for it, there was a women's baseball league during WWII. A League of their Own explores this hard but extremely fun time for the girls of the All American Baseball League.When World War II threatens to shut down Major League Baseball, candy manufacturing magnate Walter Harvey decides to create a women's league to make money. Ira Lowenstein is put in charge of public relations and scout Ernie Capadino is sent out to recruit players. Capadino likes what he sees in catcher Dottie Hinson. She's a terrific hitter and he offers her a tryout, but the married woman is content where she is, working in a dairy and on the family farm in Oregon while her husband is away at war. He's less impressed with her younger sister, pitcher Kit Keller, who loves the game passionately but appears to be less talented. He finally lets her come along when she persuades Dottie to give it a try for her sake. When the trio arrive at the tryouts in Chicago, they meet Doris and Mae. They make it onto the team, The Peaches who are managed by drunkard former baseball great Jimmy Dugan. Jimmy initially treats the whole thing as a joke, leaving the managerial duties to Dottie. However, he takes over when he sees how hard and well his team plays. The league attracts little interest at first. With a Life magazine photographer in attendance, he asks them to do something spectacular. When a ball is popped up behind home plate, she catches it while doing splits; the resulting photograph makes the cover of the magazine. More and more people show up and the league becomes a huge success.The acting is absolutely superb, we have actors on top of their game, Tom Hanks who delivers the memorable "There's no crying in baseball!" speech. Geena Davis who was a great heroine as the star of the league who just wants her husband home from the war but is hanging onto the league for her little sister's sake. Even Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell are great together and have awesome chemistry as best friends Mae and Doris. This is one of those chick flicks that everyone has to see because it worked on every level. Penny Marshall truly brought out the pain these girls had to go through to be taken seriously. The ending always gets me in tears I have to admit, just knowing that these girls hung in there and stayed strong when everyone told them that girls couldn't play ball, let's hope that one day they'll have the opportunity again.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish, warm and fun to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)This movie is about ten times better than it has any right to be considering how sappy director Penny Marshall could have been tempted to make it, and how phony is the actual baseball played by the young women. (More on this below.)What makes it work are fine performances by Geena Davis as catcher Dottie Hinson, "the best player in the league," and Lori Petty as her younger sister, Kit Keller. Geena Davis absolutely looks the part with her cool confidence and stately figure while Lori Petty is scrappy and believable as the little sister whose puck and determination set the stage for a sister-rivalry climax at the end.Jon Lovitz as Ernie Capadino, the baseball talent scout, is a crackup as he delivers just about all the best one liners. (Example: he's watching Dottie and Kit milk the cows and asks, "Doesn't that hurt them?" Geena shrugs for the city slicker, "They don't seem to mind." Ernie thinks about it and then says, "Well, it would bruise the heck out of me," which was doubly funny since he has his anatomy confused.) But the guy who really holds the whole thing together is Tom Hanks as one-time home run king Jimmy Dugan, who is now the Rockford Peaches' alcoholic manager. I have seen Tom Hanks in a number of films, but I don't think he was ever any better than he is here. His transformation from a crude, uncaring drunk to the team's hard-nosed but soft-hearted leader is very well and believably done. And Hanks was never more charming and seldom funnier.Just as good as the work of the fine cast is Marshall's clear, old-fashioned direction. In many ways this film is a throwback to an earlier time when films set out to warm the hearts of the audience and uplift their spirits. Sure, there is evil in the world and you can't win them all, but you can try, is what this film makes us feel, and if you do, something good will happen. There is of course a somewhat self-conscious retrospective look at the sorry political and social state of women sixty years ago, but Marshall does not wallow in the politics. Instead she emphasizes a fun-to-watch tale with real human characters. The unpredictable, but believable ending was very agreeable.Okay now to some of the problems with the "baseball." Notice that we first see Kit as a softball pitcher. How she made the transition from throwing underhanded to being one of the best overhand hardball throwers in the league in just a few months is...well, doubtful. And the outfits they wore!Ever try to slide into second trying to break up the double play without sliding pads or even jersey pants? I don't think so. The girls were bare-legged. To Marshall's credit she does show one girl with a huge strawberry bruise on her thigh. Furthermore for those viewers who have actually played baseball, the way many of the young women threw and caught the ball was again, shall we say, doubtful. Marshall employed as extras some young ladies who could actually play a little and we see some shots of their style and grace, but the only star who could even pretend to play at that level would be Rosie O'Donnell. Madonna has some athletic ability, but to imagine her patrolling center field and hauling down long drives strains credibility.Okay, so what? If we put Tom Hanks at bat against even the most mediocre of Class A pitchers, it would be obvious that he is no home run king. In fact, I think Penny Marshall did a great job of creating and maintaining the illusion of Big League skills for the players so that we were not distracted from the story itself. Skillful editing helped.By the way, if they gave Academy Awards for a performance in a role short of a supporting role but longer than a cameo (and maybe they should), Megan Cavanagh would have won it for her touching impersonation of Marla Hooch, a painfully shy and vulnerable, less than pretty girl from the farm who finds herself as a baseball player in the city as she steals some guy's heart with an unselfconscious, boozy, off-key torch song. I also loved the scene where she is rocketing line drives off the walls and through the windows of the high school gymnasium.Note the appearance of David L. Lander as the radio play-by-play guy. He's best known as the wacky/creepy "Squiggy" Squiggman from the old Laverne and Shirley TV sit-com. Here he plays it mostly straight but does get to wear his hat with the bill up as Leo Gorcey did in the East Side Kids (AKA The Bowery Boys) movies from the early forties.Bottom line here: Uplifting, fun, and even worth seeing again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining look at an obscure piece of sporting history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most Englishmen, I know about as much about baseball as the average American knows about cricket. I am also not a great fan of sporting films in general, although there are a number of exceptions. Despite this, however, I generally love baseball films, of which there were a number of good examples in the late eighties and early nineties. ('Eight Men Out', 'Field of Dreams' and 'The Natural' all spring to mind). There is something about the sport that seems to lend itself to the cinema; perhaps British filmmakers should consider making a film about cricket, as the two sports have a lot in common. During the Second World War many of America's male baseball stars were drafted into the forces, and it appeared that the nation might be deprived of its favourite sport. An entrepreneur therefore had the idea of creating an all-female baseball league. 'A League of their Own' tells the story of some of the women who played in that league. At the centre of the drama is the rivalry between two sisters, Dottie and Kit, who sign for the same team, the Rockford Peaches. The sisters have contrasting characters. Dottie is the more talented player, but Kit is more aggressive and determined to succeed. Kit's aggression and the sibling rivalry between her and Dottie lead to dissension in the team's dressing room, and Kit is traded to a rival team, the Racine Belles. The climax of the film comes when Rockford and Racine meet in the finals of the league championship, with Kit and Dottie on opposite teams. The film has some interesting observations about the social values of the era in which it is set. During this period there was a conflict between traditional views of femininity and the need, caused by wartime conditions, for women to take on what had historically been masculine roles. Before the war, there had been only very limited opportunities for women in professional sport; most sports, such as tennis and athletics, in which women were permitted to compete were strictly amateur. During the war, they were allowed to take part, but were still expected to conform to the ideal of being 'ladylike'. In the film, players are selected as much for their sex appeal as for their talent (Ernie Capadino, the cynical, sexist talent scout, wants to leave one player out of the team because he considers her insufficiently glamorous) and they are required to attend a 'charm school' and to conform to a strict code of sexual morality. Dottie and Kit can be seen as representing the two sides of this conflict. For all her talent, Dottie's heart is not really in professional baseball, and her real wish is to return to her old life as a housewife as soon as her husband returns from the war. Kit, on the other hand, is single, and sees the game as a way of escaping from her previously dull existence. Although Geena Davis was quite good as Dottie, the two best performances came from two actors I had not previously heard of, Jon Lovitz in the cameo role of Ernie Capadino, and Lori Petty as Kit, who brought out the fierce determination and will to win of her character. I am surprised that she has not gone on to become a bigger star than she has. It was interesting to see Madonna (normally found in starring roles) in a supporting role as Mae, one of the Peaches who rebels against the strict moral code.Tom Hanks stars as Jimmy Dugan, the coach of the Rockford Peaches, in a role created largely because the filmmakers felt that they needed a big male star. Dugan was himself a famous baseball player in his time, but his career was wrecked by his heavy drinking. At the beginning of the film, Dugan is played as a figure of fun, making blunders such as urinating in front of the women, but being too drunk to notice or to care. Later on, Dugan sobers up and develops into a mixture of inspirational coach and dispenser of homespun philosophy along the lines of 'There's no crying in baseball'. At neither stage, however, does the film bring out the genuinely tragic aspects of Dugan's fall from grace as a great, or potentially great, athlete ruined by alcoholism. (One can think of modern parallels such as George Best or Diego Maradona). The actor may be at fault here; during the early part of his career Hanks always seemed a limited actor, convincing in 'Mr Nice Guy' roles but unable to portray more unsympathetic characters. ('Bonfire of the Vanities' being another example). There were one or two other things about the film that I did not like. I felt we should have seen more of Kit between her transfer to Racine and her reappearance in the finals. The opening and closing scenes, showing a reunion of the surviving players more than forty years later, did not add much to the story. (They did, however, correct the misleading impression given in the rest of the film that women's professional baseball came to an end with the war; in fact, it survived until 1954). Overall, however, this was an entertaining film, well worth watching. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fitting,funny tribute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Little did I know as a child that a professional women's baseball league even existed.That just goes to prove what little recognition these ladies have gotten over the years.This film finally pushes them over the top in terms of getting that recognition.Excellent perception and direction by Penny Marshall here in recreating this long ago time;a time of war when the nation needed the simple pleasures of life more than ever,to help them escape,at least temporarily,the horrors of the goings on overseas.With most of the male professional ball players overseas,our beloved women were called upon to fill the void,and boy did they ever fill it!It makes me wish, in some ways,that I could have been there to see it all.A fine comic performance here by Tom Hanks,as Jimmy Dugan, the somewhat reluctant and ignorant(at least,at first) manager of the Rockford Peaches. Outstanding performances as well from Madonna,Rosie O'Donnell,Geena Davis,and Lori Petty.A finer tribute could not have been made.Well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a wonderful film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film! Seeing Geena Davis, Lori Petty, Rosie O'Donnell and Madonna in one film is fantastic. Having it directed by Penny Marshall makes it all the better. After I watched it, for some strange reason I felt I'd watched an extended episode of "Laverne &amp; Shirley" but this is great for the comedy!Tom Hanks was magnificent with all the comic touches that endear him to so many of us.The older version of Dottie at the beginning and ending of the story is NOT Geena Davis made up to look older - neither are any of the other ladies! An excellent casting decision was made to have older actresses play these parts - Lynn Cartright was chosen to play Dottie (Geena Davis) in her late 60's and she was a dead-ringer for Geena!Watch for Tea Leoni (as Racine Belles 1st-base player), Eddie Mekka (Carmine on "Laverne &amp; Shirley" - he dances with Madonna!) and David L. Lander (Squiggy from "L &amp; S" - radio announcer.)Brings a tear to my eye no matter how many times I watch it - right up there with FIELD OF DREAMS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set at the start of World War 2, Geena Davis and Lori Petty are recruited to the first professional baseball league for women. The sisters struggle to keep the league going against the odds, while their own personal rivalry begins to escalate.I don't pretend to know much about baseball, so if this element is poor i wouldn't really notice, but i did feel that it was a good setting for the story.Quite touching and well directed, i was surprised how compelling this movie was. All in all the strong cast and pleasant script makes this a good movie, with a little for everyone.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Penny Marshall's Absolute Home Run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a movie-goer. I watch everything on video or cable. I have seen League of Their Own no less than 50 times, and each time, I'm delighted and amazed at the comedic thought and timing that Penny Marshall put into this movie. This is the only movie that I can quote verbatim during the dialogue. Such gems as when Jimmy Dugan asks why the bus stopped, then "Betty Spaghetti" informs him that "Lou quit." Dugan screams, "Who's Lou?!" And on another Dugan rant, when Rosie O'Donnell's character mumbles, "Is that English?" The expression on the scout's face when he sees how, er, plain-looking Marla looks. His explanation that he has to go home after dropping his recruits off for tryouts, because he needs to shower, shave, and "give the wife some pickle tickle." Beyond the funny, fine performances, though, this film has a sweet sadness that makes it real. In the end, these former professional athletes who made it to their golden years come back to be honored in the Baseball Hall of Fame and play in a virtual homecoming game. They all look pretty much like the grandma who you love or who lives down the street from you, but you know that they're women who were brought together because they all had the guts, determination and talent to change the face of American sports.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can truly watch this movie over and over again and still be inspired by it. I think it shows just what women are capable of. If u haven't seen it i strongly recommend it. It remains at the top of my list and i've seen many award winning movies. It is filled with an amazing cast. It will make u cry and the best part is that there are some true facts. There was this league of women made after most male baseball players had gone to fight in the war. There's romance, fighting, comedy, and some dancing. I mean it has everything a movie needs to be enjoyable. Believe me it wont be a waste of time. You can watch this movie with family and friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A League of Their Own" tells a story that is rarely discussed in historical circles. The country is immersed in World War II and it is up to the women to keep professional baseball going. The film follows the sometimes rocky relationship between two sisters (Geena Davis and Lori Petty) who go from a small town in the midwest to the major leagues. Tom Hanks does outstanding work as the former player who now manages their team. Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell are among the other girls on the team who keep Hanks on his toes. Penny Marshall's direction is very solid here and she tells the story with a dignified style and grace that works well on the silver screen. A very good comedy-drama from the early-1990s. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For me, a very beautiful and inspiring movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the fact of this movie was exhibited on screens in 1992 or 93, I've just saw it on TV in my country only a few days ago. In fact, it isn't the first time it is exhibited, but for one reason or other I've never had seen it. And I've to say that "A League Of Their Own" really touched me. In my country, unlike other Latinamerican like Venezuela, Puerto Rico and -- if I'm not wrong -- Cuba, baseball isn't a popular game, like soccer or tennis. It's played only in some clubs by American citizens or Chilean who lived in the U.S. and learned to play and love it. However, for me the ignorance of the baseball rules is not important, but the fact of that the subjects treated in this movie are universal: fight for a dream and achieve it, solidarity (how beautiful the scene when one of the players teaches to read the one who doesn't know, using a "little hot" short-novel), friendship, hope, dignity and the spirit of trying to be always better. From now on, this movie has become one of my favorites, with some other like "Steel Magnolias" and "Fried Green Tomatoes". Beautiful ones, inspiring, with no-violence and giving a positive message good for our spirits, no matter the zone of the world where you live because, like I've already said, its message is universal: the hope on reaching your dreams and be a better person. And I think that it's marvelous in a world like the present, that sometimes turns so hard to live in. I believe also that it isn't necessary to be American or have had friends or relatives involved in a terrible conflict like the 2nd W.W. to understand this movie. Finally, I'm sorry for my not good English and, if possible, I beg from someone who had had the patience to read this lines up to this point, some additional information about the female baseball league of the United States. I will appreciate it, really. And friendly greetings from Chile, proudly the world's southernmost country!!. (and very friendly with foreigners, too. Visit us, we're waiting for you!!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'A League of Their Own' is a film about an all-female baseball team during the second World War. This film follows the stories about the team of females and their perspective on life and society (as women) during this time in history. I am not a fan of sports or sport-related films, but I did enjoy this one. I think that this film had enough elements for a wider audience to enjoy it. It also is able to combine comedy with drama and history, and it makes an exciting and engaging film with characters that are three-dimension and easy to care about. I think that this is an exciting film, and even if you dislike sports, the film has plenty more to offer for any viewer.</fullReview>

Many people said that a female director wouldn't do this film any good. I think that this movie needed a female director and it couldn't have been done any better!

		<shortDescription>Plastic nostalgia...but Geena Davis and Lori Petty are perfectly cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A modern-day reunion of WWII-era women's league baseball players brings back fond memories for one such lady, who recalls the journey she and her kid sister made to brief but tangible stardom in America's Golden Era. Director Penny Marshall's nostalgic valentine to war-time tomboys puts the squeeze on us right from the start (with elderly actress Lynn Cartwright dubbed with Geena Davis' voice, to ill effect). Marshall wants to make sure we don't miss any of her hat-tricks, some of which (including a urination gag) that misfire completely. The cast of high-spirited gals (and Tom Hanks as their coach) are alternately lively, wonderful, and excruciating. Rosie O'Donnell is a real chore stomping about on the field, but Geena Davis and Lori Petty (as competitive sisters) are genuinely charming, shrewdly cast, and nearly flawless (a movie about them alone would be worth watching). The film isn't nearly as hearty as it wants to be (the mechanical seams show right through), but the put-on sentiment may hook some. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of my favorite movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>a league of their own is one of my favorite movies of all time. from start to finish it not only makes you laugh but gives you an inside view of women in baseball during the second world war. i had not known until this film came out that women even played baseball in the 1940's while the men were away fighting. history class obviously skipped some things. geena davis gives one of her best performances as dottie hinson a natural born ball player with a heart of gold. dottie watches out for her younger sister kit who is plagued with insecurities and self doubt. dottie and kit are given the chance to be apart of the first women's baseball league and with some insistence on kit's part they go for it. eventually they end up on the same team and the fun begins with laughs from rosie o'donnell and madonna. madonna is wonderful in this movie and i wish she would take a cue from it and do more supporting roles in good comedies/dramas. sibling rivalry consumes kit and dottie takes a loss to give kit the confidence she never had. penny marshall directs with a natural ease and integrity that is rare in Hollywood. why penny hasn't won an academy award for best director is not good by me. this is a movie worth owning! buy the special edition!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the gals did a magnificent job in this delightfully entertaining film. Tom Hanks and the rest of the cast also deserve cheers. Penny Marshall's direction was flawless especially when invoking tears in many parts of the film. The ladies like Lynn Cartwright et al were not only brilliantly cast as older look-a-likes but they simply WERE the younger actresses 40 years later.The film is paced well with excellent timing and begins in 1943 went the men went to war. As I understand the Ladies league lasted between 1943 and 1954. I, myself, enjoy women's baseball and soccer. A true spirit and comradery was displayed throughout this exciting and touching movie. Congratulations to all and I certainly want more films like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Valentine to the All American Girls Baseball League, but Where have you gone Geena Davis?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A joyous gift to the women who graced the diamond. Here is slightly altered historic proof that women can be just as exciting and skilled as men in sports. The fact that a female baseball league survived twelve years during the 40's and 50's is a little surprising. I love the scene with the "proper" ladies on the radio, talking about the "masculinization of women." It is vintage American stupidity. Geena Davis, who needs to more movies, and Lori Petty, ditto, are great as the dueling Dotty and Kit. Tom Hanks and Jon Lovitz steal the movie with supporting roles slammed out of the park. Nearly every line they utter is classic. Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell, and Megan Cavanagh as team mates are strong as well. The interplay between these five women is awesome as well, such as the scene where Dotty, Kit, Mae, and Doris meet. The direction of the baseball scenes is far more exciting than any real baseball I have ever seen. Aside from a script that could have used some streamlining and focus, this is a great movie that is funny, emotional, and entertaining.*Ernie: "See the way this works is, the train leaves, not the station"***Jimmy: Did anyone ever tell you that you look like a little p*n*s with a hat on?"**</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many others, I didn't know anything about a wartime female baseball league so the story was fascinating to me. The film is beautifully told and is very touching and funny. The plot follows the women who made up a professional girls' baseball league during the second world war when the guys went fightin'. And then of course the war is over, and the guys come back - then what happens to the women with their glimpse of independence and a life outside the kitchen? There are lots of good character arcs, particularly the two sisters, Dottie (Geena Davis) and Kit (Lori Petty), and the washed up has-been, Jimmy Dugan, played by Tom Hanks with about 2 stone extra on him for the role.The flashback structure works so well you can't imagine doing it any other way. All the actors do a great job, but for me, Lori Petty as Kit, Dottie's kid sister, steals the show. She is brilliant. Watch out for occasional glimpses of Tea Leoni as a Racine hitter.Apparently all the injuries seen were sustained by the actors themselves. You can believe it too - they really look like ball players. First-rate editing makes it genuinely exciting sport. The film could have been a stinker - there are many cliches and it's pretty predictable, but it's handled with great sympathy and sentiment without treacle by Penny Marshall. Twists and subplots would have been out of place - this is a classic feelgood and entertains without dragging on.I give this 7 out of 10. On a rainy afternoon it's great entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some big talent, but a sickly sweet script and direction by Marshall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A League of Their Own (1992)It's funny, but I remember seeing this when it came out in a tiny theater with an oversized screen in upstate New York, and I really liked it. It seems big and fun, with some great characters, and I was just getting to know Tom Hanks. This time I still loved the fun parts, and with Madonna being silly and Rosie O'Donnell being a crack-up it was worth the look. But it's not an especially good movie. In fact, it's kind of a pastiche of ideas, even though there is a solid historical basis for the plot (the creation of a woman's professional baseball league to replace the men's league during WWII). At times it's trying to be a touching story of young women with real dreams of greatness. Other times it's making hay off the historical quirks, including the sexist madness of it all (without any actual comment on that sexism). Other aspects include a businessman's world mercenary intentions (with David Strathairn as the good guy in that mix). It's cobbled together without a lot of realism?in other words, it's all for entertainment.Which is fine. But then there is the Penny Marshall touch. This famous director/writer has a way of making things as simple and sugary as possible, as if we are all living in a Hallmark commercial. It undermines every single aspect listed above, including the touching part, which is her real goal. By the very end, with the inevitable look at the contemporary women (who are played by actresses, don't be fooled into thinking they are the real deal), it gets moving but in that pushy way that makes you kind of glad the film is finally ending.Too bad. There is more potential here than all that.There is a host of striving baseball movies that fall flat due to sentiment. I like baseball, but movies like "42" and "The Natural" (and even the recent Clint Eastwood "Trouble with the Curve") seem to acknowledge that the sport is something mired in a nostalgic past. Only in something like "Moneyball" does it morph into something bigger, and much better. So maybe it's me wanting baseball to be great but also realistic and vivid and intense. Not sticky with honey and amber glows.Yeah, an enjoyable movie on many little levels, including moments of nearly everyone's performances. But don't expect more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice fictional film on women's pro baseball league</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A League of Their Own" is an enjoyable film about the short stint that women's professional baseball had in the U.S. From 1943 to 1954, there was a professional league that was the brainchild of Chicago chewing gum magnate Philip Wrigley. He and other baseball owners started the league supposedly to keep baseball "alive" in the minds of the public during World War II. The thinking was that the sport might die out because so many men who played professional baseball went off to war. The women's league went through a few name changes. In 1943, the All- American Girls Softball League was changed to the All-American Girls Baseball League. The league ranged from four to 10 teams each year and had a total of 15 teams over its 12-year history. It started with four teams, two of which are portrayed playing the first girls baseball world series in 1943 ? the Racine Belles and the Rockford Peaches. The movie is a highly fictionalized story of the founding and first year of the league. But it includes a reunion of many of the girls at the National Baseball Hall of Fame when its Women in Baseball exhibit opened on Nov. 5, 1988. Penny Marshal who produced and directed the movie, attended that opening and shot scenes there. The lead character, Dottie Hinson (played by Geena Davis) was said to be a composite of two of the real girl players ? Dottie Kamenshek and Pepper Paire Davis. In the movie, Dottie is married and plays just one year until her wounded husband returns from the war. The real Kamenshek, however, began playing when she was 17 and never married. She was considered the best player of the league and led her team, the Rockford Peaches, to four of the 12 series titles. She led the league in many stats. All the rest of the characters in the film were fictional as well, as was the Peaches' manager, Jimmy Dugan, played by Tom Hanks. I suppose Hollywood thought a straight story based mostly on facts and real characters wouldn't be as glamorous or interesting. There's no doubt that Hanks' Jimmy Dugan added some color to the film. But the film does give an accurate portrayal of the training the girls were required to take ? off the field. They studied etiquette and manners. And it is a good account of the uniforms and other aspects of the girls professional baseball. The girls teams played mostly at larger towns outside of the major league cities. That also makes the supposed purpose of the league ? to keep baseball alive in the minds of the public ? suspect. After all, the big leagues (National and American) continued to play ball all during the war. They did suspend play for a couple days after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. But the game went on and each year the World Series games were played at the end of the regular season. For the record, the St Louis Cardinals won the 1942 World Series over the NY Yankees. The Yankees turned the trick the next year against the Cards. Then, the Cards won the 1944 Series over cross-town rivals, the St. Louis Browns. Finally, in 1945 the Detroit Tigers took the Series over the Chicago Cubs. I mention this because a scene sticks in my mind from the 1943 movie, "Guadalcanal Diary." William Bendix is a corporal who's listening to a game on the radio and rooting for the Brooklyn Dodgers. There's some talk among the men about the possibility of the Dodgers winning the pennant to play the Yankees in the World Series. That probably was the year of the movie ? 1943. The Dodgers finished third that year in the National League, behind Cincinnati and far behind the Cards. Still, one wonders if there might not have been one or more other reasons behind the women's pro baseball league. For starters, how about another venue of wholesome and interesting entertainment for folks back home during the war? Especially since the folks outside the cities didn't often get to see big league games. Remember ? this is before television. Then there's always the profit motive. One scene in the film addresses this. The Walter Harvey character (of chewing gum fame ? guess who) played by Garry Marshall tells Ira Lowenstein, the league manager, played by David Strathairn, that the league will have to shut down after the first year because it's losing money. Of course, Ira does some things to turn that around, with the help of some of the players. The movie completely dodges one aspect of the girls pro baseball league. That has to do with sizes and distances. The ball they used to start with was the same size as a softball ? 12 inches in circumference (compared to the 9-inch baseball). And they pitched it underhanded. The infield was considerably smaller than that of pro baseball. The distance between bases was 65 feet, compared to 90 in baseball. The pitcher's mound was 40 feet from home plate, compared to 60 feet, six inches. As the years went on after the war, the field distances widened and got closer to those of baseball, and by 1948, the ball size was 10 3/8 inches and overhand pitching was allowed. This is an enjoyable film to watch and a nice tribute to women's baseball and sports in general. For more history and an accurate account of the girls pro baseball league, one might visit the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, NY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Women playing professional baseball leagues, a big turning point for our country.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A League of their own is a great movie. I have watched it several times over the years. This is one of them films that I could never get tired of watching. When I first seen this film for the first time I thought it was neat that women were playing baseball professionally. What appeared to me most was women were doing something something different then what they was expected to do. This movie just proves that women can be just as good at sports as men are.During World War two a lot of jobs became available to women, including baseball. Candy manufacturing magnate Walter Harvey comes up with a plan to start a professional women's baseball league, so he sends scout Ernie Capadino to recruit players. Capadino comes across Dottie Hinson in Oregon. He is very impressed and offers her a shot at tryouts but she is not interested. However her younger sister Kit Keller loves baseball and is really interested, but the scout is not interested in Kit. Eventually Capadino tells Kit she can come along if Dottie comes and try's out. So the two set off to Chicago for tryouts. Both of the them make the same team, The Peaches, which is coached by a drunkard former baseball player Jimmy Dugan. He thinks this whole thing is a joke and does nothing but stay drunk in the pit. Dottie guides and directs the team. Jimmy gets to see how good the team really is and then steps up to the plate of being coach. With Dottie doing something spectacular the team ends up in being successful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading the previous 'critique' of this film, I will state that I didn't view the film on individual performances. I do believe that the cast was able to work together, much like a well oiled baseball/softball team should. The performances were stellar all around..why?? Because for 2 hours you were able to loose yourself in the concept of the movie. For those of us that ARE ex-baseball/softball players this film was able to give us a nostalgic back flash. Oh, and by the way........for persons who love the game, and I am speaking for all of the players who have a love of the game......switching from a softball to a baseball poses NO problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A League of Their Own is the greatest movie of ALL TIME. The cast is brilliant, solid acting, excellent cinematography...the whole package. This movie is long, but it draws you in to each character and follows three perfectly woven story lines that keep your attention throughout. The writing is hilarious, moving, intense, informative, touching, and inspiring. A League of Their Own is the most quotable movie ever made with such popular gems as "there's no crying in baseball" and "the hard is what makes it great". The characters will steal your heart and give you the sense that you're living their victories and defeats along with them. It is appropriate enough for the entire family and entertaining enough for any group. I would not classify it as a sports movie or a chick flick...just a really good film. You have no?[</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The bit where Jimmy kisses the old woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the funniest part of this film is when Stewell puts his hands over the bus drivers eyes and the driver subsequently quits and Miss Copbun {not sure of name} runs after him out the door. The funny thing being when she comes back to tell Jimmy {Tom Hanks.} He mistakenly kisses her thinking she was one of the younger girls when he wakes up, just the way he screams gets me every time. Then he goes and shouts to the girls outside to get back on the bus and none of them understand what he says. Also when he delivers the line 'by the way I loved you in the Wizard Of Oz' its just classic Tom Hanks.Does anyone else agree.Another favourite bit of mine is when Marla is doing her tryout for Mr Capodino his face when she comes over to meet him. This film has got to be one of the best sports films ever made. It has everything in it comedy, drama, tears and a fab ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. There were some great lines ("There's NO CRYING in baseball!") and the cast was fabulous, even the minor characters (Garry Marshall is one of my all-time favorite character actors). Tom Hanks was brilliant, and one gets the feeling that if Madonna had stuck to comedy she'd be a huge box office draw by now. The only thing I didn't really care about was the "rivalry" going on between Dottie Hinson and her sister-Kip was one of the weakest characters in the film and too much attention was paid to her for her to be so underdeveloped.If you haven't seen it, rent it sometime during the baseball season. It's almost as good as "The Natural" and better than "Field of Dreams."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realize it's a little late to be commeting on a movie thats thirteen years old, but I didn't see it till recently, so whether it's proper, or not, I feel like I need to comment on it because it's such a wonderful movie.Every lady who played in the movie, played their parts with perfection.Maddona, Lori Pettie, Rosie O'Donnell, and Geena Davis, of course stole the show, but without the support of the multi talented rest of the cast, as well as the stunt people, they couldn't have pulled it off.And let us not forget Tom Hanks, character, as the teams manager, who started out as being a misanthropic idiot, but as the movie progressed,he gradually became a relatively tolerable human being. Only Hanks could have pulled this character off with such an air of perfection.I think one reason for this film being such a wonderful, interesting, entertaining, and watchable movie, is the fact that Penny Marshall directed it. She couldn't have (in my opinion) done a better job.I've watched this movie, probably ten times, and expect I probably will watch it at least that many more. The movie it is in every respect one of the best I've seen. Ladies playing baseball, especially pretty ladies is a pleasurs to watch.Thanks for letting me express my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb movie and tribute to the Women's Professional Baseball League.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until this movie came out, most of the general American public, even the baseball fans, knew little to nothing about the old Women's League. This movie, starring a purposely overweight Tom Hanks as the boozing, washed up baseball man Jimmy Dugan, asked to coach the women, is a delight and pays appropriate tribute to those female players of old.The nominal female star is Geena Davis as Dottie, a young married woman with a husband in the Army. Dottie is a natural athlete and becomes the star of her team. She wasn't even planning to try out, but the scouts saw her while visiting to see her little sister, Kit, played by Lori Petty. Kit was marginal, and Dottie's going along was a way to get Kit a chance. Kit remained marginal, and that was a source of drama between the sisters.Madonna does a credible job as Mae (center field) and Rosie O'Donnell as Doris (3rd base). Jon Lovitz is quite good, and quite a hoot, as the baseball scout, Ernie Capadino. The ladies in this movie play fairly believable baseball, and the whole story is a very touching one. The movie has much good humor in it too, like the scenes where a drunken Jimmy Dugan is trying to give one set of signals, while Dottie is trying to keep the team on a even keel, giving a different set of signals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless classic...(Contains Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the early 1940s and a World War is at hand. With most American males, including famous baseball players, going off to war, a plan is made to keep the baseball industry going by drafting women to fill their beloved men's shoes.Enter Dotti Henson and Kit Kellar, two sisters who battle each other both at their home on the farm and on the ball field. Kit, a decent pitcher at best, feels as though she's constantly in the shadow of her older, married, more athletic and all-around better sister, Dotti.During the girls' struggle to see who can truly be "The Best," we meet many colorful characters, including Jimmy Duggan (a brilliant Tom Hanks), coach of the Rockford Peaches, the team Kit and Dotti play for. From there, the balls fly and the base runs just keep on comin'.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***In my opinion, this is Penny Marshall's best film. Never have a group of women been portrayed in such a graceful AND strong light as "A League of Their Own." Geena Davis, Hanks, and Lori Petty shine in their leading roles, while Rosie O'Donnell, Madonna, and David Strathairn are brilliant as the supporting cast.This timeless piece of cinematography will pull at your heartstrings in ways you've not felt in a long time. We all rolled on the floor laughing when Jimmy Duggan finally outwitted the bratty Steelwell Angel by hitting him in the face with a baseball mitt. No one could stop the tears from flowing when they heard Betty "Spaghetti" scream out the name of her husband George who, along with countless other young soldiers, was never coming back. And who will ever forget the delightful chills they felt in their spine when Kit Keller was hoisted up on her teammates' shoulders to the crowd excitedly chanting her name, finally saving the day and proving that sometimes, simply "wanting it more" really can make all the difference, even removing the brutal power struggle between two sisters who realize that they love each other more than all the home runs in the world.I recommend this film for anyone that wants to see a movie that will make you laugh and cry without taking either to the extreme. "A League of Their Own" is a classic film and will definitely be around for years to come.God bless you all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sparkling celebration of some diamond women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Realistic, misty eyed and farcical by turns, but always entertaining, Penny Marshall's 1992 movie is based on an episode of WWII that was all but forgotten before the film was made. Short of male players, because of war service, Chicago Cubs owner, Philip K Wrigley, developed a professional women's league. The movie embodies one major embroidery of the truth - the actual wartime league played a modified form of softball, not the hardball depicted on screen. However, other features are factual, such as the emphasis on the "girls" - never women - maintaining their decorum and charm off the playing field, while wearing short skirts on it. (See www.aagpbl.org)Geena Davis is in her element as feisty and hugely talented catcher/hitter, Dottie Hinson; the rivalry between Dottie and her less able, pitcher sister, Kit (Lori Petty), gives some edge to the movie. Madonna allows herself to be typecast as sexy 'All the way' Mae; and Tom Hanks plays the falling-down-drunk manager, who is inspired into laying off the booze by his team's dedication. There is plenty of exciting baseball action, of course, which is exaggerated, but no more so than in other sports films. However, the most telling and poignant shot in the movie is when a young African-American woman spectator - at that time excluded from professional baseball along with black men - throws a ball back to Dottie, with a defiant expression. </fullReview>

After I'm done watching this movie, I always have to think about it for a long time. Did Dottie mean to drop the ball? Why couldn't Kit have stayed at Rockford, and shouldn't they have won!

		<shortDescription>I Loved It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie long time ago and I still watch this movie. "A League of Their Own" is absolutely hilarious and also has some drama. I think this movie owes a big one to the actors who brought so much fun. Geena Davis plays Dottie Hinson, a loving sister who has some troubles with her younger sister, Kit, and struggles on making decisions of wether she should stay in baseball team (Rockford Peaches) or go back to her home with her husband who just came back from World War II with broken arm(or was it a leg?). It surprised me when I found out that Geena was inches taller than most of the women in the movie. She showed off many fascinating stunts, such as catching a flying baseball with one hand and sliding like a ballerina when catching the foul ball. She was great.Tom Hanks was hilarious as Jimmy Dugan, an alcoholic hitter who became a baseball coach of Rockford Peaches. Jim hates that job, but as the time goes by, he realizes that the girls are very good and he gets pretty enthusiastic about the game and all. I love the part when he gets frustrated and shouts, "There's no crying in baseball!" and gets on a fight with the judge. Jimmy Dugan is probably one of Tom's best characters so far.Another great performance by Lori Petty, who played Geena Davis' sister, Kit. Kit is a very good player, but she gets jealous of Dottie and eventually joins another team called Racines. Somehow, I loved her performance.Then there are other great actings by Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell. They are somewhat nasty girls in the team who happen to be two close best friends. They bring so much joy to this movie and I loved the dancing scene at the bar. Madonna plays her part really well and Rosie is just great as always.Megan Cavannagh was funny also. She played Marla Hooch, who was obviously one of the best players in the team, but unfortunately her looks did matter when she was joining the team. Even though she might not be a best singer (scene at the bar was funny!), she met a great man and got married. Ann Cusack, who played Shirley Baker was pretty forgettable, but she played the sweetest role. Other roles like a player who is a mother of a naughty son (can't remember her name, though) was also sweet, and the player who lost her husband made me cry. A pretty blonde player who used to be Miss Georgia was good also. Jon Lovitz plays a scout and gives the hilarious lines and I wish he had played more. And don't miss Tea Leoni as the Racine player! She appears in some scenes, so keep your eyes open. And the older version of the characters looked so much like the younger versions. Especially the Old Dottie Hinson.So if you are depressed and want to watch a funny, witty movie and just have some fun - go and rent this movie. I would give 3 1/2 out of 5 (probably not a breath-taking film, but very entertaining).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Davis Makes It A Winning Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a sports fan, it's fun to see a film of a little different nature, the case here being women's pro baseball - something that actually took place for a short time during World War II.The best thing going for the film, in my opinion, was a very likable lead character - someone you could really root for - in Geena Davis' character "Dottie Hinson." She made the movie, as far as I was concerned as the rest of the cast - although good - was not particularly likable.For instance, Tom Hanks plays a profane, drunken manager, and not a lot of laughs except for famous, "There is no crying in baseball" line which has become famous. Then there is the family-friendly Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell. Yikes! Actually, Madonna plays a nice, subdued character and she's okay to watch but, frankly, it's hard for me to warm up to O'Donnell in any role. Just hearing that voice is enough to call 'time out' and stop the game. Many of the men in here are generally pictured as sexist idiots, which is the way left-wing Hollywood likes to portray men.The sad thing is, this is another one of the these Penny Marshall films that ignorant national movie critics call a "family film." However, profanity - which includes four blasphemes (even one by Davis which ruined her good-person character image at that point), a two-minute scene of hearing Hanks taking a pee....and other things hardly add up to "family fare."However, it is an entertaining adult movie that has a lot of charm to it and is recommended, especially if you're a baseball fan.</fullReview>

It is moving and funny, exciting and uplifting--with terrific music, acting and directing. If you are a baseball fan, you have to see it. Geena Davis and Tom Hanks are incredible, and the final scene is magical. The story of two sisters competing, and the death of a husband, and the stories of love, respect, friendship and redemption--it's all there. Look for Tea Leoni at first base, and a hilarious Madonna. It's a beautiful story and spectacularly presented.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well Acted and Compelling Baseball Drama,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A League of Their Own is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's a very compelling drama with a lot of heart and very likable characters, I'm not sure how historically accurate it really is, but it feels very natural throughout. I felt like it needed more character development from characters outside of Dottie, of course she is the main character and we are going to learn the most about her, but some more development from Jimmy and several female characters would have helped the story progress. The film also has many funny parts, though it isn't purely a comedy, it has several bits that are there for a chuckle and I appreciated this, it dosen't take itself too seriously. A compelling movie with a strong cast, I would recommend A League of Their Own to anyone looking for a good drama or sports film. Two sisters become rivals when they join the first female professional baseball league during World War II. Best Performance: Geena Davis Worst Performance: Madonna</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My review for A League Of Their Own(1992)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was on More than Movies last night and since I am a fan of Tom Hanks for a very long time I decided to check it out. The film also stars Madonna,Geena Davis(from Stuart Little franchise),Bill Pullman(from While You Were Sleeping and teamed up with Tom Hanks a year after this film was made for Sleepless In Seattle),and Rosie O Donnell(also in Sleepless in Seattle as Meg Ryan's BFF).The movie is based on the fictional story of an All American Girls Professional Baseball Tournament and tells the tale of a group of women(one led by Genna Davis who is an excellent baseball player btw) who's husbands are out during World War II and they join a baseball tournament where Tom Hanks's character Jimmy Duggan trains them for baseball. They of course have to battle it out with other professional baseball players to see will they go further in their team and win the tournament, but can they win the tournament in 1943?The film is set in 1943 and its been told in flashbacks since the film is taken place in 1992 and 1943 where we see an old Dottie(now played by Lynn Cartwright,while the younger version of her is played by Genna Davis)who visits her old buddies since her husband passed away and she quit the tournament a long time ago and we see her at the grand opening of a museum about their lives and on the All American Girl's Professional Baseball Tournament near the end of the film which was pretty interesting.Bottom line I enjoyed this movie as it tells you that it doesn't matter what gender you are you can do anything and also you can play baseball at any gender. Also the supporting cast is great and Tom Hanks was great in this movie as I consider him a very good actor as any film he is in he delivers his performances very well in each role he does. The movie also has some very funny moments and some touching moments too.Overall its a 7/10Also keep an eye out for Garry Marshall who stars in this movie too. The film is also directed by Big director Penny Marshall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tribute to a fastly becoming lost generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to vote 10, but I feel its doing the film an injustice. I wasn't a great Madonna fan, yet I love the theme song (and have gelled to her in later years) and being a Brit Baseball, I have played. Yet this film bring out an emotion of a time when a generation was hard done in a world war, the ups and downs of this film leave you with a feeling of I would watch it again. It's hard not to quote from the movie, but to think my mother was once living with all the emotions that every generation has to deal with. I love the whole idea of this type of film. We look back at great times and people who still have a passion. I think all too often we overlook things in the present and make films that are there as money cows, with special effects or some boring theme that all the studios copy until its died a death. My only regret is reading that the soundtrack hasn't got the Madonna song on it and that only a limited version was produced in a shorter time. Madonna should release it as a bonus track, even you-tube do not have the song listed now. But back to the film, I miss my parents and as I get older then I think that I should record things for my kids to read, maybe make a film script themselves. For every generation has a story to tell and I think todays generation will have the hardest yet. But if you want to look back on days of simple pleasure then watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two sisters (Davis &amp; Petty) help make the first ever professional baseball league. They make sure it's successful, but problems begin to commence. Manager Jimmy Duggan (Hanks) is a former star player that has a drinking problem and refuses to take the job seriously. Meanwhile, tension brews among the girls. This was a really good movie! I'm a guy, but I've always thought men and women should have equal rights. I'm not sexist and I try to not discriminate. They mirrored the time period precisely and I enjoyed the look of the field and the baseball uniforms. The baseball action is exciting as well. Some of the catches the girls made were very athletic. Geena Davis and Lori Petty are the heart of this movie! Their passion and intensity really made this movie. They were on the top of their games. Hanks is excellent as he always is, but he has tremendous support. Even Rosie O'Donnell is admittedly solid, and I can't stand her! Madonna adds star power. The ending is very heartwarming and made me smile. Baseball fans and movie fans in general shouldn't have much to complain about! It's exciting, engrossing, and riveting. Check it out!8/10</fullReview>

It has positive aspects: It's an all-star cast, it has the incredible Tom Hanks in the film, it's about woman power, and it's has quite a few funny moments too. So why do I have a strong distaste for the movie? I like baseball, I like the cast, I like the woman-power idea, I like comedy, I like Tom Hanks and the story is good. What is wrong with me and this film?! I still cannot put my finger on the reason I do not enjoy this movie. I would rather have my teeth pulled than to re-watch this film.I cannot give this movie a bad review because I have nothing but good to say about it.

		<shortDescription>A different twist on the baseball genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit that when watching the film I was rather impressed with it since it touched about something different in baseball which has rarely talked about which was women playing in the league, the idea behind behind the concept was test world war 2 threatened to nearly cancel baseball so the idea of a women's major league was crested as a way of keeping the genre alive. I was very impressed with the film, since it had great performances from Genia Davis, Tom hanks, and Lori petty. The supporting cast including Rosie o Donnell and Madonna in one of her better performances was actually quite decent. I would say that this is a film test is a must see for baseball fans and casual viewership, since it is something gets has a heart, humor, and a touching story that will continue to be adored by fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stands in a League of Of Its Own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes I know everybody continually uses that classic line from Tom Hanks, "there's no crying in baseball." Well after watching "A League of Their Own", I can't help but shedding tears of joy. It's surely one of those films that will leave you awestruck in how good it is while at the same time, it will also leave your heart fluttering with ecstatic and joy once the end credits roll.Set in the year 1943,the heart and soul of WWII where all the male athletes went off to war to take down Hitler and his band of Nazis. The baseball association trying to keep up with America's pastime, goes off on a scouting female ballplayers to fill the void. It looked very doubtful at first with tickets not selling and it looked as the though the MLB was going to go on strike. But after seeing just how talented these ladies are, marketing started to take notice. And as they say, the rest is history. The central focus on the story is on two sisters, Dottie Hinson (Geena Davis) and Kit Keller (Lori Petty) who join the team the Rockford Peaches and the trials and tribulations the team face and the sibling rivalry that comes with it.On the whole, the casting was phenomenal. The ensemble excels well in their respected roles and from the looks of things, the girls truly love and know their baseball. Tom Hanks shines in one of his last light-hearted films before he turned a new chapter in his career to play more serious Oscar winning film. He was hilarious as former slugger turned alcoholic wash-up who takes up the initiative to manage the girls to the World Series against the Racine. I can even tolerate the scene where he urinates for five minutes. Davis turns in her best performance as Dottie. She had the right attitude and even believable that she had her share of flaws. She had her squabbles with her sister, but what sibling hasn't fought with each other? Petty was equally poignant as the younger sibling Kit who never felt comfortable being perpetually usurped by her older sister. And that feeling has the same effects other younger siblings face in their lifetime. The only two performers that didn't sit well for me were from Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell as center-fielder Mae Mordabito and 3B Doris Murphy respectfully. Sure they were manageable as tough New Yorkers, but I think they casted because of their celebrity status rather than their ability to act.I'm kind of a fan of sports movies, especially if it's an underdog story. In this case it was the entire female baseball teams. They struggled to grab the medias attention and to be taken seriously. I was also fascinated by the stories that the ladies had about their husbands going off to war. These stories itself sales as the grief these ladies have will also have an impact on the audience. That being said, this movie goes beyond the parameters of an all-girls baseball team, in which a non-sports fan can indulge in.The sets, props and costumes were really apropos to the time period. The cars, the clothes and the colloquial period language are what I would expect from the war laden era of the 1940's. The score also sets the tone to the time period this movie is set in. It shows that the crew was doing their research when they made this movie. Hats off to the crew.This movie was everything you'd want it to be. It had drama, humor, nostalgia, sports and most of all inspiration. This is truly one movie that has hit a homer in our hearts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Entertaining Baseball Movie WIth Some Curve Balls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is little doubt that to the average viewer this is an entertaining, well-made film, and if you and your family are in a non-critical mode, in the mood for a baseball movie, some easy laughs and a tiny bit of history, this is a good choice.If there is a problem with the film its because its trying to do three things simultaneously: Is it a serious feminist document about women in baseball in the 1940s? Is it a predictable comedy with stereotyped characters (the grumpy manager who doesn't think women can play ball..guess what happens?) and all-too familiar plot lines? Is it a three-hankie tear jerker with lots of female bonding to ensure the waterworks will flow? Director Penny Marshall balances the elements effectively, but the honor she could have done to the real accomplishment of these sports- minded pioneers too frequently smacks of the sitcom; nevertheless, fine performances all round, especially from lead Geena Davis</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually had an interest in this film because Im a Tom Hanks fan however i did recognize Geena Davis she looked so familiar. I just kept saying her name over and over again then my mind had a Brain Blast she was in BeetleJuice and Thelma and Louise. I watched her in this film and I'm like WOW !!! Geena was perfect for the role of Dottie , so confident and caring and mature and sexy enough lol.I agree with a lot of other people on here saying Madonna was quite swell as Mae I loved the way she walked , her attitude , her voice and even she smoked brilliantly. Also Kit was interesting you could tell her jealousy and her high spirit. Her getting showered down was funny , Her older self look exactly like her !!! i was shocked when I looked in the credits and found out it was not the same actress.Jimmy Dugan ( Tom Hanks) played as a coach - it was strange I think because he was a supporting character and added some comical and seriousness moments to the film. To me it was weird not liking Tom Hanks character right away and he was not the main star , I just had to get use to that as I watched it. However he did a decent of enough job drunk and then cleaning up his act to help out the Womens baseball team ( but i thought they could have shown that a little better ! )Last comments - I liked the film Dottie and Kit had great sibling history going on there - they had each others backs / loved each other / laughed together / cried together / played baseball together / argued together and were a family. A womens team beating the odds - its no where near a chick flick in my opinion. Hanks did a decent job but keep in mind Geena Davis is the star who deserves 2 thumbs up. Problems with the film ? not many a little over done at the end I thought and Tom hanks should have been in the film a bit more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A womens baseball movie one of the best baseball movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering that this womens baseball league of the 1940's and early 50's is the only time in history that baseball was really played on a high level by women(softball is different enough to be it's own sport). It's amazing that Penny Marshall was able to make one of the better movies about baseball. Really compelling characters by almost everyone on the team where they're all real characters and not just a handful of main characters and the rest being just glorified extras like how it normally goes.While the movie has a very ensemble feel to it, it still mostly focuses on Geena Davis and Lori Petty playing sisters. Tom Hanks is great as the washed up former MLB star who's now forced to manage the womens team. Even Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell do good in their supporting roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full Review of the film A League of Their Own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film A League of Their Own follows two sisters, Dottie Henson (Geena Davis) and Kit Keller (Lori Petty), on their journey from rural Oregon to the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. They ran into characters that shaped their lives, Marla Hooch (Megan Cavanagh), Ernie Capadino (Jon Lovitz), Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks), and many more, along the way that allowed these two women grow from bickering sisters to in the end respected equals. The theme of this movie is sibling rivalry and how no matter where you are or what you have done in life at some point in time siblings must become equals. This theme reflects the type of theme you could find in such films as Lion King and Thor where that rivalry spurs a tumultuous relationship.Dottie Henson was always the toast of the small town that these two girls grew up in, and until a scout, Ernie Capadino, discovered Dottie for the new professional women's baseball league forming due to the war it looked like the two girls would forever live in the small town and Kit forever in Dottie's shadow. As they became Rockford Peaches and grew together through this league and the bonding found within the team there were still moments where Kit felt constantly outdone by the star of the league her big sister Dottie. Dottie was constantly favored by their coach and her friend Jimmy Dugan as well as the man running the league itself Ira Lowenstein (David Strathairn).This theme and conflict ultimately ends up with a fight between the sisters where Kit gets traded to Racine, but as you will find out after viewing the film Kit may end up getting the last laugh. Ultimately the women end up respecting one another and Kit feels vindicated and can truly consider Dottie a sister and a friend instead of something in her life holding her back.There are moments where the techniques used by the filmmakers allow the viewer to get a great glimpse into what the sisters are feeling towards one another. In the final game of their series to determine the champion of the league, in the heat of the game the director decides to constantly go to close-ups of both Dottie and Kit as they are facing off in this battle of wills. The viewer can see the confidence, yet sympathy of Dottie as she feels for her sister and all of her trials. The viewer also can see the fear of losing in Kit's face, but this fear is accompanied by a raw determination. The other element of film that brought this theme to life was the intense dialogue brought to us in a phenomenal script. In one scene where Kit has been traded the big argument takes place, and with the dialogue accompanied by tremendous performances by Geena Davis and Lori Petty the viewer is watching such an intense and raw moment that you can actually feel Kit's desperation and Dottie's anger and frustration.This film set in the backdrop of an upside-down era of World War II speaks to millions of children and young adults going through this very same theme in their lives. Sibling rivalry is something most families go through in our society and A League of Their Own portrays in a wonderfully made film how siblings can and should overcome these issues so they can become friends and respected peers. With love and respect the most strained relationship can be mended as long as the two individuals are willing to put their differences aside and embrace what makes them two great people and A League of Their Own illustrates that in an entertaining film for all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've spent the whole of my life in England and though I've spent a fair amount of time - including an Academic year - in the US I've never seen a live game of baseball. Nevertheless I'm very much aware of a lack of films about baseball and have enjoyed all the ones I have seen. These is an exceptional feel-good entry and the DVD comes complete with extras confirming that there was, in fact, a women's baseball league that was active between 1943 and 1954. Penny Marshall does a good job on bullhorn and manages to capture the 'feel' of the war years and even Madonna makes no attempt at grandstanding which would have overbalanced the film. It's also notable that there's no real attempt at romance although we do see the girls fraternising at a dance, one of the team actually does find romance but this is very much played down. The Geena Davis character (based on a real female star of the era) is married throughout but there is some fine underplayed attraction between her and Tom Hanks but this is more or less extinguished when her serviceman husband, Bill Pullman, is invalided out of the service. This means that Marshall is free to concentrate on baseball itself and this she does well. An excellent film on an usual subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Women Took a Sports and Made it Theirs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unless you're a history buff you may not know that there was a women's baseball league -- the All American Girls' Professional Baseball League, formed in 1943 -- and while the men were away fighting the war in Europe these women kept the spirit alive by playing an game that has become part of Americana. Itself a sports version of SWING SHIFT, A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN is a sentimental journey back in time to when all this was taking place and it seemed that women would also claim this as their own sports in a male-dominated world. (They didn't, but it was good while it lasted.)The story of how these very different women came together from all areas of the country, played under the tutelage of Jimmy Dugan, a one-time baseball hero who was now going through his own bad patch as an alcoholic, is the basis for Penny Marshall's movie. Focusing mainly on Dottie Hinson and Kit Keller, sisters living in Oregon who become a part of this team but due to Kit's hotheaded temper, eventually become estranged and playing opposite teams, the movie in itself becomes an interesting view of how cutthroat woman can be in the sports arena, but also, how a sisterhood can thrive in the face of a horror that hovers over like an invisible cloud.With performances by Geena Davis (then at the top of her movie career, going from hit to hit to hit), Lori Petty, Tom Hanks (on the cusp of Oscar greatness and still in his boyish mode), Jon Lovitz, Rosie O'Donnell (playing herself, much the case in all of the movies she's appeared in), Madonna (actually able to act), David Strathairn, and Bill Pullman in a small but crucial part as Bob Hinson, A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN is the equivalent of sitting back and taking a good look at your high-school yearbook and reminiscing. The final segment, in which the characters reunite in their older selves, is impacting because it features many of the actual players from the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Fun Movies, Watch it Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to get to work on "A League of Their Own" as one of the main extras.Filmed mostly in Southern Indiana, Evansville's Bosse Field and Huntingburg's League Stadium are the sites for the majority of the films baseball scenes.And yes it was HOT! We began filming in Southern Indiana in a small town called St. Phillips (the softball scenes for Geena and Lori) A calf was born, and was named Penny in honor of the director. Filming moved on to the Huntingburg stadium and lasted several weeks. Although a few of the extras were paid, most of them were actually there for free. Through the heat, the retakes, the bad food, and did I mention the heat? It was an amazing scene to watch the filming and then see the final product become such a beloved hit.More trivia, the scene in which the shortstop throws the ball at the heckler was of course staged--but in the first rehearsal---SHE ACTUALLY DID IT- From the short stop position. They had to pad the guy and made her throw off so not to hit the guy again.During breaks in the filming, Penny would hit up local antique shops. She loved buying antiques. Yes she really does drink milk and Pepsi.Tom Hanks got a break as a director on this film, he was allowed to film pick up shots. I got to be in one, but it is on the cutting room floor somewhere. :( To the reviewer who thought the baseball the girls played was all faked, it wasn't. Most of the shots of the girls playing ball are real, and many of them were actually very good at it.The stunt double for Geena in the split catch scene was actually a guy. His name was Michael and he ran a local college radio station.There was a scene which was cut from the film in which Marla is injured during a play. Later to find out that Marla is expecting a child. This scene was completely cut out.Although she was not a major star, Rosie O'Donnell was very shy around most of the "stars." She spent a lot of time with the extras. I remember being the one who encouraged her to spend more time with Madonna, and as we all know that friendship became famous.It was a fun movie to film and even more fun to watch. I can honestly say I will never get tired of seeing this one and it was definitely one of happiest experiences in my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You may look at the cover and think, "Modonna...in a baseball movie?" And, besides that, the cover, I have always felt, does the film absolutely no justice. It just go to show, the old addage really does apply in this circumstance, 'don't judge a book (or in this case, movie) by its cover.'Picture 1944. Oregon state, farm country. Two girls milking cows, when all of a sudden a man walks into their lives that will change them forever. With a smart, yet for that time, eccentric idea, Harvey Weinstein (Gary Marshall)decides to have a girl's baseball team. Throughout the film, we meet all different characters. Women, all over the country who have come to New York, to become a professional female baseball player. A smart, funny, and ultimately touching film, Penny Marshall directs the piece in a way that is equally heartfelt as it is human, and funny. Tom Hanks and Geena Davis lead the movie, with their talents as dramatic actor and actress, and also comic styles.It's a must watch, for anyone interested in good dramas, and movies that touch not only the soul and heart, but also really mean something in the end.One of the best films to ever come out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the baseball movies I have had the pleasure of watching, this one was one of the better ones, and clearly ranks up there with "Field of Dreams" and "Pride of the Yankees".With Tom Hanks as a washed-up has-been who gets another chance at baseball through managing a girls professional baseball team during World War II, Geena Davis and Lori Petty as dueling siblings who make the team in tryouts at what clearly looks like Wrigley Field in Chicago, coupled with Jon Lovitz as the eccentric scout, Madonna as the resident tart and Rosie O'Donnell as the smart-mouthed member of the team, you just know you that are in for a treat. A League of Their Own does not disappoint.As the team is put together, one both sees how silly some of the societal norms and rules were back then, yet just how talented these women were in playing the game of baseball. The film artfully shows how they were made fun of at first; yet through their hard work ethic, they gained the respect of the fans that came out to see them.With the weaving of story lines of the individual players throughout the film, one can identify with the struggles of the players and of the others in the movie, and in a sense ? much like baseball itself ? they become a part of us; after all, baseball is an American institution that has in large measure stayed constant through the years.A word of advice: GUYS: If you want to go to both a baseball movie and satisfy your sweetheart with a 'chick flick' THIS is the movie for both of you. It will leave a smile on both of your faces and the reinforce the belief that baseball ? steroids aside ? in many respects baseball really does reflect on all that is good and right with America.On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this film an 8/10. ***</fullReview>

It has all around great elements to it- a phenomenal cast, hilarious comedy, great history, just to name a few. However, being an athlete, my favorite part of this movie is how authentic the portrayal of the sport of baseball is. I cannot tell you how mad it makes me when I see a movie and a sport is so badly portrayed. Its like the casting directors were too lazy and decided to find actors that could pretend to play rather than take the time to find athletes that could pull off acting! I truly commend Penny Marshall for making actors pass a baseball playing test before even being allowed to read the script. It really "made" the film because viewers were not distracted by the flaws in the game playing, but could just sit back and enjoy it! I give it 10 stars!</fullReview>

Behind the scenes: I tried to get into this movie too. Noticed the crews were a bit unfriendly.I heard Penny Marshall was a bit rude. Everyone else was polite, but all business. A fact that is not present is that CHET M. COLLINS plays the umpire and even says a line in the end credits. The line is posted in his garage at his home. He is a real or was an official umpire with union card. He umpired at Double Day Park often, and up to his retirement umpired at Cooperstown Dream Parks. He partied with the real team players and enjoyed their company in Indiania. The Documentary on the laser disc was very interesting and informative. You see him few times in the end credits and a slight appearance in the beginning. His wife Phyllis was an extra in the grandstands. They are retired Springfield Center lifelong farmers. I own the only copy at this time of a signed copy by Chester Collins in laser. Watch it to see his line. Hint: mentions balls and strikesHE SHOULD BE ADDED TO CREDITS JOHN VRIESEMA</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has held up very well over time. Nothing out of the ordinary about the story, just that everything is so well done. Plenty of laughs, a struggling bond between the sisters (Petty and Davis), Hanks "no crying in baseball" speech, Marla Hooch's blossoming and her father's big heart, the grown-up "Stillwell Angel", best use of Jon Lovitz in a film ever, former "Laverne &amp; Shirley" cast-member spotting, the little asides. Hanks and Davis are great together. Poor Lori Petty, she shined so much in this film she has rarely been given an opportunity to live up to it (except maybe in the guilty-pleasure bomb "Tank Girl"). But it is she and Hanks who set the tone for the film. This is fun from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. I first watched it when I was 9 years old and I've loved it ever since. The movie is about the first All American Girl's Baseball League in 1943. It also deals with the relationship of two sisters who play on the same team but find that they are growing apart from each other. When one of the sisters gets traded onto another team, fights and emotions break loose. The ending was great and it just goes to show you that no matter who won the world series in that league, love is what holds family and friends together. The acting was magnificent with Tom Hanks as the drunken and unsympathetic coach, Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell, Tracy Riener, Bitty Schram etc. were great as the team members and Geena Davis and Lori Petti as the sisters. The movie was excellent and had me laughing but be sure to take out the kleenex box towards the end of the movie. This movie gets 4 stars out of 5. Watch it!! It's a great hit!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"One of the best films ever made about baseball"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A League of their own ranks up there as one of the very best films ever made about baseball. It's humor does not come from outlandish characters as in Major League, but a terrific script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, who give us a plateful of well developed, distinct characters. Add to this, a drunken has been manager, played by Tom Hanks in one of his best roles, and you have a movie you can watch and never tire of. With so many characters, you would expect there to be at least one sour note, but Penny Marshall assembled a great cast and they each give us memorable and well thought out characters we can relate to. Along with the humor, there are dramatic moments as well, and in one extremely memorable scene a telegram is delivered to the locker room to inform one of the girls their husband has died. This scene is just one, but it says bookloads about the great work done by everybody in the making of A League Of Their Own. They hit this one out of the park.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good sports movie about women's baseball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers!!! Tom Hanks is very good in this movie. He clearly has the best lines. "There's no crying in baseball!" will probably go down as one of the most memorable line in movie history. But don't forget the line, "The hard is what makes it great." That just stops you in your tracks. The movie centers on two sisters, Dottie and Kitt, and their sibling rivalry. Both play for the Rockford Peaches. Dottie is a better player than Kitt, but Kitt is no slouch. Kitt gets very jealous over the attention being showered on Dottie. One day Kitt boils over into a jealous rage and starts a fight with one of her team mates and as a result gets traded to the team in Racine. Both Rockford and Racine face each other in the league championship series. Kitt has a hard time overcoming the psychological effects of sibling rivalry. It almost costs her the series. Kitt finally beats her sister when she runs for home and Dottie drops the ball. Kitt is ruled safe and that wins the series for the Racine team. I think that this is a brilliant move for a sports movie. It goes against the sports movie convention that the featured team must win in the end. This sports movie becomes more of a vehicle for sisterhood rivalry than for baseball. Anyone who had competing sisters or are women who were competing sisters can surely appreciate this movie and how the rivalries and jealousies were resolved. The modern day scenes(circa 1992)that bookended the movie were so unnecessary and distracting. A paragraph in the closing credits could have easily sufficed to explain the history of women's baseball.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Germany invades Poland. Germany occupies France. Japan attacks Pearl Harbor. These events ushered the United States entry into WWII. Many Major League Baseball players were called to war, leaving America without its national pastime. WWII establishes the opportunity for women, such as Dottie Hinson (Geena Davis) and Kit Keller (Lori Petty), her sister, to compete in professional baseball, as portrayed in Penny Marshall's `A League of Their Own' (1992). `A League of Their Own' informs the public of the existence of the All-American Girls' Professional Baseball League during the 1940s. The leagues superstar Dottie Hinson acts as the `time capsule' between the past and the present. The film demonstrates the impediments women had during WWII breaking the old stereotypes, and the need for women's status in athletic competition. Throughout the year, the casualty total continues to rise, and some of the players do not receive any letters from their husbands or boyfriends. Then one day the first tragedy occurs with the all too common scene of the 1940s. The Western Union boy arrives at the office. All the women know what he symbolizes and hope that it is not their husband. When Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks) cedes the letter to Betty Spaghetti (Tracy Reiner), all of the women are relieved. This relief turns into a feeling of shame and remorse. Another tension driven scene occurs when Dottie's husband returns from overseas wounded. He was shot in the leg. Dottie has always said that as soon as her husband returns she will go home. According to Dottie, `she is only playing baseball for Kit and for the league.' She begins to pack and deserts, but reappears to play in the World Series. Dottie is put in a taxing situation, and her team is playing against her sister's team. There is a play at the plate. Does Dottie catch the ball and get the runner out, or does she drop the ball and let her sister win? Watch the movie and make the call.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While the Men Fought in War, the Women Folk Lead an All-American Baseball Team!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Set in the early 1940's, during the big one: World War II. The men were overseas either getting killed or killing opponents. But the women back home had to amuse themselves, so they started an all-American baseball team. This is their story.  A scout, Ernie Capadino, meets two women, Dottie Hinson and Kit Keller, at their farm one afternoon. Ernie was working for Mr. Harvey, founder of Harvey candy bars, who was starting a woman's baseball team. Dottie is quite good at baseball, but Kit wasn't, but Dottie wouldn't go with Ernie unless Kit could. Ernie is a very sarcastic man. He could really annoy people, but his cameo is scene stealing! They pick up another recruit for the team along the way: Marla Hooch, well, let's just say with her, her beauty is on the inside. They finally arrive at the field and meet other players: Doris Murphy, Mae "All the Way Mae" Mordabito, Evelyn Gardner and more. Ira Lowenstein, Harvey's right-hand man, showed the ladies the new uniforms: skirts. The girls didn't like them one bit.  All they needed now was a coach. Harvey seeked Jimmy Dugan, a washed up drunk baseball legend. Dugan, half sober, was delighted to coach the team. He expressed his gratitude to the women by tearing up their baseball cards and speaking not a word to them. Well, from then on, the ladies really played ball! One of them had a little boy, Stillwell, who would annoy the players. And Dugan just loved kids. I mean that sarcastically. Tension begins to build up: morale drops. Kit picks a fight with Doris. Kit is traded to the other team! Dottie's husband, Bob, returns from overseas and they want to go home, and Dugan is not happy about that, but Dottie returns to win the world series for them. Forty years later, the ladies, now old women, have a reunion. Sadly, Jimmy Dugan wasn't there. He had died five years earlier. My opinion of this movie: pretty good. Geena Davis is very pretty, naturally Tom Hanks is good, but why do Tom Hanks' characters always have to yell so much? In all his movies, he either plays a guy who rants and raves or just snaps and starts screaming. Some Hanks movies I like are Big, Forrest Gump, The 'burbs, Turner &amp; Hooch, The Green Mile. Tom Hanks is a good actor, I'm not saying anything against him, just that he ought to tell his characters to take a valium. Rosie O'Donnell, everyone's favorite mouth, is good too. Everybody is good! If you're a fan of Davis, Hanks, Madonna or whatever, then I recommend A League of Their Own!-</fullReview>

I still pull this movie out when I want a good laugh (and cry--the scene where Geena Davis is sobbing alone in her room gets me every time). I wish I could have watched these girls in action for real. The game montage sequences still get my blood pumping after many, many viewings. Madonna actually does a good job in this movie, and my kids recognize Rosie O'Donnell from TV and "The Flintstones." They also know Tom Hanks since I have several of his movies too. The best scenes are when Jimmy is bawling out a player (hence my title) and getting revenge on Stillwell Angel (see the movie if you don't recall the name). Oh heck, the whole movie is good.

		<shortDescription>A Baseball Coming Of Age Story For Women - But Men Will Enjoy It Too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing particularly earth-shattering in this movie, which offers a heavily fictionalized account of the goings on in the "All American Girls Professional Baseball League" - a real baseball league formed during the Second World War as a means of keeping interest in the game alive while some of its biggest stars were fighting overseas.There are some good performances to be found here. Tom Hanks - reunited with Director Penny Marshall (they worked together previously on "Big") offered his usual high calibre performance as Jimmy Dugan - an alcoholic ex-baseball star who (against his will) is assigned to manage the Rockford Peaches. Geena Davis was great as Dottie Hinson, the Peaches catcher and - as Dugan describes her - "the best player in the league." I was also impressed by Lori Petty as Kit Keller, Dottie's little sister. In a relatively brief role through the first half hour or so of the movie, Jon Lovitz was entirely believable as the scout (Ernie Capadino) who discovered Dottie and got her to agree to play. Several other "big" names appear - most notably Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell as teammates on the Peaches.The movie is in many ways a coming of age story, with at least three subplots all revolving around the theme. First is Dugan's growth as the Peaches manager. Originally not interested in the team, showing up at games late and drunk, falling asleep in the dugout, he becomes almost fanatical in his desire to see the Peaches win the AAGPBL (now there's a mouthful!) World Series. The relationship between Dottie and Kit gets a lot of attention, as Kit's resentment of living in Dottie's shadow grows and grows throughout the movie. Then there's the story of Marla Hootch (played by Megan Cavanaugh), the homely, shy girl, raised by her widowed father as a tomboy, who - ironically enough - learns how to be a "lady" by the time she spends hanging out with "girl baseball players."All in all, this is a good story, very entertaining, with good acting and good directing from Penny Marshall, who manages to create a real "game feel" in the baseball scenes and keeps us interested in the human interest sidelines without letting them bog us down.7/10.</fullReview>

Geena Davis and Lori Petty are spectacular as well. Don't make a mistake this is not a "chick flick."

I laughed out loud and I even teared up (all right I cried like a little girl - at the end at least). It manages to evoke emotions with so little effort. This is partially because the story itself is so touching, but the acting is equally responsible.Even if you're a movie buff or a casual viewer, you can't miss with this one.

		<fullReview>Back in a time when all a women were expected to do was to stay in the kitchen and keep a household, a war broke out and everything changed. Men went off to war and women for the first time in history had a chance to enter into strange and exciting worlds that would have never been available to them otherwise. This film captures just this and the cast illustrated this fabulously. Geena Davis and Lori Petty (Kit and Dottie) were perfect as the sisters who were in constant competition with each other, more on Kit's end who had an apparent chip on her shoulder and Dottie's take charge(indirectly)attitude and "I'm in this league for my sister" was probably the greatest role in her career. She displayed her strength as woman remarkably well. Kit's jealousy was also played very well by Petty, who with one look made you feel for her. Tom Hanks talent was magnified in his role as the crude but charming lush, Jimmy Dugan who really gets a chance to redeem himself later in the film. He, in my opinion is one of the finest actors of our day. Doris (Rosie O'Donnel), May (Madonna) and all the other ladies played hard, had fun and had a passion for baseball just as much or perhaps a little more than any man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Story, Great Acting -- Worth Seeing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A League of their Own" is one of my favorite movies. This is great "historical fiction," a story based on real events. Penny Marshall directed an interesting movie about a long-forgotten women's baseball league."A League of Their Own" had a very strong plot, a great script, and excellent acting. Not only did it capture the flavor of the 1940s, but it featured believable, interesting characters. Geena Davis, as star catcher and hitter Dottie Hinson, carried this movie. I was very impressed with her acting ability. I'm surprised that even though you read a lot of praise for actresses like Meryl Streep, no critics have ever given Geena Davis her propers. Even though I am no fan of either Madonna or Rosie O'Donnell, their portrayals of the two most colorful players "All the Way Mae" and Doris Murphy lit up the screen. I even liked Madonna's theme song "This Used to Be My Playground." The story line takes you from the formation of the League until their first "World Series." A famous businessman (based on Mr. Wrigley?) decides to start a women's baseball league during World War II when many male baseball players were off fighting World War Two. Recruiting young women baseball players all over the country, the scout first signs Dottie and her sister Kit in Oregon. As the train heads east, they pick up other promising sluggers. When we first meet Marla, she hammers the ball out of the park on every pitch. The scout is reluctant to sign her because she isn't pretty, but Dottie takes command, stating, "If she doesn't play, I don't play." The morals and manners of a bygone era dictate strict rules for the Rockford Peaches. Mae is bummed when told she can't smoke cigarettes or drink liquor. The "girls" are sent to a charm school to teach them "ladylike" behavior, and they are forced to wear uniforms with skirts, not always the most practical. They have a strict "housemother" and curfews, but the Peaches manage to sneak out to a night club where they drink, smoke, cuss, and dance with servicemen. One of the funniest scenes occurs when Rosie O'Donnell, a strong swing dancer, flips her parter. "Look, I threw a guy over my head!" While none of this behavior would seem out of place today, society in the 1940s stressed "propriety," even for men, but much more so for women.Even though their games filled many stadiums all over the country, satisfying America's need for our favorite sport, there are strong hints that the League may not last more than another season. Actually, the league survived until 1953, but it never caught on big and was long forgotten. I have been around since 1950 and consider myself well-read, but until this movie, I never even heard of this league. The film brings back an interesting segment of baseball history, when players enjoyed the game, had loyalty to their teammates and fans, and did not make seven figure salaries.The film builds to an exciting climax for the "World Series." Traded in mid-season, Kit now pitches for the Peaches' rival team. Seeing the two sisters face each other as pitcher and catcher builds tension and you really get into that game.Overall, I highly recommend seeing "A League of Their Own."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was surprisingly good, and still holds up well after nearly a decade. The creation of atmosphere and nostalgia, even during the first viewing, is a tribute to Penny Marshall as a director. There are feelings as if you've been there before, even when you know you haven't. The performances are all top-notch, with career-highlighting performances from Lori Petty and Geena Davis.This movie is highly recommended, as a comedy, and as an example of the emotional strength needed for women to compete professionally in sports.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though Tom Hanks was a supporting character in this film, he was only outshined by the story itself. And what's more fum then a really good story based on fact, with real people identified at the end of the film. This is story is designed to remind us of the women who filed in (and did so very well), for the men of major league baseball, during World War II. This womens league went on to prove women can do well in a mans arena. I enjoy this film more every time I see it. And I have seen it many times.I can't recommend it to highly, unless that is your looking for sex, shooting, or car chrases. There are none, just rich, warm characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A League of Their Own" works on several different levels. It's a great baseball film. It's a great nostalgia film. It's a great family film. It's a great comedic film. One piece of advice: try to watch the widescreen version. The movie was intended for theatrical viewing, and does not lend itself well to the "pan and scan" standard format. The camera has to make too many sudden moves and sharp pans to keep up with having the films' "sides" cut off for TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the person who said that the movie was good up until the reunion scene, you really need to go rent it and think that comment over, buddy. The reunion scene is what ties it all together! It shows you what happens to all the characters! I think that scene was one of the most adorable! And the casting! The women who played Kit and Dottie's part as older women were fantastic! They looked exactly like them! Every time I watch it with someone who has never seen it, they exclaim, "What good makeup work they've done!", thinking that they just made up Geena Davis and Lori Petty. For whichever person it was who said it dealt too much with the rivalry between sisters and not enough on the league, that was the whole point! That's the plot, that's everything about the movie. If they had focused entirely on the league, not only would it not hit the theatres and wind up being some stupid special on A&amp;E, but nobody would watch it even then! True, to the women who lived it all, it was exciting, but unless you make it into a movie that good, nobody's going to end up caring. Children who saw A League of their Own learned about women in baseball and saw the beginning of females playing sports. Do you think more than about 3 kids in America would know ANYTHING about how women's baseball started if it had just been a boring documentary on the History Channel? I don't think so. To conclude this long-winded speech about why you two who commented negatively should go rent the movie again, I give it two very enthusiastic thumbs-up! I know I rented that movie a 14 year-old girl who figured girls had been allowed to play sports since Jesus was alive and after watching it, knew entirely better. One of the most fabulous movies and might I add - My favorite actress/director, Penny Marshall did a WONDERFUL job on it. And just a note: Keep an eye out for Penny's new movie, Riding in Cars With Boys. It's sure to be a good one, overlook the title, anyone who liked League will like this one, I guarantee!</fullReview>

Penny Marshall has succeeded in representing life in the 40s and some of the obstacles that a group of women had to face in trying to improve their lives, have fun and play some ball. The acting is great and very believable. Geena Davis should have been nominated for Best Actress, but I guess coming after Thelma and Louise, 2 years in a row would have been difficult. Based on the real women's league, the movie has restored some of my faith in athletes who once played for love of the game. Now I have a reason to visit the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. This is not a "girls movie" but one for the whole family. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A League Of Their Own" has to be one of my favorite movies. I mean I usually enjoy films with flashbacks, (i.e. "Now &amp; Then" and "Stand By Me"), but this film delivers so much of an emotional punch it is an incredibly wonderful experience just rewatching it. There is the lingering doubt at the end of the movie...was that drop purposeful?...but that is the only loose end in the whole flick. Geena Davis and Tom Hanks are the two outstanding players in this mixture of comedy, tragedy, and history; but Rosie &amp; Madonna are also well worth the price of a rental from your local movie store. Jon Lovitz is delightfully dry and quite comedic in his short, but sweet role. Madonna very convincingly pulls off the attitude that makes her part. Overall, Tom Hanks is a great actor and I hold this film up there with "Saving Private Ryan" and "Apollo 13" on his best work list. This is an enjoyable and at the same time heartwrenching movie that should be viewed more than once.</fullReview>

In my humble opinion, even those folks who don't like baseball will like this movie. Everyone in the cast is excellent; my only regret is that Jon Lovitz' part wasn't bigger. The one thing I gained the most from this movie was a deeper respect and a little more insight into what American women went through during World War II and after it ended. My (baseball) cap is off to Penny Marshall and the entire cast for a thoroughly enjoyable film that I will continue to see over and over.</fullReview>

It is a movie about the AAGPBL (All-American Girls Professional Baseball League) team named the Rockford Peaches. There were only 3 other teams: Racine, South Bend, and Kanosha (sp?). Geena Davis stars as Dottie Hinson, also known as "The Queen of Diamonds." She is the kind of person who won't admit that she plays baseball because she loves it. Her little sister Kit Keller is played by Lori Petty, who acts as the Peaches pitcher. Tom Hanks is their coach. Also starring are Madonna (Mae) and Rosie O'Donnell (Doris).

There is also something about that era that is very magical and meaningful and it shows through well in the movie. The actresses who play the girls are very believable they made it look like fun but also like hard, rewarding work. It made me want to go out and join a women's baseball team! Some parts were a little bit sappy, but it was supposed to be a sensitive film as well as comical. I have mixed emotions about the uniforms because they were cute, but a little bit sexist.

		<fullReview>This film is one of my all time favourites. Nostalgia has a way of hitting home to the audience in many films but none are done better than this. I love the way this film was directed and the way it portrayed the women baseballers of an era long forgotten. It was a thrill to watch all the actresses and actors performing together, and I myself was riveted from the beginning to end. What really got to me was the end of the movie, where all the players return for the opening of the baseball museum, especially a section dedicated to the A.A.G.P.B.L. We get to see what the players look like now, and all the memories that come flooding back. It gives us that warm feeling deep down, and it is brought off magnificently by Penny Marshall. I thoroughly recommend this film to be a part of your video library, a movie you can share with your family time and time again.</fullReview>

Penny Marshall does an amazing job of taking us on an emotional roller-coaster ride: witness the scene where the Peaches sing the AAGBL theme song...they're happy, excited, and psyched for the game. Ten seconds later, the War Dept. official walks in with the telegram, and we watch Jimmy walk down to Dottie, and then apologize to Betty. Great acting there, when Betty just crumbles, as expected, and later on by Geena Davis as she cries in her room. Maybe I'm biased because I know all the thrills and downfalls these girls as ballplayers experience, but this film is perfect, hands down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before A League of Their Own I had no idea that there ever was a women's baseball league. Going in to see A League of Their Own I expected a rather boring film about the long forgotten baseball league. To my surprise the film was quite good, in fact, it is one of the better sports films that I have ever seen. The film chronicles the first season of the AAGPBL (I think that is the correct abbreviation), primarily focusing on the Rockford Peaches. Geena Davis is wonderful in performance that should have earned her an Oscar nomination, especially in 1992 when there weren't very good roles for women in film. Tom Hanks is excellent as the recovering alcoholic manager of the Peaches. This was Hanks best performance, at the time, since Big in 1988. Lori Petty and the rest of the cast, including Madonna, are very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt everyone's heard about Rosie the Riveter, but the women's baseball team seems to not be as well remembered. "A League of Their Own" is the story of this team. Various women from all over come to participate, although the movie mostly focuses on Dottie Hinson (Geena Davis), Mae Mordabito (Madonna), and the manager Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks).I've never really been a baseball fan, so maybe I'm not the right person to be reviewing this movie, but I thought that it was pretty well done. There was one particular line that seems to have been thrown in for comic relief (I mean what Jimmy says after getting chewed out by the umpire). But overall, Penny Marshall has shown herself to be very adept as a director, with this and "Awakenings". Worth seeing. Also starring Lori Petty, Jon Lovitz, David Strathairn, Bill Pullman, Garry Marshall (the director's brother) and Rosie O'Donnell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A League of Their Own pulls one of the rare feats. It's a movie about women, but since it's a baseball movie, men will enjoy it too. A humorous look at a woman's professional baseball league during World War II, A League of Their Own follows the lives of Dottie (Geena Davis) and her kid sister Kit (Lori Petty) as they try out for and make the Rockford Peaches, one of the four teams in the league just for women. While some of the names have been changed to protect the innocent, the movie tells the mostly-true story of the league's first year. Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell play fellow Peaches, adding a sassy duo that helps bring smiles to the scenes that they are in. But it's Tom Hanks who steals the show. He plays Jimmy Dugan, a former home run king who cannot get a Major League managerial job because of his obsession with drinking. There was not really a baseball player named Jimmy Dugan, but most believe the character is based on former Philadelphia Athletic power hitter, Jimmy Foxx. Hanks plays his character over the top, over asleep drunk in the dugout. He utters the most famous line of the movie, "There is no crying in baseball" to one of his players who just committed an error. He also holds the record for longest on-camera urination in the history of cinema. But Tom Hanks comedic performance could have been overshadowed if Jon Lovitz had been in just one more scene. Lovitz plays a scout looking for talent across America, while playing a variation of "The Liar" he perfected on SNL at the same time. Penny Marshall, who directed this film, makes sure to keep the pace even, with both baseball scenes and scenes with just the girls. My favorite non-baseball scene involves the girls at charm school trying to sip tea the right way. The movie does follow the usual sports-movies clichs, but you know what? I had a good time anyway. The movie isn't about the team on the field, but rather the way the girls bonded as a team. There is one heartbreaking scene where one of the girls finds out here husband died in the war. But that scene is equaled with Tom Hanks driving the team bus after waking up to a rude surprise.</fullReview>

Tom Hanks steals the show as Jimmy Duggan. His performance alone would make this film worth going to see. Geena Davis is also superb as this movie came out before her descent into obscurity (the Best Supporting Actress Oscar Curse).

		<fullReview>This is the best sports movie I have ever seen. Better than the Natural, Rudy, Hoosiers, Field of Dreams, Raging Bull and even Rocky. A League of Their Own is simply more multi-dimensional and brings more to the table than these movies. It captures everything that makes baseball great: competition, escapism, camaraderie, scientific exactitude and, most importantly, that intangible aura that surrounds the game. From an amateur game on a dusty, rural field to a stadium day-night doubleheader this movie has it all. Even more, it stands in a solid foundation of historical fact regarding the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, World War II and 1940s America. Tom Hanks and Jon Lovitz are hilarious as Jimmy Dugan (Jimmy Fox), the retired ballplayer/manager of the Rockford Peaches and a bitter scout for the fledgling league. Geena Davis, Lori Petty, David Strathairn and even Madonna turn in strong and convincing performances. The good acting and great script combine to give the viewer at least five solid 'chill moments,' as the Sports Guy would say. I recommend watching this movie every April, as I do, just before opening day. There's no better introduction to a season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Can't we do both?'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Above line is from a very funny scene in the movie where a youngster does Dottie Hinson a favor. He wants her to 'make a man outta him' and she offers 'how about I just slap you around for awhile?' and that is his response. Its also appropriate because director Penny Marshall seems to want to make a nostalgic womens baseball movie but also a comedy, a drama, a statement and a tribute. She is mostly very successful. Geena Davis gives her best performance as Dottie, the 'Queen of Diamonds', a catcher with natural baseball skills who does not take the game that seriously to begin with. Her rivalry with her sister Kit (Lori Petty) is believable to start with but gets to be an annoyance after awhile. Both of them are much more successful than Rosie O'Donnell and Madonna, who are both pretty bad. Its embarrassing to see Madonna try to have a dramatic moment and blow it. Rosie gets a laugh or two but is mostly around because she looks like a girl who might have played baseball when it was unfashionable. Tom Hanks is excellent as Jimmy Dugan, a former player who developed a drinking problem and had to leave the game before he was really ready to. His ex-boss, Walter Harvey (Garry Marshall) gives him the job coaching in the new girls league which he reluctantly accepts. Movie has many memorable moments - the 'there's no crying in baseball' scene; Dottie's dry humor, especially in response to the most obnoxious child in movie history, who is named 'Stillwell Angel'; and Jimmy's drunken entrance in which he relieves himself in front of all the girls.Director makes note of the fact that black women were omitted just as their male counterparts were, that some women were never educated properly or even taken seriously on many different levels. It seems a little inappropriate that she did not explore any girl/girl themes, which of course existed as well. Also the movie is grossly unfair to Marla, who hits like Ted Williams but does not have physical beauty on her side. She is originally rejected by scout Jon Lovitz (he's a riot in the fifteen minutes you see him) and then is made fun of some more at a 'beauty' school the girls are inexplicably sent to. She meets a nice guy and gets married so at least she gets a happy ending. Nostalgic movie hits mostly homers. 8/10. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this numerous times on cable over the years. While it isn't a perfect film, it is a nice little enjoyable flick for a Sunday afternoon - you could do worse.When the men were shipped off to fight in World War II, there wasn't anyone left to play baseball. Fearing financial losses, women were hired to fill in for the men's absence - forming major and minor league teams and putting on games like the boys did.This is based on a true story and stars Geena Davis as the main character. Tom Hanks plays her alcoholic coach, who has trouble accepting his position as a women's coach - he kind of resents the idea of coaching females in general.Madonna has a co-star role as one of the baseball players, and it was her name on the credits that really helped make this a success back in '92 - without her it wouldn't have been quite as marketable.The cast is overall pretty good. There are some recognizable faces like Jon Lovitz to add humor to the mix. And the story is well told without coming across as smug.It's not a great movie but if you're in the mood for gentle entertainment, it's a good choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hanks steals the show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well-directed by the reliable Penny Marshall, A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN (1992) is an entertaining, fun baseball movie about WOMEN'S baseball! Based on a true story of a women's league formed to keep the sport going while Major League ball was suspended during WWII, this nifty period piece does a solid job of evoking a time and place. And, yes, even though the film is populated by and stars mostly female characters, it is really a MALE character that owns this movie! The great Tom Hanks plays alcoholic, down-on-his-luck, former baseball player Jimmy Dugan who is tasked to manage the film's central baseball team, the Rockford Peaches, led by the team's best player catcher Dottie Hinson (well played by Geena Davis) and her fiery younger sister pitcher Kit Keller (wonderfully played by Lori Petty). Dottie is a war wife as her husband (played by the reliable Bill Pullman) is off to war and living on her parents' farm with little sis Kit.The film's opening sequence shows the modern-day older Peaches reminiscing about their 1940s escapades. Then it flashes back to Dottie and Kit on the farm approached by a recruiter (played by a scene-stealing Jon Lovitz) to the newly formed women's league. Along the way, they pick up another recruit, the homely slugging phenom Marla Hooch (hilariously played by Megan Cavanagh). Upon arrival at the baseball camp in Chicago, the trio meet up with the future teammates third-baseman Doris (played with the typical comic bravado by Rosie O'Donnell) and her best friend center-fielder Mae (played by Madonna, who is just kind of there). Rounding out the engaging cast of Peaches are first baseman Helen Haley (played by the funny Anne Ramsay), outfielders Betty 'Spaghetti' (played by feisty Tracy Reiner), Shirley Baker (strongly played by Ann Cusack), and the hilarious Evelyn Gardner (played by another scene-stealer Bitty Schram), who has her precocious son Stilwell (scene-stealing lad Justin Scheller), who lives to aggravate Jimmy! LOL Other notable cast members are Garry Marshall (Penny's brother) playing the de facto commissioner of the women's league, and his right hand man, played earnestly by David Strathairn, who push to market the league and get it going.The over-arching storyline of the movie is a bit too predictable and sentimental for my taste. The Dottie-Kit rivalry is at the forefront, but really pales to all of the hilarious scene-stealing turns by most of the supporting cast. Other than Hanks' iconic performance as Jimmy Dugan with his famous 'no crying in baseball' speech, the best characters are really played by the unknown/lesser known actors: Marla, Evelyn, Stilwell, in particular, as well as the other no-name cast members. Davis, while professional, is a bit too mannered in her role, and gets upstaged by at least half the cast! Petty, while playing the more lively role, is a bit too abrasive at times. Their sibling rivalry kind of takes a backseat to the scene-stealing supporting cast. O'Donnell is actually pretty good, but ironically not the comic standout in this movie. And, as previously mentioned, I have no idea what Madonna is doing in this! Easily the most useless role.Even though Davis is the nominal star, it is really Hanks who owns this movie! I know everyone fawns over Hanks' first Oscar-winning role in 'Philadelphia', but in my opinion, Mr. Hanks first Oscar should have been for this movie! Ironically, Hanks has top billing over Davis, but I would think he would have been nominated Best Supporting Actor. He didn't even get nominated! Even though he has 2 Oscar wins on his resume and several other nods, I still think this was a great oversight by the Academy. So, remember folks, 'Philadelphia' didn't put Hanks in the big leagues in terms of acting, 'A League of Their Own' did! And it didn't take overly emotional crying scenes of sentimentality to be a great performance!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like feel-good sports movies, then you will love this movie. It features an all-woman baseball team after all the men are drafted into World War II. It features a perfect cast (especially Tom Hanks as the manager in his "comeback" role and Geena Davis, Rosie O'Donnell, and Madonna), good characters, humor, drama, and sports action. I loved the bratty little kid and the urination scene, as well as all the game scenes. Unforgettable line:"There's no crying in baseball!" This is the type of movie you will want to watch over and over again and enjoy it each time! You will like each character,each scene, and just about everything about this movie. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a feel good movie about a period during the war where women's baseball became popular. It served the purpose of giving entertainment during a very hard time in our history. It also showed the wonderful relationships that developed. Tom Hanks plays the enigmatic coach who has always dealt with men. The subplot involves sisters, where the tall pretty one has seemingly always held sway in the family. This is about growing. This is an opportunity for a new start for one of them. Madonna plays a fun character, full of life and sass. Of course, we are in for a lead up to a significant game where things will get sorted out. It's also an education in a particular sports phenomenon that was short lived but quite interesting. The movie sparkles and Hanks does a great job of suffering through something he is totally unequipped for. Quite delightful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film for the nth time after many times as part of the "Trailblazing Women" series on Turner Classic Movies. After watching the Rosie the Riveter documentary, it really stands out how much women were "used" during World War II. They were told how important they were to the war effort. What wasn't emphasized was the transient nature of the situation, that it was "until the men come back", so they got used to doing something other than housework if they were married or pretty mind numbing low paying jobs if they were not. The women working in the factories during the war had good paying jobs and some independence for the first times in their lives, the same with the girls in this movie. They not only had good pay, but a place in the limelight, doing something they were good at doing - baseball - with crowds rooting for them, but like Dottie and Kit, they had just been playing as amateurs pre-War. Dottie doesn't want to join the league at first. What Kit says is true - Dotty is the prettier sister, the sister with more baseball talent, and she doesn't want to admit her own competitive spirit until she is given a chance to exercise it, and then that competitiveness somewhat scares her. Tom Hanks is brilliant as Jimmy Dugan, a washed up ball player who drank away the five best years of his career and is recruited to coach the Rockford Peaches. At first he doesn't take this job seriously, but time, a few verbal bouts with Dottie, and a growing attachment to the girls change that. Towards the end of the film he delivers one of the best monologues that I have ever heard about talent, opportunities lost, and the fact that certain moments never come again. I know somebody else wrote these lines, but he delivered them with heart. One line should be emblazoned on everybody's mind - "If it wasn't hard everyone would do it. The hard is what makes it great." Don't run away from anything because it is hard.Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell provide great comic relief - they actually had a pretty good off-screen friendship - so their back and forth comes across naturally. Even if you don't like these two individually, I think you'll like them here. It's funny how much women playing ball just offends American society's sensibilities about what is proper for a woman so much that a big part of the girls' training is basically a charm school, and that as players the women actually have curfews and places like bars that are off limits to them due to publicity, as though they were minors or gentle flowers that need protection.And now let me talk about Oregonian sisters Dottie and Kit, specifically Kit. Kit has talent. Kit has beauty. She just doesn't have as much as her sister. She definitely shows the audience how to be both a bad winner and a bad loser and just how much jealousy can make anybody ugly inside and out. And now the debate on the ending - that has been rehashed endlessly. I'll just say what I THINK happened makes me furious, because if I'm right then one person let an entire team down just to give another person who was green with envy a false victory in the hope that it would give them a lifetime of confidence. I know this is just a movie, but envy is a condition that is not cured by an external victory, earned or not. It can only be cured by a person changing their viewpoint, that THEY are responsible for their lives and actions. Give a jealous person one victory today and this time next year it will just be something else they feel is unfair and responsible for their misery.I highly recommend this one. It is almost perfect on every level, even the soundtrack!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Fun Little Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two sisters join the first female professional baseball league and struggle to help it succeed amidst their own growing rivalry.This is Geena Davis in her prime. I mean, not to sell her short, but 1985-1995 was the golden age of Geena, with one hit after another. This is one of those, maybe second only to "The Fly". And alongside Lori Petty and Tom Hanks? Priceless.Some may ask, how factual is this? Well, strictly speaking, not very. These are made up characters. But the Rockford Peaches really existed, and there really was a women's baseball league for about a decade. If not for this film, they might be completely forgotten. So, thank you movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A league of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, after 20+ years, I recorded and watched what I thought was going to be a middling Tom Hanks comedy. Reason for that was the trailers I'd seen hundreds of times: "Crying. There's no crying in baseball!"What I saw was a movie that should have been allowed to give Unforgiven serious competition for Best Picture and Geena Davis an Oscar for Best Actress in a leading role. Apparently I wasn't the only one fooled by those trailers.Penny Marshall's movie is a brilliant, beautifully crafted homage to a little remembered period when, just as Rosie became a riveter, numbers of talented women filled in for their men as ball players. Proving, like Rosie, they were every bit as capable as the absent males.More than that, of course, is the broader theme of the individual refusing to buckle under to social conventions. A very common American theme with Marshall's contribution ranking with the best of its expositions. Pretty good as a Baseball pic, too.It is a long movie, over 2 hours, but, despite the simplicity of the story, it doesn't play like two hours. From the first scene you (or at least I) fall in love with the screen and time becomes meaningless.Two people, supported by a strong supporting cast, are responsible: Peggy Marshall and Geena Davis. Marshall and her editor crafted a truly remarkable piece of cinematography that may be perfect; not a clang or misstep anywhere.Such movies need glue to make it all hang together and that's where Davis comes in: though brilliantly supported, without Davis the whole house would have failed. League is very much Geena Davis' movie, she's the one who puts flesh to the bones of Penny Marshall's vision.As Americans we love and should love movies like this, these celebrations of the best of our values, of how hundreds of women kept a league of their own alive for ten years.That achievement was quickly forgotten, buried in the reactionary conservatism of the '50s, which should anger us, but that anger can easily be tempered by Marshall's rediscovery and loving treatment of their story.For all of that seriousness, League is a successful comedy and fun to watch while, also successfully, demonstrating both how far we've come and how far yet to go.A large part of that 'yet to go' are those trailers that made me think that League was a Tom Hanks movie. It isn't; Hanks is almost a tertiary figure. Davis and the supporting cast, all women, are the Stars. Hanks character, Jimmy Dugan, is important and, especially at the last, honored but, as the movie unfolds, more comic relief than mover. Very much a second fiddle; to his credit, Hanks plays that fiddle masterfully.However, the fact that the distributors felt the need to exaggerate his presence to the point of ridiculousness speaks volumes about how, even in 1992, we weren't ready to embrace a movie by women about women. The Oscar's Nominating Committee's failure to recognize League as the masterpiece it is stamps paid to that point.As a movie, judged by objective cinematic standards, League should rank with the best of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Geena Davis helms a plucky, extroverted squad of girls embroiled in the inaugural season of a ladies' baseball league. It's got heart and charm to spare, but often veers too close to super motivational, Lifetime Network feel-good material for my taste. The talent is there, with strong support from Tom Hanks, Jon Lovitz and Madonna, though their roles frequently edge near the cartoonish. Some are able to pull that off - Lovitz has been making bread with such exaggerated characters for years - but others, like Rosie O'Donnell's stereotypical feisty Jersey girl, aren't as adept. Puffy, padded, and egregiously predictable, its message about the irresistible force of gender equality in the midst of WWII is nice, but often feels secondary to the manufactured lite drama in the locker room.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying that A League Of Their Own is a fun movie. Geena Davis fulfills the role of "baseball dolly" and seems believable while Tom Hanks as washed up coach plays to the crown to everyones delight. Is there anyone out there who doesn't know that there's no crying in baseball? Even the Jon Lovitz scout was peppered with great one-liners and lovable schmaltz. Unfortunately the rest of the movie is unlovable schmaltz. The sports scenes seemed to be created for TV, as if it didn't matter if the positioning of balls, catches and players made no sense. The pushing of Madonna gave us one current pop culture moment from Rosie (I'm supposed to be an athlete, but maybe nobody noticed that I don't belong) O'Donnel stating, Mae, do you think there's any man left in America who hasn't seen your bosoms? Penny Marshall handled some scenes that worked and others that felt like Happy Days. Maybe it was her father on the set, but this plays like a "Laverne and Shirley" extended episode.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dottie Hinson (Geena Davis) is a married milkmaid on the Oregon family farm. It's WWII and the men are all over seas fighting the war including Dottie's husband. Scout Ernie Capadino (Jon Lovitz) comes to find new talents. He's interested in Dottie but not her sister Kit Keller (Lori Petty). He only takes Kit after Dottie agrees to come. It's a slow start and the girls have the drunken ex-player Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks) as their manager. Then Dottie becomes a star and the league begins to be successful. As Dottie gets bigger, Kit gets more jealous and angry at Dottie's shadow holding her back.Director Penny Marshall has created a very satisfying drama. It has some great moments and a few memorable lines. It can be a little bit corny at times but the top rate actors keeps it from going over the edge. Even the duo of Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell can't derail this. Tom Hanks and Geena Davis are simply wonderful providing a solid foundation. The baseball action is mostly just montages of action scenes except the big climatic finale. That's perfectly fine especially since it keeps the action moving. It's a great fun watch time after time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no crying in baseball?unless you love baseball and love this movie. This movie based on the book "Dirt in the Skirt" tells the fictionalized story account of the real-life All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) under the team of the Rockford Peaches. The team was created by Chicago Cubs owner Walter Harvey play by Gerry Marshall because World War 2 was slowly destroying the sport due to most of the sport's best male players are fighting in the war. The Rockford Peaches is lead into the season, by manager, alcoholic former baseball player Jimmy Dugan play by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks not only come out to be a likable mean-spirit drunk, but also a funny, sweet guy who just want to see the girls play their best out there. His acting is superb and his comedy side is just funny. He just steals the scenes, when he featured. Geena Davis plays Dottie Hitson, one of the Peaches best players who leads the team when Jimmy Dugan fails to do. The team is made up with kid sister pitcher Kit Keller (Lori Kerry) who has always be over looked due to Dottie's over success. "All the Way" Mae Mordabito played by Madonna (in her very best role, playing herself), a taxi dancer. Doris Murphy (Rosie O'Donnell) a tough- New Yorker type. There is soft-spoken right fielder Evelyn Gardner play by "Bitty" Schram. In one key scene, Jimmy Dugan and Evelyn Gardner just go at it, and you can't help yourself crying out laughing. The team must do their best, not only to win the games? but will the hearts and minds of the fans. Until this movie cames along , I had no idea that there had been a professional women's baseball team . Kudos to director Penny Marshall for making this film and shining a lovely little light on this country's history in women' s sports. Though women's sports maybe overlooked, these women were trailblazers in establishing women's leagues that are still up and running in our present time. It's a truly tremendous film, a classic, timeless and nostalgic. The most poignant moments in this movie is when at the end, when the story comes back to the present, the winners and losers don't seem so important today. It was just playing the game and the life long bond it created between the players.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Sports Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A League of Their Own is a film that sheds light on a little-known chapter of American sports history with its story of a struggling team in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. The league was formed when the recruiting of soldiers during World War II resulted in a shortage of men's baseball teams. Directed by Penny Marshall, the film stars Geena Davis, Lori Petty, Tom Hanks, Madonna, and Rosie O'Donnell. The screenplay was written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel from a story by Kim Wilson and Kelly Candaele.The story begins as a candy-bar tycoon enlists agents to scour the country to find women who could play ball. In the backwoods of Oregon, two sisters namely:Dottie and Kit are discovered. Dottie can hit and catch, while Kit can throw a mean fastball. The girls come to Chicago to try out for the team with other prospects that include their soon-to-be- teammates Mae Mordabito, Doris Murphy, and Marla Hooch. The team's owner, Walter Harvey needs someone to coach his team and he picks one- time home-run champion Jimmy Dugan, who is now a broken-down alcoholic. After a few weeks of training, as Dugan sobers up, the team begins to show some promise. By the end of the season, the team has improved to the point where they are competing in the World Series. The movie is one of the year's most cheerful, most relaxed, most easily enjoyable comedies ever released on screen. It's a serious film that's lighter than air, a very funny movie that manages to score a few points for feminism in passing.In addition to that,it serves up good-natured entertainment, if you're in the mood, but be prepared to swallow a generous helping of sickly-sweet sentimentality along with the laughs. Finally,it's a conventional Hollywood sports story but the stellar cast is delightful, and the movie's filled with memorable moments, witty dialogue, and agreeable sentiment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A woman's baseball league was being formed during the War World II to fill in for the men who were at war. Geena Davis who plays Dottie and Lori Pety who plays her little sister Kit were both picked to go try out for the league. Baseball was Kit's passion but the recruiter initially only wanted Dottie and she wasn't interested. With the recruiter giving Kit and ultimatum that she can try out only if Dottie does, the two were on their way to the big leagues. Both were recruited to the same team but because little sister Kit was always in her Dottie's shadow it created problems that would eventually make the two split. Coached by Tom hanks who plays Jimmy Dugan, a drunk belligerent former baseball player who believes his job is a joke eventually pushes the ladies to step up to the plate to get the crowd interested. Kit was eventually traded to the rival team which started the sister's fall out. Years later the women all reunited in the grand opening of The All American Women section of the hall of fame and there they all reminisced about the past.The two themes that best fit this movie would be the struggle for human dignity and the complexity of human relationships. In this film Dottie struggles with over shadowing her little sister all the time. She can't help that she good in whatever she does but can't stand that her little sister blames her for her short comings. Kit as well struggles with human dignity because she not better than her sister she resents her sister and always lashes out on her because she angry with herself. The complexity of human relationships were presented through the entire film whether it be Jimmies relationship with the entire team, Kitt and Dottie's relationship and Mae and Doris's relationship. Jimmie didn't care for the team at first until they start winning, Dottie and Kit had their sister issue but who doesn't and Mae and Doris had that best friend relationship that everyone longs for. This movie reminds me of the movie Love and Basketball because it establishes a relationship between two people and shows what the love of a sport can do to deter that friendship. It is a must see if you haven't seen it already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Girls can't play ball!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie! It is one of my favorites. The movie A League of Their Own is about the first professional women's baseball league. It is also about the empowerment of women. While the men are at war the baseball league is in jeopardy of being shut down. Mr. Walter Harvey (Garry Marshall), a wealthy business man decides to create a women's baseball league to keep it running until the men return from war. The women are recruited by Ernie Capadino (Jon Lovitz). He travels throughout the United States searching for women while providing humor. On his journey he recruits Dottie Hinson (Geena Davis) and her kid sister Kit Keller (Lori Petty). After watching a game Ernie Capadino decides he wants Dottie and not Kit. She is more attractive and better at baseball. After Dottie turns him down, Kit tells him she's ready to join. Mr. Capadino states "I don't want you; I want the one who hit the ball." Kit eventually talks him into allowing her to come to tryouts if she can get Dottie to go too. Ultimately Dottie decides to attend for her little sister. While traveling back to Chicago they make a pit stop and recruit Marla Hooch (Megan Cavanaugh). During tryouts the girls encounter May Mordabito (Madonna) and Doris Murphy (Rosie O'Donnell). This is one of my favorite scenes. The lighting of this scene is very bright with sunlight. May and Doris decide to test the other three ladies and tell them not everyone is going to make the teams. While walking away Doris throws the baseball at them to prove a point but Dottie catches it with her bare hand. The sound it makes when she catches the ball makes it seem like it should really hurt but she didn't even flinch. Needless to say, all of these women make the Rockford Peaches team together. Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks) is hired to coach the Rockford Peaches. At first he treats the team as a joke until he sees the talent these women have. In the beginning the league attracts very little attention. The women are seen as a joke until a reporter and photographer attend a game. Mr. Lowenstein (David Straithairn) asked the girls to give them something special and focuses on Dottie. He calls her The Queen of Diamonds. During the game a foul bowl is hit and Dottie catches it while doing the splits. The photographer snaps a picture of this and when the article is published in the newspaper the league becomes more popular. While the girls are working their way to the championship a rivalry is brewing between Dottie and her sister Kit. Kit feels that she is being overshadowed by Dottie and wants some of the attention. The tension between the sisters becomes too much and Kit is traded to Racine Belles. In the end Kit gets the best of her sister and wins the game for her team. The rivalry is sad because deep down Dottie only wants the best for her sister and is proud of what she accomplished. While the movie is about women playing baseball the underlining of this movie is about female empowerment. While the men are home women are expected to be in the kitchen. When the men are away at war they are told it's their duty to get out of the kitchen. These women are asked to keep the league alive but at the same time forced to endure being degraded for being women playing the sport. They are forced to wear skirts as uniforms and are criticized by the fans. During the first game for the Rockford Peaches a man in the stands screams "girls can't play ball" and proceeds to make fun of the team. I love this scene because Ellen Sue throws the ball at the man to shut him up. No matter how much they went through and how many people doubted them they won the hearts of everyone in the end. The league continued on for many years. A League of Their Own reminds me of the movie "Mystery, Alaska." Even though this film is not about women; it is about a hockey team in Alaska that is fighting to be recognized and accepted for who they are. Both films show the teams being criticized and ridiculed but in the end they all persevere and get the respect they deserve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about sister relationships</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A league of their own is a story about women playing baseball while the men are away at war. The movie focuses on two players that are sisters, Dottie Hinson (Geena Davis/Anne Cartwright) and Kit Keller (Lori Petty/Kathleen Butler). These two sisters play for a local softball team and are scouted to play professional while the men are away at war. Dottie doesn't want to leave home and play baseball she is happy at home waiting for her husband to return from the war, Kit on the other hand is very excited and anxious to leave home.The entire movie is about the focus on these two sisters and their differences. Kit is forever finding herself in her sister, Dottie's shadow, but Dottie doesn't care as much about the game as Kit does. Kit and Dottie find themselves on different teams because of the competition and family disputes, and face off in the World Series. The winning play comes down to Kit running for home base while Dottie tries to get Kit out, because Kit's determination of the game is stronger Kit slams into her sister and wins the game.The movie focuses on these two characters and their complex sibling relationship. The movie portrays Dottie as a better player than Kit but she doesn't have the heart for it, Dottie's only care is her husband and mentions a few times throughout the film that she just wants to be home with him. Kit has a drive to get away from her home, and to not be compared to her sister anymore. Even though Kit and Dottie see things differently the movie shows that siblings can have a complex relationship.This movie reminded me of the Spitfire Grill, a movie about a girl joining a "family", she was perceived to be different and she was trying to earn their acceptance. Like the woman in the Spitfire Grill, Kit knew she was different than her sister and wasn't traditional like Dottie. Kit was forever trying to establish her own name, and be herself not a shadow. Percy in the Spitfire Grill was trying to be herself, even though she wasn't a traditionalist like the locals and was having a hard time trying to establish herself from this pre-conceived idea that the locals had about her.This movie starts out showing Dottie as an older woman preparing to go to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, where they will recognize the Women in Baseball, and then the movie begins a flashback as Dottie remembers how she joined with her sister and how the first league was played. The movie had great bright lighting, and soft colors on the uniform and throughout while in the 40's. Other references were made that made it realistic for the time, like the woman radio announcer speaking about the women being drug from their homes and children to play baseball and she told Mr. Harvey that "like your candy you are nuts". The rules that were enforced on the ladies that played baseball also represented the time that it was set in. The women were not allowed to smoke, have men around, and had to take classes on how to be more lady like. The movie did a good job of bringing in authentic time characteristics.This movie shows just one aspect of how the women in the 40's had to fill in for the men while they were away at war, but the plot of the movie really focused on the two sisters and their relationship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely underrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of making a movie about women baseball league during World War II, is a truly great one. At that time, women didn't really had anything to say in sports, generally speaking, not to mention baseball, probably the most important American activity of the time. No! Women raised kids, women cooked dinners, women washed dishes, women swept the floors. They surely didn't played ball! Well, this title showed me, in an unique style, that anyone can achieve greatness despite gender, looks, or studies.Furthermore, I loved the character mix this title suggested. Maybe I'm biased when it comes to multiple character relations in a certain film, but I can't restrain from saying that "A Lague of Their Own" is a true masterpiece from this point of view. A little more substance would've been more appropriate, I won't disagree with that, but this film is terrific nonetheless! So far, there hasn't been a single perfect film. That's just a standard to reach for, an illusion, if you don't mind the adjective.The acting was superior. Tom Hanks was very convincing as Jimmy Dougan a former baseball star, now an ordinary low-life alcoholic, head coach of Rockford Peaches women baseball team, Geena Davis beautifully interpreted soon-to-be baseball superstar Dottie Hinson and Lori Petty did great as Kit, always envious on her sister's Dottie huge success. Even Madonna was above her mediocre standards in the role of sleazy Mae Mordabito.To conclude, "A League of Their Own" grows on you. It's funny, original, captivating from one end to the other and will always rest in my memory as a particular pleasant adaptation of such an interesting subject. Accordingly, it deserves no less than a ****/***** rating</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Home Run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of the women's professional baseball league after almost 40 years after the last game was played comes to the big screen with A League Of Their Own. Though the names are changed and the facts are jumbled, A League Of Their Own celebrates what was a milestone in the feminist movement. Woman's entry into team sports, previously reserved for the male of the species.The film centers around two sisters, Geena Davis and Lori Petty, but a whole lot of women get some great roles in this film. Those who particularly stand out are Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell, and Bitty Schram, all members of the Rockford Peaches except for Petty who gets traded to the Racine team.The league was founded by Phil Wrigley played under an alias by Garry Marshall, brother of Penny Marshall. Mr. Wrigley was not the most public of baseball moguls and by all accounts did not have half the personality that Garry Marshall displays. He had some interesting ideas and this was probably the most enduring even though the league eventually folded long after the action in this film is concluded. Read Bill Veeck's book Veeck as in Wreck to get an insight into Mr. Wrigley or some of the various Chicago Cub histories.The character of Jimmie Dugan who Tom Hanks plays is based on Hall of Famer Jimmie Foxx. When I was growing up Foxx was number two on the all time home run list with 535 to Babe Ruth. He was in fact a hard drinking man as Hanks portrays. He was also a mighty man of muscle which Tom Hanks is not. Someone like Joe Piscopo would have looked a whole lot more like Jimmie Foxx. Nevertheless Hanks is brilliant in the role.In those years of Rosie the Riveteer on the World War II homefront, the Women's baseball league was a daring innovation and a radical step forward into women's athletics. Now we have a Women's Basketball League that is doing quite well.Could a woman's baseball league get started again?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Peach of a Baseball Movie which Delivers a Full Count</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the boys went off to to fight in the second World War, "Harvey Candy Bar" owner "Walter Harvey" (Garry Marshall) decides to create an all-women baseball league.Two players recruited are two farm girls, sisters from Iowa who are in the middle of a sibling rivalry. You have "Dottie Hinson" (Geena Davis), who the movie centers around as the movie is shown as a flashback of her memories of the days playing in the league, and her younger sister, "Kit Keller" (Lori Petty), who is unmarried and is overshadowed by her sister in the local softball league.The two are signed to the Rockford Peaches, which is lead by a down-and-out former Major Leaguer (Tom Hanks), whose drinking problem not only destroyed his career, but his knee as well when he jumped from a hotel window to escape a fire he accidentally started in a drinking binge.Despite the problems with the manager, and the initial negative comments from the league's critics and fans who mocked the ladies, the Peaches and the three other teams quickly gained their supporters. They also became another family for each other, giving each other support not only on the field, but in their personal lives like when one of the Peaches got the word from the government that her husband was killed in action.However, that sibling rivalry comes back to haunt "Dottie," who the media has flocked around. Especially when, thanks to a miscommunication between team owners and her sister, "Kit" is traded to the Racine Belles.This movie is a fictionalized story on the creation of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL), which was created in 1943 by Phil Wrigley, the man behind many popular gum brands and the Chicago Cubs baseball team. It uses the names of the original four teams of the league, but plays with the history of the league's first season.The movie begins by focusing on "Dottie", who is preparing for the league's induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. When the movie flashes back, it focuses on the Peaches from her point of view. And this is done pretty well.We get to meet some interesting cast of characters on the Peaches, including manager Jimmy Dugan (Hanks), former strip club bouncer (her father owned the club) "Doris Murphy" (Rosie O'Donnell) and "All-the-Way" Mae Mordabito" (Madonna). Now, the only problem with having so many characters is that we never get them fully developed. You get to know a little background on these characters, and see their personalities. But, in my opinion, focusing on everybody was just a little too much. I could not connect with any of the girls, which was needed to feel for one when her life is changed by the war forever.What this movie does right is put together a really good cast. Davis and Petty really made you feel as if they were having a sibling competition with one being athletically superior to the other. Hanks was wonderful as the down-and-out manager who eventually realizes that these girls want what he couldn't have thanks to his drinking problem -- a championship. In fact, the entire fictional Peaches team were all good in their own way.There were three pairings of actors that I loved to watch when they were on screen together. Like I said earlier, Petty and Davis were great as sibling rivals. Davis was also great when paired up against Hanks, and have one of the best comedic scenes when the two have a battle of signals to the batter. Then there was O'Donnell and Madonna, who I wish who had more scenes together. If you ask me those two were the best comedic duo in the cast.Another thing that this film does great is the game action. From a production point of view, many of the plays were staged so they could get the shot. What else made these scenes wonderful was that the majority of the cast (one person had an on-field double) was actually playing. There is one scene where one of the Peaches is having her thigh iced. This particular scene was pretty much unscripted as that injury was legitimate (and one of the nastiest bruises I've seen).The wardrobes for everybody is done very well in this movie. In fact, they appear to be authentic right down to the tiniest stitch.Penny Marshall, who hired not only her brother as the founder of the league, but other cast members from her popular television series "Laverne and Shirley" (at least two regular cast members from the series appear in the movie), did a good job in the director's seat. She set up every shot nicely, especially the ones during games.One thing that I wasn't really into was the music. I usually don't pay direct attention to the music, although I subconsciously notice it when used to enhance the scene. In this movie, I couldn't tell you any scene where the music helped the mood. In fact, the only piece of music I clearly recall is the song sung by Madonna that was played as the closing credits began to roll.I can't say that this movie hit a Grand Slam home run, but it wasn't a balk or strikeout either. It's a good movie to add to your "To Rent" list if you ask me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1943 and Baseball in the states has been decimated by all the men called up to join the services. Enter the ladies who themselves help to kick start a womens league to keep the Baseball fires burning.The first thing any prospective first time viewer of this piece should note, is that it's not actually a film about Baseball. It's about friendships, challenges, and differing off shoots to the complications of war, it just so happens that it's the game of Baseball that brings it all together! Directed by Penny Marshall (Big), screenplay by Lowell Ganz &amp; Babaloo Mandel (City Slickers/Parenthood) and featuring Tom Hanks {wonderful as drunken coach Dugan} as the leading male, it's no surprise that A League Of Their Own booms with sentiment and no little amount of comedy. It is to me a very rewarding picture, the sort that wants you to chuckle along with it whilst noting the need for human interaction during a troubled time. The lady actors do great impressions of bona fide athletes, asked to parade in short skirts and entertain the watching public, these gals, led by the always engaging Geena Davis, deliver a sparky picture that never veers into maudlin territory. There are of course some sombre moments, but they are placed nicely by Marshall in the context of the films events, never trite, they serve more as tender vignettes to run alongside the frivolity on offer. Ultimately A League Of Their Own achieves its aims come the final credits, its not taxing and its not purporting to be an intelligent look at a period in history. It's asking us the viewers to feel heartened by what we just watched, and just maybe to give those girls back in the 1940s a piece of our respect, job done. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautiful movie where huge skepticism transforms into optimism. Unbelievable! For a while I had a feeling that I must learn the rules of baseball to know all the connections. A perfect screenplay, not too serious or childish, but funny and honest. A little bit too much oversensitive in my opinion. All this is joined together with genial Tom Hanks, where his huge talent is visible the most I have ever seen; they could just give him a little more space before camera. A League of Their Own is surely something more than just a movie about women baseball league in the USA. It is a film about courage to create something original although many mockery and distrust. I recommend watching this movie especially for fans of Tom Hanks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm always pleased to learn about something wonderful I knew nothing about. Combine it with baseball, and how can you lose? The variety of characters, their development, their interaction makes for a touching movie. Terrific performances from Geena Davis, Rosie O'Donnell, Madonna, Tom Hanks and so many others, all of whom know their place in the cast yet have their moments, build into a true team picture. Penny Marshall deserves full credit for bringing this all together. I would love to see a documentary of the history of the league, maybe done by Ken Burns. A moment commented on by others, the black woman who threw the ball back, is so poignant, yet allows the viewers to interpret it for themselves and I would truly enjoy seeing that explored. I fully enjoyed the comment from the woman who was a teammate on a softball team of the woman who played the part. If you haven't seen it - do so. If you have, I bet you've seen it more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It is a touching story of how girls played baseball doing the war and the men were over seas fighting. Based on a true story that isn't like all other true story movies. It touches your heart as it shows the relationships between sisters, friendship, teammates, and husband and wife. These ladies provided entertainment for people just like them who lost loved ones in the war or who had loved over seas and didn't know if they were okay. The acting was great and it showed true heart. You almost forget that these are actors playing real people. It makes you apart of the movie. So when the characters feel pain or joy you are right there feeling it too. If I could have I would have given it the best picture Oscar.

Geena Davis, Madonna and Lori Petty give solid performances, whilst Tom Hanks is his comedic best and Rosie O'Donnell is a pleasant surprise.The story remains interesting for the most part and is potentially moving, but the good early comedy dies out too soon.

		<shortDescription>Effectively Simplistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is very straight forward. It portrays the Women's Professional Baseball League started during World War 2 to fill a need because the men were away at war. It is very effective as entertainment.One thing the film illustrated is when it came out, Cooperstown , New York did not have any display about this history. This movie shamed them into doing one. What is a shame is that Cooperstown has become the moralistic Baseball shrine.In order to present a history of a sport, properly, you have to present all it's greatest players after they retire, regardless of what they did outside of playing. Cooperstown is too high-handed to do that because they have bought into political correctness, lock stock &amp; barrel.A League of Their Own shows what happened &amp; was roundly ignored by these shrews running Cooperstown. They are nice enough in the film to set up a place that didn't exist when the film was made.Geena Davis is great in this film, &amp; attractive. Tom Hanks is perfect as her Manager. Rosie O'Donnell was never better than this film. Even Madonna is OK in this film though she is even better in EVITA. Without a doubt this is Lori Petty's best role as Kit, Geena's sister. As this film was able to change history in Cooperstown, &amp; is very simplistic &amp; watchable, it gets a solid rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry...call me sentimental. Call me a softy. Call me for dinner--but, I just flat out love this film.This is one of those films when I'm bored and flipping through the channels and I see that it's on, I inevitably end up catching it at whatever stage that it's in and I watch it. The way that Penny Marshall put this together is absolutely seamless. It's almost poetic.The story centers around the start and first season of the All American Girl's Baseball League, and, more specifically, the sibling rivalry that unfolds between Dottie (Geena Davis) and Kit (Lori Petty). It is quintessential Women's Lib incarnate.Kit doesn't want to live in Oregon forever, while Dottie, who's husband is off at war, is basically biding her time until her husband returns. So, when the scout shows up for a local game, they both have different motives.Not a situation is overlooked while piecing the plot together. We see that, like that horrible country song reminds us, war is hell on the home front, too. Women become widows, underdogs become heroes, and interesting supporting characters abound. You just can't help but be engaged.I saw this film in an actual theatre when it was released, and the theatre was not packed at all. But, to an individual, everyone left the theatre not only talking about what they'd seen, but, smiling ear to ear. I'd waste a Saturday afternoon for this film any day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hanks's a riot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This might strike you as your average sport movie, but it's wrong to assume so. First of all, the choice of a women's baseball league brings along a few other issues. A league of their own gives a nice image of the way men thought of women during World War II. The girls have to look pretty at all times, because that would be the only reason for a crowd to show up. Despite all this, the girls keep their head up and manage to create a strong team spirit. Tom Hanks' coach Jimmy Dugan takes a little credit in this, evolving from a sack-scratching liquor-gulping mad man (watch out for the scene in the bus), into a caring and lovable sport fanatic (still a little mad, though). Although the ending is a bit predictable, A league of their own is a great movie with a lot of fine actors (great performance by Geena Davis), a lot of laughs and a lot of heart. Kudos to Penny Marshall!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>.."league" was the only one..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...please read some of the other comments to get the story-line...While this film is really enjoyable and educating, it gives the impression it was the only "league". Younger "users" admit they had no idea there were professional teams of female ball-players. Chicago DID have Wrigley Field, but other cities (large and small) all over this nation also had great stadiums......they had their own female teams. The African-American lady who lobbed the ball to catcher Geena Davis should inform you some areas in The South had integrated teams, even in the '40s, which were very popular to the local residents. I'm also sure many ladies who saw "A League of Their Own" felt left-out. I am also surprised that NONE of them have made comments here - maybe they don't know about IMDb.Let me assure "user" "Ten Percent" there were MANY "butch" players on these teams. You really didn't take a close look at the backgrounds of the film? - especially for the "reunion" scenes - because there several gay ladies in them. You didn't recognize your own kind? To make you feel better, I can attest the best players in these leagues were Lesbians - they were big girls who played - and fought - like men. I knew several of them in New Orleans, where I worked in a gay bar they visited. Ironically, I also worked in a drag show for 26 years in Los Angeles which was begun by a former, professional player (she died before I worked there). I did not really personally know her, but knew whom she was before I worked at the club - and MOST ironically - I now live in her home ! Yes, she was a Lesbian - and a great, all-around athlete and loved by everyone who knew her.I'm sure it was brought-out quite apparently during watching"League" that women do not run like men - their pelvic-bones don't permit that. I will attest the Lesbians who played HARDBALL - not some tacky version of "softball" as "geofbob" says in his comment - and were as manly as the professional, male players. Not only do you get a history of baseball with females in my comment, also be informed Lesians have been around since "dirt", and the ones who had the guts to "come-out" before modern days almost ALL lived as men; you didn't mess with this gals.Penny Marshall made a wonderful movie, with all of the cast doing a fabulous performance. I'm sure many people were surprised to see Geena Davis play so well - but, "trivia" told us that all of the ladies were tested for their ability to play ball at the time they auditioned for their roles. Brava! Geena. Brava! Lori. Brava! Madonna, although I'm not one of your fans. Brava! Rosie - and I thought Hanks did a great job, but am wondering if he takes a leak in all of his film??? As so many "users" have written, this movie has some of everything in it, and is the better for it. It IS one of the movies that gives you an uplift - we certainly can use more of those! The script and directing were first-rate - the jokes were funny, the drama was saddening and realistic. It also showed how America "played" in nightclubs before they became places to be seen in, where everyone was welcomed and you didn't have to have a certain "attitude" to get in. Sad that "clubbing"-enjoyment is also controlled, after paying to get in.NOW - here is an opportunity for ANOTHER film on this subject, which would show how masculine and skilled most of the players were, and not those sissy girls "League" depicts. When I was a kid, even the girls were just as rough-and-tumble as the guys, or else they weren't allowed to play baseball. If mom and dad would leave "Little League"-rs alone, we would have integrated teams with girls beating the pants off a lot of the guys - everyone should see this movie - it rates a 20.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Story of the formation of the first professional female baseball league, during World War II.Playing rounders for a living is a tough job - but someone's gotta do it. And, in 1943 America, with Joe DiMaggio and co off fighting Gerry, it was down to the womenfolk to keep the sport of baseball ticking over.As it happens, the All-American Girls' Professional Baseball League became popular enough that it survived for a further eight years after the War came to an end. But 'A League of Their Own' tells the story of those first pioneers to replace their oven gloves with catcher's mitts, as it were.Central to the tale are the sisters Dottie and Kit (Geena Davis and Lori 'Tank Girl' Petty), who are plucked from their jobs as milk maids to join the ranks of the newly-formed Rockford Peaches. Among their more prominent team-mates are Rosie O'Donnell as the burly no-messing Doris, Megan Cavanaugh as gorilla-faced hard-hitter Marla, and good ol' Madonna as the yo-yo-drawered Mae 'All-The-Way' Mordabito.But it's largely the presence and performance of Tom Hanks as washed-up Major League hero Jimmy Dugan that lifts this a cut above the average sport movie. Dugan's a boozer and a cynic, but he's also got a bit of heart, and gradually begins to take his job as Peaches manager more and more seriously - so much so, in fact, that by the end of the movie he even knows some of his players' names. Now that's dedication! Hanks also gets all of the funniest lines in this solid and, for the most part, entertaining feel-gooder. It's also an interesting story that's being told, although it inevitably contains practically every clich we've come to expect from sports flicks, from the easily-categorized team "characters" to the big end-of-season-game climax. The film also gets bogged down in mushiness in the final stages, when we're reminded that the whole thing's being told in flashback and are returned to the modern day reunion of the girls, now all old biddies of course. Look out for the dodgy bit of dubbing involved in putting Geena Davis' voice over the lip-movements of old Lynn Cartwright in the role of "Older Dottie".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good sports movie about women's baseball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers!!! Tom Hanks is very good in this movie. He clearly has the best lines. "There's no crying in baseball!" will probably go down as one of the most memorable line in movie history. But don't forget the line, "The hard is what makes it great." That just stops you in your tracks. The movie centers on two sisters, Dottie and Kitt, and their sibling rivalry. Both play for the Rockford Peaches. Dottie is a better player than Kitt, but Kitt is no slouch. Kitt gets very jealous over the attention being showered on Dottie. One day Kitt boils over into a jealous rage and starts a fight with one of her team mates and as a result gets traded to the team in Racine. Both Rockford and Racine face each other in the league championship series. Kitt has a hard time overcoming the psychological effects of sibling rivalry. It almost costs her the series. Kitt finally beats her sister when she runs for home and Dottie drops the ball. Kitt is ruled safe and that wins the series for the Racine team. I think that this is a brilliant move for a sports movie. It goes against the sports movie convention that the featured team must win in the end. This sports movie becomes more of a vehicle for sisterhood rivalry than for baseball. Anyone who had competing sisters or are women who were competing sisters can surely appreciate this movie and how the rivalries and jealousies were resolved. The modern day scenes(circa 1992)that bookended the movie were so unnecessary and distracting. A paragraph in the closing credits could have easily sufficed to explain the history of women's baseball.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different look at the game of Baseball.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What helped this film was the fact that the story of the Women's baseball league, which sprouted during WWII, had never been told before. It makes it an original despite various inaccuracies. There is a great deal of baseball history that many people have no knowledge of and films like this help tell that history.The opening scenes with the older Dottie and her daughter and then the closing scenes at the Hall of Fame could have been omitted. They really didn't add much to the story and came off as hokey and corny. Likewise the scenes with Dotties Army husband showing up out of nowhere. Bill Pullmans character is a perfect example of excess baggage in a film. Tom Hanks puts in a good performance as the initially reluctant to do the job Peaches manager. It appeared that the Hanks character was supposed to be Jimmy Foxx a former big leaguer who managed one of the girl ball clubs despite having reservations about it.Jon Lovitz as the baseball scout who must scour the country in search of female baseball talent was the most colorful of all in the film but disappears after only a few minutes.The film makes a very brief reference to the fact that when this league of women players was formed the color line like in the majors was still followed by the owners. During one game a black female spectator throws a ball back that had wandered off the playing field. She throws it with such power she shows the players (and the viewers) that she could be out there playing but the color of her skin prevents her from doing so.All in all an enjoyable film that is fun to watch time and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This flick reminds me definitely of Billie Jean King and other similar women in sports who try to equalize the so-called problem of males dominating in virtually all sports. "Major League" was a little bit related to this flick because it involved a woman named Rene Russo, who was involved with the Cleveland Indians baseball team, but "A League Of Their Own" is a little more exciting than "Major League"...because I was interested in what are women thinking about in a sport that has a lot of complications--almost as much complications as does chess.The characterizations between Geena Davis, Madonna, and Rosie O'Donnell build gently in this flick--from the farm scenes all the way to the scout baseball auditions at Wrigley Field...and finally, a glimpse of the unusual milieu of the All-American Girls' Professional Baseball League---also known as the AAGPBL.Then you run into Tom Hanks, who is selected to be the coach of the Rockford Peaches...he has a hard time dealing with both the male umpires and the lady players that have a little difficulty following his orders.You are also a witness to several of the AAGPBL promotions as you witness a typical season with the Rockford Peaches. For instance, there was a incentive for a woman to kiss a spectator who catches a foul ball.....In another instance, there was a night game that ended with a brief fireworks display.And the scene involving the world series between the Racine Belles and the Rockford Peaches was exciting enough...all the way to the collision at home plate that caused the Racine Belles to win the world series....Then, at the end of the movie, you see a glimpse of the AAGPBL reunion...seniors who were former members of the league in a little pick-up baseball game.....All of this comes to show that baseball is not just for good-old men.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Cinemania 97, Rogber Ebert writes, "A League of Their Own US (1992): Sports/Drama/Comedy Roger Ebert Review: 3.0 stars out of 4128 min, Rated PG, Color, Available on videocassette and laserdiscUntil seeing Penny Marshall's A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN, I had no idea that an organization named the All-American Girls' Professional Baseball League ever flourished in this country, even though I was 12 when it folded up shop, and therefore of an age to collect Bob Feller and Robin Roberts baseball cards and listen to the Cardinals on the radio. The league was founded in 1943, when it briefly appeared that men's baseball would be a casualty of the war, and once the men came marching home it's a wonder the AAGPBL survived until 1954. Then it was consigned to oblivion; history is written by the victors. At the time, it seemed as if the AAGPBL might mean the financial survival of the major league baseball franchises and their owners. The movie gives us a Chicago candy-bar mogol in place of the Wrigleys, and shows his agents scouting the countryside for women who could play ball. In a rural area of Oregon, the scout finds two sisters, Dottie and Kit (Geena Davis and Lori Petty), one who can catch and hit, the other who can throw but is a sucker for high fast balls. He brings them back to Chicago for tryouts with a lot of other hopefuls, including would-be team members played by Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell and Megan Cavanaugh. A coach is needed for the team, which is based in Rockford. The owner (Garry Marshall) recruits Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks), a onetime home-run king whose alcoholism has wrecked his career and left him without prospects. For the first few weeks of the season, Dugan can hardly focus on the field, but then he starts to take an interest in his girls, and excitement builds. By the end of the season, Rockford is in the World Series against Racine (no great achievement, since there are only four teams in the league), and the movie, like all sports movies, ends with a great play at the last moment. A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN follows many of the time-honored formulas of sports movies, and has a fair assortment of stock characters (the plain girl who gains confidence, the brash girl with the heart of gold, the jealous sisters), but it has another level that's a lot more interesting. What happened during World War II was that American society, after years of perpetuating the image of the docile little woman who sat at home caring for her lord and master, suddenly found that it needed women who were competent to do hard, skilled work. Rosie the Riveter became a national emblem, Hollywood threw out its romance formulas and started making movies about strong, independent females, and it was discovered that women could actually excel at professional sports. The movie remembers this period from the present; it begins with Dottie Hinson, the Geena Davis character, now older, taking a trip to Cooperstown for ceremonies honoring the AAGPBL. What we learn about Dottie is that she never took women's baseball all that seriously. She was the best player of her time, and yet, in her mind, her life was simply on hold until her husband came back from the war. Dugan, the coach, tells her she lights up when she plays baseball?that something comes over her. But she doesn't seem aware of it. This ambiguity about a woman's role is probably in the movie because it was directed by a woman, Penny Marshall. A man might have assumed that these women knew how all-important baseball was. Marshall shows her women characters in a tug-of-war between new images and old values, and so her movie is about transition?about how it felt as a woman to suddenly have new roles and freedom. The movie has a real bittersweet charm. The baseball sequences, we've seen before. What's fresh are the personalities of the players, the gradual unfolding of their coach, and the way this early chapter of women's liberation fit into the hidebound traditions of professional baseball. By the end, when the women get together again for their reunion, it's touching, the way they have to admit that, whatdaya know, they really were pioneers.This ambiguity about a woman's role is probably in the movie because it was directed by a woman, Penny Marshall.

		<fullReview>This movie is fun to watch, what with all the internal strains within the group and the external stress of playing ball while the men are away. Some nice gags too. Madonna emerges from the confessional and a moment later a priest sticks his head out and stares at her with a stricken look.It's a baseball story and a feel-good middle-brow commercial piece of movie making so it invites cliches. Which ones doesn't it have? Well, there is no player who developes a debilitating disease, like Gary Cooper. There is no angry misfit who must learn to shape her values to accord with those of the team. There is no pair of players who were once enemies and now find themselves with a score to settle. Nobody developes an immoral habit and suffers a slump, like Robert Redford. Nobody is offered money to throw a game, although David Strathairn is here as a straight guy.What does it have? A pretty bad case of sibling rivalry developes. The manager, Tom Hanks, is an exasperated ex-ball-playing drunk, like Walter Matthau. The team, representing Rockford, Illinois, is a microcosm of wartime America -- a wisecracking New Yorker with a gutter accent, a woman of loose moral who suggests that in order to attract press attention to the team she allow her shirt to pop open during a game and her bosoms to fall out. (Wisecracker: "You think there's a man in this country who hasn't already seen your bosoms?") A knockout "Miss Georgia." A big-eyed homely young woman who can hit like nobody's business. One of those telegrams from the War Department telling a player that her husband is KIA. Female solidarity that we know must end with the war. A sweet ending with some of the players reuniting in old-age makeup. A fragile blonde who must take her snotty young boy around with her wherever she goes, whom Hanks is forever bawling out, is involved in one of the movie's better comic scenes. As the all-important series is about to begin, he takes her aside. Shaking -- quivering all over with rage -- stifling it enough to manage a small arid smile -- he tells her in a quaking voice: "You know -- you have a tendency to cut. You think you could -- work on it? -- before next season?" When she smiles and nods happily and leaves, he undergoes an epileptiform spasm.You might like it. I kind of did. Garry Marshall is a lot of fun in a subordinate role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Small Role in History...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the last hour of this movie was as good as the first twenty minutes, I would have to put it in my all time top 10. Jon Lovitz steals the movie. The part of Ernie Capadino is the funniest little role I've ever seen in a movie. It is a shame that he goes back to hit the road so early. He does appear again as a really old guy at the Hall of Fame, but has no lines. Penny Marshall should have realized what a great job Jon Lovitz was doing and brought the character back from time to time, particularly with a story that tended to drag as often as this one. Once Lovitz walks down that tunnel at Harvey Field, the only reason to keep watching is Tom Hanks. Few actors have the versatility to pull off scenes as funny as "Are you crying?" and what is probably the second longest pee in movie history (Austin Powers has that distinguished honor) and then have a scene as heavy as walking down the line to tell Betty that her husband was KIA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** 1/2Starring: Geena Davis, Tom Hanks, and Lori Petty.When I say it's a movie of their own, I mean for the women. I can't say that I have seen a good movie that primarily has a female cast. Hanks is in it but he has a supporting role. Rosie O'Donnell is in it but she came out later in life. Just kidding. Well, now for the plot summary: An candy bar creator (I had no other way of putting that) creates an all woman baseball team during World War II. It follows the women and their struggle of staying in the league.The movie is a fun and funny film. Surprisingly enough, Madonna provided some comedy. I recommend it.</fullReview>

The acting was good, the story is really cool and all of the characters are cool. the story follows an all woman Baseball League which follows a team coached by Tom Hanks. Geena Davis and Lori Petty are two rivalling sisters who end up on the same team, then one goes to another team. It follows the hardship of the World War II and what happens to the men.Overall Tom Hanks is hilarious and all of the other characters are cool. The acting is great and everything else is good.

		<shortDescription>Better Madonna Than Geena</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off let me say, I'm not a Geena Davis fan; I saw this movie for one reason and she really knocked me out with her "Open Her Heart" video. Madonna really does make the most of the scenes she is in as does Rosie O'Donnell, her best friend. I was rooting for Lori Petty over Geena; she looks better with hair. I'm not a baseball fan either, and the plot moves the story along well without getting stuck on the games. Tom Hanks is the other top-billed actor taking second place to Madonna in my mind. Of course, I don't have to tell you Hanks does great in everything he does. The story of sister versus sister works great as the main story and Penny Marshall's direction is superb heightened only by the attention to the accuracy of the time as the world was at war. Good movie, top cast and good humor in the comedy. Pay attention to the kid: "You're going to lose..." ; he's a scream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is about the most even movie I have ever seen. The film had enough to keep my interest for the duration, but not enough to make me think "Wow, I've just seen a great movie" There is little in the way on conflict for the talented cast to act around. Consider Hanks who plays a recovering alcoholic ex ballplayer. His transformation is not mentioned in any way. One moment drunk and down on himself, the next moment fully recovered and socially functional. There is no down point of this movie so there is no soaring to an up point. The movie is even all the way through. What really peaks your interest is the history behind the league.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, Lori Petty, Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell, Tracy Reiner, David Strathairn, Garry Marshall, Jon Lovitz and Bill Pullman star in Penny Marshall's 1992 comedy-drama based on a true story. This story focuses on the All-American girls Baseball League during World War II where we meet sisters, Dottie (Davis) and Kit (Petty) who become part of it. Hanks plays Jimmy, a former baseball player turned coach who is an alcoholic, Madonna plays Mae, O'Donnell plays her pal, Doris, Reiner (Daughter of Rob Reiner &amp; Penny Marshall) plays Betty, Strathairn plays Lowenstein who is the league manager, Lovitz plays snobby scout, Capadino, Penny's brother, Garry plays candy maker, Harvey who is in charge of the league and Pullman plays Dottie's husband, Bob who is a soldier. This is a good film with some funny and heartfelt moments featuring a great cast and great score by Hans Zimmer. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rosie Goes to the Ball Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As "Hoosiers" did with basketball, this sort of comic melodrama does the same with baseball, turning another personal story into a case of "All-Americanism", often incurring in cheap flag-waving and sometimes verging on chauvinism, but (as "Hoosiers") it was also crowned by the U.S. Congress as part of the National Film Registry. Sentimentality overrules everything else in this film that tells the story of two sisters who play professional baseball for the AAGPBL during World War II: Geena Davis is the natural sportswoman; while Lori Petty plays the sister who has to try harder to become a good player. You have seen this story many times before -there are no great innovations story wise, and it even includes the "classic" climatic game in which the two sisters/brothers/buddies, etcetera, play in opposite teams-, but real history saves the day, for if you frame the plot within the lives of the over 600 women who played baseball during that war, the film becomes something else, something bigger. Tom Hanks received top billing but he was only there to "add spice" (as the clichd former sports star turned into an alcoholic), and Madonna had little else to do but play her alter ego version of the 1940s. Not in the league of the outstanding documentary "The Life and Times of Rosie, the Riveter" (also included in the Registry), but attractive enough to keep you (at least) amused, and make you shed a few little tears.</fullReview>

Kit and Dotty, are sisters, and Dotty is asked to try out for the Woman's Baseball League. Dotty, doesn't want to, but Kit begs her to, and Kit ends up going along too. Lori Petty does a great job portraying Kits character, an upbeat, positive, but sometimes rowdy young woman. Tom HAnks plays the Peaches drunken coach, and does a good job of it. The only thing I didn't like was Dotty's aditute. I think that she had a terrible aditute towards baseball.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A League of Their Own" is an exciting baseball movie with interesting characters, but a too much drama. It tries to milk out too much, when if it just backed off, it would've been fine. Dottie Hinson and her kid sister, Kit, are both good baseball players. This is the middle of WWII, though, and all of the male baseball players are away at war. John Lovitz plays his classic, smart-aleck character, this time who's a baseball scout. A candy-bar mogul decides to start up a women's baseball league during the war, to keep the sport going. Lovitz travels around the country finding girls who can play. The league comes together in Illinois with four teams. When they're placed on the same team, there is a lot of rivalry between Kit and Dottie, and eventually Kit is sent to the other team. They end up playing against each other in the world series and drama ensues. The movie is entertaining, however, and a good look at the American home front during the second world war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute, could've been much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pros: Great story potential about lost history of women's baseball plus the social attitudes of the time. Potentially brilliant cast, including terrific supporting actors. Good range of character personalities to allow for humor, pathos, and conflict.Cons: Poor direction made all this potential go to waste. Wooden performances at times (especially at the beginning) by Geena Davis, who's a better actress than this. The painfully bad baseball playing made me wince at times, though I understand the difficulty directing non-athletes. More than anything, this film posed a number of dramatically compelling questions but left them unanswered. How did the women feel about being forced into the "sex object" role even while playing ball? What were the consequences after a player found out her husband had been killed in battle? What were the consequences for the Peaches after Kit was traded (in real life this would've posed major issues for everyone on the team)? Did Dottie ever regret leaving after one season (this issue was posed multiple times but never answered in the film)? What path did Kit take -- she seemed set at the end of the film for a more independent role than Dottie, but was she able to succeed in a culture which forced women back into the home after the war? What were the consequences for the sisters' relationship? Most importantly, whatever happened to the league?? And was that reunion at the end real? The players were kick-butt, putting the younger stars to shame.The list could be longer than this, but the fact that these major issues were left unresolved points to unsatisfactory writing and direction. Not that we needed a play-by-play rundown of every conflict, but good writers don't set up that many dramatic tension points without giving us a clue as to how at least some of them get resolved.With such a talented cast and great story potential, the film was strong enough to keep me interested (and crying at times!) but left me dissatisfied at the end.</fullReview>

In an attempt to save the sport, several owners formed the All American Girls Baseball League. The film begins in the 90s as one of the players from the 40s leaves to attend their installation in the Baseball Hall of Fame. The story told in one long flashback, is of two sisters who play in the inaugural year of the league. They have to establish themselves with baseball professionals, the public and each other as they try and live the lives of women athletes in the 1940s.

My problem is I just couldn't get into this all that much. I am not a baseball fan and generally do not watch sports movies(although there ARE exceptions, mainly Field of Dreams.) But to me, this movie had no crossover appeal. It's focuses are baseball and slapstick. It's hard to love it if your not a baseball fan or a fan of this particular brand of humor(a lot of slapstick). While I think the acting was great and the the movie very well made as well and was a tearjerker, I simply did not become involved at all. Because I don't really get into slapstick humer I didn't laugh all that much. Likewise, I am not into baseball so I was a little bored at times. Although, I can understand the positives in this, it's simply not a movie that had any of the elements that for me, would make this unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A League of Their Own, is an awesome depiction, of how the All American Girls Professional Baseball League players, fought for the right to play, became victorious as a sport, and faced cruel jibes by feminists, and men alike. A league of thier own, also displayed how these women forged through for women of our time, pushing limits, and bursting the binds of a mans world. These women, were looked down upon, for doing something, that they just loved. They were treated as if they were scum, and not really women at all. It was as if they were a disgrace to woman kind, but instead they were revolutionaries, in a field that is not recognized, and forgotten. Furthermore, the movie also incorporated humor and an outstanding story, of how the love of a sister, will come before anything, even a World Championship title. A League of Their Own, will never be forgotten by this woman, and is a role model for all female Baseball, and softball players alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is about the all American girls professional baseball league, and that is definitely the demographic this appeals to. It's way too much of a melodrama to be an effective drama, the same problem most `dramadies' run into. It's a combination of hackneyed writing, poor directing and less than average acting. It follows the `how to create drama' handbook to a T. Never once did I care whether these people succeeded or not. It fails as a drama. Thankfully, it was at least able to provide a few laughs. Most of it is female driven physical humor, which can get old after a while, but there are two shining beacons in the movie, and tying into the sardonic ways of the world, they just happen to be men. I'm of course speaking about Tom Hanks and Jon Lovitz. Both turn in brief, but hilarious performances. It's a real pleasure to watch Tom Hanks, who should have at least gotten a Golden Globe nomination (if not win) for his efforts. It's a great character and Hanks pulls it off beautifully. It's a mediocre comedy with two real great performances, sadly being too brief. The drama aspect it was too sentimental and over the top. I'm sure certain people love that, but it's not for me. See it for Hanks if for anything. 4.5/10* */ * * * *</fullReview>

The only thing I have a problem with is when Dottie &amp; Kit meet at the Hall of Fame Ceremony near the end of the movie. Is it just me or is the woman who plays an older Kit going into convulsions when she hugs Dottie. Her eyes are blinking faster than the red lights on a railroad crossing gate and it looks like she is having a spasm. It also looks like she can't swallow and is about to pass out. Then when they line up for the official photo, Kit is waiving her arms like she has cerebral palsy and looks like a total retard. Maybe it is just me that sees the scene this way, but the next time you watch this great movie, please look closely at this meeting between Dottie &amp; Kit and let me know if you see it my way or not.
