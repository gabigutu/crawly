		<shortDescription>A cathartic viewing experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd seen "Wild Strawberries" as a college freshman when it was first released, and knew right away I'd be a Bergman fan from then on. I watched it again just last night, January 2004, at age 63, and needless to say got a whole different perspective on the film. Where the surrealist touches, moody photography, and incredibly smooth direction had made the big hit with me as a near boy, as an aging man I found myself--I hesitate to say painfully, but...well, closely--identifying with old Isak Borg in his strange pilgrimage, both interior and exterior, the day he receives his honorary degree at the cathedral in Lund.In the last twenty minutes or so of the movie, I found tears running down my face, not from any thrilling sentimental browbeating (I doubt if Mr. Bergman shot five seconds' worth of sentimentality in his whole long career!) but simply from the cumulative emotional impact of this simple, powerful story and its probing revelation of human character, desire, and chagrin. By the time the film ended, I felt wrung out, disoriented, happy and deeply sad at the same time: it's the experience the Greeks wanted their tragedies to convey to the spectator; they spoke of "katharsis." I experienced it firsthand when I had the great good fortune to see a production (in English) of "Medea." I walked away in tears and scarcely able to think straight for an hour or so. The same thing happened with "Wild Strawberries." This is one of the handful of films I unhesitatingly rate a "ten."A side note: I watched the Criterion Collection DVD. Before the film itself, I watched the hour-long interview conducted in 1998 by Jorn Donner included on the disc. It was remarkable to see how the film Bergman shot ca. 1957 contains many elements that were to be present in his later life--like a foreshadowing of his own old age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When film was an art form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this symbolic tale of an old man's journey from emotional isolation to a kind of personal renaissance, Ingmar Bergman explores in part his own past, and in doing so rewards us all with a tale of redemption and love.Victor Sjostrom, then 80 years old, stars as Professor Isak Borg whose self-indulgent cynicism has left him isolated from others. Sjostrom, whose work goes back to the very beginning of the Swedish cinema in the silent film era, both as an actor and as a director, gives a brilliant and compelling performance. All the action of the film takes place in a single day with flashbacks and dream sequences to Borg's past as Borg wakes and goes on a journey to receive a "Jubilee Doctor" degree from the University of Lund. Bergman wrote that the idea for the film came upon him when he asked the question, "What if I could suddenly walk into my childhood?" He then imagined a film "about suddenly opening a door, emerging in reality, then turning a corner and entering another period of one's existence, and all the time the past is going on, alive."Bibi Andersson plays both the Sara from Borg's childhood, the cousin he was to marry, and the hitchhiker Sara who with her two companions befriends him with warmth and affection. The key scene is when the ancient Borg in dreamscape comes upon the Sara of his childhood out gathering wild strawberries. Borg looks on (unnoticed of course) as his brother, the young Sigfrid, ravishes her with a kiss which she returns passionately; and, as the wild strawberries fall from her bowl onto her apron, staining it red, Borg experiences the pain of infidelity and heartbreak once again. Note that in English we speak of losing one's "cherry"; here the strawberries symbolize emotionally much the same thing for Sara. Later on in the film as the redemption comes, the present day Sara calls out to Borg that it is he that she really loves, always and forever. Borg waves her away from the balcony, yet we are greatly moved by her love, and we know how touched he is.The two young men accompanying Sara can be seen as reincarnations of the serious and careful Isak Borg and the more carefree and daring Sigfrid. It is as though his life has returned to him as a theater in which the characters resemble those of his past; yet we are not clear in realizing whether the resemblance properly belongs in the old man's mind or is a synchronicity of time returned.Memorable is Ingrid Thulin who plays Mariana, the wife of Borg's son who accompanies him on the auto trip to Lund. She begins with frank bitterness toward the old man but ends with love for him; and again we are emotionally moved at the transformation. What Bergman does so very well in this film is to make us experience forgiveness and the transformation of the human spirit from the negative emotions of jealousy and a cold indifference that is close to hate, to the redemption that comes with love and a renewal of the human spirit. In quiet agreement with this, but with the edge of realism fully intact, is the scene near the end when Borg asks his long time housekeeper and cook if they might not call one another by their first names. She responses that even at her age, a woman has her reputation to consider. Such a gentle comeuppance meshes well with, and serves as a foil for, all that has gone on before on this magical day in an old man's life.See this for Bergman who was just then realizing his genius (The Seventh Seal was produced immediately before this film) and for Sjostrom who had the rare opportunity to return to film as an actor in a leading role many decades past him prime, and made the most of it with a flawless performance, his last major performance as he was to die three years later.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>First Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the first scene of "Wild Strawberries," I didn't think I'd be able to get through it -- the Swedish was so alien to me it sounded almost comical; it seemed as if every word ended with an "eer" sound. But quickly the beautiful black and white photography caught my eye and I was drawn into Isak Borg's story, or rather, his self-examination.The progression of the film is fantastic. Early in the film, Isak has an apparition within a dream and the small events leading up to it, within the dream, are quite brilliant. Throughout the rest of the film there are dreams and recollections; newly discovered secrets of the past that Isak sees for the first time. As he says in the film, "Dreams, as if I must tell myself something I won't listen to when I'm awake."How Bergman shows us the characters is terrific. It's a like a relaxed puzzle that doesn't emphasize any sort of urgency to figure things out. The story unfolds beautifully as we get a deeper sense of Isak, who I assume is an alter ago of Ingmar Bergman at that stage of his life (he was thirty-nine when the film was released).It pains me to know that the majority of people my age would rather watch an Adam Sandler movie or "The Rock" than something like this. Hey, I liked "Big Daddy" and I love Nicolas Cage, but "Wild Strawberries" is one of the few films I've seen that could possibly change the way I live my life. I'm always interested in listening to what aged people have to say about their own life because, well, it can only give me tips about my own, and that's what this film does in a way.There is one sequence in the film that is frightening and "arty," and I don't completely grasp what it means beyond Isak's deterioration and his realization of how people actually feel towards him (he's told earlier in the film as well, but he seems to accept this "verdict" more readily), but it doesn't take away from the film; rather, it's an interesting addition to an otherwise satisfying experience. In fact, it's probably the most vital part of the movie -- Isak may not like it, bbut once he gets past it, he has the option to develop.I don't know if the film is a masterpiece -- it's my introduction to Bergman, so once I see "Cries and Whispers," "Fanny and Alexander," "Persona" and "The Seventh Seal" (if I can get through it, this time) I'll come back to this film with a new perspective, or at least see it as a part of Bergman's whole. I do think this is a great film of its type. It's the kind of film that may require viewings every five or so years, as a sort of reminder.Pauline Kael once said that she didn't think much of Bergman because she'd done her share of soul-wrestling and it wasn't that difficult. The film isn't as challenging as I was expecting it to be, in fact, it's a walk in the park. It's pleasant and rich and beautiful, and the title seems perfect after you've seen the film. It's all about wild strawberries.****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Master's Most Optimistic, Profound, And Warmest Films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "Wild Strawberries" many years ago at one of the special screenings in the small theater in Moscow. It was the first Bergman's film I ever saw. This picture is amazing in its emotional impact and in my opinion is one of Bergman's most optimistic, profound, and warm films."Wild Strawberries" provides sincere, intelligent, and emotional contemplations of life's disappointment, regrets, and losses. The main character, seventy-eight-year-old Professor Isak Borg is forced to see his life in a true and painful light, but he also would learn that there is hope.Sparkling cinematography by Gunnar Fisher and superb acting of Bergman's regulars ? Ingrid Thulin, Bibi Anderson, Gunnar Bjornstrand, Max von Sydow and especially, the great silent film director, Victor Sjostrom as Professor Borg add to many delights of "Wild Strawberries" which also include Bergman's writing/directing with his famous mixing of conscious and unconscious, dreams and reality, the past and the present in the same scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A gorgeous movie about memory and hope. A trip and a form of catharsis. It is not a story of an old man who discovers images of his past, about a marital crisis or some teenagers. It is not a confession. It is a mirror. The same crisis is the "gift" of everybody. The same silence, fear and desire are the refuge of a man, a woman, a n American or Irakian. At a moment, at a single moment, you discover your past like only reality. Like your real skin, your only voice, your essential eye. It is not strange. We are the fruits of some experiences. Some books, some people, a family, a child or a wife are the Ganymedes of our hours, our evolution, our death. Our freedom, our gestures, our smile are the trees of their presence. Isak Borg is the image of a age. Our age who grow-up in the noise of every day. The isolation is only way to be yourself. The way to Lund, the relation with Agda, the empty attitude, the projection in Evald, the words are the symbols of a clock who is seed of our conscience. Childhood is only reality of our life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Bergman's greatest achievements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild Strawberries can be praised for so many reasons, but chief among them in my own mind is the way in which the film so perfectly conveys its themes of self-examination and the contemplation of one's own mortality (particularly through its stunning use of flashbacks). Bergman's autobiographical story also benefits from the brilliant casting of Swedish film legend Victor Sjostrom as Isak Borg, whose towering performance is essential to the success of Wild Strawberries. I read that Bergman based the coffin dream sequence on a frequent nightmare that he had -- and it never ceases to amaze me just how effective it remains even after all these years. Wild Strawberries seems like a quiet, thoughtful, introsepective movie -- and it is; it is also one of world cinema's most impressive motion pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film as an art form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We trace the journey of an elderly professor who is traveling to receive an honor for a life of accomplishment and service. Along the way he confronts the lack of success in his human relationships as opposed to the success he has enjoyed professionally. A string of encounters with the past and with iconic people he meets gradually bring the contrast into focus for the viewer.I particularly liked the subtle and intelligent storytelling in this film. He tells us before the credits that he is just a boring pedant. We realize as he comes to realize what this has really meant to him. We slowly receive hints of the emotional truths that frame the man's life. He is confronted by traces of how things could have been different.Important points are hinted at without being said--the viewer is left to sort them out. For example, the couple at the gas station convince us in a short and seemingly banal exchange that the Professor was a great healer whose service to those outside his family was anything but sterile. Yet speaking to his daughter-in-law, his smug insistence that a debt must be paid gives us a glimpse at what it must have been like for his son to have been held at emotional bay by bloodless, cold rationalism.This film deserves NOT to be remade, in order to preserve its artistic integrity. It affirms that film can be an art form that touches the soul as opposed to merely a product to be sold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>exceptionally well made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I'm not the biggest Ingmar Bergman fan, I have really enjoyed some of his movies--especially the one that are not so pessimistic. Although the underlying theme of this movie is aging and impending death, the movie is NOT all pessimism. If it had been, it would have lost my interest early on. Instead, I really enjoyed the film--particularly the fine acting by Victor Sjöström as Professor Borg.The professor is well-respected for his work as a doctor. However, despite his success in his career, he is a failure in his personal relationships. His emotional baggage over the years has prevented him from allowing himself to be close to those he truly loves. This theme mirrors one of the subplots of Through a Glass Darkly, where a father is being destroyed inside by his daughter's mental illness but he CANNOT allow himself to show his anguish--choosing instead to hide in his room with his tears. It is interesting that the same man playing Borg's son (Gunnar Björnstrand) plays the father only a few years later in Through a Glass Darkly.Fortunately, unlike Through a Glass Darkly, there IS evidence that the professor is willing to change his persona, as he begins to open up more through the course of the movie. This appears to be assisted through extensive soul searching and dreams the professor has concerning his past and his own mortality--along with experiences he has during a long drive down the coast of Sweden. Because of this, even his extremely strained relationship with his son appears to hold some hope of improvement by the film's end. This hope for change lifts this movie above some Bergman films that only wallow in hopelessness.FYI--The Criterion version of this DVD is nice due to its running commentary as well as the accompanying documentary. Get this version if you have the chance.Also FYI--After watching many Bergman films and reading about his life, I detect quite a bit of autobiography in this film and his own stuggles with intimacy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply one of the very, very best movies I have ever seen. Saw it recently for the second time, some 15 to 20 years after seeing it for the first time. First time round I was the age and stage of the traveling youngsters and saw the world through their eyes. This time I could identify more with the son and daughter-in-law characters with just as much conviction. The subtlety and sophistication of this movie defy description. It simply has to be seen to be believed. If you've never seen it, don't just sit there, go see the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman's Masterpiece Confronts us with the Important Question.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Ingmar Berman's film masterpiece Smultronstallet (or ?Wild Strawberries' B&amp;W, 1957), the protagonist, an elderly professor who is facing death, has to come to face to face with a long life that has failed to answer the important questions. He is old now and faced with his own inadequacy and impotence.Bergman introduces three young people into the drama to introduce life's most important question ? that of the existence of God. The old man gives them a ride. One of the young men is thinking about becoming a parson; the other argues that God doesn't exist. The old man offers no opinion to the debate. He is silent, but it is a loud silence. It's a silence that reveals an amazing dimension of loss ? the loss of year upon year of not coming to terms with this all-important question.In one of the final scenes, Bergman masterfully closes in tight on the aged face of Professor Isak Borg (played by Victor Sjostrom). In that shot, we can see the whole universe in his eyes and all of its cares in the bags beneath them. Only Bergman could have directed that scene ? only him. It makes Smultronstallet one of the most important films ever made. That one scene, better than any other that I know, captures ?loss' on celluloid for all future generations to witness. If you see it, you may find yourself having to look away.The imagery in Smultronstallet is unparalleled, except by Bergman's own Sjunde inseglrt, Det (The Seventh Seal, 1957). Look for the handless watch, the corpse wagon, the sparseness of the first scene, the car windows turning to black ? ominous signs are everywhere. Notice the clues that point to Bergman's existential philosophy (the twins write a song for a deaf man ? as futile as Sisyphus' labor!) and the redemption themes (Izak pierces his hand as he looks into the window, or the line: `A doctor's first duty is to ask for forgiveness.'). Notice also the outright defiance of the divine presence that he has bred into his son (`I will not be forced to live one day longer than I want to.').Izak is ready to die, but it seems that, for him, life is more forbidding than death. He is a living corpse, dead already in nearly every way. All of these factors conspire to create a masterwork of pure art, and one that gets richer with each repeated viewing.The film is also cathartic in the sense that Greek drama was cathartic ? a warning to the men of ancient Greece to avoid the tragic flaw that undoes the hero - and may be a fateful knock on the door of your undoing as well. Have we answered the question that Izak has not? If not, Izak is us. Look hard - very hard - at Izak. Do you like what you see? To quote a line from the film: `Is there no mercy?' `Don't ask me.' I hope that all of us will fare better when confronted with the film's important question.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning Bergman Masterpiece -- Maybe His Best?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wild Strawberries" profoundly moved me. The theme -- an old man coming up fast on death and wondering if his life has had any meaning -- is an old one for Bergman, and one which he explored ad nauseum throughout the subsequent decades. But here Bergman approaches the question with an uncharacteristic optimism and sense of hope. For once, he seems to come close to finding some peace with the unknowns of life that obviously preoccupied him as an artist, and the movie he gives us is sad but immensely warm; resigned but calm and reflective.An unequivocal masterpiece, and only one of a handful of Bergman films ("Persona" and "Cries and Whispers" being two others) that don't drive me over the edge when I watch them now.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman knows how to make you think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bergman has been seen by many as being a depressing film makes, who speaks above the heads of most people. Thank God someone does! In this piece of genius, we are asked to consider who God is; what makes a life worthwhile; and whether human nature alters through the generations, or is it just the costumes that change? As usual, the answers are to be provided by the audience. We must chose for ourselves what we think is 'right' or 'just'. Bergman uses the usual pattern for him - a man is on a journey (life) and meets people who are going along the same road (friends and family), and they all head toward the end of their trip (death). They stop in for obligatory visits with relatives and for food (as we all do), receive an honourary degree (fame &amp; success?), and then send the children off to a party held in our honour that we do not attend (funeral). What happens along the way is important, but we always end up in the same place - the end. Wonderful editing techniques, good story, good images, fantastic acting, and more ideas and questions to ponder than one film can hold - or so you thought. It's only after the film ends that these ponderings come to you. During the film, you simply watch a man travel from his home to another city, but this is far from what the film is about. See this film once, think about the questions it poses, then rewind and see it again. You will be rewarded for doing so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better late than never; tragicomedy ending with hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film school movie; one of the greatest ever made, or so say the experts. I was told to read the play (The English title is "Wild Strawberries") in a lit class in college and then we were given the chance to see the film. I watched both showings and it changed my thinking about what makes a good movie. This was in the stone age back in '75. I was a wild boy about campus who's taste for films was more action/adventure, western and mystery/suspense. The funny thing about Wild Strawberries is there's a little of all those genre's in it (if you understand what a cowboy Bergmann was at this point in his career).This is the story about the late-life introspection of an elderly physician. It really appears on the surface to be about as dull a concept for a film as one could ever want to suffer through. But this is a story about facing reality, and reality is rarely dull. The plot moves seamlessly through many phases, but much of it involves a road trip through the Swedish countryside.I recently bought a DVD of the 70's cult car-chase flick "Vanishing Point"; I hadn't seen it since the drive-in in my college years. I also own a Criterion Collection copy of Wild Strawberries and I've watched both recently. I realized that Wild Strawberries is a car chase flick as well. But Bergmann's Isak is not running from war weariness but from a life of nihilism cloaked in the old-world respectability of a family doctor. The chase is his lifetime of self-certainty, agnosticism and increasing isolation finally catching up to him. He realizes that he has been a walking dead man for much of his life (something he partially inherited from his mother). Getting too far into the details may fall into the category of being a spoiler, although there is enough complexity in this plot to keep literature classes struggling for an A for a long time (note: the stage play script is exactly the same as the screenplay script).There are a number of notable scenes in the movie that make this day a turning point in the life of the doctor. The ground-breaking dream sequences in the beginning is Hitchcock-like and terrifyingly surreal (or is Hitch being Bergmannesque?). Of great beauty is the reverie scene, where Isak relives some of his childhood while making a stop at his families' deserted summer lake house. The dialog scenes between Isak and his daughter-in-law, and later with the Almans (including another disturbing dream sequence) and with the "children" (hitchhiking college-age kids) are all filled with symbols and conversation pointing to Isak's living-dead existence.It's interesting that Bergmann himself, at this point in his young career, was much like Isak; agnostic, distant, self-absorbed, incapable of intimacy. Yet his conclusion to Wild Strawberries is much more hopeful than what Bergmann's own life has been.The turning point of the movie, easy to miss if you're not paying close attention, is the love-promise from the young hitchhiker Sara; a moment of incredible sweetness and innocent passion that is a regeneration, a salvation experience for Isak. Unlike Bergmann, Isak closes his eyes that night with the hope of a life of meaning, of love in service, not just service for maintaining personal dignity and image. Unlike Bergmann, Isak has a hope of seeing God when his death does arrive, and has demonstrated a new life has begun. This is Isak's Today; his day of repentance, of stopping the tortuous task of hardening his heart against the call of life, yielding in submission to love, mercy and grace.Watch this one several times. Bergmann's troupe of actors are incredible, his cinematography is spartan and overwhelmingly effective; his location shooting in the beautiful Swedish summer is fascinatingly effective in giving a foreign yet "down-home" feeling that's almost Mayberry like, if that's not too extreme a comparison.This movie shows the dichotomy of living for self versus living for the service of others. Isak thought he lived to serve but discovered that service is only of meaning to the server if it is from the heart. It is ultimately a hopeful picture that we can all learn from if we watch with an open heart. Otherwise, we see the wasted tragedy of existential living with no greater good than one's own dead image. Does YOUR watch have any hands?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One last time around the strawberry patch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Slight Spoilers) A man's life journey is all seen through a number of dreams and hallucinations on his trip, some 400 miles, to the town of Lund where he's to receive a lifetime achievement award for his 50 or so years of service to his fellow man as a doctor and a professor of medicine at his alma mater the Cathedral of Lund.Disturbed by a dream he had the night before Isak Borg decides to take a ride by car, not plane, to Lund for a ceremony thats to be in his honor for his work as a man of medicine. Isak's maid for some 40 years Agda is very upset with her boss' and good friends decision and decides to stay at home, she'll eventually show up at the ceremony, feeling that the old man has somehow lost control of his senses. It turns out that the long car trip together with his daughter-in-law Marianne was one of the best decision that he made in his long life, Isak is 78 years old. The trip that Isak takes will bring back past memories that he so desperately tried to hide from himself. That past will in effect make him not only a better person but bring back the feeling of humanity that he lost not only for himself over these long and empty years. Not only for Isak but for those close to him whom he more or less also lost contact with. Isak,in both his dreams and memories, is seen as a man who is unable to show any real feelings for those around and close to him in the fear of either being rejected as well as showing himself to be hurt by their negative responses.This defect in Isak personality has cost him the love of his life Sara when he was a young man who rejected him for his handsome and openly aggressive older brother Sigfried. We also see that Isak's marriage to his wife, who had long since passed away, Karin was anything but happy with her disgusted with his inability to show her any real feelings and emotions as a husband. Were also shown, in one of Isak's dreams, that she had an affair with another man Ake Fridell, who was anything but passive with her like her husband Isak was, some 40 years ago behind his back. That may have possibly resulted in the birth of his only child his son, who's also a doctor, Evald Marriane's husband.Seeing his 96 year-old mother on his way to Lund we see in her the same human defect that he has in that all of her ten children, who with the exception of Isak are now deceased, never bothered to visit her in her old age. The only time that they had anything to do with her was when they wanted money from the old lady. This coldness and inability to have any attachment to her children is shown not only in both Isak and his mother but in his son Evald who's so disgusted with life and what it had to offer him, like a beautiful and caring wife like Marianne. Evald threatened to walk out on Marianne when after he found out of her being pregnant, I guess by him, she refused his demand of her getting an abortion.Isak is helped on his long trip to Lund not only by Marianne but a number of people they meet and in some cases give a ride along the way. This included a young girl and two of her friend going on a trip to Italy ironically named Sara, a virtual twin of the Sara that he loved and lost as a young man. Later Sara together with Anders and Victor who later as a singing group serenade a surprised and grateful, to the point of tears, Isak after he received his award. Meeting among others along the way to far flung Lund a bickering couple Mr. &amp; Mrs. Alman, who almost had Isak and his passengers killed in a head-on car crash. Isak also met a gas station attendant, Henrik, who was so impressed and grateful by what he did for him and his wife in the past , delivered their first child, that he refused to get paid for filling up Isak's gas-tank.By the time Isak got to Lund and received his lifetime achievement award to the attendance and cheering of the entire town he not only realized all the good that he did as a man of medicine all these years but also all the hurt that he gave to others, if unintentional. With the little time that he has left, Isak was to pass away three years later at the age of 81, Isak is determined to make up for it.Sweet touching yet simple little film about one man's journey back in time who sees how he missed out on the many wonderful things that life had to offer him by being blind to them. Now given a second chance Isak would try as best as he can to both re-live and at the same time correct his past mistakes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman's WILD STRAWBERRIES, on the Criterion DVD version, is nothing short of stunning. Picture, sound and English Subtitles have never been as fine as seen here. Having viewed this 1957 film during its first U.S. release in 1959, when I was 21 years-old, it was quite involving to return to it 43 years later. Like the Professor of the story, I too often reflect upon choice made along lifes path and wonder what might have been if different choices had been made. Victor Sjostron as Proffesor Isak Borg gives the performance of a life-time! What a magnificent face this man had! Bergman films can be quite dark and depressing, but his THE SEVENTH SEAL and WILD STRAWBERRIES are marvelous, thought-provoking dramas that lift the spirit. BEWARE: There are two other DVD releases, one from Asia and one from Brazil -- but neither of these have been cleaned up like the Criterion version. The sound for instance -- I have seen the dream sequence at the beginning of the film when the Professor walks through empty streets, sees handless clocks, a carriage carrying a casket with his body -- a scene with almost complete silence,BUT prints on 16mm, VHS and even Laser Disc all contain a great deal of surface noise. In the Criterion version, the silence is almost complete. And the picture is perfection -- blacks &amp; whites that sparkle and no film blemishes or dirt-- a picture that is a wonder to behold. Peter Cowie's Commentary is outstanding and very worth while. The 90 Documentary from Swedish Television, INGMAR BERGMAN ON LIFE AND WORK is quite fascinating. Bergman, then in his early 80's, is very articulate and thoughtful in his discussion. Over the years Bergman has come to the conclusion that when we die we are no more -- and he has stated that conclusion gives him great peace. BUT his conversation in this documentary puts a wrinkle in his conclusion. He speaks of his final marriage to a woman for over 20 years and of her passing. He can not believe that SHE does not exist anymore. He often has the feeling that she is near him and that she still influences decisions he makes. He can accept not being for himself but not for her. Bergman is getting closer to the truth then he realizes. . . death is not the end -- but only the beginning. When he finally passes from this early life and finds that he still "is" -- I wonder if he'll wish he could change the focus of his later film work. Be that as it may -- WILD STRAWBERRIES and THE SEVENTH SEAL are two of the finest films of the last century -- in my humble opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Contrarian View</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I look at all the 10 star reviews that others have given this film I wonder if I am being foolhardy in daring to say something to the contrary. I am and have been for many years a Bergman fan. I eagerly saw most of his films as they were released. I love nearly all of them - this one being an exception. Certainly the film is worth seeing - any Bergman film is. But this one is often cited as his best, and there I would strongly disagree. It is about an academic and although professor Borg has to face some of his demons, he comes out on top in then end. I understand why this film is so popular. Academics see themselves in professor Borg and academics have a lot of influence on what is considered art and what isn't. Borg ends up looking good at the end of the film, and academics, although they have their faults like anyone else, like to think that they are worthy of the respect that their position commands. In many, many cases they are - and this is not a diatribe against academics. I just think that Bergman let this character off too easily, particularly when you compare the way he treats his other characters in movies like "The Hour of the Wolf", "The Silence", "Shame" and so on. He plumbs the depths of the soul and takes no prisoners. "Wild Strawberries" starts out that way, when the professor flashes back to the key points in his life where he turned away from love, life and reality in favor of academic honor. But ultimately Bergman backs down. The professor, having seen the errors of a lifetime in a few short hours, is shown to be wiser and a better man now as he receives his honorary award. Bergman does not do this in his other films. For me this gives a certain falsity to "Wild Strawberries" that I don't see in "Persona" for example. Well, everyone will probably disagree with me, - this is such an acclaimed film - but sometimes it is valuable to hear a contrarian opinion even when you don't agree with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film for a class, and virtually everyone groaned over the development. I was the only one with an open mind, and I was thankful for such a condition of spirit. While this film was at times slow, the morphing of different worlds created quite an experience, one which was spiritual and eerie. The dream sequences were amazing, examining the doctor's state of mind through the use of imagery and allegorical conventions. A good film for anyone to experience, and you get to Max von Sydow as a young man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Great Films of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a junior in college when I came down to NYC for a day and saw WILD STRAWBERRIES in its first run at the Beekman Theater. From that day to today it has been in my top five films of all time and one that I watch over and over again.Everything works in what I consider to be director Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece. The story is simple, though so loaded with meaning and symbolism that it can be dissected frame by frame. Isak Borg, an old doctor and teacher living in Stockholm, Sweden is to be honored for a lifetime of work, in Lund, a Cathedral town many miles away. After waking from a terrible nightmare in which he envisions his own mortality, Borg decided to drive to Lund, taking his daughter in law, who has been staying with him, as she is estranged from Borg's son Evald, with him. The journey, which takes up the major part of the film, is one of self revelation as Borg slips back and forth in time in his dreams, and faces the stark reality of the cold, impersonal person he has become. Only at the end of his journey, is there redemption.The cast is flawless with the luminous Ingrid Thulin as the daughter in law, and Bibi Anderson in a dual role as Sara, the girl Borg wanted to marry and Sara, a hitchhiking youngster, who helps in Borg dealing with understanding his loss. But is famed director Victor Sjostrom as Borg that stays forever in your mind. (Indeed, the second to last close up of him in the film, has to be one of film's all time most memorable moments. In an astounding bit of acting, Sjostrom, like a Swedish Scrooge, turns from an old, icy pedant, into a human being right before our eyes. What a magnificent performance.The direction of Ingmar Bergman, the crystal clear black and white photography of Gunnar Fischer and the music by Erik Nordgren meld together into a seamless work of art that stays with you long after the final frame.If you have never seen WILD STRAWBERRIES, now is the perfect time as it has been released on a beautiful DVD by Criterion. If you have seen it, watch it again, as you will be amazed at all the new things you find with every viewing.WILD STRAWBERRIES is a magnificent achievement!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a pleasant surprise after seeing the dark 'The Seventh Seal', 'Autumn Sonata' and 'Fanny and Alexander'. Maybe I'm just not a fan of Sven Nykvist. Surrealist instances and magic realism make 'Wild Strawberries' lighter and at least as memorable as 'the Seventh Seal', which was made in the same year. As a fan of Luis Bunuel I think I can say that Bunuel must have liked these two masterpieces, although here is less humour and less shocking moments than in any of his own films and Bunuel hated family values. But we already knew from Swedish people that they have less temperament than the Spanish.Victor Sjostrom and 'The Wind' (1928) have been mentioned, so I will not do that again here, but cinematographer Gunnar Fischer was a also a crucial mind behind the success of this film which is at least visually unforgettable and a directorial milestone. The screenplay of the Seventh Seal is obviously superior, but also a bit more heavy-handed than this eclectic film.Is a honorary degree more important than family memories or family values? What do you learn from life if you spend it studying it? These are the questions that I would like to ask many academics by recommending to them this film. After all, questions are more important than answers. Sokrates said it, and a certain Ingmar Bergman too.10 points out of 10 :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Smultronstallet", the elderly professor Isak Borg, on his way to receive an honorary degree, uses the journey to discover and understand himself and the effect he has had on others. The action converts past and present, reality and fantasy, the present harshly and starkly lit, the earlier memories more relaxed and lyrical as if, for an old man, the past - that other country - was better than the time and place he inhabits now. Each new character, each reminiscence as it springs up in the mind of professor reveals something new about him - his failings, his shortcomings, the reasons why, in his apparently successful and honored old age, he is alone and lonely. This is, admittedly, an uneven film, verbally over explicit, but it is packed with vivid imagery - an early dream sequence, both mysterious and yet significant; a disenchanted couple squabbling fiercely in a car; the sad beauty of Marianne, unhappy daughter-in-law; the words, memories and gestures of professor's mother; the distancing effect produced by the device of having the professor visiting his own past unseen by those who shared it with him; the meeting with Akerman. It is a sombre, striking work, uncompromising in its examination of the protagonist and Victor Sjostrom, in his last screen role, is splendid. For me, this film is the proof for to believe Ingmar Bergman the best best European director of the last century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most beautiful films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ostensibly simple on first analysis, Wild Strawberries, alongside the work of Bresson, Dreyers Le Passion De Jeanne D'Arc and Murnau's Sunrise, is one of those very special, transcendent assets of cinema able to inspire us in a deep and spiritual way. Bergman's achievement to tell a heartfelt story with a very human message juxtaposed with image after image of stunning beauty is something so rare and so very remarkable. I wont go into a deep analysis of this beautiful masterpiece, as many other users on here have done so. All I will do is simply describe one of the films most lyrically sublime scenes. Near the end of the film, as Isak Borg lies in bed, his son asks him how his heart is (meaning his physical health). Being a doctor of considerable talent and having a tradition of being practical and sensible in his work, you would expect him to tell his son of his failing health. However after his subsequent journey, both physical and spiritual, his attentions are now turned toward his emotional and spiritual well being, a part of himself he has neglected for many years. He simply replies that his heart is fine, and that he is happy and content. In this single moment, we understand that Isak has reached a moment of catharsis, but it also tells us something about every one of us. We strive constantly for physical wealth and materialistic products of our lives and jobs, but we must remember the simple but extremely rewarding pleasures that determine the happiest of individuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, moving masterpiece - Bergman's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Swedish Professor Isak Borg (Victor Sjöström) embarks on a journey to Lund in order to receive an award for lifelong achievement in the medical field. After his house maid refuses to go with him ("We're not married!") he finds his daughter-in-law (Bibi Andersson) inviting herself along. Little does he know that she holds a great contempt for her father-in-law and is only accompanying him as a way of easily confronting him and expressing her true feelings.Painfully wounded by the prospect of his own daughter-in-law hating him, Borg begins to reflect upon his life in a series of visions, flashbacks and hazy dream sequences.This is my favorite Ingmar Bergman film. Although it's a close call, I'd say this is his overall best movie and is wonderfully, beautifully shot. It's tasteful, just the right running length (short enough not to contain any unnecessary scenes and long enough to feel satisfied when it's over).The point here -- underneath all the layers -- is that we don't have a very long time on earth, and we should make the most out of it. Borg realizes as a frail old man that he has ruined his own life and has no happy memories.It is Bergman's "Citizen Kane" or "Ikiru" -- a poignant reflection on humanity and a film that, ultimately, can change the way you look at life -- if you open up enough to let it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cold start to a warm ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild StrawberriesWild Strawberries, written and directed by Ingmar Bergman is an interesting film in the mere fact that it is difficult to predict the conclusion before film's end. Bergman's use of light and dark scenes to create a sense of the character and atmosphere is wonderfully achieved in this outstanding film of the late 1950s. The opening scene of the movie provides the viewer an excellent synopsis of Dr. Isak Borg's life and family. The scene acquaints the viewer with his son, mother, house keeper, deceased wife and the doctor himself. The first dream by Dr. Borg is dark and puzzling due mainly to its unclear meaning and uncanny nature. The street is deserted and clear. Dr. Borg approaches a clock and looks, but it is without hands. He looks at his pocket watch and it is also without hands. The black and white scene is subdued and calm, but draws the viewer in all the while guessing what's next. The scene is without music and progresses with the sound of a heart beat that quickens with each step taken as he walks along the desolate boulevard. When Dr. Borg approaches a man, the man turns and lacks a face. Shortly after, a cart-drawn casket passes and knocks its wheel off after colliding with a lamp post. The casket falls, opens, and a hand hangs exposed. Dr. Borg approaches the casket preparing to look inside when the hand reaches and clutches his hand. Surprised and frightened, he struggles to free the grip and soon recognizes that the face of the man in the casket is his own.The movie was filled with Dr. Borg's puzzling dreams and remembrances of his early life, but much of the charm and warmth that is contained throughout the movie is owed to the secondary characters. Dr. Borg's daughter-in-law, Marianne is a delight to watch because she can smile like an angle and can be bluntly frank, all at the same time. Her stunning classic looks and assured mannerism helps the movie in a great way. Agda has lived with the doctor as his housekeeper for forty years. She and Dr. Borg hysterically argues as if man and wife. She knows the doctor well and understands him like the other people in his life do not. Sara, the young girl who wakes the doctor as he lay near the wild strawberries is a joy to watch. She shows the doctor new ways to look at the world by not taking anything too seriously. She takes in all that life has to offer and brings out the joy. Her slight touch to the doctor's face while they drove is one of the warmest scenes in the film and defines her loving character. There are many warm moments in the film, and many moments of darkness. The beginning of the film was dark, puzzling, and melancholy, and the end of the film was warm, bright and full of life and tenderness. The movie brought to mind, Charles Dickens' Scrooge, from A Christmas Carol. Although Professor Borg was not nearly as cold and unpleasant as Mr. Scrooge, he did however isolate and distance himself from his wife, friends, and family. His cruelty was hidden by his charm, but affected people quite similar to Mr. Scrooge's nasty mannerisms. On several occasions, in dreams and reality, Dr. Borg had to endure scrutiny from family members about his coldness. While driving to Lund, Marianne charmingly reminded him of his lack of warmth, love, and understanding and how she only knows him as a father-in-law. Marianne also lets on to Dr. Borg that his own son hates him; words that rang in the doctor's head. The doctor's dreams pointed out to him how he isolated the important parts of life and the people who cared for him. During one of Dr. Borg's dreams, he was taken by a teacher to see his dead wife. She was in a grassy field where she was making love to another man. Afterwards, she sat there talking to the man about her husband not caring, not giving her the attention she needed and how he would dismiss the entire event as his fault, but she says he does not mean any of it, because "he is cold as ice." Dr. Borg also became puzzled by a pocket watch that once belonged to his father. His mother showed him the watch and had wanted to give it to her grandson. The watch was missing the hands, just as the one in his dream. Throughout the movie, Dr. Borg let more and more of his old ways die and by the end of the day he was beginning to live and be happy. The crabby old coot that emerged at the beginning of the movie, softened and begin to see how happy he could be if he allowed himself. The Drive with the good people that Dr. Borg was fortunate to have accompany him, allowed him to experience the love and joy of others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant piece of filmmaking detailing a man's disappointments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Smultronstallet or Wild Strawberries, by Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, is one of the greatest films ever. Its cinematography, screenplay, acting, and directing are superb. This motion picture is amazing in its emotional impact and in my opinion is better than Bergman's other masterwork, The Seventh Seal. I say this because although Seventh Seal's plot is more ominous and the ending is a little more well done, Wild Strawberries could actually make you change your outlook on life. Great films do this. Just look at "One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest", "The Deer Hunter", "Platoon", "Natural Born Killers", and "JFK", among others. Overall, a fantastic film that deserves many viewings and more attention than bloated American Hollywood blockbusters.4/4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinema as an art form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bergman's films, to state the blindingly obvious, are the complete antithesis of the mindcandy (A Beautiful Mind) presented to cinemagoers in sterile multiplexes. They are almost like cinematic art forms, meditations on life and its meanings but, like many works of art, they can be obscure, challenging and demand patience to understand their underlying subtexts. Even after a 2nd viewing!?Wild Strawberries' deals with the past, memories &amp; regrets. It's about an inner journey about one man's subjective state of mind as he sees nostalgic memories of childhood &amp; lost love (regret), surreal visions of denial (mortality) and unsettling weird dreams which hint at a self-awareness and truth that he cannot face in reality.I was touched by Victor Sjostrom's performance as the elderly Prof. Isak Borg reflecting upon his life, and moved by the final emotional scenes where he achieves an inner peace. Is it slightly deceiving, a cop-out that Borg finds peace at the sight of his father and mother, ?the point before betrayal, before the messiness of life' intervenes as another reviewer stated? Well, I think it's commonly accepted that most people, as they grow older, tend to remember more from their past &amp; childhoods. Why? Perhaps because it reminds them of a time of lost innocence.What I found quite difficult to understand was how Isak is supposed to be this cold-hearted rationalist; Sjostrom's touching depiction makes this troubled old man quite endearing (viz the young travelling companions affection for him). Perhaps, as the opening suggests, this is a man who has shied away from intimate contact, whose coldness drove his unhappy late wife into the arms of another and who has approached life solely on his own (egotistic) terms leading to loneliness. This is where the allusion to wild strawberries becomes significant as it is the symbol of regeneration: through his inner journey, mixing dream &amp; reality, Borg sees the truth about his life and its emptiness. The film charts his growing intimacy with his daughter-in-law and an eventual inner peace.The film sounds typically Scandinavian in its gloom but it is also a celebration of youth as well as a study of mortality and one man's mind. It's also not without comedy, particularly the old Prof's relationship with his housekeeper Agfa and the absurd boxing match about 'God'(Bergman parodying himself) between the two young hitchhikers.What makes the film so intriguing is how characters/situations often reflect one another (Borg &amp; his son, their coldness and attitude to life); these parallels extend to the point where characters even play dual roles: Bibi Andersson as Sara (the lost love &amp; then the young vivacious traveller) and a cruel husband who later appears as the stern examiner in an unsettling dream. It's a highly complex pattern of subtle connections (stream of consciousness)that, as Borg states at the end, forms some sort of logical order.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and having said that I can say this might be one of Bergman's critically over-rated pictures. Of course there is much to look for, admire, and saturate with his tale of an old professor/doctor on his way to get a degree who looks back on his life, but the road trip scenes, while somewhat fascinating, can't hold a candle to the work that is displayed in the first dream. We see clocks with no hands (no time left for the old timer), a man with a very tightened face, and a coffin that falls right in front of the old man with himself inside of it, reflecting him. That this is one of Bergman's most evocative and powerful scenes goes to show why the film is so praised, and with the other dreams we see much insight into his fears and doubts on his life and what it's meant. But a number of the scenes go nowhere or ponder on events that slow the film down. Wild Strawberries is a film that can be judged as a display of perfect sorrow or longish observation, you decide. Plenty of beautiful outdoor scenery shots though; Max Von Sydow has a cameo as a gas station attendant. Grade: A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wild Strawberries is one of those rare films that works underneath the surface, building emotion in the viewer while the story unwinds. The themes are universal, death, family, the generations, even technology. I think it helps a viewer to realize the care with which a Bergman, or a Kubrick, or any film maker of the first rank approaches the script, shoot, edit, release sequence. Because Bergman had his hands in all of that he had a chance to look at every scene from all angles. Any seeming clunkiness or absract reality presented has a reason for being there. I found it best to sit without concerning myself with why anything happened and let the movie roll forward trusting the people to be who they were and go where they would. The ending was lushly satisfactory. I love this film.</fullReview>

The trip becomes a relicing of the old man's life as he realizes he led an empty life due to his stuffiness , egotism and inability to really love and feel. Nightmares, dreams and reminiscences are expertly blended as space and time are broken to work on the various levels on the man's thoughts.Picture sometimes talks too much in philosophical asides, but it remains a searching pictorial analysis of a man's life. Expert directorial touches and notations of director Ingmar Bergman, and the dignified miming of oldtime director Sjostrom, plus other fine thespic additions, make this an offbeater.

		<fullReview>Thoughtful and thought-provoking, this Ingmar Bergman classic will probably mean different things to different viewers. The deceptively simple story introduces you to characters who are not wholly sympathetic, yet whom you cannot help but care about. It shows their lives to be rather drab for the most part, yet it also brings out how important the events in their lives are to the characters themselves.The story of old Professor Borg driving across Sweden to attend a ceremony in his honor is complemented by just the right measure of dream sequences and flashbacks to his youth, which put the doctor's life into perspective and raise the questions that Bergman wants his viewers to think about. The youthful memories, and the symbols they use, often strike an immediate chord whether you can personally relate to them or not. The dreams are suitably weird without being overblown, and they are always pertinent. All of this is a difficult balance to maintain, and Bergman had a masterful restraint that most film-makers lack, especially today. He trusts his viewers to pay attention, and he wants the emphasis to remain on the important themes, where it should be, and not on cinematic artifice. Of course, "Wild Strawberries" also benefits enormously from Victor Sjöström's excellent lead performance, with considerable help from the rest of the cast as well.Since it has little action and little pretense, but much substance, this is the kind of movie that might never be widely popular. But it is a worthwhile experience that will mean something - not always the same thing - to anyone who gives it the attention that it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could never hope to do justice to this film in writing. I could ramble on and on about it, spouting adjectives like "warm", "funny", "honest", "chilling", "captivating", "intelligent" and "poignant", but what would be the point of that? Other, more eloquent reviewers have already said it better than me. I'd just like to say that it's a shame many dismiss Bergman's work as the epitome of pretentious, incomprehensible, depressing foreign cinema for art-house snobs, when it really is anything but. Unlike the stereotypical Bergman film, Smultronstället is all at once terrifyingly honest and beautifully uplifting. The performances by Victor Sjöström, Ingrid Thulin and Gunnar Björnstrand are beyond description, and the script by Bergman himself has to rank among the best ever written. Not to mention the direction, which is by turns spine-tingling and heartbreaking, and the unforgettable cinematography by Gunnar Fischer. Smultronstället manages to combine flawless and impressive technical aspects with an understandable story that is timeless and easy to relate to. No other film does this as well as this one, which is why I don't hesitate to call it the greatest film ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are moments in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries where you become so enthralled by an image that you want to dwell on it, until you realize that there are so many such moments that to do so would be to stop at practically every scene in the film. The sheer technical and visual skill that Bergman shows here is unsurprising, insofar as we ought to expect this from him, but it is dazzling, even when it is displayed in a film that, on the surface, has a rather tame premise. An old man, Professor Isak Borg (played to perfection by Victor Sjöström), is driving to Lund, where he is to be honoured. His son's wife, and three spirited young people, two men and a woman, accompany him. They also pick up an utterly depressed couple along the way, only to drop them off when they begin to fight. Interspersed with the present actions are the old man's dreams, and flashbacks to his youth.Out of this material, Bergman crafts a wonderful and touching film about redemption. There is always a tendency to marvel at how an atheist like Bergman can be so deeply involved with religious issues, but many atheists, of course, are atheists precisely as a result of such deep involvement. I don't know enough about Bergman's views on religion to comment on his attitude towards God and religion beyond the basics. What is important, at any rate, is that this film is one in which an old man is redeemed from a miserably lonely and empty existence through contact with others. This is a deeply humanistic view of redemption, and one which is firmly grounded in reality.The film begins with the professor telling us that he has distanced himself from others, because he has shunned human relationships. This has left him feeling empty and alone. The man we see seems nice enough, until we learn from his son's wife, who speaks frankly to him, how this self-imposed exilic state has rendered him selfish and aloof. Through flashbacks and the dream sequences, we learn enough about his life to chart his progress: when young, the girl he loved, Sara, chose his brother over him. The professor married, but the marriage was a bad one; his wife cheated on him, but it apparently did nothing for him. To her, as she states in one of the dream sequences, he was " cold as ice". The professor, therefore, is old, lonely, and has an empty existence.How does one find oneself out of that miserable situation? There are three means through which the old man is redeemed. Firstly, the dream sequences serve to warn him of death, which, considering that the man is 78, could come any day. The dream sequences also point out to him just how detached he is from other human beings. In a fantastic scene, he is given a test, which he fails. The point is clear enough: he might be a professor and doctor, but that is nothing if he does not have an understanding of human beings, their emotions and feelings. Secondly, the flashbacks serve to remind him of a time when he was connected with others, as well as of times when he was disconnected from his wife and others. The beautiful scenes of his childhood are marvelously retold, with everyone well dressed in white, and the entire family engaging with each other. Only he is absent, standing in the dark at the threshold, an old man staring at the happy ghosts of the past mingling before him. Lastly, the three young people the professor meets, especially the wonderful Sonia, connect with him on a deeply emotional and innocent level. The girl looks like, and has the same name as, the Sonia who rejected the professor in favour of his brother when he was young. You can interpret this in any way you like, but I think it's obvious that we see here a kind of second chance. In the car, the professor asks Sonia which of the two young men she likes the most. She does not answer firmly. At the end of the film, as the three bid him goodbye, she tells the professor that she loves him the most of all. He brushes it off, but once he gets in bed, there is a great smile on his face. The smile no doubt is a reaction to the whole day's events, but I'm certain that one big reason for his happiness at the end is that Sonia finally chose him, after having rejected him so long ago.What is the overall message of this film? As with all great films, there is no one right answer. What is certain, however, is that Bergman gives us a view of the world that is neither wholly pessimistic nor wholly optimistic, because it is so painfully real. The characters in this film have been bruised. They are broken, and seek a way out of their situation. There is no indication in the film that Bergman suggests that a solution will solve all the problems. Rather, any change for the better can only come once we engage with the past. Through an understanding of our past and our self, we can add a new sense of our self to what the past given. If we can achieve that, through whatever means necessary, then we can be redeemed. In fact, that understanding of ourselves is itself a kind of redemption. Bergman's world is one in which hope is always possible. It can happen to an unsuspecting 78 year old man, and it can happen to us. It is never too late. Every day in our life is a new chance to make something better of ourselves.A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem among the history of movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingmer Bergman's films are usually about what's happening inside the mind of a character, rather than in the outside world, and Wild Strawberries is a classic of the genre. The story in the conventional sense is almost nonexistent, and I have no qualms about spilling whatever there is. In any case, it's only my version of the story. A 78-year old doctor is to be honored on the 50th anniversary of his graduation from the university. The old man's day is normally filled either recalling his dreams while asleep, most of them he is unable to comprehend, or day-dreaming about the girl he loved in his youth, who ditched him to marry his brother. It's no different on the day of coronation, when he is traveling to the university accompanied by his daughter-in-law, estranged from his son. Significantly, he never day-dreams about his wife he lived with till her death. Occasionally, when she does appear in his dreams, he is guilt-ridden to find himself devoid of any feelings for her other than lust. During the journey, his daughter-in-law confides in him, that his 38-year old son is cold, detached, selfish and vainly principled - traits she observes in him as well as his 95-year old mother they meet on the way. The old man has loaned an undisclosed sum of money to his son, and in spite of son desperately needing money, and old man having no use for it, both father and son insist on returning the money as a matter of principle. Although feeling sorry for his son not enjoying life in his prime, just like himself, he feels himself absolved of any guilt feelings - it's in the genes - and goes back to day-dreaming of the girl he loved but lost. It's a film pleasing to the senses - B&amp;W cinematography is exceptionally beautiful, the background score is haunting and nostalgic. As a character study of old age, it's pioneering. Ingmer Bergman is one of the purists of the cinema, who has not compromised the least bit in any of his movies. He, along with few others notably Robert Bresson and Werner Herzog, has made cinema the art form within 100 years of its origin. Bergman's Wild Strawberries (and Seventh Seal) are among the gems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WILD STRAWBERRIES (Ingmar Bergman, 1957) ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is still one of Bergman&#x2019;s finest and, actually, it seems to me that the film improves with each viewing. It was certainly an inspired choice to cast elderly ex-director Victor Sjostrom in the lead, while the main female roles are filled by the luscious Ingrid Thulin (here in one of her best showcases) and a radiant Bibi Andersson (in two roles no less, both named Sara!). Other important members of Bergman&#x2019;s stock company of actors appear in bit-parts: even Gunnar Bjornstrand in the pivotal role of Sjostrom&#x2019;s son and Thulin&#x2019;s husband is only in a couple of scenes; a blonde Gunnel Lindblom plays Andersson&#x2019;s sister (during Sjostrom&#x2019;s recollections); and, most incongruously, Max von Sydow turns up as a gas-station owner grateful to doctor Sjostrom for services rendered in the past!WILD STRAWBERRIES also features two of cinema&#x2019;s most unforgettable dream sequences &#x2013; Sjostrom&#x2019;s character meeting his own corpse while walking a deserted city street and, later, his humiliating exam for a doctor&#x2019;s degree (by and in front of the people he met during the day&#x2019;s journey on the way to picking up an award for his distinguished career). The film presents a simple but eventful, episodic narrative that is brimming with reflections and insights about family, love and duty; invariably, these have marked the personality of the protagonist (rendered somewhat cold by regrets and disappointments) and now lead to either reconciliation or resignation on his part with his earlier life &#x2013; it&#x2019;s as if Bergman was doing his own version of &#x201c;A Christmas Carol&#x201d;!As usual, spirituality (the eternal debate on the existence of God) is touched upon here via semi-humorous incidents &#x2013; a bickering middle-aged couple and two young students (both in love with the second character played by Andersson) who determine to settle the argument with a fistfight! By the way, in earlier viewings of WILD STRAWBERRIES, I used to resent Bergman&#x2019;s rather contemptuous depiction of the twins (being one myself, I can attest to the fact that such siblings don&#x2019;t speak in unison as depicted here &#x2013; though it happens on occasion, for instance, that my brother and I discover to have shared parallel thoughts!); thankfully, however, the two characters&#x2019; participation in the film doesn&#x2019;t last for very long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A metaphoric road film full of symbolism, this film has gained the status as one of Ingmar Bergman's best films. It is uneven, with gaps between the most spectacular and meaningful sequences, however the film certainly has enough in it to rate as a great film. Victor Sjöström is excellent as the old man reflecting on his past and trying to sort out his emotions, and the camera-work is simply beautiful. The (too few) nightmarish dream segments are very well done: surreal and quite frightening to a degree. The film pushes the boundaries with some aspects though, such as how the protagonist is able to remember events that he never witnessed himself, and a time factor that can only be discussed in light of events that happen towards the end of the film. There a small number of things that one can quibble about here, but the overall film stands up strong. It is relatively pleasant, quite well acted, and the bits that are done well are done very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quietly spellbinding -- The Best Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film summary missed the point altogether. The professor (doctor) made no "bad choices" in his life; no, the "choice" that cast a shadow on the professor's entire life was Sara's choice in loving the professor's brother and rejecting the professor. Sara was/is the girl He loved, the girl he will always love; with that light taken out of his life everything remaining is coldness; the quiet hell of living life in the absence of love; an infection that effects his wife, his son, but oddly not the people he served as a doctor. As the story progresses, the professor witnesses a much younger Sara and her two rival young men, an exact reflection of his own situation decades ago. As the loneliness generated the coldness in his life, the one radiant light was his quiet and close-guarded memory of the love he had for Sara, and in the final scene we watch the old man view paradise as he looks back on the time when Sara was still with him, with his family at a country get-together. What adds to the emotional wallop is the realization that the old man is Ingmar Bergman's projection of himself some 40 years hence, Bergman, a man loved by many beautiful women, yet he can see (and fear) the devastation which can destroy even a strong person if such person loses the spark of irreplaceable love. Immediately following this movie, I evaluated my own life; resolving drastic action to avoid (if possible) the pitfall Bergman warned us about with this powerful movie.</fullReview>

He is going to receive an award for 50 years of work. He travel with the wife of his son. In the road, they begin a travel of feelings and remembers, where the dreams of this old doctor are important characters. "Smultronstället" is a masterpiece because makes you feel a warm air. Because is an exploration of your soul and the human been past. No matter if you are old or you are young,. That is the thing that makes so important "Smultronstället". This film relation all ages and mixed in an awesome retrospective of life. Every fact of the life of this doctor is represented in each of one person that appears in the road of his life. All the characters have a meaning that represents the past (love, family, career) of this old doctor. At the same time it makes you realize about the truly important facts in life, and this makes it talks in an universal language.I love "Smultronstället" because is a perfect movie. Is cozy, meanful, understandable and nice. And here is my question... Why don't do movies like this anymore? *Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of My Favorite Bergman Pics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Smultronstallet/Wild Strawberries(1957) features a prestigous professor whose memories of his youth become precious as he comes closer to the end of his life. Memories are important for Bergman's film protagonists because of a personal desire to return to happier days. Ingmar Bergman was interested in his own youthful memories which are loosely injected into the youthful memories of Professor Isak Borg. Memories of Professor Borg are intergrated into his dreams to create a time period both unreal and filled with life moments that can never return.Dreams are portrayed in Wild Strawberries(1957) as segments of childhood for the Professor. Early dreams of Professor Borg involve childhood love for an older cousin. The young woman who is his cousin seems to represent an unattainable love which has eluded the Professor his entire life. Professor's memories of his favorite cousin are the film's main tender moments.Light hearted Bergman fare compared to films, The 7th Seal(1957) and The Virgin Spring(1959). Ingmar Bergman presents the past as a time of innocence before the faults of old age begin to creep in. Professor Borg is in a way as seen now a stand-in for Ingmar Bergman because like Bergman, Professor Borg is well known for his achievements. Ingmar Bergman's five masterpieces are Persona(1966), Cries &amp; Whispers(1972), Wild Strawberries(1957), Seventh Seal(1957), and Fanny &amp; Alexander(1982).A heartfelt performance by Victor Sjostrom as a prestigious professor who looks back on his early life with nostalgia. Wild Strawberries(1957) is one of the few times in the Ingmar Bergman filmography to see an important male lead. Victor Sjostrom's performance is a good as the best of Max Von Sydow in an Ingmar Bergman film. The performances from the rest of the actors are very good as a whole.Wild Strawberrie's mis-en-scene moves with amazing imagery to capture the director's personal themes. Dreams and surreal moments are always soul searchful in the films of Ingmar Bergman. Ingmar Bergman is the Sweedish equivant of Luis Bunuel and Federico Fellini. Ingmar Bergman directs with a perfectionist dedication that is definitely typical of a master film director.Rare Bergman film which wasn't photographed by Sven Nykvist. Wild Strawberries(1957) does not suffer from the absense of Sven Nykvist because of the marvelous cinematography by Gunnar Fischer. Wild Strawberries(1957) is an excellent photographed film which is the norm for a Ingmar Bergman film. Whether by Nykvist or someone else, the cinematography in Bergman's films are for the most part in top form.Excellent in every area of film that constitutes a masterpiece. Strengths are in acting, imagery, montage, etc. Dream sequences are portrayed in the manner of a memoir. A viewer must have a degree of patience when watching an Ingmar Bergman film because of their slow moving nature.Wild Strawberries(1957) also deals with the Professor's fond memories of his parents which are shown in his dreams. These dreams which involve his parents signify Professor Borg's desire to return to a time that is lost and exists only in memories. Seems like the professor's relationship with his parents had a strong effect on him when he first became a parent himself. The final dream sequence marks an escape for the professor from the dreads of old age and death.Max Von Sydow has a rare small supporting role as Henrik Akerman. Bibi Anderrson as always in an Ingmar Bergman pic performs nicely as a young woman, the professor meets on his way to his tribute. Wild Strawberries(1957) is a cinematic classic without being flashy or starstruck. Title refers to the nature of Professor's inner thoughts and desires.Wild Strawberries(1957) also focuses on the theme of death and looking back as death is near at hand. Its with this aspect of the story that Wild Strawberries(1957) shares many common qualities with Seventh Seal(1957). Professor Borg comes to term with past behaviors and events as his time is about to come to a close. Bitter sweet motion picture that strikes at the core emotions of an audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Life in Isolation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A successful, respected doctor and professor near the end of his life looks back on it with regret and nostalgia. Bergman uses dreams and allegorical images and characters to illustrate his idea that the greatest waste of a life is to live it isolation. Wild Strawberries is also light and humorous in places, with a gentle and loving depiction of the doctor's family in his youth (though I think it's important that we never see the doctor interacting with his past family until the very end). He is ultimately redeemed, and Bergman is stating, I think, that there is hope for us to change even until the very end of our lives, and that such change is worth undertaking. One of the great strengths of this movie, and of Bergman's work in general, is that he creates characters who function successfully as both "types" -- embodiments of ideas, philosophies, or points of view -- and also as credible individuals in a narrative about whom we care. That's difficult to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman is, upon review, often-times seen as a master of portrayal of the human condition. In this instance, it must be said, that I cannot agree more.If one is perceptive enough to appreciate cinematographic endeavour older than thirty years (i.e. in monochrome and/or with subtitles) then this film is definitely worth viewing - the sheer subtlety of portrayal of human emotion in breath-taking. In short, please watch this film if you are prepared for an almost tearful recollection of the human condition, as observed by a character who has observed 70 years of life and it's cruelties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A High for me, this movie blew me completely away. Ingmar Bergman creates a real nightmare in this movie, kind of funny but i had a similar nightmare few years ago a it's so scary and surreal. Movie is from Sweden and naturally people in it talk in Swedish so it's subtitles but must be very well done the translating because every word seems to fit perfectly and every scene also fits perfect to the story. They don't make them like these anymore is something i was sure i would never say, but i have never seen anything like this before or after there is something Mr Bergman put in this movie thats makes it this special. The cast here is wonderful Bibi Anderson as Sara is a thing of beauty and as a nice plus her acting here is good, The old professor is acted by Victor Sjöström and what a great performance bravo i say. funny but i have only seen good films from Sweden o know they must have made some bad ones but i will hunt down all of Ingmar Bergman i watch them. I recommended the Criterion version cause Criterion equals quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Bergman's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I have only seen it once, I can safely say that I was taken aback by this film. Ingmar Bergman is a master of self-exploration and takes a beautiful, sometimes haunting, look at the emptiness in an elderly man's life. Professor Isak Borg is on his way to Lund to receive and honorary award from the college at which he used to teach. Now seventy-eight years old, Borg is cantankerous, cold and arrogant to the people around him. The film begins with some narration, Borg is setting the story up for us, filling us in quickly before we begin to follow him. He has a dream at the beginning of the film that sets the tone for the rest of the film. He is on a street that is devoid of any signs of life. The clocks have no hands and he is all alone. He knows what this all means; death is near. A solitary man is seen standing on the sidewalk and Borg goes to speak to him. When he turns, we discover a shriveled and disgusting face staring back at him. A cart comes carrying a casket and catches itself on a lamp post, losing it's wheel and dropping the casket into the street. Borg goes to examine the body and finds that it his own. When he tries to move away, his dead self grabs him, refusing to let go.After waking from the nightmare, he informs his maid that he is going to Lund to receive his award without her, and instead takes with him his daughter-in-law, Marianne. Along the way, Marianne tells Borg why she (and her husband) dislike him. This forces Borg to think about the things he has done in life and his dreams take him back to specific events in his life, events he did not get to see, in which the people he cared for were explaining their feelings about him to another person. Borg was, in his early years, in love with his Cousin Sarah, but eventually lost her to his brother, Sigfrid. Now, in the present, Sarah has come back into Isak's life (despite the fact that she had died years ago) in the way of Sara, a hitchhiker with two companions (obvious representations of young Isak and Sigfrid) all of whom ride to Lund with Isak and Marianne. After a long journey filled with bizarre dreams, discussions on the existence of God, discussions of love and it's importance and a near deadly car accident, Professor Borg finally arrives in Lund, receives his award and goes to stay at his son's house. While there, he realizes the errors and mistakes he made in life and vows to reform himself, though he knows death is right around the corner. Sara and her companions are leaving for Italy, but congratulate him before departing. Sara takes this time to tell Isak that she loved him all along, a fact which seems to make a huge mark on the old man. He later helps to reunite his son and Marianne, whose marriage is failing as his once was, so that they do not have to suffer as her has. We leave Borg after his final dream, a dream in which he is reunited with his mother and father who are sitting on a river bed, just outside their summer home. We see a sparkle of life in Borgs eyes that was previously thought to be non-existent. Death is near, but he is able to accept it know, knowing that he has come to terms with his life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild Strawberries- Last movie you want to see before you dead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The famous "Wild Strawberries", Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece, so glad to watch it finally! An old professor, had a strange dream, in which he saw a faceless dead man and a clock without pointers. The metaphor of the dream made him look back into his nearly 80 -year-old life.His selfishness and apartness hurt a lot of people around him, he lost his first love to his cousin because his passive personality though he loved her so much. His relationship with his mother is tolerable because they are so alike, he inherited the apathy from his mother and passed it to his own son, a lamentable biological heredity.When the professor decided to receive an award for him, he drove to the ceremony with his daughter-in-law who had just disputed with her husband about the unborn baby. On their way they met different people, the professor recalled the memories of his youth, and found the true meaning of life, death, love, hurt etc...Life goes on, the inertia drives us to neglect who we're, we may lose, regret and hesitate to a lot of things, among which are treasure, some we could have seized at that moment but the inertia inside deterred us. How can we see ourselves clear and transparent? We're not god so maybe we can't, so at least we can do as much as possible to be near it.This film contains too much things about what a man could learn, so it needs to be re-watched many times. The subtle feeling, complex thoughts, vulnerable emotions and meaningful words can truly touch the deepest part of my heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>¨ Wild strawberries¨ is a spellbinding masterpiece by the great Ingmar Bergman with brilliant acting by Victor Sjostrom (Sweden first movie filmmaker and star , best known for his silent work , who died three years later , aged 81) and awesome cinematography by Gunnar Fischer ; showing a rich tapestry of fears , dreams , anxieties , memories and occasionally over-symbolic frames . This Bergman's landmark film is developed in Sweden , after living a life marked by coldness, an aging professor is forced to confront the emptiness of his existence , taking place a sentimental voyage . This the story about an aging scientist on the rout to accept a prize and he must come to terms with nightmares , surrealist dreams and guilt .The movie displays haunting and powerful scenes ,it's plenty of intellectual images which stay forever in the mind ; resulting to be one of Bergman's warmest and therefore finest movies . Brooding and thought-provoking screenplay , Ingmar Bergman wrote the script while he was in hospital and thought the movie with Victor Sjöström in mind and riddled with a real feeling the joys of youth , age and nature . Although sometimes is slow moving ,however the thoughtful screenplay is narrated with intelligence and sensitivity but are developed ethics and moral issues as death , God , religion , family and aging . Surrealist and impressive images as when the coffin falling from the hearse , one of Bergman's own recurring dreams . Victor Sjostrom , Swedish cinema's best known pioneer and in his final screen appearance , gives a surprisingly moving interpretation as a professor on a touching journey to his redemption . The movie is marvelously paced and acted , and realizes an excellent Sweden reunion actors with usual Bergman's players (Ingrid Thulin , Bibi Andersson , Max Von Sidow as a gas station keeper and Gunner Lindblon, among others) , showing the different characters and exploring their apprehensions , ambitions, fears and circumstances . Glimmer and riveting cinematography by Gunner Fischer (The seventh seal) , he's deemed by many to be one of the world's greatest cameraman , he achieved give the movies on the most natural and simplest look imaginable . Cinematographer Gunnar Fischer says that several scenes had to be shot indoors due to Victor Sjöström's poor health , "We had to make some very bad back-projection in the car because we never knew if Victor would come back alive the next day." Gunnar was subsequently replaced by Sven Nykvist (won an Oscar for Fanny and Alexander) as Bergman's cinematographer . ¨Smultronstället¨ is wonderfully directed by Bergman ,it's a real masterpiece who made his major impact gaining international acclaim and winning Gloden Globe 60 , for the best Foreign film . His realization was during an impressive golden period from 1957-1968 when Bergman made stunning masterpieces, plenty of richly observed characters : The seventh seal , Persona, The communicants , The silence , Virgin spring , Hour of wolf . Rating: Magnificent, but is considered by many (along with The seventh seal) to be the Bergman's best .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imperfect but still wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is surprisingly flawed for Bergman. For one thing, the main character witnesses several flashbacks throughout the movie. However, he was never present at any of the events he rewitnesses. How can someone recall an event that they weren't at? Of course, this is only a minor flaw, but it still detracts from the plausibility and thus, the overall effectiveness of the film. Also, the film is much too cerebral for its own good. I don't have anything against a "thinking man's" movie, but in this particular case, it actually hurts the story. It gets too bogged down in intellectualism and doesn't have enough heart. The transformation that this film shows us deserves a more human quality to it. Still, I don't want to go on complaining about all the film's faults and ignore its triumphs; this is a great movie that any serious film lover should see. The cast is excellent and the cinematography is gorgeous. I especially loved the dream sequences, which are wonderful examples of the effectiveness of symbolic imagery in film. This might not be Bergman at his best (try "Persona," "Cries and Whispers," "Fanny and Alexander," or "The Seventh Seal"), but it is still a teriffic film and a landmark in art cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Igmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries was a very touching film. It exposed Dr. Isak Borg's past through a trip down memory lane, literally. He goes on a road trip to receive an honorary reward and on his way he visits his old home and his old mother. He has dreams and flashbacks that give us a peek into his very lonely life. Only in his old age on the day of his glorification does he realize what a lonely life he's had. It's very sad to see this, especially since he tries to change his ways in the end. I liked this film and would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There seems to be a consensus that Isak is lonely and isolated because he is cold and aloof. Actually, he does not seem so bad. He is friendly enough with other people, and he appears to be content with his relatively solitary existence. Anyway, Sara, the woman he loved when he was young, married his brother, and somehow that was Isak's fault, because he was cold and aloof. And Karin, the woman he ended up being married to, cuckolded him, but that was also Isak's fault, because he was cold and aloof. He visits his mother, who is cold and aloof. His son Evald is cold and aloof.I suppose the point is that he should have been warm and accessible, and then Sara would have married him and they would have lived happily ever after. Or Karin would have been faithful to him and they would have lived happily ever after. And they would have raised their son Evald to be warm and accessible, so that he and his wife Marianne could have lived happily ever after. And being warm and accessible, Evald would have been happy to hear that Marianne was pregnant, so that they would have a child of their own, whom they could raise to be warm and accessible.Having seen the error of his ways, Isak decides that he will henceforth become warm and accessible. Better late than never. So, he asks Agda, his maid of forty years, if she would like to be on a first-name basis. She rebuffs him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Wild Strawberries' was my second film from Swedish master director Ingmar Bergman, and it couldn't have come at a more appropriate time, just one month after the director's death, age 89. After 'The Seventh Seal' left me in absolute awe of its flawless beauty, 'Wild Strawberries,' released in the same year, did little to disappoint. Each and every frame is utterly perfect, and Bergman's hand so incredibly assured. Even in the most common situations ? a close-up of Dr. Isak Borg's face, for example ? the images on the screen seem to exude beauty; we see the character's aging, withered features and a sense of irreconcilable sadness lurking behind his eyes, and we, too, are crestfallen.'Wild Strawberries' stars Victor Sjöström, then 78, as Dr. Isak Borg, an aging professor who travels across the country from Stockholm to Lund to receive an honorary university degree. Sjöström himself was one of Sweden's greatest directors, no doubt a great influence upon Bergman, and he also directed 'Körkarlen {The Phantom Chariot} (1921),' among my favourite films of the silent era. As he makes the day-long car journey, Isak begins to re-evaluate his entire life, prompted by memories, daydreams and unsettling nightmares. His wife has passed away some years ago, the end to a somewhat frictional marriage, and now Isak is fully aware that his own minutes are slowly ticking away. In the truly frightening opening dream sequence, he finds himself in a deserted city, with an ominous blackness looming ominously over his lonely form, and the complete and utter silence leaving him only too aware of the frantic beating of his failing heart. Approaching a coffin that has toppled from a carriage into the street, Isak finds within it his own expressionless corpse.Accompanying Isak on his journey to Lund is his daughter-in-law, Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), who is currently facing marital problems with her husband and possesses a certain bitterness towards his father. The marriage between Marianne and Evald (Gunnar Björnstrand) is very much like that between Isak and his long-deceased wife, and one of Isak's final wishes is that he can convince his son not to make the very same mistakes that he did. Also along for the trip is young hitchhiker Sara (Bibi Andersson), who reminds Isak of his lost childhood love, and her two friends Anders and Viktor, who both love her. A bickering married couple whom they pick up after a car accident (played by Gunnel Broström and Gunnar Sjöberg) act as a cold reminder of Isak's many unhappy years with his wife, Karin (Gertrud Fridh).Considering the solemn subject matter, Bergman includes quite a few amusing moments in his film, many arising from Anders and Victor's childlike bickering over the existence of God. There is a genuine air of optimism infused throughout the story, and the ending ? though I thought it came all too soon ? is both gratifying and heartwarming. 'Wild Strawberries' is a beautiful tale of life, death and redemption, and nobody tells it more beautifully than Ingmar Bergman.</fullReview>

The black and white medium is a must for this dramatic story of an older doctor with self doubts about his own existence. The cast is dynamic. The subtitles are easily seen and one has to put this one on his or her must see list.

		<fullReview>After a bit of mannered symbolism in an introductory dream sequence, Bergman gets right down to business, and his business is as profound as any I've seen treated in film. Fortunately, the treatment itself isn't heavy-handed, and the story line remains entertaining while it slowly grips you with a more important message as an elderly man attempts to make sense of his life.Pay close attention to this film, and your effort will be rewarded. It's a cautionary tale about the mistakes you might make in your own life, about how ego can be its own undoing, and how giving in to fear can cause you to waste your time on this earth.The film-making is consistently masterful, yet generally understated. I can't think of a better work; it remains my favorite film, ever, by anyone. Finally, after you've seen "Wild Strawberries", don't miss Woody Allen's foul-mouthed, harsh, and hilarious remake, "Deconstructing Harry".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The search for meaning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An aging professor of bacterium embarks upon a day's journey from Stockholm to Lundsk to receive an honourary award for his career work. The night before, he has a Bunuel-esque nightmare that foreshadows his own fate, seeing a watch with no hands, and his own corpse in a coffin. Cleverly, the film hints that he may be out of time before his own mortality claims him, and thus he begins a journey of self discovery where his skeletons reach out from the closet.For my first Bergman film, I was impressed by the crisp presentation and cerebral story. Its not often that filmmakers explore the aging process in sympathetic ways, and this is helped by the characterization of Dr. Isak Borg as an every man which makes him easier to relate to. He's a successful academic, although happiness in his personal life was sacrificed for concentration on his profession. And so Dr. Borg asks the eternal question of whether his existence has had any significance at all. Along the road trip with his daughter in law Marianne (who resents his emotional distancing), they pick up passengers that each represent and harken back to the failures of Borg's past. An old bickering couple that remind him of his unhappy marriage, and a love triangle between two men and a girl who symbolize a lost love from his adolescence. As the memories come flooding back, the old doctor descends into his recollections and subconscious dreams, where suppressed issues come hurtling forth from the depths. His clinical nature and lack of interest in relationships led to his first love leaving him for his brother, and later his wife having a bastard child with another man, who Borg still raised as his own. There is a haunting scene where he takes Marianne to visit his lonely, decrepit mother, and there the audience realizes along with her that this lack of zest for life seems to run through the family; Isak's son is too revealed to be a misanthropic bore, who rejects his wife Marianne's request for a child. The result of his resentfulness at having been raised as an unwanted child himself.The doctor soon learns that the only good he ever accomplished was tied to his medicinal work, but at the cost of living a life of solitude and isolation, a mindset that has afflicted his own son. There is a subtle theme from Bergman that Borg's ignorance of his family and friends has been the result of his turning away from God, as hinted by the young men they pick up (a minister and a doctor, the two sides of Isak's psyche) who fight and debate over its existence. No real answer is given in the end, symbolized by the men's stalemate in the argument. But as said later in the film: "a doctor's first duty is forgiveness." It seems the first step to even beginning to comprehend the question is by forgiving the flaws of those around you and the ones within. And although Borg fears he may be too late to reconcile the animosity between him and his family, the film makes an inspiring statement by the end that it's never never too late to redeem oneself and begin enjoying life. The story is resolved, and the generational cycle of resentment broken, with the rapprochement between two lovers and the potential birth of new life.Alas, there are flaws in Bergman's work that cannot be forgiven, and he was no God. The first major flashback acts as a crux of the plot, but appears contrived due to Isak being present for an event that was impossible for him to have known. Nor do we ever get to really see this "cold distance" that Isak possessed as a man; only its effects. The director is to be commended for not spoon feeding the audience the philosophical aspects (this is an art film from Sweden after all), but sometimes his high brow obscurity gets in the way of my enjoyment of the story. It's all a little too esoteric for me. While the message may seem a little trite and simplistic at times, this is still a heartwarming and life-affirming fable from a legendary auteur. "Wild Strawberries" has a comforting aura, although like Doctor Isak Borg himself, the film can be rather too pedantic for its own good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Farewell, Victor Sjostrom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After living a life marked by coldness, an aging professor (Victor Sjöström) is forced to confront the emptiness of his existence.Star Victor Sjöström had been a gem of Swedish cinema for decades. He worked primarily in the silent era; his best known films include "The Phantom Carriage" (1921), "He Who Gets Slapped" (1924) and "The Wind" (1928). Bergman said this film could not have been made without him, and it makes sense. Not only was Bergman influenced by these early Swedish films, but it makes sense to have a man at the end of his distinguished career.The real standout performance (besides Sjostrom) is Bibi Andersson, who plays Sara. Is it any surprise she starred in more than ten Bergman-directed pictures, including "Smiles of a Summer's Night", "The Seventh Seal", "Brink of Life", "The Magician", "The Passion of Anna", "The Touch" and "Persona". If Bergman had a muse, it was Andersson.Bergman has been a strong influence on Woody Allen, and "Wild Strawberries" has influenced a whole series of Allen films: "Stardust Memories", "Another Woman", "Crimes and Misdemeanors", and "Deconstructing Harry". No less a person than Stanley Kubrick said this was his second favorite film of all time.</fullReview>

Victor Sjöström gives a precise and personal performance, authenticating Bergman's astoundingly screenplay. Technicalities don't truly matter with films like Wild Strawberries, but never the less; the cinematography is soft, artful visual poetry. The sound design and score might not be but they function fine as an drivers of the narrative without making it an impersonal experience. Overall, Wild Strawberries may not be the magnum opus that Persona is, but it is still an empowering personal and deftly poetic study of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that urges us to concern ourselves with what really counts; our personal wild strawberries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you stay in a distance, you won't get any connection. If you don't give love, you won't get any. You won't be happy, for sure. You won't have a clue about the meaning of life, the real essence of it- the WILD STRAWBERRIES of YOUR life. To comprehend this last phrase, you will have to think of the wild strawberries as they stand in the Scandinavian countries (where this movie comes from). They are pretty rare to find. If and when you find them, they won't even put out your hunger (as any other food, easily found in your refrigerator would accomplish). You don't really need them. But that's the whole point, the true value they carry.The film begins with Isak Borg making a trip to another town to get an award for his great achievements as a doctor. But, unexpectedly, this journey will be of a very different nature. He will pass from known places that will wake up memories well hidden in the unconscious, places which will take care for the development of this nature. He will meet personas who will play a part in this. He will go through situations that will ring a revealing bell of truth, they will be a strong reality check... for him and the audience...Ingmar Bergman, with his flawless masterpiece, presents to us the meaning of life in something like 90 minutes. Many films, especially in the '00s, have tried to walk through this path, but we easily reach the conclusion that they have achieved very little as we watch wild strawberries. In the same time, Bergman gives us a punch in the face. It's a painful procedure; to see what really counts and then realise you haven't valued it as you should all the previous years of your life until this moment of realisation. That you have not given it the time and space that fits to it, that you have spent your time and emotional space (the only things that really belong to you in this world) in other unimportant matters (like arguing about the existence of god ;-) ). Bergman's "wild strawberries" have a sublime flavor and during their digestion comes real personal valuation and change. I have seen hundreds of movies, but this is the one I always looked for. Thank you mr. Bergman.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, uplifting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Sjostrom stars in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries, from 1957.As most everyone knows, Victor Sjostrom was the Swedish and Hollywood director Victor Seastrom who ultimately quit directing and acted full-time in theater and film. I don't think multitalented covers it. His acting, as his directing, is magnificent.Here he is Professor Isak Borg, a man about to get a prestigious award. As he contemplates his life, however, he has strange dreams. As he talks to his daughter-in-law (Ingrid Thulin), he realizes that the only difference between his life and death is the coffin. In choosing a lonely, cutoff existence and a life of cold detachment, Borg realizes that he is already dead.This sounds like depressing Bergman, but in fact, Isak learns something as he travels to get his award. Along the way, he and his daughter-in-law Marianne agree to give a ride to some young people, two boys and a girl named Sara, which is the name of Isak's first love, his cousin. Like the woman he loved, Sara is being sought after by both boys, and she flirts with each one. In Isak's life, his Sara fell for his brother. The situation brings back Isak's childhood to him, and he relives family experiences when he visits his old home and later, his 96-year-old mother and sees her own coldness.Isak and Marianne also give a ride to a married couple whose car has broken down. But their fighting is reminiscent of Isak's own marriage (and Marianne's to Isak's son, too, for that matter), and Marianne asks them to get out of the car."Wild Strawberries," referring to the strawberries that grew on the land of Isak's family home, is the story of a man coming to grips with his life - a life full of accomplishment but not many human connections.The most striking thing about this black and white film is the cinematography - the starkness of Isak's dreams, the family all in white against the Swedish landscape - so many stunning images.People call this film optimistic and uplifting, and it is. It is also profound, emotional, and very warm. Sjostrom shows us a charming old man whose niceness is on the surface only. While Marianne says that she doesn't like him very much, the young people love him and buy into his facade because they sense the real man he is afraid to show others.Bergman tells us that life's questions aren't answered right away - sometimes, it takes a lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember, back when I was in high school, I was just starting to get into film, at least as more than just a cheap way to kill a couple of hours. I'd heard a lot about Bergman, about how he was one of the all-time greats, so I decided to watch "The Seventh Seal". Frankly, I wasn't overly impressed. I've seen it again since then, and I liked it a lot better the second time, but my first impression was disappointment. But not long afterward, I decided to get back on the horse and give Bergman one more shot. The second movie I tried was "Wild Strawberries", and that was another story altogether.The story is a relatively simple one. Professor Isak Borg (Victor Sjöström), an aging physician, is traveling to Lund to receive an honorary degree. Accompanying him is his daughter-in-law, Marianne (Ingrid Thulin). Along the way, they make various acquaintances ? a trio of young travelers, an embittered married couple, Borg's mother, a former patient, etc. Each of these encounters recalls some memory, some event in Borg's life, recollections of his childhood, his family, his estranged wife, his boyhood sweetheart. Over the course of the film, Borg's life is reconstructed before our eyes, and through HIS eyes, we see our own questions being asked, our own tribulations being explored.The film has its share of many typical Bergman trademarks: psychology, existential angst, questions of the existence of God, strange dream sequences, feelings of loneliness, and an exploration of the apparent meaninglessness of life. But at the same time, the film has a warmth that you don't often get from Bergman, as well as glimmers of hope, a sense that maybe all isn't lost after all.The acting is solid throughout, and the performance delivered by Sjöström is particularly touching, portraying a tired, trouble man, struggling with his own stubborn, judgmental, alienating tendencies.I've seen many Bergman films since I first saw "Wild Strawberries", and he's come to be one of my favorite directors, but to this day, "Wild Strawberries" is my favorite of his films. To me, it's one of his most cohesive, well-conceived, clearly executed films, and its impact survives repeated viewings. I recommend it highly, especially to people who are new to Bergman, or who watched another of his films and weren't impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychological masterwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our world filled with adverts and illusions hardly occurs to remark the old age of man. Deep within a reality where beauty and carnal desires take over, seldom is there room for elderly people. Would an old person make for a good leading character in the jungle of muscled idols? In fact, more than 50 years ago the master director of Swedish origin, Ingmar Bergman, proved that to be possible. An old man, Isak Borg (Victor Sjostrom) with his rich experience and subtle psyche is able to win viewers' hearts, is capable of inviting us to join him in the journey through his life, to shed a tear sometimes, to laugh a bit when needed in order to learn modesty and ask for forgiveness... That is the uniqueness of the greatly psychological picture I have seen and would never forget - WILD STRAWBERRIES.Let me first look deeper at the idea of the content as it appears, rightly so, that there are no useless aspects in this masterful film. The old professor Isak Borg is presented to us before the credits as a very intellectual pedant. He has a family but...they go on existing in the photos that we see on his desk rather than in mutual understanding and good co-existence. Soon, the elderly professor invites us deeper into his inner worlds: he has a dream filled with thrill, symbols, angst odd mystery and... as he wakes up, we encounter his outside world, people around him... What begins is a long journey he sets for with his daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin) from the capital city to the cathedral of Lund where he is to receive the honorary doctorate. What a privilege! Yet, he does not see it this way. It does not occur to satisfy him much. There is something else he longs for in the depth of his mind. All the tension is about to fill our imagination when they stop at the old mansion, the very spot where Isak played as a child, spent lovely days of youth, the youth full of dreams, achievements and losses...He starts to live his life again within his memory, all images and stream of events are so clear, all the people so close, including the beautiful love of his life, Sara (Bibi Andersson) and the whole family with cute twins who cannot learn to speak only when spoken to and deaf uncle Aron who indeed loves the song. The past blends with the presence, dreams with reality, memories with fantasies...The psychology is expressed throughout the film from the Freudian aspect of angst, dreams, desires to the very development of reconciliation and forgiveness. The images combined with sounds and symbols (consider for instance the dream sequence) leave a powerful impact in each viewer. The strange combination between events and people resembles a truly genuine insight into the psyche of the character, into his interior worlds and the exterior world. Here, I should add that everything seems to be, on the one hand, individual, on the other hand, deeply rooted within the fascinating country - Sweden, its landscape, its atmosphere and its society. Doesn't this journey through Sweden symbolize it in a way? But now let me focus on one man who makes the film a true rarity.The great psychology manifested in the film is possible to achieve thanks to the leading performance of Victor Sjostrom (the great Swedish actor and silent director - just to mention his PHANTOM CARRIAGE which had overwhelmed Bergman himself). Sjostrom does a marvelous job, he occurs to be unique and powerful and, at the same time, the most convincing and transcendent. He seems to represent his character's feelings in the most astonishing and authentic manner. Seldom do we find such a flawless performance. Here, what is left to me is just quote the director of the film, Ingmar Bergman, who said: "Sjostrom's face shone, it emanated light - a reflection of a different reality, hitherto absent. His whole appearance was soft and gentle, his glance joyful and tender. It was like a miracle."The supporting cast also constitute a very authentic development of different psyches within the professor's exterior world. Just to mention Bibi Andersson who plays Sara, the woman who meant most in Isak's life, yet the woman whom he lost. Gunnar Bjornstrand does a fine job as Isak's desperate son, Evald. His despair combined with sophisticated psyche emanates from the screen. It is the woman, Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), who finds striking similarity between him and his father. Except for others, a mention must be made of Naima Wifstrand who portrays Isak's cold mother. Ms Wifstrand, who was once a queen of the operettas in Stockholm, highlights the most memorable aspects of a reclusive bitterness and coldness of her character. Besides, I think that Professor's housewife is another character that needs special attention. She symbolizes the opposite aspect of a psyche, someone in contrast with the Professor: not a great intellect but rather simplicity. She is so angry with him due to some minor obstacles, but, finally, respects him in the solemnity at Lund...All in all, WILD STRAWBERRIES is a timeless masterwork of psychology, a film that will capture you, absorb you to the very core no matter if you are young or elderly. It is also a wonderful lesson of life, of old age that has its angst, its regret, its bitterness, perhaps, but also the dignity of inner beauty that does not require much from the exterior world: just a heartfelt smile, a nice word or a beautiful song of love sung in your youthful enthusiasm. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very satisfying; a coming to terms with one's life near its close</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night, at our monthly film series "Great Films @ the Cathedal," we showed Ingmar Bergman's "Wild Strawberries." This film is one of his early films that propelled Bergman's recognition by his peers as one of the greatest and influential film directors of all time. It's a psychological drama about a Swedish physician (Dr. Isak Borg), later a professor, coming to terms with his life in his elder years: his mistakes, weaknesses, his successes, his strengths.Knowing Bergman's life in the family in which he grew up helps one better understand both this film as well as his others. Bergman's mother was a fairly strong-willed nurse while his father was also strong-willed and a very strict Lutheran pastor who later was appointed pastor to the King of Sweden. Bergman's father was punitive with his son, e.g., putting him in a dark closet for hours as a young child as a reaction to any wrong he considered his son had done. Young Ingmar was entranced by the stained glass in his father's churches -- their saints, angels, devils, scenes from Biblical stories. Ingmar's father and mother did NOT have a comfortable, happy marriage. One sees echoes of these experiences in the issues, the traits and behaviors of the characters Bergman gives us as both a scriptwriter and film director.Bergman described how the germ of this "WS"'s narrative came to him while he was driving across Sweden and passing through the town in which he grew up. He imagined going to homes in which he'd once lived--opening the door and observing life and his relatives as they had been and then, after a bit--exiting through the door back to life in the present. So this device (plus some troubling dreams) is used to help jolt his main character, Dr. Borg, into reassessing his attitudes and behavior.My explorations of my own family plus my work as a family therapist helped me appreciate this movie very much. One sees ample instances of how some of these traits are transmitted and cascade through the generations. The tone at the end of the film is largely satisfying to most. Our group unanimously thought "WS" ranked among the very best of the best films we've seen this season.Victor Sjöström, a renowned Swedish film director and former actor who played Dr. Borg, was in somewhat precarious health throughout the filming and died not long after completing this film.FWIW, the title "Wild Strawberries" refers to a scene in the movie in which a young woman goes to a patch of little known wild strawberries to pick some as a succulent gift for a relative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is simply universally great, just because it deals with life's extremely important questions: How to deal with disappointments in life? How to overcome them? How to find beauty in every day? How to fill the inner emptiness? It reminds us that the family should always be a major factor in our lives and if create distance to the family, our lives will get cold. It is the mastery of Bergman who brings this questions to life, to visualize the fears of the protagonist. Even the old professor, who lived his live in emotional isolation seems to find his peace by exploring the memories about his family and resolving existing conflicts. Well I always thought that memories will vanish like "tears in rain", but no, since this movie I know that my memories about my family are there to bring me peace and joy. Simply a great movie and must see for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About thirty years ago I was totally into art films. I went to college film festivals and art theaters. It was an experience. Unfortunately, I was a little too wet behind the ears to have the proper appreciation. I am now retracing my steps and watching these films again, and now I'm seeing why they've withstood the test of time. This is a tremendous film with so much humanity and so much sadness. It's about all of us who have lived out lives a bit thoughtlessly. I think of Kurosawa's "Ikiru" as an example of the ultimate in that category. The good doctor has all he can do to make his way to receive an honorary degree. He brings along his daughter-in-law who really doesn't like him mostly because of what he has done to make his son a cynical, harsh man. He has been beset by dreams with faceless men and handless clocks, where time stands still. He is terrified. As we go along we realize that time often does heal and when we repress what really bothers, we flatten out the rough edges. On the long drive, human beings do what they often do. They begin to forgive and understand. If the doctor is an old inflexible being, it becomes obvious that he has had enough when his daughter-in-law levels with him. He begins to draw up his past for review. He sees that his basic sterility was as destructive as if he had been cruel. The deciding factor is a group of kids going to Italy. The travelers pick them up and their infectious youth begins to come to the fore. They begin to offer new insights to the two unhappy people. There is so much in this movie that I can't begin to tell all here. Let the real critics do that, but this is ultimately about how we need to forgive and forget and let life into us. There are some wonderful religious arguments that are, thankfully, never resolved. Everyone is put to the test and the movie teaches us some valuable lessons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too often, I think, movies get caught up with exploring negative topics: crime, evil or disturbed people, dark family secrets. Any kind of positive message or happy ending is written off as a fake Hollywood Ending. In "Wild Strawberries", Ingmar Bergman reminds us a film can be positive and uplifting yet not seem the least bit hokey, and that's what I'm most thankful for when it comes to this film."Wild Strawberries" has a simple enough plot: an aging professor, full of regrets about his life, travels across Sweden (to the surprise of his maid and son, who had his day planned for him) on his way to a ceremony in honor of him. On his way he goes places and meets people who bring out positive and negative memories about his life, and all the while he is having haunting dreams. All of this results in a sweet yet powerful message delivered with a crescendo in the closing moments of the film. If a movie is to have a clear message, this is certainly a fine way to do it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where the heart is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An elderly Professor of Medicine is due to collect a lifetime achievement award at Lund University in Sweden. The night before, he has a wicked dream - laced with typical Bergman symbolism. He awakes early - partly perturbed, partly bemused - and decides to take a long, scenic route to the University, in his car, bypassing places of his youth.His daughter-in-law joins him for a lift and they set off by themselves, leaving his long serving housekeeper somewhat agitated. Along the way, they come into contact with different types of people, stopping at times for a rest. The Professor falls asleep on more than one occasion, and it is during his dreams - which unlike the one at the start of the film, now seem to be retracted memories - that he begins to chip away at the ice cover around his heart.The end may come rather suddenly for some, but if you have been feeling the gist of the story as it has progressed this likely will not be the case.Another thing which some people may not like is the black and white photography. Those people would be wise to still give this film a chance - mainly because of the way Bergman can handle this particular medium: there is none of the stuffiness or atmospheric smothering that misuse of black and white brings; the sky does look bright, the youth's skin does look full of youthfulness.Keep in mind this is not a film that overbears it's message; concentrate on it from start to finish and you may just learn something of yourself.</fullReview>

It really touched me, maybe because i am just in the phase of '37 which means reevaluating your entire life. And this really showed me how could i end, if i don't pay attention (means stays here in Sweden - no offense meant, simply other culture). generally this is a miracle movie which will work above the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman's rich, deceptive masterpiece (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Wild Strawberries' is the account by a 78-year old man of a day spent on the road with his unhappy daughter-in-law and three young hitch-hikers, as he travels to receive an honorary doctorate for 50 years service as a doctor, scientist and inventor. The film is full of bitterness and unhappiness - Marianne has left her emotionally congealed husband because he refuses to inflict a baby on the world (that old chestnut); they crash into and give a lift to a married couple who seem like refugees from a latter Bergman movie, lacerating in a sado-masochistic relationship. Isak Borg has a series of dreams and memories pointing out the emotional failures of his life. And yet the movie ends on a note of tranquillity and tentative reconciliation. all the old doom and gloom stuff that riddled earlier Bergman movies - God, death etc. - is wonderfully parodied in the figures of two male hitch-hikers whose metaphysical boxing matches sublimate frustrated desire for the third.With hindsight, we can refract 'Strawberries' through the lens of its sister picture, Bergman's last masterpiece 'Fanny and Alexander'. In 'Strawberries', and old man looks back at his life, filmed by a young man; in 'Fanny', Bergman himself is the old man looking back at his youth. As with 'Fanny', not everything in this film is as it seems, and as with all Bergman films, what seems to be narratively transparent is actually a labyrinth strewn with mines for the unwary viewer.We should remember at all times that 'Strawberries' doesn't unfold on an objective 'realistic' level, but is a memoir shaped by an old man with certain vested interests. Early on, his daughter-in-law accuses him of being an egoist behind his old-world charm, and we should remember this when faced with a resolution that seems to be brought about by his good offices. It is significant that Borg's reputation - for either goodness or failure - is not shown or proven to the audience, but discussed and analysed by other characters, both in the real life story and in the dreams and memories (i.e. he is analysing himself). In the very process at which he is supposed to be enlightening himself about his life's failure, he remains absent from life, a detached observer, not reaping emotional reward or pain because he has put himself mentally above them (literally, as a man lying alone in bed). The movement of the film is actually quite negative. The film is that rare thing, a European road movie. Whereas the American variant is usually a journey into the unknown, the future, a journey of progress, Europe cannot offer that freedom, it is too small, too cluttered, too marked by history. So a European road movie, while seeming to go forward, is actually a journey backwards into the past. The physical landscape through which Borg drives is also a mental landscape, as he passes crucial personal landmarks, the summer house in which he was 'betrayed' by his fiancee, his mother's house, the petrol station whose owners he once helped. Bergman is used to playing with layers of narrative reality, muddying the boundaries of dreams, wishes, reality etc. At the first stop, the summer house, Borg transforms, through memory, a physical landscape into the world of the past, as he watches his fiancee seduced by his brother, the key moment in his life that seemed to deaden him emotionally. This isn't even memory - he wasn't there - it is a projection, an imposing of his fantasy, his will on a truth he will never access. He is brought back to 'reality' by a young woman. Except this woman is played by the same actress as the one who played his fiancee, and they share the same name. this may be coincidence, or it may be part of the defence mechanism of a man who killed human contact with logic, the very logic with which he is writing this memoir we're watching, providing the redemption in which we're expected to believe (later, the petrol shop owners, in a real-world scene, are far too young to remember kindness from decades previously, suggesting narrative boundaries well and truly erased). This is before any of the 'official' dream sequences. There is a logic, a progression. The film begins with a dream, where an old man sees his own death, having ordered his life in such a way that he remains alone, like his dad (Oedipal resonances not just in his dad's handless watch, but the blind eyes as a sign under it), and ends with a dream, with an old man returning to his birth, the sight of his father and mother, his younger self non-existent. The point before betrayal, before the messiness of life. Borg finds tranquillity in a dream of non-being. if this is happiness, reconciliation, peace, than God help us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spellbinding and a viscerally stimulating piece of art by Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wild Strawberries", or Smultronstället (the original title), was one of two absolute gems Ingmar Bergman wrote in 1957, the other being The Seventh Seal. In both films, we witness the journey of a disillusioned man in pursuit of life satisfaction, an explanation to their existence. We are then introduced to a series of flashbacks, which will reveal a great deal about how they have been shaped into who they have become.The story is of aging professor Dr. Isak Borg and his feelings of remorse near the end of his life compelling him to seek out answers or at least some type of meaning. "I hate resentful people" he ironically mutters, though we are given the brief impression that it is all people he despises. As he travels to Lund with his disarmingly candid daughter-in-law, Marianne, to accept an honorary degree, he will encounter both people and places that will elicit memories, both the good and the bad, of his past, as we watch his feelings of melancholy gradually morph into the affirmation of life in which he was always searching for.So much of "Wild Strawberries" is, at its core, extraordinarily nuanced, with each new experience revealing another layer of our grouchy protagonist. "The place where wild strawberries grow", he gaily reminisces about at the film's beginning. I like to believe that, like 'Rosebud' in Citizen Kane, the wild strawberries serve as an emblem of the innocence in our youth, a memory that evokes hope and sheer joy, parts of life that many people will, as they grow older, seek to regain in some form or another.This film had me in a complete lost for words. It is able to connect with you on such an emotional, profoundly deep level beyond explanation. The cinematography is done with such care, with each detail almost emerging with a consciousness of its own. There is so much life in every frame, whether it being in the forest, the wild strawberry field. The acting and direction is subtle and true-to-life, as we feel that we are witnessing the telling of a genuine life story rather than observing a film. It is, in simplest terms, pure cinematic art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An existential road movie through life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie takes the audience through life, it makes us reflect on ourselves, it forces to reconsider our path. We see Isak, an old doctor who, on his way of receiving a honorary award, is confronted with his entire life, and the way that life changed him. He realizes that he aid his selfishness with loneliness, and that time took away his joy to live. The characters of Isak's mother, on one side, and Marianne and Evald on the other, remind us that this drama is recurrent in every human life, like a self-repeating prophecy that haunts all generations: Is it worth living? Should we even bother bringing new creatures to this meaningless world? How can we avoid falling into the trap of loneliness eventually?On their trip to Lund, Isak and Marianne pick up two very different groups of people. First, there's Sara, Viktor and Anders; young, happy, and cheerful. They are still innocent and worried about the existence of God and the beauty of art. Then, they pick up a bitter married couple that are constantly arguing with each other. These passengers mirror Isak's stages in life, from his cheerful youth to an already cynical marriage, the path that Marianne and Evald also seem to be taking. It is meaningful, then, that Marianne forces the married couple to leave the car. In the end, what prevails is the desire to live happily.Though, like all Bergman's movies, the plot moves a bit too slowly for modern audiences' taste, this should not overshadow the depth of this movie, so rarely found in today's cinema. Wild Strawberries is an insightful movie that brings us all to the bottom of human existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reflections of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a quiet film, with an old man reflecting back on his life as he travels to an awards ceremony with his daughter-in-law. It may sound too sedate to hold one's interest, but it does. Through dream sequences filled with symbolism and dialog with people he meets along the way, we get a picture painted of his life, its key moments, and how he evolved over time. We see the common thread ? his serious, intelligent, considerate, yet cool and judgmental personality ? and how that made him a very successful doctor, but created difficulties in his personal life. We see how he lost the real love of his life when she was picking wild strawberries and his own more passionate brother pursued her, and how his subsequent marriage to another was plagued with strife and his wife's infidelity. We see how this carried down to his son, his unhappy childhood, his depression, and the difficulty he has in his own marriage. We also see the perils of old age, seeing death coming, being sentimental, and fearing becoming obsolete. We see that despite his brilliant career and the very prestigious award he's just been given, the most meaningful, happy moment in his life was simply fishing on a peaceful day with his father, a sentiment which has a 'Rosebud' feel to it.The film is not heavy or hard to watch and just enjoy Bergman's storytelling, but at the same time it does have a weightiness to it - in recalling the soul-crushing moments of sadness in life, in his sentimental reflections of his childhood, in his weighing in on two younger men's debate about God's existence ("I see His traces wherever flowers bloom"), and as he thinks about his mortality. Some comic relief is provided in his relationship with housekeeper, who brings a smile when she leaves her door ajar as she goes to bed in case he "wants anything", after having bickered with him for the entire movie (and presumably decades of their lives).I don't see the film as being optimistic or pessimistic, or as much 'warmer' than his other work, though other viewers certainly seem to and there are moments of charm, such as when the young woman of the three he gives a ride to talks to him, asks him for advice, and sweetly says she loves him as they part. Bibi Andersson played both this role and the role of the girl in the strawberry patch that he lost, which has a certain symmetry and renewal to it. However, I think the movie is realistic and balanced, with just as much bittersweetness as sweetness ? even the married couple they nearly get into a car accident with make endless snide comments about one another ? and its genius is in showing us truths about life that are common to us all.While the movie doesn't preach or overtly push a message, you realize just how hard it is to lead a virtuous, positive life without regrets - and reflect on your own life, where you place priorities, how you treat people, whether you appreciate the small moments, or recognize the pivotal ones ? all the things that you will probably remember at the end. Great art does this, spur reflection, and that's the case with 'Wild Strawberries'. Don't believe all the hype, but at the same time, don't be intimidated either ? this would be a good one to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sweet Smell of Sorrow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman is the quintessential, existential filmmaker. To me, he is the black angel of cinematic death, and please, I mean that in the best way possible. He's most famous for attempting to answer the questions that all of us want answered. What is the meaning of life? What happens when we die? Is there a god? Is there a heaven or a hell? Bergman is always asking these questions in his film, and always, does he find interesting answers and hypothesis formed by these questions. He uses his actors and his framing abilities to help drive home the main idea of these films, and thus, his movies are notoriously not very hard to understand. Most importantly, he has an ability to make us understand the answers, and to help us understand ourselves. Bergman is an introspective filmmaker by definition, and because of that, his films have become so cherished and remembered for being so. In a period slightly before his heyday, no film makes a better example of his unique cinematic mission than "Wild Strawberries""Wild Strawberries" focuses on an elderly professor, Dr. Isak Borg, who lives by himself with his common-law wife in Stockholm. After a lifelong journey of achieving greatness in himself and academia, he has been invited to Lund University to receive an honorary degree. He gets in a car with his daughter-in-law, Marianne, and together they travel to Lund. Through the travel, Isak is haunted by his own thoughts and dreams that have accumulated after years of isolation and reflection. At the not-so-ripe age of 78, Isak want's to understand what led him to this strange point of his life, where he went wrong, and what on Earth will happen next? He is remembered of the place of his childhood, where the wild strawberries grew. A time when he romanced his young, beautiful cousin, Sara, before being stolen from him by his older, arrogant brother Sigfrid. Before going on the trip, he has a vivid, terrible nightmare of being old, as a dead body follows him through a city street and a hearse crashed in front of him, revealing a clone of himself in a casket. Through the ways of the trip, and through the hitchhikers he meets along the way, his mind keeps racing and the dreams of his past and future keep following him. The journey becomes so strenuous and visceral to his memory, that by the time he arrives at his destination, his psyche is entirely cleansed, and he is greeted with the memory of a peaceful fishing trip with his family. What Bergman is doing here is experimenting with time and space, through memory and reflection. His style reminds me of "Hiroshima Mon-Amour", considering that there is no clear pattern between what happens in the moment, and what happens in the past. Bergman is giving us a deconstructed narrative that in essence, gives us a clear indication of the kind of crisis that Isak is going through. As a man that has been through everything and nothing, his mind is racing, much like our own, of scenarios that did and didn't happen. This is quite an interesting introspective device that Bergman uses. He is making movies about people, the exact way that we think about each other. Bergman typically uses characters that wrestle with their own identity, and bravely ask questions that might have no answers. Thus, it doesn't take much interpretation of the audience to understand, because all of the questions and answers are presented on screen. "Wild Strawberries" is a very entertaining, beautiful piece to that effect. The entire time, I was haunted, confused, and rightfully engaged with Isak and the characters he meets. My favorite scene of the film is the nightmare at the beginning. The surrealism of this section is frightening and so wonderfully imaginative. I loved the giant eyeglasses that appeared over his head, as well as the dead man with no face that appears to him in the middle of the street. Bergman was really experimenting with some wonderful visual concepts, especially for the 1950's. I thought the acting, was also very real and interesting to watch. Bergman was always known to be a director for actors, and in this film especially, he makes his actors play these characters as real people, not merely as stage personas. What we get because of that is a real, frightening portrayal of an older man, and seeing that alone is fascinating. In conclusion, "Wild Strawberries" is a dark and interesting classic about the struggle of understanding our fate, and without question, it should regarded as one of the great films of Ingmar Bergman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I begin this review with an acknowledgement that viewing this film 56 years after it's initial debut has diminished it's impact for me. Some of the techniques, both in story telling and in visual stimuli are very dated. Although I can appreciate the care and attention to detail utilized in the making of the film it does not deliver anything that I have not seen before. Mostly it conveys a familiar message in an time and tradition that may have been ground breaking in it's day but is not now. The photography is beautiful. The characters are not singular in their originality or their behavior. I recognize many of the actors from other Bergman films such as the Magician, The Seventh Seal and the Virgin Spring. This is a nice little movie about an old man reflecting on his past on an important date in his life. Good but not necessarily a classic. Classic in the sense that it is from a classic era of film making and by a heralded director no less but it does not reside in my top 100 movies of all time. Perhaps that opinion is a byproduct of my era? Perhaps it's not. There are other films made before this one that I regard much more highly. Gone with the wind, Double Indemnity, Spellbound, Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Sunrise, Pride of the Yankees, Key Largo and 12 Angry Men are all old films yet they suit my sensibilities better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wild Strawberries" is a drama movie in which we have a man who was loyal to science and in his carrier for all of his life and he never felt love, passion or some emotions from someone else. Because of his work he will be granted an honorable title and because this ceremony will take place in another city he decides to go by car and not with airplane as he had planned before. And everything will change in this trip.I really liked this movie because it shows us how a person's way of thinking and even feeling can change due to some facts or incidents that take place. In addition to this we can observe that because of some incidents or because of some people and the conversations that we have with them can change many things to us or we will reconsider some decisions that we had took. Ialso liked this movie because of the plot which I found brilliant. I also believe that the interpretation of Victor Sjöström who played as Dr. Isak Borg was really great and also the interpretation of Ingrid Thulin who played as Marianne Borg was equally good.Finally I have to say that "Wild Strawberries" is a great movie to watch because after watching this movie I am sure that you will start thinking a little bit different. And of course you will reconsider some things that we have as granted and we should not all of us in our lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dr. Isak Borg (Victor Sjostrom) is a complex character that many of us can probably relate to. He is a successful scientist who has made a career for himself and has stayed in it ever since. Isak is a successful man on the outside but he has a cold personality that interfered with the relationship between him and his wife Karin Borg(Gertrud Fridh) and his son Dr. Evald Borg (Gunnar Bjornstrand). Now an elderly man Isak gets up one day to attend an award ceremony in his honor. But as his daughter in law Marianne Borg (Ingrid Thulin) drives him to his destination they make many stops along the way. In each way Isak is reminded of his life. From his childhood to him as an adult. he learns from each stop what his life has meant to people in positive and negative ways. He sees what he has done for science and progress but at the same time is reminded of his own bitterness and coldness. Ingmar Bergman I know has made some really great films but this is by far his best. Dare I say it but it's even better then The Seventh Seal. Bergman shows us a man who has achieved much success but in the process has shut himself outside of his own life. I highly recommend this movie. The acting and story are fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Wild Strawberries (original title: Smultronstället) we follow professor Isak Borg played by the mesmerizing Victor Sjöström. One of the masters of world cinema with a career spanning from 1912 to 1957 as actor and director, here he gives the role of a lifetime. He told Bergman that he was too tired to take the role, then he changed his mind on one stipulation, that the shooting for the day would be over before his daily late afternoon drink. Bergman quickly agreed, and the shooting of the film turned into one of the director's most fond memories. Sjöström's professor undertakes a journey both by car and spiritually. Stopping by the place where he picked wild strawberries as a youth, his memories come flooding back. For the rest of the movie the story interweaves between the present and the memories of the moments that have most shaped his life. On his journey from Stockholm to Lund, he also meets several characters that perfectly fit in with his memories and his questions to himself. At the end of the journey Isak comes to a conclusion, a change must come. Is it too late? Everyone should watch this movie.</fullReview>

Wild Strawberries is about of a man's journey from isolation and coldness to a resurge in his life, Wild Strawberries is just a beautiful movie with some valuable lessons. Victor Sjostrom plays Professor Isak Borg whose has led a life of isolation. The entirety of the movie takes place in a day with flashbacks of the life that he has led. He is on the way to receive a degree from the University of Lund. The movie is essentially about viewing the life you have led and realizing that it is never too late to change your ways. Bibi Andersson plays Sara a cousin he was to marry. Borg dreams about visiting the Sara from his dreams while out picking strawberries. Borg's brother gropes Sara and this breaks Borg's heart. The whole movie is full of hidden metaphors and subtext about regrets and happiness in life that everyone experiences. The beautiful Ingrid Thulin plays Mariana, the wife of Borg's son who travels with Borg to Lund. She initially has hatred and bitterness towards Borg but eventually gets to like him; this is an uplifting sub-plot in the duration of the movie. I believe that the message that Bergman was trying to convey is done so very well in this film in that it make us feel the many different and various feelings that are portrayed in the movie such as forgiveness. Wild Strawberries is yet another masterpiece from Ingmar Bergman that is told in such a uplifting and beautiful manner.</fullReview>

After living a life marked by coldness, an aging professor is forced to confront the emptiness of his existence during a journey across Sweden to receive his honorary degree, filled with flashbacks and dream sequences. The market throughout the dead centre years of the 20th century offered the world a considerably large collection of epic-style films orientating around the subjects of introspection, recollection of past lives and regret from all corners of the atlas. As you'd expect it just so happened to become the case that Bergman's finest hour is the gold standard of such an exploit: its sombre tone from the word go mixed with the melodic Swedish-language screenplay make for a truly moving, thought provoking and memorable feature film which explores the aforementioned facets of seasoned-to-misery ageing protagonist Dr Isak Borg (Victor Sjöström). Laced with flashbacks that remain deeper, more beautiful and more poetic throughout than those of its rivals, Bergman guides Smultronstället with his steady and knowledgeable hand through a Viennese waltz of charming and calming rhetoric and retrospect of dear thought and organisation. When writing about Smultronstället, one has to mention the famous dream sequence, where Borg travels through an empty city: with broken clocks, paper thin faces and a chilling atmosphere that really establishes Smultronstället as not solely a homely film of no distress. The flashbacks provide an insight into the exquisitely crafted life of the many-faced protagonist, funnel towards a cumulative emotional impact of this simple, powerful story and its probing revelation of human character, desire, and chagrin. My grandmother, an immigrant from Sweden, translated a version of Smultronstället and it has remained her personal jewel throughout the years for a fraction of the reasons I've mentioned. On top of its emotional amicability and the journey it shows us into the reminiscent mind of a fascinating character, it shows us moreover an equally brilliant journey through Southern Sweden in its aesthetic glory, with the black and white lens never subtracting from it, until we reach Borg's 'smultronstället', literally translated as wild strawberry patch or 'a place of sentimental meaning'. Never has a lovelier journey been created and realised, with such brutal honesty, a revelation of a life lived of mixed emotions and receptions, and incomparable dream sequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw my first Bergman picture and it was beautiful. Both acting and formal arrangement of the story are fantastic in my opinion. Opposed to the majority of films that I have seen that piece by Bergman really touched me even though I have not understood many of the underlying conflicts. In spite of the difficulty and seriousness of the topics dealt with in this film one does not feel depressed or empty towards the end of the film. I guess this is because of the artistic brilliance evoked by the actors and the camera. I am not familiar with film analysis and I won't go into formal details for that reason. I am grateful to Bergman for the film because it makes you realize that all the hardship and heaviness of love and facing oneself is in a way natural and a universal task that everyone seeking for these things has to accept. I am still quite young and naive but I believe that love in one form or the other might be that one idea that can sort of tame that inner longing or drive for other things or beings, which could not be stopped otherwise. Thanks to people like Bergman I realize that misery and all the other negative feelings one can think are more part of the process than something one has to avoid as good as possible. I enjoy beauty and that film was just that. My favorite shot was the close up of Isak's face staring at the moon after he saw Sara, the love of his life and his brother Sigfrid happily in their share living room. The shot made me feel so much compassion for that man...</fullReview>

Although I watched this movie in a not so good print, it did not make a great difference, because the movie itself was mind blowing. Even though the story-line is not very thrilling, yet it keeps you in its grip. You wont get bored for a second while watching it, at least I didn't. The acting done by the cast is also pretty good. You would feel as if you are there experiencing it yourself. It contains scenes of both emotions and comedy. The movie just flows on and keeps you in wonder what will the ending be. Its a soft and a light movie, a perfect piece to end your weekend with. It's a must watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely do films evoke such emotion and nostalgia out of me. Although outdated and set in olden society, many of the themes are prevalent and generally forgotten in society's high tempo. We tend to go through life, completing daily tasks and essentially not living life and enjoying its facets. What is family? Just your reproductive offspring and people you speak with on occasion? What is the purpose of life? To just have fun and enjoy your time on this planet?Wild Strawberries is a commendable film since it displays the inner conflicts we all go through to seek meaning. No one really knows what their time on Earth is for. At the end of the day, will we be satisfied with all we have done and left undone? Movies generally focus on entertainment and try to provide a platform for audiences to enjoy themselves and superficially relate with characters. I truly believe the connection viewers built with Isak was a deeper one since this misunderstood elderly man is just trying to find his way in life like we all are. When we're on our deathbeds and nearing the end of our time, will we be happy with the life and legacy we are leaving behind and ready to go?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Search of Lost Time ... paved by success, but ruled by mistakes ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a poetic coincidence! The night after I finished my second experience of Ingmar Bergman's "Wild Strawberries", I couldn't sleep, invaded by countless thoughts about the purpose of my life, questioning every single choice I had to make since I was given that privilege, and ultimately wondering which path my sentimental life would have taken, had my heart not picked the chosen one. "Wild Strawberries" chronicles a series of occurrences such as melancholic reveries, nightmares, nostalgic reminiscences or real-life encounters during the unforgettable journey of Dr. Isaak Borg, an affable and educated 78-year old physician, who must travel from Stockholm to Lund to receive a Doctoris Jubilaris celebrating the 50th year after his doctorate. From our perspective, there's no doubt that Isaak was and is still an honorable man. Early in the film, he stops at a gas station and a young Max Von Sydow recalls the days when Isaak was a general practitioner, speaking very highly of good old Doctor Isaak Borg.If not a flawless man, Isaak immediately inspires our respect and admiration, and this is a credit to the Swedish veteran actor Victor Sjöström who exudes a powerful mixture of charismatic wisdom and sympathetic shyness. These traits are often branded as coldness by his entourage, but we personally suspect that only a defensive mind, such as his pregnant daughter-in-law Marianne, played by a breathtakingly beautiful Ingrid Thullin, would be so critical of Isaak's manners. However, as the story progresses, and as we get deeper in the relationships between Isaak and his mother, and with his son Ewald, played by the inevitable Gunnar Björnstrand, we realize that maybe, Isaak inherited from his mother (and Ewald from Isaak) this strange capability to inspire defensive mechanisms from the others. And maybe the key of some mistakes that might have undermined his life can only be drained from the well of memories."Wild Strawberries" features an enigma of a man told from the other's perspectives. Given its surrealistic undertones, the film is ahead of its time, but not quite. I found personally ironic that Bergman loathed so much "Citizen Kane" when he unconsciously borrowed some elements from Orson Welles, except that the mystery doesn't focus on a man who's dead, but on a man who contemplates death at the twilight of his life, and wonders which other paths could have brought more happiness in his life. And as a genuine genius, Bergman understood the value of the road-movie format for character studies, that would inspire such memorable movies as "Five Easy Pieces", "Easy Rider", Woody Allen's "Deconstructing Harry" or Alexander Payne's "About Schmidt".The road format is indeed crucial, as if the way that leads to our soul's abysses were like some tortuous roads with as many encounters as there are facets in our personalities. During Isaak's journey's, the most significant moment occurs when he picks up three young hitchhikers among them a lively blonde girl, Sara, played by a young Bibi Anderson. And Papa Isaak (the tender nickname she gives him) grows reciprocally fond of her, thinking back of Sara, her youth's sweetheart, as if she was resurrecting the old sparkle that defined his younger years, or reopened the concealed wound of having let Sara slip from his hands, to one of his cousins.Each scene of "Wild Strawberries" carries a symbolic resonance, an embittered couple reminds of his failed marriage and a sordid episode where he symbolically lost his wife and didn't try to conquer her back, out of guilt or an apathetic weakness, surrendering to the humiliating weight of fatality. The most significant episode of the film is still the titular one, where plunged in a deep meditation, Isaak finds himself in his family cottage at the seaside, with Sara, the girl he used to court in the wild strawberries patch. Ingmar, like Proust for literature, invented a symbol to define the most cherished places of our childhood. Sadly enough, Isaak's cookie-Proust left a bitter taste. And while the pieces of the puzzle are assembled during this unforgettable road trip, Borg's odyssey highlights many aspects of his life and memories, inviting us in retrospect to question the value of our own lives. As usual, in Bergman's films, there are two levels of appreciations, as we follow the story of protagonists, we're tunneled into our own soul and are invited to meditate on the meaning of our lives, even more because we (contrarily to Isaak) can afford hope. And so does Marianne who embodies our perspective and refuses to see her husband inheriting the same traits Isaak took from her mother. Marianne's future is the fresh air that extinguishes some of Isaak's demons. For it is wise to learn from our mistakes, but even wiser and nobler to help other people to learn from ours. And this might be what the 'wild strawberries' stand for, a cinematic metaphor for this state of felicity following a great achievement. As a poet said: it's when you have reached the mountain top, that you shall begin to climb. No doubt that Isaak was finally climbing his way to some peace of mind at the end of the journey."Wild Strawberries" is a humanistic masterpiece inviting us to discover ourselves, to find eternal peace and happiness through our memories. This is not 'inner child' material but a survival move guided by the nihilism induced by life as a linear movement toward death, ruled by mistakes, but paved by achievements, the very tools we use to build a personal history and connect it with our family's, thus contributing to the never-ending transmission of life.If Isaak's experience can contribute to the happiness of his son, his daughter-in-law or a young stranger, his life had a purpose after all... in this vaster scheme driven by the superior forces Ingmar Bergman tried to touch through his Art, like he did, the same year with another masterpiece: "The Seventh Seal".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Smultronstället is not a movie about a plot with many twists and great tragedies. It is a story about an aging man and his journey spiced with the memories and the dreams he witnesses about himself. Ingmar Bergman creates the tension and the feelings from minimum amount of events, from which non remain unnecessary and from a small amount of characters that all have their own personality and place in the movie. The gorgeous Swedish summer gives a life full background and a great contrast to the old professor preparing for his end.Although the movie is definitely not made for everyone's taste due to its minimal action and the very slow storytelling, it is an indescribable strong and wise movie about the aging, youth and the life itself. journey that will help us to gaze back into the past and help us to remember our own wild strawberry patch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film in the early sixties, and still have vivid memories of it. What struck me then was how close Bergman came to evoking the atmosphere of those dreams that linger with us for years or decades. And the atmosphere in which our oldest and most cherished memories are wrapped. Probably the most 'atmospheric' movie I've ever seen. I concur with the reviewer who called it the very, very best. This was my impression as an adolescent -- I look forward to seeing it again when my copy arrives, and re-evaluating it as an old man (like old Isaak).There will, of course always be those who prefer their Quentin Tarantinos, just as there are those who prefer to open their nuts with ten-pound hammers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The road called "life"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The journey that Bergman takes us on vicariously through Wild Strawberries is a road adventure of past experiences and mistakes. Compared to an American road trip film, where the actual adventure lies in self discovery, Wild Strawberries is quite different?instead Bergman permits us into the memories of an old, egocentric man named Dr. Isak Borg who clings to past emotional attachments and his failures.In this film, nostalgia is more or less a "bittersweet" experience. Instead of reminiscing about his childhood and his deceased wife, old and weathered Professor Borg analyzes himself and his past choices negatively. Borg's character challenges the stigma "the older, the wiser" due to his sterile personality and obviously stubborn disposition?he is emotionally unavailable for the majority of the story. However, in contrast, the film as a whole represents the sad and inevitable changes one endures over a lifetime and is amazingly quite human. The film stands alone as incredibly accessible and simplistic in its meaning and content, a film which truly speaks to the audience about coping with mortality, the significance of life, and the importance of the relationship with your loved ones, friends, family, and ultimately yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman made several modern films in the 1950's, which dealt with social issues. He started to build his reputation with The Naked Night (1953) and Summer with Monika (1953). In 1957 Bergman's two films The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries got released. Those films together ensured his place as the most important filmmaker of his time. Ingmar Bergman achieved to create such high reputation that people still today see him as one of the most influential directors of all time. He, as all great artists, managed to create his own unique world vision.Wild Strawberries is about Dr. Isak Borg, an old doctor who goes for a short trip with his car. In result of coincidence, four youngsters join his trip. The trip that lead Isak Borg to the extreme of self-examination. Wild Strawberries is a story of a journey to past, dreams, nightmares, memories, fears and the choices made in life.Ingmar Bergman's films are clearly European modernism, and his films are actually the finest example of it. Its cinematography, narrative and use of light and shadow are very modern. He has defined how to create this kind of atmospheres. He was a true master of cinema. The beautiful themes of Wild Strawberries brilliantly reflect to the cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The art form of life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mere words cannot describe what Ingmar Bergman was capable of with a camera. Certainly from a metaphysical standpoint, his films consist of the the typical images and framing nearly all other films have. Yet, on a spiritual and emotional level, his films are unlike practically any other director's. Not a single film maker today, save Woody Allen, is capable nor willing to tackle the subjects and ideas Bergman so willingly explored.In this film, we have an elderly professor on a journey to receive recognition for his life's work. In a sense, he is on his way to death as this award signifies his life is near the end. He travels by car with his daughter-in-law as well as three youths and begins having strange and powerful dreams and hallucinations. What they mean remains unclear, but what they do to our protagonist is shake to the core his foundation of beliefs. No longer does he fully accept what his past has been or what his life can be summed up as. Now, he must face the inner demons tormenting his subconscious.These were typical themes of Bergman's films and his unique visual style married his ideas perfectly. Moody, bleak cinematography filled with frightful and beautiful images create a powerful atmosphere to plunge us into. For Wild Strawberries, he makes great use of voice-over narration and flashback sequences, using them to fill in the back story as well as create a sense of disillusionment and misdirection with the audience. Many of the professor's dreams either make no sense or seem to have no relevance to the larger arc of the story. The same is true with many dreams we have. Indeed, this whole film could be seen as a dream, but when is he awake and when is he asleep? The purpose of it all is not in the end of the journey, but in the journey itself. Nearly everyone he comes into contact with symbolizes part of his life be it his son and his wife, the young hitchhikers who despair of growing old, or the bickering married couple who have an uncanny resemblance to the professor and his late wife.This is not a film to discuss, rather to watch. Most of Bergman's work is one that must be experienced fully and then talked about afterward. He is certainly one of the most fearless directors ever, never afraid to tackle issues of God, meaning of life and relationships. So many others attempt to do what he does, but none can match his eye for quality nor his mind for intelligent, coherent, philosophical dialogue. In this case, the art form is of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Man reacquires his humanity during a road trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Wild Strawberries" again after 30 years (Traverse City Film Festival) and I was as much affected by it today as I was then. Dr. Isak Borg (Victor Sjöström) is a bitter old man who lost the twinkle in his eye and love of people during 78 years of a hard, but successful life. A domineering stern mother and an unhappy marriage have left him without apparent emotional attachments. A strange dream shakes him out of his routine and he makes a sudden decision to drive to the town (Luund) where he is to receive a high honor. His daughter-in-law, Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), joins him on the journey, but he is totally uninterested in hearing about her problems. On the way to Luund, he decides to stop at an old house where he spent his youth with his 9 siblings. A patch of wild strawberries takes him on a journey in time to his youth when he was madly in love with his cousin Sara (Bibi Andersson). All of a sudden the memories awaken in him the pain of losing Sara and the failed relationship with his wife. The latter memory finds echo in the relationship of a couple that they pick up on the road, but he also meets an old patient Henrik (Max Van Sydow) who thanks Isak for some unspecified kindness in the past. The road crew becomes decidedly interesting when they pick up hitchhikers, a lovely and lively young girl named Sara (Bibi Andersson again) and her two boyfriends. Little by little and in often imperceptible ways we see Dr. Borg soften and become more human. By the journey's end, Isak has come a full circle. He has reconciled with his own past and achieved a kind of peace few are lucky enough to acquire.Victor Sjöström is fabulous as the old man and others are cast perfectly as well; many of whom are usual participants in Ingmar Bergman's adventures. Bibi Andersson looks radiant and it is easy to fall in love with her. Ingrid Thulin's character is also changed by the journey and she goes from being a cold and estranged wife to one who is beginning to understand and like her father-in-law. People taking a "journey" or road trip is a popular theme in films, and this is one of the most effective ones. It sometimes resembles "Midsummer Night's Dream" in its ability to find magic and meaning in the woods. Except for a brief Dali-Hitchcock inspired scene in the beginning, there is nary a false note. It is vintage Bergman.</fullReview>

After the credits, director Ingmar Bergman sets the stage, with a surrealistic nightmare. Then, his subtly haunting drama unfolds? "Smultronstället" aka "Wild Strawberries" is a uniquely beautiful Bergman piece.

		<fullReview>Watching Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries for the first time was an interesting experience because of three reasons. One, the film itself is terrific. Two, I watched it the same night as the 2006 Academy Awards, and was struck by how Bergman's film never condescends to its viewer, unlike the major nominated Politically Correct films Hollywood churns out and rewards. Three, having always known of Bergman from the films of American filmmaker Woody Allen, I was struck at just how much Allen steals from Bergman in many of his films- from camera angles and techniques, to outright theft of scenes. Not that I am accusing Allen of wrongdoing, for T.S. Eliot basically admitted that if an artist is to steal, they should steal from the greats, and Bergman crafted a great film, rife for purloining, back in 1957.The story the film tells is rather simple- it's a road film that journeys into the past and psyche of a retired widower and Professor of Medicine named Isak Borg (Victor Sjöström). Sjöström was apparently a greatly influential actor and director in the first few decades of Swedish cinema, but by 1957 had spent a decade or more in declining reputation. This film and role sealed his immortality. It is a great performance, and one which a lesser actor could easily have gone over the top with. There is a perfect modulation to not only his performance, but to every aspect of the film, starting with Bergman's stellar screenplay. I would be hard pressed to think of a great film, or even a good one, that lacks a good screenplay. This is one of the ironies of film, versus the other visual arts- it's almost wholly dependent upon an art form, writing, with an entirely different paradigm.Bergman was wise to have his film clock in at a mere hour and a half. It is a small, personal film, despite its cosmic undertones and themes. In a sense it balances the best of the dramas of Shakespeare and Chekhov, which is where the plays of Ibsen and Strindberg, Bergman's two greatest claimed influences, reside. He also wisely fills the detritus of Borg's life with symbolism that others- in the film or out- can interpret, but to Borg are just there. In a sense, the most important scene in the film, the one which acts as a fractal refraction of the whole film, is that where Borg and his mother pick through the old box of children's things as Marianne looks coldly on, misinterpreting both mother and son for her own reasons. For this reason, Wild Strawberries stands out not only as a great piece of cinema, but its screenplay as a great piece of literature. And given the multivalence of such art as this, to skillfully combine great imagery with great storytelling in a poetic vein, it's no wonder that film has become the dominant art form of the last half century, supplanting the novel and painting, just as they had supplanted poetry and the romance. Let me end this essay where I began, lamenting the greatness of this film juxtaposed with the supposedly 'great' films that Hollywood proffered for Oscars this year. It is like comparing a rich, diverse banquet with a greasy bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Period. One of the complaints that I have always found valid about great art is how it is usually always too expensive for the average person to enjoy- be it paintings in swank galleries, small books of poetry several times the price of novels, outrageously priced theater and opera tickets, or even foreign films on video or DVD. This was one of the major reasons it took me so long to watch this film, because the DVD I purchased, from The Criterion Collection, retails for $39.95, while your average Hollywood blockbuster can retail for a third that, or less. Is it any wonder, then, that the masses choose swill to fill their free time? In the name of raising up the filmic awareness and appreciation for the great films of the past, foreign or domestic, like Wild Strawberries, I urge companies that distribute foreign films to do their best to make good quality DVDs of such classics available more cheaply, for there is a market to be filled with great affordable art, and once a taste of greatness is given, the market will only expand, and justify the demotic impulse to lower prices with an increased quantity of sales making up for loss of high profit margins per unit. Dover Thrift Editions in America, and Wordsworth Editions in the U.K. have proved that great books cheaply distributed is an economically viable strategy, and I believe the same is true for great films. Why should films like Wild Strawberries remain only in the province of film snobs, and not made available to compete for viewership with contemporary schlock like Brokeback Mountain or Crash simply for economic reasons? Greatness in art may exact a price from its creators, but price should not diminish art's reach. Great films like Wild Strawberries deserve to be freed to the masses, to be enjoyed and enlightened. Watch it and you will agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Victor Sj"ostr"om (1879-1960) is just the right age for this portrayal of a clinically objective and emotionless doctor who is traveling on the road to receive a pointedly "honorary" and therefore non-academic award.Bergman has introduced a social comment and conflict quite early on:an argument with Isak's housekeeper; youth and age;life and death, and the marital disputes between his daughter-in-law ( whose divine looks outshine both Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor) and his son,plus the abrasive husband who riles his wife mercilessly so much just after being rescued from a collision that they are asked,not by him,but by the daughter-in law to leave the car. The grotesque dream where a hearse containing his double symbolically disintegrates and so on, has been mentioned. The doctor dreams on during the journey: he is scientifically detached when his (now long dead) wife is assaulted by a stranger;there are surrealistic vignettes of a garden where wild strawberries are spilled,or a dinner where they are eaten,all fifty or more years earlier.The contrast between golden youth...more Swedish blonde goddesses...is marked when his aged features gaze on childhood scenes. Perhaps the examination scene in a medical students' class sums it up: he is ineffective,is weighed and found wanting. His son,stiff,upright,resembling Scandinavian royalty is also estranged from his wife because of her revelation of an early pregnancy. In a final rejection he cannot even presume first names with his housekeeper who insists on standing,very uprightly for her years,on her professional dignity. In order to perceive the nuances,this existential film of Bergman's about what might be miscalled the "Categorial imperatives" requires certainly more than one viewing. Look for Max von Sydow as a Texaco gas station attendant. They are all four-dimensional characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since I first saw Wild Strawberries, like with The Seventh Seal, Fanny and Alexander and Cries and Whispers, I was blown away by how well made and thought provoking it was(it is one of his more accessible films too). Ingmar Bergman's direction as ever is superb, there is a certain warmth to how he composes and conveys everything. Wild Strawberries looks gorgeous, it is beautifully shot with atmospheric lighting and scenery. It isn't a Bergman film either without memorable images, and Wild Strawberries has those certainly. Some people may find the symbolism of the nightmares with the handless clocks and runaway hearses somewhat overpowering, I didn't think so, I found them very haunting and even fascinating to watch. It is the more beautiful images where Wild Strawberries really drew me in, the memories of the idyllic summers are among Bergman's most beautiful and finest moments. The score fits perfectly, while the script is incredibly thought-provoking, and the story contrasts innocence with the expectancy of youth with bitterness with the regrets of old age very movingly. Victor Sjöström is on magisterial form being both frosty and vain as his character seizes the chance for redemption. Overall, one of Bergman's finest, a wonderful film in all regards. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

Early in the film, Isak has an apparition within a dream and the small events leading up to it, within the dream, are quite brilliant. Throughout the rest of the film there are dreams and recollections; newly discovered secrets of the past that Isak sees for the first time. As he says in the film, "Dreams, as if I must tell myself something I won't listen to when I'm awake." How Bergman shows us the characters is terrific. It's a like a relaxed puzzle that doesn't emphasize any sort of urgency to figure things out. The story unfolds beautifully as we get a deeper sense of Isak, who I assume is an alter ago of Ingmar Bergman at that stage of his life (he was thirty-nine when the film was released).It pains me to know that the majority of people my age would rather watch an Adam Sandler movie or "The Rock" than something like this. Hey, I liked "Big Daddy" and I love Nicolas Cage, but "Wild Strawberries" is one of the few films I've seen that could possibly change the way I live my life. I'm always interested in listening to what aged people have to say about their own life because, well, it can only give me tips about my own, and that's what this film does in a way.There is one sequence in the film that is frightening and "arty," and I don't completely grasp what it means beyond Isak's deterioration and his realization of how people actually feel towards him (he's told earlier in the film as well, but he seems to accept this "verdict" more readily), but it doesn't take away from the film; rather, it's an interesting addition to an otherwise satisfying experience. In fact, it's probably the most vital part of the movie -- Isak may not like it, bbut once he gets past it, he has the option to develop.I don't know if the film is a masterpiece -- it's my introduction to Bergman, so once I see "Cries and Whispers," "Fanny and Alexander," "Persona" and "The Seventh Seal" (if I can get through it, this time) I'll come back to this film with a new perspective, or at least see it as a part of Bergman's whole. I do think this is a great film of its type. It's the kind of film that may require viewings every five or so years, as a sort of reminder.Pauline Kael once said that she didn't think much of Bergman because she'd done her share of soul-wrestling and it wasn't that difficult. The film isn't as challenging as I was expecting it to be, in fact, it's a walk in the park. It's pleasant and rich and beautiful, and the title seems perfect after you've seen the film. It's all about wild strawberries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman Speaks to the Big Questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I do not agree that this film presents "renewed belief in mankind," it is certainly a dramatic epic that consoles a lonely spirit. I prefer this to Bergman's Seventh Seal (1957), because for me the images and themes are more immediate and relevant. From the Freudian to the postmodern, you will find it in this film. It is not a cute pseudo intellectual movie that rewards with cheap plot twists and predictable fates, but rather a deep and intense journey into the soul of a man with a cold and dark heart. For the aging, for the lonely, for the misguided, this film is confrontational in its challenges to our beliefs of time, social relationships, and ethics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I'll refrain from calling this a masterpiece, WildStrawberries is nevertheless a feel good movie that teaches usthe importance of focusing on family, memories, and mentoringthe young. We see how Isak's life has been a mess, and how onlywhen nearing the end of his life does everything come together forhim. The movie generally ignores the negatives and focuses onhow Isak spreads his knowledge and receives accolades as aprofessional and as a person. The film ended on a positive note,tying up all neccessary loose ends, and Isak is a hero. Notneccessarily a must-see or an epic, but a nice story and anoutstanding movie for its era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When my class was talking briefly about Wild Strawberries before Iactually viewed it, one of the people said how weird it was andhow she didn't like it. So when I was viewing it, I didn't have highexpectations at all. I thought that this film was very touching, andreally got to explore issues of everyday life. These issues includelove, dying, jealousy, as well as others. I think that the acting waswonderful, and the flashbacks were intense, and had muchrelevance to how much I enjoyed the plot. The movie began withthe main character have a weird dream. I felt that the dream wasreally his loneliness and feeling of self worth coming through. Iwas kind of wierded out by the dream sequence, thinking that themovie would continue in this fashion, but it had a relatively normalstory line. It was hard for him to admit any wrongdoing, and to lookback on some of the bad points of his life. The audience saw notonly his pain, but his son's pain who was going down the samepath of blocking people out. I enjoyed the idea of the roadtrip, andpicking up the different people along the way. The cinematography was also very well done, mixing in differentshades of black and white, especially in the dreams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another Bergman classic that I liked and admired, but didn't love on first viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An old doctor (a magnificent performance by Victor Sjostrom) takes a car trip to receive an award for 50 years in medicine, accompanied by his daughter in law, and some teenage hitchhikers they pick up. He is tormented by highly symbolic dreams (beautifully done), and by the realization he has kept himself at an emotional distance from others and the world, and now his life is racing towards it's end. Quite moving in spots, but somehow never ended up with as much power as I expected. Two critics' notes made sense to me. One said that, for as great and transparent as Sjostrom's performance is, he is so sweet and likable a presence it's hard to reconcile him with a man his daughter in law openly admits she doesn't like because of his cold nature. The other point ? which could also be applied to 'The Seventh Seal' is that the film seems less special today because the stylistic barriers it broke and the doors it opened (an almost totally subjective film, dream sequences of depth and meaning, etc) have since become a familiar part of film grammar. But at the time, this was something new and brave. Another to re-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You are a coward! Yes I am"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am no professional critic, so I received the movie in the personal way in which every viewer should do with every movie, at least in their inner forum.It is the first Bergman movie, and I cannot estimate if it will be the last or not. I found it recommended as "soothing" somewhere, and being aware of how much of an important director Bergman is considered, I thought why not give it a try.It wasn't really soothing, but it wasn't difficult to watch either. The Swedish are weird for the less Nordic Europeans, that showed here too. Why are they so quiet, then so dramatic all of a sudden? And in this movie why were they marring cousins? Someone said once it is their climate...I also wondered why it seemed that upper class could meditate of their lives and in the same time waste them, suffer and sigh (not only in this movie, but this one brought it back), while the financially undetermined characters are supposed to always be occupied with the simpler yet equally cruel struggles of everyday life? So, I would contest the validity of the life cameo here because of the main character being so particular. Why take an individual so atypical and expand on life philosophy through him? And the greatest objection is that this movie seems purposeless, a luxury that in our era is very rarely permitted. Maybe judging it by the year it was made this would be less disturbing, but now...The old man has his dreams, his childhood flashbacks, the vague thoughts to change some things, yet it is considered somehow enough that he achieved some kind of human connection with his daughter in law, an encounter with some youngsters and half of a discussion with his son.Well, it is not. People who do not bend all their lives for those close to them, leave traumas and marks that may not heal even after generations have come and gone. It is not enough to have a few dreams and half of a conversation, then forgive oneself and talk about epiphany. The film does not take a stand, therefore the likes of Isak could watch it and think that having thoughts is enough to change the world for the better, even the wrongs they have done.And this is not moralistic talk. It is hard for humans to tell each other the truth, even harder to accept it. A movie, a book, a play can build a bridge over this gap. If a piece of such art tackles such a delicate subject it shouldn't let it in the air.The movie is a cowardly approach of regret.Interesting little thing: the way he was mixing with the past characters, him as an old man, the others young, telling him they remained young.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One hot summer-day the aging professor named Isak Borg drives from his home in Stockholm with his daughter in-law. He is to receive the title as honorary doctor the following day, but first and foremost he has to pay a visit to his mother and his son named Evald.In Ingmar Bergman's 18th and presumably most joyful feature film the viewers are introduced to 78-year-old professor Isak Borg, who after an alarming dream realizes that his self-chosen distance from almost any kind of interaction with other people and emotional inadequacy has been passed on to his son, and that he has to reach into his son before it's too late. The film follows a one day long journey where the main character, magnificently acted by then 78-year-old historic filmmaker Victor Sjöström in his final performance, meets people and sees places which reminds him of his childhood, his first love and his marriage. Through Victor Sjöström's harmonic voice-over narration, enchanting flashback scenes, Ingmar Bergman's gripping and compassionate screenplay, Ingrid Thulin's distinct and considerate role interpretation, Gunnar Fischer's radiant black-and-white cinematography and Bibi Andersson's charming and vital supporting performance, a whole life is depicted.This exquisite masterpiece which was awarded with the Golden Bear at the Berlinale and the Italian Film Critics Award at the Venice Film Festival in 1958, is one of the brightest and warmest studies of character from the visionary playwright who mastered the light like few others and in most of his films worked with actors such as Harriet Andersson, Bibi Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, Liv Ullmann, Erland Josephson, Gunnar Björnstrand, Birger Malmsten and Max Von Sydow. Ingmar Bergman's peaceful road-movie is surrounded by poetic atmospheres.</fullReview>

The story is about an elderly professor, Isak Borg (Victor Sjostrom), who has a nightmare and thinks back over his long life.The film is a beautifully paced and acted, but somewhat obscure piece; Borg's nightmares are characterised by visually arresting but often unfathomable symbols. More effective by far are his idyllic pastoral memories of his cousin Sara (Bibi Andersson), exquisitely shot. The film is included on the Vatican Best Films List, recommended for its portrayal of a man's "interior journey from pangs of regret and anxiety to a refreshing sense of peace and reconciliation".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Bergman Road Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Veteran filmmaker Victor Sjostrom plays Dr Isak Borg, a man who has shunned social contact where possible, who is nearing the end of his life. Borg decides to drive to the other end of the country to collect an honorary doctorate in recognition of his work, and is accompanied by his daughter-in-law, Marianne (Ingrid Thulin). Although Borg is supposed to be something of a misanthropist, he doesn't really come across as one in the film; in fact he comes across as quite a pleasant old chap. This could be because of a dream he recently had in which he wanders deserted city streets before coming across a clock with no hands and a carriage containing a coffin within which lies his own body. It's an undeniably powerful sequence ? and must have been even more so back in 1957 ? and it indicates to both Isak and the audience that death is not far away.This realisation triggers a series of hallucinations which cause Isak to re-assess his life, and the incidents that resulted in him becoming the way he is. We learn that the woman he really loved left him for another man, an act which he perhaps has regarded as one of feckless cruelty, but which his hallucination informs us was actually a tortuous decision.Isak and Marianne stop on the way to visit Isak's 96-year-old mother who lives alone, and largely unvisited, in a detached old house. There is little intimacy between mother and son, and it becomes evident that Isak was an unwanted child (much like Bergman). It's perhaps easy, then, to see the genetic conditioning that led Isak down the path he chose.The film continues in this revelatory vein for its relatively brief running time, and it is never less than an intelligent and absorbing tale. Isak and Marianne pick up hikers on their travels: a young girl ? played by Bibi Andersson, who also plays Sara, Isak's lost love ? and her two male companions, whose situation mirrors that of Isak's Sara, and a bickering married couple, with whom Isak relates because they remind him of his own troubled marriage to a wife long dead.Wild Strawberries is one of those films that tempts the viewer into ever deeper thought: the more you think about it, the more you realise you've yet to uncover. The best films are like this: you keep peeling away one layer only to reveal another underneath ? and while they don't provide the visceral thrill of more popular films, they are undoubtedly infinitely more rewarding. The subject matter might be grim ? coming to terms with the imminent end of one's life, the nature of death, and the perilous path misinformed decisions can lead us down ? but Wild Strawberries isn't a depressing film. It's not exactly uplifting, either, but it has something to say, and says it in an intelligent and insightful way. Victor Sjostrom, whose last film this would be, gives a near perfect performance as old Isak. He was 78 when the film was made ? the same age as the character he plays ? and in poor health, a fact which ironically enhances the realism of his performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another beautifully painted contemplative portrait of mortality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To compare "Wild Strawberries" to a story that's a bit more grounded (yet still part fantasy), what instantly comes to mind is "A Christmas Carol." Though that classic is much more exaggerated, it shares that reflective spirit, sense of personal regret and un-fulfillment and the desire to make amends. The difference is that in "Wild Strawberries" we need no ghosts - - only Ingmar Bergman as our guide.Isak is a very old professor on his way to Lund, Sweden with his daughter-in-law to receive an honorary award, when in his aging state he's confronted by dreams of his childhood and consequent past regrets. On the trip, he also meets some vivacious young people and a bickering couple who continue to steer him toward a path of using his last days/months/years to bring meaning into his life.Released at the same time as Bergman classic "The Seventh Seal," "Strawberries" is also incredibly contemplative and full of incredibly philosophical dialogue. Both films confront themes of mortality, but "Strawberries" is the more hopeful of the two. Although we pity Isak and the film's other characters who seem to have failed miserably to suck any joy or positive meaning from life, there's nothing imminently bad or unavoidable -- there is great capacity for betterment.Bergman's excellence as a director resonates throughout the film through its opening scene with ticking clocks and first major dream sequence on the barren streets to the final zoom-ins and close-ups. His every shot is a portrait of an emotion or at the least of a man caught somewhere between the past and death. Like all great classic/black and white directors, Bergman understands the powerful moments of his story and reserves his best just for them.Although Bergman creates more pity than empathy (though it could be my fault I've always struggled to really find personal epiphany in viewing his stories) and his language more intentionally mystical at times than intrinsically inspired, he manages to capture the uncertainty he's trying to address better than anyone else; His portrait of emotion brings us closer to life's toughest questions than any other director has ever dared.It's the hopeful ending, however, that really makes "Wild Strawberries" a great film. Despite Bergman showing us a mirror that's very tough to look at for an extended period of time, he never suggests that we can't look into it and change whatever it is we don't like. It's that outlet that makes the thematic difficulty of the film all that much easier to bear.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

I had avoided watching his films for thirty-five years because of the heaviness of heart, the weariness that these prejudices caused me.However, this film is just a darned good movie. I laughed aloud several times during the film at the interactions between the very real seeming characters. The protagonist learns something about life during the progress of his journey. The dream sequences, far from being tedious or thrumming me on the head with their symbolism, are, to my mind, the most accurate depiction of the dream state I've seen on film. In no way is this film dated. (except, perhaps in that the beautiful women seem normal size rather than the unhealthily thin monstrosities we are forced to watch these days).Watching this (the Criterion collection version with subtitles) has made me want to see more Bergman films to see if any of the optimism and accuracy of this film are in his other films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I feel about Ingmar Bergman, after the screening of his two films at the Suchitra Film society, Bangalore, he is a very complex film maker under his simple narrative style. He is a creator of complex characters. In his most acclaimed film Wild Strawberries, on the surface of narration you can't find anything special here. But you can easily find out a 'meaning' is there. Hope you can understand that I'm not using the word 'meaning' in a typical term.Bergman is capable to make a feel of his 'meaning' in his film from beginning to end. In this film you can find two existential element parallel in whole narrative is loneliness and the memories from the past. Here unlike other existential movies the pathos runs into the generations.Wild Strawberries in like an old poem. No wonder that Bergman tells us a story about old people or about those are growing to be old. Some youth are also in this plot but they creates a contrast and the darkness around the main character. It is very difficult to make a simple decision about Bergman and this is truth about all great filmmakers... isn't it?</fullReview>

His fear is visceral but there's no raw insight to back it up. Maybe he was a simpleton in a gentleman's clothing. I didn't understand the reason for the title though. Regardless, Wild Strawberries didn't come even close to dislodging 12 Angry Men as my favorite movie of 1957, let alone the best film of all time.

Ingmar Bergman examines the life of Isak Borg, a 78 year old former doctor, who is now filled with loneliness inside, with no emotional attachments and just sees himself as a living corpse. The dream sequences are quite haunting and memorable and it is very interesting how Bergman used symbolisms a lot of times in those dreams. Another interesting aspect was Isak's interactions with the group of youngsters and his daughter-in-law, Marianne. You can see how he maintains himself emotionally distant, even when Marianne is revealing her deepest feelings towards his son, Evald. Wild Strawberries had great comedic moments to balance the dramatic scenes, making it not only entertaining to watch, but always intriguing.

		<shortDescription>One Of Bergman's Best Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild Strawberries is a Swedish film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman, about an old man recalling his past. The original Swedish title is Smultronstället, which literally means "the wild strawberry patch", but idiomatically means an underrated gem of a place. The cast includes Victor Sjöström in his final screen performance, as well as Bergman regulars Bibi Andersson, Ingrid Thulin and Gunnar Björnstrand. Max von Sydow also appears in a small role. Bergman wrote the screenplay while hospitalized. After exploring his disillusionment with religion in his previous films, Ingmar Bergman adopted a humanistic approach for this classic study in isolationism.Isak Borg is an aging medical professor who reassesses his life while journeying to his former university to receive an honorary degree. Borg travels with his estranged daughter-in-law Marianne and revisits many of the landmarks of his past, conjuring up memories of his family and of his onetime sweetheart Sara. Returning to the present, he meets a teenage girl who resembles the long-departed Sara. She hitches a ride with the professor and Marianne, as do a ceaselessly bickering married couple. These new characters eventually become intertwined with Borg's hazy flashbacks and fantasies, as the old man recalls the disappointments and disillusionment that have left him cold and guilt- ridden, attributes emphasized when he encounters his equally cold and resentful son. Book ending Borg's odyssey of self-discovery are a series of symbolic images at the beginning of the film and a hauntingly beautiful finale, in which professor is beckoned back to the "perfect" world he left behind so many years earlier.One of Ingmar Bergman's many masterpieces, this universal meditation on the meaning of life is extremely well-acted by Victor Sjostrom as the aging professor.Because it tackles difficult questions about life, and thought-provoking themes such as self-discovery and human existence, the film is often considered to be one of Bergman's most emotional, optimistic and best films.Truly a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what is so fascinating is the subject matter of this film, which is in essence the subject matter of cinema itself: where do dreams and memories finish, and objective reality begin? Indeed, can there be an objective reality? this film, which its beautiful aesthetic stylisation (note especially the use of shadow in the dream sequence; the shape of the trees in the woods)seems to suggest that there is no objective reality, no symptamology which we can read and will allow us to reach a true conclusion. Rather than interpreting the moment when he sees his parents as him opting for non-existence over life, though, can we not read it as the moment when Isak realises that there is a chance for a connection, that happiness and intimacy are possible, that he waves to his parents across the gaps of time, memory and space and it is in his realisation that they had a moment of happiness that he is finally reconciled to his own existence? And, of course, this seems to suggest rather then that the new baby's happiness is dependent on the reconciliation of his son and daughter-in-law, which he attempts to effect. I especially enjoyed the early dream sequence with its haunting imagery and then the rather more loopy examination scene, which feel would definately support a second viewing...

		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman's "Wild Strawberries" was a thoughtful and intelligent film. The protagonist's spiritual journey was quite moving. As an old man, Isak Borg makes a trip across Sweden to receive an honorary degree. While on the trip, he stops at his childhood home, bringing up old memories. As Isak looks back at his life, he has the horrifying realization that his life has been meaningless. He contemplates his life and confronts his past, and realizes that he hasn't lived life to its fullest. Isak realizes he needs to let emotion in, and in the end he is at peace with himself at last. This film was very well made and directed. I found it to be insightful and artistic, even though it did move a little slow for my taste. "Wild Strawberries" delivers an important message: that we should all take a good look at our lives, lest we grow old and realize we missed out on the important things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A successful, respected doctor and professor near the end of his life looks back on his years with regret and nostalgia. Bergman uses dreams and allegorical images and characters to support his thesis that the greatest waste of a life is to live it in isolation."Wild Strawberries" is also light and humorous in places, with a gentle and loving depiction of the doctor's family in his youth (though I think it's important that we never see the doctor interacting with his past family until the very end). He is ultimately redeemed at the end, and Bergman is saying, I think, that there is hope for us to change even until the very end of our lives, and that change is worth undertaking.On the whole, "Wild Strawberries" makes an affirmative statement. One of the strengths of this movie, and of Bergman's work in general, is his ability to create characters who function successfully as both "types" -- embodiments of ideas, philosophies or points of view -- and also as credible individuals in a narrative about whom we care. That's difficult.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Old professors on road trips, no matter how many fully dressed blonds you add, will probably never provide much wildness or strawberries, especially if they spend more time with them dreaming as they snooze during the trip then take in the landscape and people. Ingmar definitely failed despite apparently the entire country of Sweden voting to the contrary for their film hero. He hints that he may be attempting irony, but that really doesn't work outside of a few instances where the actors pull it off.One way the irony could have worked is if the film is understood more like Robot and Frank involving an old man nearing death with a failing brain. It might be seen as an allegory in why making plans based on a dream you have the night before is unlikely to add wildness or strawberries to your day.The film seems more like that of a young, naive director playing with university ideas and quite possibly trying to antagonize a professor he hated, or simply fool him into grading the film highly by not committing to anything and leaving it open for interpretation.At best, it's an interesting look into the Summer conventions and traditions of Sweden in the 1950s where pipe smoking is viewed as healthy and marrying cousins is normal. All this can be better achieved through some clips of the film, an actual documentary, and some photo essays. You'll also have the benefit of knowing it rather than wondering if you're lost in somebody's bad dreams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The vast majority of films are artless. But just because we encounter a real artist -- and real art -- is no reason to welcome it into our breast. I can trust some artists to work their magic to change me in ways that I admire or even like. But I have to be very careful with Bergman: his primary concern is often himself, which immediately worries me. And his method is extreme in the engineering of the presentation, with the focus being an exploration of that very compulsion. The art is more than earnest, it is obsessive in attention to detail, and that obsession is possibly near the brink of madness -- the kind of madness that is contagious.I do not accept this film, but warmly embrace 'The Seventh Seal,' made at the same time, with many of the same sensibilities. But 'Seal' was about the nature of constructed memory in the context of film and general myth. 'Strawberries' substitutes personal experience for the fabric of art and myth, so the constructed memories all have emotional consequence. Odd how he swings. Be careful with this one.The DVD contains an interview with Bergman. Unlike nearly all such filler, this one is valuable.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the amount of weight Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries brings to the table, there's an incredible amount of ease and earnestness in its story, blooming from its leads and the overall subject matter that it so brilliantly handles. Unlike his previous effort, The Seventh Seal, made the same year as this, Bergman unfolds more of a Charles Dickens-esque story, more centered on the modern world rather than the Middle Ages, and a one about how a man can see his childhood memories with piercing clarity, yet can not fathom or even begin to be piece together his present life.The man is Professor Isak Borg, played by the marvelous director Victor Sjöström. Isak is the bossy and stubborn professor of bacteriology, who resides in a small home with just a house maid for company. He must make the lengthy trip from Stockholm to Lund to receive an honorary degree after graduating from Lund University fifty years ago. Ingrid Thulin is Marianne, his pregnant daughter-in-law who is planning to divorce her husband once the baby is born. She views her father-in-law much like the rest of the world; snotty, ungrateful, and unimportant.It is during this long car trip that Isak begins to see through to his inner-self. This newfound exercise is assisted by three different groups of people he encounters. One is the relationship with his close family, which is closed-off to his mother, daughter-in-law, and son. Another is with people he encounters while on the road, like a bickering married couple, who relationship is apparently physically and verbally abusive, along with a group of young hikers. And the final relationship is with the man's own psyche, which writer/director Bergman does not hesitate to plunge deeply into.We see Isak's psyche through metaphoric and sometimes disturbing dream sequences, one of which takes place right at the beginning of the film. The dream involves Isak walking down an empty road, disillusioned and confused. The clocks do not have hands on them, and everything appears washed-out and unusually bright. We see a horse-drawn carriage collide into a pole, releasing one of its wooden wheels. The horse scurry off frightened when a casket falls off the carriage, opening slightly, revealing its contents to be those of Isak's. The "body" attempts to pull him in right before Isak can snap back into reality. That scene plays like a short film in itself and is surreal and poignant, offering more than words could ever.Wild Strawberries is a treat everyone should indulge in. It provided me with one of the most thought-provoking characters I've ever seen - someone who can connect and get on the good side of those he just meets, but truly takes advantage of and detaches himself from those close to him - and gave me one of the rawest and interesting dramas I have yet to see.Starring: Victor Sjöström, Bibi Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, and Gunnar Björnstrand. Directed by: Ingmar Bergman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man."- Don Vito Corelone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has a theme similar to Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru. Ingmar Bergman has brilliantly presented his thoughts through this masterpiece. Ingmar Bergman uses his trademark way of bolstering the story with quixotic world, something he invented and pioneered in making movies with a tinge of fantasy.An aging scholar and revered doctor, Isak Borg, is to be conferred the Emeritus title by the medical university for his outstanding dedication of work in the field of medicine. He is escorted by his daughter-in-law who makes him realize how rude he has been to his very son when it came to returning borrowed money, how he has lived a life of emptiness and with no one to care and love for. He flakes out en route and the emptiness of his life haunts him in the dreams. He visits his childhood house and calls on his mother. He starts to realize how he spent time on material possessions such as degrees or money but not for his very kin. He turns a new leaf in the end.An eye-opener to many a obdurate, hard-working recluse who spare no time for their kith and kin.A 10/10 movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild, wild strawberries..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild Strawberries should be considered essential viewing for anyone, who wants to get in touch with Ingmar Bergman's great directorial career. It's one of those movies, along with The Seventh Seal, that discuss the theme of a meaningful journey, covered with existential dilemmas and spiritual moralities. Dr. Isaak Borg, an old and very acclaimed professor, is about to travel from Stockholm to Lund in order to receive an honorary degree. Normally he would've taken the plane, but due to a eerie dream that haunted him the previous night he starts to reminisce about his whole life, and finally decides to ride there by car, just to have some time for himself and those piercing thoughts of various matters. Yet, along with him comes his daughter-in-law Marianne. In a series of honest exchange of views Isaak realizes how meaningless and full of void his life has been up to this point. He shut out all of the relationship that he had and concentrated only on his selfish life made up of hard work and materialistic needs. Even though he achieved respect in the scientific world, in the humanity's entity he has been dead for a long time now. Emotionless and cold- as-ice, he wasn't able to take care of any person that longed for his attention.Somewhere along the road they stop at the house where Isaak grew up. His hazy memory shows him a few scenes from his early life, and how really bitter and depressing it has been. Without love and warmth, even from the girl he wanted to marry, he blocked his deepest emotions and became as ruthless as the people he was surrounded by. And it all passes down in the family, as it seems that his son is as heartless and dismal as his father. Thoughts of death occur on a daily basis, as if the pain of being alive was too hard to bear. It's really paradoxical, that the only people that ever thought of him as a nice and friendly man were those, who didn't know him one bit: the family at the gas station, and the three young people he took along on the ride.Bergman placed them fantastically in the story to present a sharp contrast between the cheerful young fellows and a sorrowful, nearly dead, old man contemplating his empty life. There is also a notion of the existence of God that those three characters bring onto the screen.It's as if Bergman wanted to evaluate Borg's fatalism with contradicting it with the possibilities of an afterlife. His body is still functioning, but in the spiritual meaning he is long gone.On the side of cinematography, this divine problem is also brilliantly shown by the nightmare that haunted Borg that night. He stands on a street, in a place devoid of time, where people melt and die. Then comes the metaphorical black stagecoach carrying a coffin with Borg inside. Is he still alive, or is he dead? An image that would scary anyone, I suppose.In the end apart from deep empathy I somehow felt happy, as the final scenes provide some kind of a reprieve for Borg. Even though he lead a life of emptiness and was never kind to anyone, and valued death over life itself, at the end of the day he finally caught a glimpse of what real remorse may feel like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Weird, Mesmerizing Exposition on Individualism and False Dichotomies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman has had his duds. "A Lesson in Love" was mediocre at best, "Persona" (2003) was pretentious, and "The Naked Night" was dreadfully boring. The first time I sat down and watched "Wild Strawberries" I had written it off as another Bergman dud, but a future rewatch proved that it's likely his third best film ? behind "Autumn Sonata" and "From the Life of the Marionettes".The key to enjoying this film is to recognize its two primary themes: individualism and false dichotomies. The value of the individual is contrasted with the needs of society as a whole, and the false dichotomy is the illusion that one must choose between one or the other. Bergman communicates these ideas through symbolism. The tree named Otto represents the individual human being, while the surrounding ecosystem represents society as a whole. The false dichotomy presents itself when each character is forced to choose between protecting Otto or the surrounding ecosystem. Without recognizing these symbols, it is impossible for the viewer to appreciate the entertaining content of this film.One of the more interesting characters is the lady botanist. She previously studied individual plants, but claims that she learned nothing from them. She believes that most people are led astray when they look at the individual plants without observing the forest as a whole. This panoramic outlook is fueled when the ecosystem suffers a gradual decline. The botanist claims that the Otto tree is poisoning the ecosystem and must be destroyed to preserve the surrounding environment. The cop asks her if there's a way for both to survive, but she says that it is impossible. However, it is divulged later on that the botanist herself is accelerating the destruction of the environment by dumping large quantities of poison into a nearby well. Her logic is that a quick death and restoration is a better option than the slow, gradual decline that Otto is currently inflicting. This must be a very painful decision coming from a character that values the needs of the many over the needs of the few.Dr. Isak Borg takes more of a natural selection angle, that the dominant individual should rightly survive irregardless of the consequences. He needs force to protect the Otto tree, which is why he wants to persuade the cop to join his side. When the guardian makes reference to the "rules of the forest", the viewer will correctly remember that the kidnapper in the opening scene made reference to "the rules of the world", and since this movie uses the forest as a symbol for the human world, we now understand that both characters share the same essential outlook. You see, the "rules of the world" represent the false dichotomy of choosing between the individual and society. The world maintains order by forcing people to make this decision and blinding them from recognizing that a third option does indeed exist. The guardian seems to subconsciously recognize this third option, but his obsession with Otto (aka the individual) prevents him from realizing it.This is where Dr. Isak Borg's character comes into play. He is the "swing vote" of sorts because his status as a doctor gives him the power of authority. However, he seemingly plays both sides, first opting to protect the first Otto tree and then opting to destroy the second Otto tree. To confuse matters he also destroys the botanist's poison well. Why does he act so erratically? Because he believes that both Otto (aka the individual) and the forest (aka society) need to survive. For him the problem is the way the question is posed. Rules and force attempt to establish a false dichotomy that allows for only two wrong choices instead of the correct third option. Therefore, he chooses to help one Otto and kill another, switching sides to keep the balance between the two forces. This film comes full circle on this theme near the end. The cop redeems his earlier mistake at the beginning of the film (getting both the kidnapper and hostage killed) by saving the botanist near the end without killing the kidnapper, another symbolic representation of avoiding a false dichotomy (of choosing one or another) by saving both.The policeman's refusal to play by the "rules of the forest" causes chaos on a local level, which is first depicted by the sledgehammer killings in the small town and then by the tree guardian's murder of the botanist's assistant. In addition, the men in black (initially hired to retrieve the first Otto for its apparent monetary value) turn on the local environmentalists and kill them. Even more striking is that these men in black turn down a briefcase full of money and refuse to give the tree guardian a ride (a complete deconstruction of their previous personas that valued money above all else). And since the events within the forest act as a microcosm of the whole world, this local chaos manifests into a worldwide pandemonium. The policeman walks out of the forest to witness the nearby city in flames. His decision to rebel against the rules of the forest has now resulted in the deconstruction of the rules of the world.This is a very well-written movie that is consistent and efficient in its structure. Viewers with an attraction to odd, quirky, deliberately paced art-house films should love this. The environments are also beautiful and moody, and the chilly weather makes this film essential viewing during the late autumn months. A truly great film with more creativity and imagination than a dozen others combined.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ontologival incestigation by Suffering's last son</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Dostoevsky, Hamsun, Strindberg, Kafka and Camus, Bergman throws himself in front of the reader. After reading his autobiography, you are forced to ask yourself, "was Isak Ingmar?" Is the movie a window into the greatest exponent of the 20th centuries art form? Or, is it a mirror for us to reach inside and grab by the throat a future that seems inevitable? No artist since Bernini has depicted pain as Bergman has. In Wild Strawberries Bergman has a given a man, frail, worn of by Christian in-action (in the Niezschean sense). It is arguably the most positive, this-life-enforcing movie that can viewed. I have refrained from quoting any specifics. I would hate to ruin the movie for someone who is harping on whether to spend 90 minutes on it. My suggestion, do it; thrice over; every year.This movie, along with Hamsun's Hunger, Dostoevsky's Notes, is the pinnacle of man's love for the dirt that hides under his nails.(I am amazed at how different the subtitle are on a criterion disc. I feel they are literal, often compromising the poetic essence that is present in other non-criterion discs sold by the Swedish Art Institute. I am torn apart as to which is better, but, if you are like me, and see Bergman as a genius whose essence is to be captured in full, see both. I would advice looking at Walter Arndt's introduction to Eugene Onegin, and the difficulties of translating Pushkin. I cannot help but wonder if Bergman is looking at us with scorn for sullying his legacy.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Bergman's Wild Strawberries first about fifteen years ago. Since then I have watched the film at least once every year. Every time I watch it the same deep emotions are wakened. I most preferably watch it alone at home, so I don't have to hide my tears. Think about it. A 52 years old rough man shedding tears over a movie.The film tells us that it is never too late to change your ways, if you want to. Old professor begins to see and analyze mistakes he has made in his life, hurting all people closest to him. Cold, cynical, indifferent attitude has infected also his son Evald, whose wife has come to stay with our professor. During one day, guided by his daughter-in-law and his own memories and nightmares, professor Borg seems to realize that he needs to start a new path in his life.This is Bergman at its best. A serious film in which there is humor and beautiful scenes to make this masterpiece easy to watch. This movie really is above all comparison, only 10 points because no chance to give more, 100/10 would be fair :-).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't very much impressed by this film. I know it is artsy and sophisticated, though, it is still more accessible than most other Bergman films. I would only say that Fanny and Alexander is more accessible, though this film here actually has a plot and well developed characters, which is unusual for Bergman films. Some of his films are only a showing of symbolism, such as The Seventh Seal, this one is also very artsy, though it doesn't sacrifice traditional narrative.But I didn't found it very entertaining. The low visual quality hurt, as the fact that it is black and white (I simply do not like black and white very much: color makes things much better looking) and the score was also very uninteresting.Overall, I would recommend it for someone who likes artsy drama films. It isn't, however, an entertaining film for the masses. And yes, I like to be entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild Strawberries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From writer/director Ingmar Bergman (Smiles of a Summer Night, Persona), this was the film that apparently cemented his career overseas, I would have thought The Seventh Seal did that, oh well. Basically seventy-eight year old physician and professor of medicine Dr. Isak Borg (BAFTA nominated Victor Sjöström) is travelling from Stockholm to Lund to receive an honorary award for fifty years in medical practice. He is joined on the journey by his daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), and along the way he tells how he has been having strange dreams, nightmares and hallucinations, and this returns again. These nightmares include clocks with faces but no hands, runaway hearses, an open coffin with his own body coming out, and of course the meaningful summers he spent with cousin Sara (Bibi Andersson) and stuff. Slipping back and forth, in and out of these questionable places, he realises choices he made int he past involving him, his love life and ultimately his family have created a lonely life. He finds he has no real purpose for living without his children and love in his life (family and passionate together), thankfully he achieves redemption, and the forgiveness and love from his children. Also starring Gunnar Björnstrand as Dr. Evald Borg, Jullan Kindahl as Agda, Folke Sundquist as Anders, Björn Bjelfvenstam as Viktor, Naima Wifstrand as Isak's Mother and a brief Max Von Sydow as Henrik ?kerman. This Swedish film has many weird and wonderful moments, especially during the dream sequences, Sjöström is a good choice for the leading character, and even though it was hard to keep up with the dream and reality placings, it is certainly a must see foreign drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quiet but rich and efficient psychodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Sjostrom's rich principal performance is typical of a cast that really fill out the characters Bergman scripted. For a work that has such narrative drive Bergman also manages to chop up the experience, through the dream episodes, to really ruminate on the alternately painful and happy experiences in the reality of the journey. It's surprisingly easy to watch and enjoy, despite quite arch conversational exchanges and bare psychological observation in the dialogue. Such episodes are to the general script what the opening dream sequence, which opens the film in the same symbolist manner as Paul Anderson's Punch Drunk Love, is to the action; all about feeding the imagination and texturing the film.If you want a fine road movie which stands alone as it's own metaphor for redemption or catharsis, I recommend David Lynch's The Straight Story. However Wild Strawberries specifically isolates the details of a life's benign cancers and dissolve them in the balm of art, a process as hard fought yet simple as the single tracking shot of the Professor's inauguration in Lund, his journey's end. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me tell you a little bit about the movie before my opinions, Wild Strawberries is a Swedish movie directed and written by Ingmar Bergman in 1957. Bergmann himself is a very interesting character, most of his movies relate to a personal experience. Interestingly enough although Wild Strawberries was nominated for best screenplay written, its not one of his top movies.I started watching Wild Strawberries late at night and after 30 mins, I wanted to sleep, things were moving too slow. I stopped watching and went to sleep, woke up this morning and finished the movie. My thoughts at the end were that must have been such a great movie int he 50's. You know when they say, it was a walk down memory lane, the movie is literally that. The idea was that this old man, Dr.Isaak Borg (main character) was going on a trip from the city he lives in to another city to be honored for being a medical doctor for 50 years. He decides to go by car and along the road he stops at places where he had memories as a young man. He also meets few interesting characters along the road and have dreams that shows his fears of being a lonely old man. The idea is really brilliant for the 50's and the directing was really good, it had beautiful scenes and really nice camera angles. Some scenes were so beautiful that it feels more like its a painted picture. Its really impressive how Bergman was able to execute his story that well. What I also loved is how the dreams reflected the character's fears and managed to show that in some well done graphic tricks. The music played through the movie served the scenes well, but the sound editing wasn't good at all, I felt every cut. Beautiful costumes and I loved how the young women were wearing pants and smoking cigarettes and driving! it felt so modern and open minded. However, I wasn't impressed by the main character's acting, it was shallow and I couldn't sympathize with him much. I liked more the secondary characters who joined him in his trip, they were more believable. I also didn't like how blunt some parts were in showing that he is a cold old man, it was more like Bergman was giving us facts with not much reasons behind it, of course through the movie you understand why is he that ruthless, but it was mentioned too much from different characters and too bluntly. And I must admit, unfortunately I didn't enjoy the language much (sorry!).Was it a good movie? yes indeed! but I wouldn't watch it again, it didn't leave me wondering and I was bored at the beginning.its-lalas-land.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An old professor reflects on his life. This is a typical Bergman film in that it touches on big themes like love, marriage, death, and God. The handling of these themes is not as heavy handed as in "The Seventh Seal," although the symbolism is too obvious (handless clock = death). Sjostrom is quite good as the professor. Thulin is also fine as his daughter-in-law. Andersson is lovely as the cousin he loved as a young man and regrets not marrying. Apparently in Sweden it is socially acceptable to marry one's cousin. A contrived plot device has Andersson also playing a young woman by the same name as the professor's cousin that he happens to meet in old age, a lazy metaphor for lost youth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Wild Strawberries' is a surprisingly accessible Ingmar Bergman film: the story of an aged doctor who is drawn to reflect on what has made him the person that he is. What's interesting is the depth of the psychology here: this movie was made in 1957, and for it's day, the sophistication of the characterisation is quite astonishing, render it in colour and you could easily believe that it dates from decades later. The style, however, is talky, the cast do their job but the whole experience lacks a little of the intensity of Bergman's later work. Nonetheless, it's a shrewd insight into the nature personality, and ahead of it's time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess my problem with it is that I found the story to be too conventional and I wasn't as emotionally impacted at the film's end as I should have been. The wonderfully surreal dreams and nightmares and flashbacks do a terrific job of outlining Isak's character and his empty life, but I felt that the story in the present didn't accurately reflect what the stories of the past implied. The elder Isak wasn't cold, wasn't harsh, and didn't deserve the loneliness which had crept over him. And, as such, I felt like his character didn't really grow over the course of the narrative, as I didn't think he was that distant to begin with. There's some redemption to be found with his son, of course, but why was that redemption required? I just thought Isak's character didn't fit within the context of the flashbacks.I suppose I'll probably like it better once I understand Bergman more and watch it again, but for now, I'll just have to be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman lite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to this movie after having watched several of Bergman's others; "The Seventh Seal," "Through a Glass Darkly," "The Silence," and "Winter Light," among others. I always had to be in the mood for one of those emotionally draining experiences, so, in a suitably heavy mindset I watched "Wild Strawberries." Many of the Bergman themes are present: lost love, loneliness, marital and family dysfunction, God versus science, anxiety, isolation, and fear of death. However, the touch seemed lighter than expected, provoking only a wistful melancholy.The storyline is simple, being that of 78 year old Professor Isak Borg (Victor Sjöström) traveling by car from Stockholm to Lund to receive honorary recognition for his lifetime of service in the medical profession. Initially he is accompanied on the trip by his attractive daughter-in-law, but they are joined along the way by a young girl and her two male companions as well as a bitterly cynical middle-aged couple. If you are wondering how all of the people fit into Borg's car, it is rather large and old - befitting its owner, as Borg comments. A Bergman road movie is a novelty in and of itself and makes seeing this a must for any Bergman fan.In the opening scene Borg (who narrates the film) says that he has chosen to withdraw from most personal interactions, since they seem to dwell on interminable discussions about people and their motivations which, one assumes, bore him. He remarks on this as leaving him rather lonely, but this seems more of a remark than a complaint. Early on we are treated to a Daliesque dream sequence that led me to feel that we were indeed going to go deeply into the psyche of Dr. Borg, but the ponderous tone created by the dream is not carried over into the remainder of the movie. The dream is spectacularly realized and, while I assume that Freud would have a field day with it, its meaning beyond having a life without much time left inducing a fear of loneliness and death escapes me. I think the dream sequence misleads us as to what is coming. It establishes the main premise, but sets the wrong tone. Toward the end of the movie we are offered another lengthy dream sequence - an anxiety dream about being unprepared for an examination (that is commonly experienced by most academics) together with revelations of the infidelity of Borg's long since dead wife and a searing interrogation by the wife who comments, "You know so much, and you don't know anything."Sandwitched between these heavier dreams the trip itself is almost lighthearted at times, primarily due to the exuberance and beauty of the young Bibi Anderson. This is not to say that Professor Borg is not hit with some weighty accusations by his daughter-in-law, like being told he is selfish and ruthless, and that his son hates him. It is fun to see Max von Sydow playing a gas station attendant who expresses thanks to Borg for services once rendered.Probably all old people wind up in Borg's position of looking back on their lives and summing up. And there are many who have regrets about foregoing personal relationships in favor of career, as Borg does. But, in the end it is difficult to see Borg as an anguished or tragic person. He made choices, some good and some bad, just like we all do. Maybe he could have had more personal happiness with different choices, who can tell. By opting for more personal happiness, maybe his talents as an honored scientist would have been lost to society. Is the social good of a life less valuable than personal satisfaction? Besides, at an old age Borg has a devoted housekeeper who is almost a surrogate wife, he is well off, he is honored by his peers, he is still intellectually active, he is engaged enough to recite poetry, and, importantly, he is still flexible and thoughtful enough to be changed by his experiences. After his long day he has had not only sobering, wounding experiences, but also the delight in his young companions and the satisfaction of being publicly honored. He is able to integrate these experiences and, near the end of life, find peace rather than confusion and despair.Woody Allen's "Another Woman" has been compared to this movie. Indeed Allen's movie was surely inspired by "Wild Strawberries," and I think it is the superior movie - deeper and more involving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wild Strawberries", Ingmar Bergman's classic film in which an elderly physician examines his life while traveling to receive an honorary award for his years of service is probably not a household name, but it should be seen. Professor Isak Borg (Sjostrom) has been living alone for years with only his housekeeper to keep him company, as he has alienated his grown son and his daughter in law. His cold demeanor and brusque mannerisms don't help to win him many friends, so on the advent of the award ceremony, while his daughter in law drives him there he reflects on his past and things that happened/decisions he made that led him to become the man he has, and led to the life he is living. Whether they are nightmarish dreams about death, or bona fide memories he experiences while they visit his childhood home along the way, each occurrence makes him more introspective (and a bit frightened) about his life and the lives of those around him."Clarity" is not the first word that comes to mind when I think of Bergman, but the words "introspective" and "provocative" do. "Wild Strawberries" was like a less sentimental "Goodbye Mr. Chips", and even has some similarities to "Deconstructing Harry". After experiencing Bergman films like "The Seventh Seal", I was expecting there to be a lot of room for interpretation, and what I got was a beautiful, interesting and thought-provoking study of a man who didn't realize all that he had lost until he finally allowed himself (or forced himself, depending on which way you want to look at it) to come to terms with certain turning points in his life, some of which he had complete control over, and some which were decided for him.Bergman's black and white cinematography is gorgeous and artful, and Sjostrom's performance is heartfelt and natural. The supporting cast is good as well. If you're trying to get someone to get into Bergman films, this may be a good warm-up before exposing them to "The Seventh Seal" or even "Persona". With "Wild Strawberries", Bergman proves once again that he is one of the most thought-provoking and creative directors of the 20th century. I would definitely recommend this film. 7/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS"Wild Strawberries" reminds me of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" where the main character has lived a cold, unfriendly existence all his life and is confronted by strange dreams which change him completely.A doctor-professor is on his way to Lund to receive an honorary degree for his service. He has spent his life acting distant, cold, and stuck up to those around him. During his trip to Lund, he has several, strange dreams about his childhood and his past that have an impact on his outlook of life.Bergman's film is very intriguing and thought-provoking. There is no sex or profanity and it's pretty much squeaky clean. 3.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hodgepodge of Philosophy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film created an interesting dialogue centered on the conflict between the rationalist and aesthetic perspectives of life. However, I found it hard to relate to the main character. Are we to believe that we should not pursue a rationalist philosophy merely because he has gone before us and become unhappy? It doesn't seem like a very good argument to a young person like myself. However, I did enjoy the move because of its interesting adaptation of these age old themes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good but overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just started a complete Bergman cycle as I hadn't seen any of his movies and was quite ashamed of it! This is my third one, I saw Sawdust &amp; Tinsel and the Seventh Seal yesterday. Seventh Seal was very profound and original, although I was disappointed by the quality of the Black&amp;White photography. I still graded it much higher than wild strawberries.Here, the acting is excellent, the directing is unsurprisingly excellent too. The storyline is very profound so are the dialogs and before all there's grace. Although the soundtrack is disappointing and the photography still doesn't deserve any awe.I was interested by this story of an old man looking back at his life; some people compared it to About Schmidt, on a similar subject it's true, but not as profound. An equally profound movie on this subject that I think is superior (despite some slow and long passages) is ETERNITY AND A DAY by Theo Angelopoulos. Bruno Ganz moves me much more than Sjostrom and the symbols all along make the dreams more subtle. The photography is better and the discreet soundtrack accompanies magnificently the pictures.In conclusion, wild Strawberries is a very good movie but we may have done better since and it seems to me that it's a little bit overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touches of cruelty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wild Strawberrys" wasn't as obtuse as other Bergman films. I thought it was an touching examination of an old, bitter man's realization of his life's end. From recollection's and comments from his traveling group he realizes he has become a mean, old b***ard. There were touches of cruelty the movie. Isak, his son Evald, their mother and the couple they were in a car accident with, all show signs of cruelty. They were mean, cold and bitter. Marianne seems to notice and comment on the behavior as if she were the conscience of the movie. She was played by a young Ingrid Thulin and was gorgeous. She was also memorable as Karin in "Cries and Whispers". Bibi Andersson played an almost Sandra Dee type character. It seems only the young people were happy in this movie and as they grew older they became mean and bitter. It wasn't a real happy movie. The ending was a bit more uplifting. Overall a good movie and a nice introduction to Bergman movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I used to be able to watch this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I last saw this movie 23 years ago. It is very useful at that age to discover that other generations had intelligent ideas about how to construct film, and that you and and your neat friends don't have a patent on originality.This is one of those works you respect for it's filmic contributions but that a viewer doesn't really enjoy per se. There are enjoyable bits in it, but it suffers, like many Bergman movies, of a stagnating sameness from moment to moment. No Bergman film I've ever seen "builds" over it's running time; which would seem to be the benefit of placing one moment next to another in a narrative format. Consequently I have no idea how Bergman decided this was "done." It meanders. The rampant symbols (&amp; dream imagery) offer no middle ground being either a) positively obvious and Fruedian or b) so murky that I just don't care what they might mean if I unraveled them.I used to be able to make it through Bergman movies. (Well, actually I never made it through the Seventh Seal) But now, there's not a chance. If he shows people sleeping (Wild Strawberries) or lazing about (Persona) it's a doubly fatal to me; like Snow White's poisoned apple. I fell asleep in the theater during one of the later dream sequences.I'm a cerebral guy, but Bergman is just too lost in his head as a film-maker for me. I couldn't find my interest in Wild Strawberries with a team of Swedish film analysts helping me. As distant as the silent era felt in the 70's the mid-century classics now begin to recede identically for me. And these films feel very dated &amp; ungenerous, despite their merits in context. Lars von Trier once said "The best thing that could happen to Swedish film is for Ingmar Bergman to die." Bergman died last week. Long live the new Swedish cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Wild strawberries" is a completely boring film about a boring old man, his boring son and the rest of the boring family.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So it´s a typical Ingmar-Bergman-film. The only one, which is not that way, is "The seventh seal". This film is really a gas. Quite untypical to Bergman. The other ones you can just watch, if you want to pretend you are interested in art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film isn't half bad. I think they tried to do a lot with surrealistic stuff but just didn't have the technology to do it well. It deals with a lot of really deep, mature issues, like abortion and the feelings of futility that come with old age, as well as the nature of love.I would love to see this film remade in color using some more modern cinematography, especially in some of his death-dream sequences, in particular the one where his childhood sweetheart (and cousin, incidentally) holds up a mirror to his face and tells him that life is futile. I'd definitely go see it. I highly recommend this film. It's a good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another "classic" that is hopelessly outdated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An elderly professor is on his way to get an award for his work. While traveling he thinks about his past, his family, friends and how he got to be where he is. Unfortunately the viewer is forced to watch it also!I'm a big fan of movies and I've seen other Bergman films but all the adoration this man has gotten puzzles me. His films are somber, grim (except for "Smiles of a Summer Night") and (basically) nothing ever happens in them! His "insights" into characters are ridiculously predictable and his little "lessons" about life are just laughable. I won't deny that some of his films LOOK beautiful and there's some good acting but the films themselves are boring. I heard this was a classic and should be seen by anyone interested in cinema. What I saw was a boring, grim and depressing drama that offered nothing new or interesting that I haven't seen before...and better done! The acting was good but I didn't care and wasn't interested one bit in the characters or situations. This may have been cutting edge in 1957--but I doubt it. Another overpraised drama from Bergman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Boring and Unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the age of 78 a retired physician finds his life to have been empty and meaningless. At that age men are hardly reflective, from my experience. Usually they are convinced that everything they did was right, specially when life was determined by success. But that is not all: he even has a 98(!) year old mother who contributes to his reflection. Pacing is always slow and the dialogue had a sedative effect on me. After seeing some of the dream sequences I almost started dreaming myself. So now you are warned. 6 / 10</fullReview>
