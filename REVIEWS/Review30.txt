		<shortDescription>Made My Face Hurt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The excessive world of modern pop is so soulless and pretentious, it's ripe picking for drama. The mental breakings of stars like Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Michael Jackson and others show an inherent flaw in how human beings are turned into oblivious money-making commodities, and then unceremoniously spit-out when their glimmer dies. Popstar, the brain child of the YouTube-turned-SNL stars The Lonely Island, touches on these things enough, but mostly it's just fantastic jokes. A timely and lightning-fast musical mockumentary, I could barely catch my breath from laughing. The story works as a parallel to the careers of the three Lonely Island guys themselves. Conner4Real (Samberg) is an international popstar who has grown beyond the popularity of his two Style Boyz partners (Taccone, Schaffer). While it uses that parallel effectively, it never becomes overbearing. Instead what shines are the original songs, a staple of these guys past endeavors, including their groundbreaking "SNL Digital Shorts" segments. Each one is an instant classic (i.e. "I'm So Humble", "Things in My Jeep"), played ridiculously as if they have influenced real musicians, many of whom make hilarious cameos. For those of you old enough to remember the comedy classic "Spinal Tap", this format may seem somewhat familiar. However, a distractingly blatant rip-off this is not. It uses its 30-year separation as a way to point out the modern massive difference between actual artistic influence and silly cultural nostalgia that permeates the musical landscape. And while it doesn't quite reach Spinal-Tap-heights of greatness, if you're looking for a perfect friends-night-out, this is a comedy you will be happy to visit and revisit over and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie if you love Lonely Island!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you understand Lonely Island you will love this movie. It may not be for everyone, however I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. If you don't know what Lonely Island is google them and watch them on youtube. This movie perfectly set the stage for a world were the lonely island crew had massive fans, but in reality their fanbase is rather small.Still the movie has massive laughs, the references are on point, and some of the songs are actually pretty good parodies of other genres.I give the movie a solid 9 out of 10. If I wasn't a Lonely Island fan I would still give it at least a solid 7. It's entertaining and fun, and a nice divergence from the Super Hero dominated world we have today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great movie!! I absolutely love the way its a documentary with such famous musicians and rappers adding to the satire. The story is so true and attacks the song writing skills of today's music. If you have a good beat, throw in a bunch of catch phrases with a cool voice, add another famous singer to back up with a couple of lines and you got a new hip hop/rap song. I was completely entertained and recommend this movie for anyone to sit back and enjoy great comedy. Love the fact JT dominates the nerd entourage cook and has the ability to be humble and have fun with this movie. The swearing can be a little intense but the movie stays true to the creators. Hope everyone else enjoys as much as my laughter filled evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'd think the mockumentary genre was played out by now. If you asked me before I watched this movie, I'd probably think so too. But the humor that the boys of the Lonely Island have concocted is not only completely fresh and well thought-out, but will prove to be ahead of its time some day.One-third of the comedy team, Andy Samberg, stars as Connor4Real--a Justin Bieber-esque pop icon--who's former hip-hop group broke up when he decided to start his solo career. Experiencing the downward slope of his fame and his slow decline to "has-been" status, his ego is too big to realize or admit it. Along the way, we get documentary-style interviews from real-life "contemporaries"--such as Usher and Mariah Carey--who give commentary on Connor's career.The movie is filled with at least a half-dozen songs, which are all catchy enough to be on the radio. But upon further attentiveness to the lyrics, they're laden with totally crude and offensive- -yet hilarious--content. So many jokes are completely off-kilter and have no ounce of necessity, but we're glad they happen. The humor, both subtle and broad, showcases the comedy trio's range. They use the Seth MacFarlane rapid-fire approach, but in a way where the jokes are much more uniform and cohesive. And if one doesn't work--or merely goes over the audience's head--there's another right around the corner to make us laugh and forget about it.It finds a nice balance between antics and story. But the Lonely Island have made their brand by successfully fusing political incorrectness, awkwardness and silliness. And the trio has taken it to the next level here. They have such a tight grasp on not only what's funny, but what's topical and realistic--making everything that happens in this movie feel like it could actually happen--or is actually happening. It's a great feeling to completely trust your filmmakers.The movie is directed by, and featuring, the other two members of the Lonely Island, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone. Together, with Samberg, the three of them have established such perfect chemistry over the years, that they probably don't care if you're not laughing at all because it's obvious they believe in their work and make themselves laugh, all while having a great time doing so.The humor may seem very easy to think up, but is in fact, pretty inventive. Some jokes may prove to be a bit more esoteric for those not in the industry, but there are plenty that aren't.Usually a lack of laughter comes from something not being funny. But there's an ode of confidence exuding from this film that you feel like, if you're not laughing, you just don't get the joke. Ever so slyly, the movie's main theme is a mockery of the self-absorption and self-aggrandizing of today's media and society--especially within the millennial generation. But it's never preachy. In fact, for those most caught up with what's hip, the jokes may not come of as jokes at all.Samberg has so much conviction in his role. It seems as if he truly believes every naive thing that he says and does. His character is so over-the-top, but Samberg makes him so real that it's never over-exaggerated.While a tad predictable, that's not the point. Popstar never tries to be any other film. So many times have we seen American comedies give their best shot at shamefully replicating--or reinventing--a Judd Apatow/Adam McKay/Todd Phillips/Seth Rogen style of comedy, and lose their own vision. But these guys take their own vision and have their way with it. Samberg and the Lonely Island have influenced comedy a lot in the past decade or so. And now they're changing the rules all over again.Twizard Rating: 93</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie about a lovable idiot and his friends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start with this: the movie is NOT, nor was it ever intended to be an SLN skit. I've seen a lot of reviews around the net comparing it to their digital shorts, but it's a huge mistake and if you went to the cinema expecting an extended digital short, you have only yourself to blame for the disappointment. Another type of complaint is that it's not critical enough of the pop industry, but it's also a false expectation, it was never intended to do that. If you know The Lonely Island even a little bit, you have to know that they are true fans of the music industry in general and they don't drag people. Hell, Andy didn't do it when he was supposed to, just watch his roast of James Franco. He said he wasn't comfortable with insulting people and Akiva and Jorma share this sentiment. As Kiv said in an interview: they don't throw shade, they throw sunshine. So now that I cleared up that what this movie isn't, let's see what it is. It's a fake pop documentary about popstar Conner4Real, played by Andy Samberg. It's fake in the sense that obviously Conner is not a real person and the shenanigans he gets into are over the top TLI style, but other than that it's an actual documentary with famous people commenting on the events every so often. I don't want to spoil anything so I'm gonna be vague: the boys make fun of the ridiculous situations and circumstances that goes with being someone in the center of a lot of people's attention, they point out the absurdity in the popstar lifestyle, but that's only the comedy aspect of the movie. Underneath that, this movie is about a lovable, sometimes childishly oblivious and out of thouch with reality kinda guy, who never had a normal life, so he doesn't know how to deal with it when things don't go his way and we follow his journey to learn and grow as a person. Conner may be a fictional character, but he's not a caricature, neither is anyone else in the movie. The characters might be a bit over the top sometimes which provides the comedy elements in the movie, but the friendship between Conner (Andy), Owen (Jorma) and Lawrence (Akiva) is real and touching and THAT's what this movie is about. While obviously it's a comedy, there are a few real, emotional moments in there that made me tear up. I won't tell about the story more, but I have to mention the music briefly: the songs are amazing (though I'm not a big fan of Hunter's bits) and Conner performing "Finest girl" on stage is just hot damn!In conclusion: I really liked the movie, I think the boys have every right to be proud of it, and if you don't go into this with false expectations you'll enjoy it very much too! Mark my words: it's gonna be cult classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny as F**K</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Funny as F**K, From the hilarious monologues, To the amazing celebrity cameos, To the outright offensive song lyrics which leaves you crying with laughter, Pop star: never stop stopping is a must see for any lonely island, Andy Samberg, comedy or even just music lover! I definitely recommend you see this and buy it because the lonely island need to be making more movies if they turn out like this. Go see this movie now, I just can't recommend enough. Though nearer the end of the middle act some of the jokes became dragged on a little bit, also the ending was a little predictable but to be honest i think the film was designed to be predictable, as it is parodying various musical artists. Apart from that the film isn't far from a perfect comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Little Formulaic, But Admittedly Funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping never looked all that appealing to me, but I must say it was surprisingly better than I expected. Seeing the trailers I thought the film was another in a wave of ultra dumb comedies, but up front, it's really not. Popstar is a little formulaic, but is admittedly funny, and finds a way to even be witty. Even more impressive, although not all that surprising is that some of the songs in this movie are actually pretty catchy, albeit mock-ups.For those who love This is Spinal Tap and other films of that nature, this film is a little derivative. That being said, it's not as if this is just a rehash of other better films, that entire genre does require modernizations every few years. Because this film is spoofing not only the musicians of today, but everybody in the entertainment world. That being said this film does list as another Judd Apatow film and does have some formulaic moments that appear in all of his films.The most notable "Appatowism" in this film is the overdone comedy trope of today, where the film lingers on jokes far longer than they should, under the illusion that lingering over a joke makes it funnier. It's kinda like when a goofy kid makes a great joke everybody laughs, and then the kid gets confident and keeps pushing the joke until everybody around is just wishing he'd shut up and go away. That being said, the film doesn't live off the annoying lingering joke, and succeeds at being genuinely funny, all the time. It's not the funniest movie this year, and it may not even be hilarious, but the film is consistently littered with raunchy funny jokes, that often deliver.The film was marketed poorly, in my opinion, because it came across as an ultra dumb comedy, and in reality isn't half as dumb as it comes across as. The film occasionally wanders into the dumb comedy area, but often finds it's way back into the land of witty comedies, making it somewhat of a mixed bag. For instance, the songs are catchy, they are witty reflections of our pop stars, but they are also a little too on the nose, making them come across as a little dumb. That being said, underneath the thin exterior of a dumb comedy is a really witty reflection of our current music industry, and the pressures, idiocracy, immaturity, selfishness, and chaos commonly associated with it.Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is filled with cameos from famous musicians and comedy actors, some of which even lend their singing talents to the musical pieces. At times it feels like the entire music industry is in this film, as they play along on a mockumentary making fun of them. However, the film is never really mean spirited, or all that damning it just grooves along, spoofing everybody from the musicians to the fans. For those who like the lonely island, you'll love this movie, and for those who are seeking a funny comedy, regardless of rating this is also a movie you'll love, but there should be a note, this movie really isn't for kids or the weak spined.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>POPSTAR blows the whistle on the "pop music" industry . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . disclosing that "popular" tunes are simply a random collection of notes and syllables packaged to please the diminished perception of drunken or otherwise impaired youngsters who should be out fighting terrorism, easing poverty, and tackling rapists. The 117 leading "song artists" making cameo appearances here obviously are taking great pride in delivering their spoof lines of Palavered Drivel with straight faces. The funnier thing is that you could read the same sort of Pompous Pontification in any issue of Rolling Stone and its competing Zines including self-styled "music reviews," and the pretensions on display would be even greater assaults against Common Sense and Rational Thinking. Since the advent of Autotune, your Uncle Fred and Aunt Ethel could be the equal of any "Pop Star" selling out stadiums, as long as they are limber enough to simulate obscene body positions (something within the capabilities of any individuals still able to use the toilet by themselves). The definition of "Pop Music" always has been anything that will make someone older than yourself (or the reviewer) cringe. "Pop Music" is NOT fully accessible to pop drinkers, or to people exercising their better judgment. As Brian Wilson had it, BURP SOUNDS better expresses the Essence of Pop. POPSTAR serves as a reminder NOT to take any music written since Bach seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprise hit in a unique genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While we've seen plenty of mockumentaries before it's not every year we see a new one. It's a genre that goes mostly unexplored, especially in mainstream cinema. From the trio of The Lonely Island (Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, and Akiva Schaffer) we get Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping. Popstar follows Samberg's Conner4real, a Justin Bieber-like performer with A-list celebrity status, from his time with the boy band The Style Boyz to his solo career. On the verge of his negatively received new album and a world tour Conner must cope with the potential decline of his career and his celebrity status. The film works as a hilarious satire on the music industry while also being a parody of the concert tour documentaries we've come to see from various artists such as Katy Perry, One Direction, and The Jonas Brothers. Comedy veterans Sarah Silverman and Tim Meadows make supporting appearances and Chris Redd has fun with a potential breakout role as Hunter the Hungry, a fellow musician who's on the way up while Conner is on the way down. Not every joke in the movie hit, but the ones that did had me nearly falling out of my chair in laughter. The Lonely Island are known for their super catchy and occasionally raunchy songs and Popstar delivers in that department. So much so you'll likely have the songs stuck in your head in the following days. Popstar is an overall fun time at the theater. Also, be sure to be on the lookout for the plethora of celebrity cameos Popstar sprinkles within it's 87 minute run time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie overall was not too bad. The comedy wasn't subtle or clever, but it wasn't without its moments. There were parts that made me laugh out loud, and others that got a chuckle, and some where I just wasn't amused. The obvious parallel to Justin Beiber's career is great, as I despise Beiber and everything about him. The absurdly obnoxious narcissism of Connor is for the most part, the best aspect of this movie.Spoilers below this pointThe parody of TMZ had me laughing fairly hard, one of the better jokes in this movie. However some of the songs, particularly the "Im Not Gay" and "Bin Laden" songs were not spectacularly funny.Overall, not a movie you watch for brilliant comedy or artistic value as a parody of pop culture, but a movie you can enjoy and appreciate for its funnier moments</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He just never stopped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review of Popstar Never Stop Never Stopping (spoiler free)**** (4/5)Cast: Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, Akiva Schaffer, Sarah Silverman, Tim MeadowsPlot: The life of superstar musician Conner4Real (Samberg) appears to be a charmed one, filled with groupies, screaming crowds and sacks of cash. But trouble is on the horizon in the form of a scheming rapper (Chris Redd), a disastrous merchandise deal and a swarm of killer bees.The spirit of This is Spinal Tap looms large over the latest comedy from the Lonely Island Crew. Like Rob Reiner's masterpiece, it's a mockumentary and a fun one at that with laughs coming out of the whazoo. It follows three likable idiots as they navigate the choppy waters of the music biz. There is even an update of Tap's 'Sh*t Sandwich' scene, as Conner4Real (Andy Samberg in possibly his funniest role ever) checks out reviews of his new album: rather than showing a star rating, Rolling Stone awards it the poop emoticon. Happily, rather than coming off as a pale imitation, Popstar: Never Sop Never Stopping squeezes laughs out of its tale like juice from a plum. However if the music industry was silly in the 1980s this certainly shows how silly it was but it's even daft now, and Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer gleefully go to town sending up its absurdities. Conner4Real is an ear studded jackass, whose humongous entourage includes an eyebrow specialist, a scarf caddy (that's a real thing) and a guy who punches him in the nuts to remind where he came from. Weirdly he has an army of personalized holograms that caper around the stage. Conner is a narcissist who uploads daily videos to Youtube, and who his best friend Owen (Taccone) to wear a deadmau5-like helmet that emits a terrifying light beacon and makes an ominous sound that is likely to deafen anybody that passes by. However Conner, is an attention seeker and there is nothing that he won't do to get attention ? a trait that is consistently hilarious ? and, given Miley's twerking and Kanye's tweet-based rants, it is all too plausible today. Hot Rod, which is the Lonely Island's film about a wannabe Evel Knievel, was at times hysterical, but lumbered with a weak narrative that really let it down. Popstar's set-up is simpler and more effective and won't fail to make you laugh. It turns out Conner4Real used to be just Conner, a decent guy who formed a boy band with Owen and his other buddy Lawrence (Schaffer) just because he wanted to see what it was like to be famous. When he got a taste for fame, he became a monster: Owen became his Dj-slave and Lawrence retired to a farm to whittle woodcarvings but unfortunately he hates that job but anything to get away from the monster. The story, as Owen attempts to reunite The Style Boyz which was the name of Conner's boy band, hat bit is surprisingly engaging. What they have added to the film are the inspired cameos peppered throughout the film mainly from the worlds of music (Arcade Fire, Justin Timberlake, Seal) and comedy (Will Forte, Bill Hader oddly with very long hair), and finally both (Weird Al Yankovic). On a weird note there is also a penis, which if reports are to be believed, belongs to an A-list director. This is Spinal Tap, of course was pinned around several gloriously bad songs, but they were enjoyable much like this the music is stupid but it's enjoyable even if some of it is offensive. But This is Spinal Tap lampooned around different genres of music. And Lonely Island certainly know their stuff because they know their way around a big juicy hook, which is what a song needs as anyone who has watched their Saturday Night Live videos can attest. Highlights here include Finest Girl, a sex jam with relentless references to the assassination of Osama Bin Laden, and Equal Rights, a paean to gay marriage filled with assurances that the singer is heterosexual. The tunes in this movie are whip-smart, quick-witted and stupendously dumb but that's a good because the hook makes them catchy that you'll be singing the hits well after the credits roll. In conclusion this is a quick-witted and well written comedy that will make you laugh out loud and even produce tears from your eyes. This is certainly a Lonely Island movie and probably one of the best of their movies it's completely relentless even the greatest comedy kings and queens will love it. Verdict: An absolute blast, with a frenetic strike-rate and songs that will worm their way into your ears for days. Like Conner, this comedy's for real. 8/10 incredibly funny</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm all for corny movies but this is horrible! Andy Samberg usually does good comedies but this is horrendous. It's very typical and dry. The script has been done before (similar to Hugh Grant in Music and Lyrics, just more focused and tried to make it funny), and it's annoying that they tried to make it as a documentary. This movie basically sums up Justin Biebers life. It's immature. The stupidest parts as well are the celebrity cameos. Simon Cowell?! Whether they're just trying to be funny, or trying to make it realistic then his cameo was just awful. We all know his stance on music and his opinion in the movie is just the opposite. A waste of 2 hours of my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Same erg is one of those actors whom is relatively unknown here in the UK. And to be honest, the most famous thing he's probably famous for on the shores of the UK is the Sandler Movie That's my Boy.But if you go a little deeper into his body of work, his movies are consistently funny, full of pop culture references, and with Schaffer at the helm, we not only have a wonderful satire on the state of celebrity with cameos from a plethora of stars whom are not ashamed to be self deprecating, we also have one of the funniest films of the year.But the most ingenious thing about the movie is that you can't point the finger to which celebrity the writers are parodying. One would instantly say Bieber, given the title. But Connor4Real isn't really a hateful character, in fact, he's just a product of the system, and has been spoon fed everything he has been given since his fame.But when his second album fails, the cracks begin to show for him, so he becomes desperate to save his popularity, and goes to the extreme to do so.It all sounds very much like Get Him To The Greek, and while movie too is funny, and from the house of Apatow also, Popstar just has that left-field wit about it.For example, the equal rights song is funny anyway, with Connor stating every second that he is straight, but then it goes over the top in the right way, showing a copy of Predator, and him randomly saying Hot Wings, to not let his millions of adoring fans that he is a full blooded male.And every celebrity cliché is thrown into the mix. From stupid product decisions, to relationships for the sake of status, rather than love. It sounds pretty perfunctory stuff, but it's handled in a way that doesn't treat the audience as they would need a joke explaining to them, the writers treat them with a bit of intelligence.And this is from a movie where Seal gets not only attacked by wolves, but states that he's been in that situation before.The references come thick and fast, and in my opinion the Tony? Scene is one of the funniest scenes of the year.Like most comedies that are original and fire all cannons to begin with, it runs out of steam before the end, but then they have a secret weapon up, their sleeves......Michael Bolton.Highly original, consistently funny, but treating the audience in a way that most comedies don't do these days (Dirty Grandpa, Bad Neighbours 2), Popstar: NSNS is as stupid as it is brilliant.Well worth seeing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a satire like this to work, it needs to have its heart in the right place. I was hesitant when watching the trailers, but fortunately the film doesn't lose track of the bigger humanization with these characters and it wears its heart on its sleeve. But perhaps that's also why it didn't go as far as it could have gone, and when all is said and done, perhaps plays things a little too safely. Still, it's vastly entertaining and the performances are aces. Andy Samberg excels at the comedy but also on making the lead a very likable protagonist, no mater his flaws. It's very easy to root for him. As a whole, definitely go seek this out and recommend it to your friends. Very underrated film that deserved to be bigger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Andy Samberg made this?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andy Samberg is a funny guy. I've always enjoyed his Lonely Island videos on Saturday Night Live and I like the fact that he gets outrageous and over the top. This movie is absolutely terrible, and I really looked forward to seeing it. It's not funny in the least, it's incredibly pedestrian, and very, very dull.What was he thinking when he made this? The humor is like something out of a network sitcom and the script is dated and totally predictable. It clearly had a huge budget, and there are cameos from a lot of pop stars, and every single one of them is wasted. I think I laughed only one time in the film, and it was during a satire of TMZ.Don't waste your time or your money on this. Twenty minutes into the film I realized it wasn't going to go anywhere and I found myself getting more and more impatient for it to be over. I finally gave up and walked out after an hour, which is something I rarely ever do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny all the way through.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a musical mockumentary directed by Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone. The film stars Andy Samberg on the lead role as the popstar and co-stars Sarah Silverman, Tim Meadows, Imogen Poots, Joan Cusack and Maya Rudolph. This movie is basically a satire of the celebrity life (Justin Bieber much ?) and the way that famous people react to falling from grace among other things. I personally really liked this film, it was incredibly funny all the way through and Andy Samberg does a fantastic job on the role here. He's actually really funny and we're once again reminded of his talent. The soundtrack is also unbelievably amazing, all the songs have a really catchy beat and funny lyrics that just replay on your head for a long time after hearing them. It does drag on for quite a bit unfortunately even though it is only 86 minutes it felt like much longer. Also the movie is filled with clichés but I guess that is not the point of the film because it was never trying to shy away from them or be something ground breaking. It is just a fun flick to watch when you have free time and I appreciate it for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty much everyone has linked this movie to This Is Spinal Tap, and with good reason - the fairly predictable story of a music star's rise to fame and career collapse isn't anything new or fresh, but it's one that can be easily translated into the new generation of auto-tune and backing tracks.Following the story of Connor4real, the story is actually fairly boring - the things that make it work are the hilariously random screenplay and snappy editing, bringing the run time to a sharp 80 minutes. That combined with a haul of celebrity cameos, from Simon Cowell and Mariah Carey to Pharrell Williams and Snoop Dogg, chipping in with quick one-liners keep your attention focused and enthralled for the majority of the movie, even when it loses steam near the end.The other great thing about the writing is the soundtrack. Several hilarious songs take a generic idea to the next level - songs about Bin Laden, Thpain, Mona Lisa, the list goes on, and it's so tongue-in- cheek you can't help but laugh! The gigs are well designed and choreographed too, with great use of backing dancers and bizarre robotic head- wear!So, it's nothing special, and won't go down in history like Spinal Tap, but for what it's worth, Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a punchy, clever and funny flick with plenty of laughs and fun - well worth a watch!4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing comedy that pokes fun at pop culture and idolatry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it gets a bit old after awhile, this is still a ingenious comedy that pokes fun at pop culture and how stupid worshiping idols really is. It's a parody comedy that is set in documentary form, kind of like those documentaries that try to portray how great pop singers are as they go on tour. Sure, this movie uses a like of pop- culture references and celebrity cameos for most of it's humor. But c'mon the title of this movie is "Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping". I usually found the The Lonely Island crew to be pretty darn funny with there skits and music videos. So for a movie like this, they really brought all their talents to the table. The direction when it comes down to it, is actually quite predictable and has been done before when it comes to the three amigos having a conflict with each other with one being the middle man. But it's not the direction that makes a movie such as this, but it's the process and how the interactions and humor plays out. I give this movie a 8/10 because of it's clever humor. I would have given it a higher score if it still carried the momentum it had that lasted for about an hour, then it started to go downwards. If this movie is not that funny for some viewers, it's at least amusing. Lastly the soundtrack for this movie is tight with it's original track, well at least for a comedy.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved every second of this movie! The comedy is on point, and the music is classic Lonely Island. I can't help but wonder how these guys come up with these things. Andy Samberg is perfect for the role, and the rest of the cast is also amazing. I would recommend this to anyone who's looking for some light entertainment and a good laugh. I'm also amazed at how TLI and Apatow has gotten almost every single famous person in the music industry to participate in this movie. Fanboy Usher was just amazing. And not to mention Justin Timberlake. I laughed so hard I cried.I'm most definitely making my boyfriend watch this as well, just so I can watch it again. STYLEBOYZ 4LIFE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satirical Look at Our Celebrity Obsessed Culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mockumentary style of filmmaking can be a divisive one. You have to balance the tone well enough for viewers to believe in the story you're trying to tell while also giving enough laughs to please the fans of the genre. Even if Popstar didn't produce as many big laughs as I would have hoped, I can appreciate the attempt to change the structure to typical filmmaking.Starring the trio from The Lonely Island and pretty much every other comedian and/or celebrity, Popstar has a tendency to rely too heavily on surprise cameos and over-the-top gags. That's not to say I didn't think the main cast had their moments, they did. But the biggest laughs came from surprise appearances from people I didn't know were in the film.The overabundance of celebrities make me curious as to why virtually no one showed up to the theatre to see the film. It's also not like they didn't properly market the film. The trailers show exactly what you're going to get; a raunchy comedy told with in the mockumentary style about a dysfunctional lead singer who struggles to regain fame, with plenty of cameos mixed in. Perhaps there just isn't the audience for this type of story.The other detraction of Popstar is that it's blatantly predictable. We all know how these films about music stars/bands go, there's a breakup, downfall, and usually a rise. So when the film reaches for a little bit of dramatic weight via one of these clichés, you see it coming a mile away. With all this said, there's plenty of entertainment to be had here. It's a quick watch and the film definitely earns its R rating in a good way, so I can see the appeal here for comedy fans or anyone who has watched SNL in the last 10 years or so. But I think there just needed to be a few more big laughs under a more original story.+Surprise cameos+Lonely Island chemistry-Sometimes story takes second to cameos-Predictable5.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spinal Tap Comparisons Are Inevitable But This Stands On Its Own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lonely Island was my introduction to Andy Samberg and his comedic prowess. He was a bright spot on SNL as well. I do feel that he is markedly underutilized in Brooklyn 99. That show itself is preposterous. Thankfully, there are movies like Popstar which give Samberg a chance to to do what he does best - act as if he is a genuine moron in a hilariously natural way. This movie is a work of satire that can't be overlooked. It is quite balanced in its critique of the music industry today. The mockumentary style and the fact that it focuses on mainstream music is obviously going to draw comparisons with 'This is Spinal Tap' but I would say cut it some slack. We all know how music has changed over time. What has remained consistent though, is the narcissism and un-hinged lifestyle of the stars. Sure, there are more things to buy now and the superstar man-child can just break more stuff when he's sad for the most stupid reasons but in essence it is all same old same old. On the sidenote, if you've to compare this movie then do it with Samberg's own - 7 days in hell. I think he is onto this mockumentary genre and is determined to perfect it. Popstar has its heart in the right place when it comes to the message - true friendship and simplicity matters at the end. There are moments in it that are similar to the Spinal Tap, for example when the band hits a low or when Nigel and David bury the hatchet and start playing music again. There are a lot of funny dialogues and shenanigans. Serving dog poop pancakes to test honesty among 'friends' being one. However, it does not take us into the unfamiliar zone. It doesn't tell us anything about the so called gods of pop music that we don't already know. How many times have we heard that music business is tough? As the band manager succinctly adds "The highs are high and lows are really low". Probably, that's the real irony of media that it parodies itself (the TMZ bit) within a satire and doesn't come off as anything shocking. Maybe that's the point of Popstar in showing him a little too honest with his fans on his Snapchat or Instagram but the fans still going crazy over his lameness. Well, who am I to complain? I can probably watch it a couple of times with friends just for the laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie With My Favourite Band</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved Popstar: Never Stop, Never Stopping. I loved how the got a really good message across, even if young people ,who require that message the most, can't see it. My favourite part is when the boys are in the car and (Spoiler Alert, Spoiler Alert) Conner's fans show him a butt with 'I Love Conner' written on it and when Conner is asked to sign a woman's breasts. Conner goes to sign the breasts and is greeted with a mans penis. I loved this movie because it blended music and humour really well. I would recommend watching 'Brooklyn Nine Nine,' 'Hot Rod' and listening to the Lonely Island if you watch this movie. I would also recommend that you are ready for huge amounts of swearing, laughs and of course, amazing music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure why the average score is at 6.9, because I enjoyed this movie a lot! Although some jokes were a little predictable because of the trailer I still thought this was over all an amazing "mock- umentary". Every song was catchy no matter how ridiculous the lyrics were, I understood surprisingly many references, such as DMZ (TMZ) and the Justin Timberlake and Michael Bolton nod backs to The Lonely Island's previous songs.Even though the movie is pretty exaggerated I think there's still a lot of truth in it, like having fake friends, how the media is portrayed and how stupid the public can seem when they blame celebrities for things that was obviously not their fault (Seal getting bit by wolves).Speaking of celebrities, I loved all the appearances, THERE WERE SO MANY! Usher, Emma Stone, Jimmy Fallon, 50 Cent, Ringo Starr, Simon Cowell and so, so many more, really impressive.According to the IMDb page they made around 10 million dollars less than they had for their budget, which is a shame because of how great all these characters were and that I would really love seeing a sequel with even more of dope songs and see where these characters go next.Lonely Island, never change &lt;3</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will get straight to the point I am a fan of Lonely Island and all genres of movies but this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Not one bit funny. Cheesy jokes and very cringe worthy. Not as bad as Meet The Spartans(as worst movie of all time) but nearly on par. I am easily pleased when hungover with comedies but this made my life hell watching this. This is my 2nd review only after Meet The Spartans which came out 8 years ago. I don't like to complain but I am passionate about how I feel about this shocker. I will watch this movie again as I did for Meet The Spartans to give it a second chance. Everyone deserves a second chance right but I am expecting the same outcome for Meet The Spartans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reliably Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things I loved to do when I was a kid was hook up my old camcorder to the TV and face them towards each other. The effect would create a swirl of constantly moving frames that would eat into each other like reflections on either side of a fun house mirror. Popstar is kind of like doing that. It points the camera at fictional pop superstar Conner (Samberg) but it might as well be pointing it directly at the music industry, creating a post- modernist spiral of superficiality that is at once hilarious and distressing.Taking cues from modern music vanity projects (though from Justin Bieber: Never Say Never (2011) especially), Popstar follows music icon Conner as he prepares for a world tour and awaits the reception of his newest album. Conner was formerly a member of The Style Boyz a Beastie Boys inspired trio co-developed by Lawrence "Kid Brain" Dunn (Schaffer) and Owen "Kid Contact" Bouchard. These days he's dubbed himself Conner4Real and replaced the embittered Lawrence with a constant stream of social media updates. Owen is still around though he's been relegated to the status of iPod shuffling DJ on Conner's world tour.Popstar is arguably one of the most savagely entertaining music industry satire to come out in the last few years. While constantly focused on the low-hanging fruit of celebrity personal branding, product-placement, reality TV inspired banality and faux savoir- faire worldliness, audiences can't help but respond with heaps of constant laughter. The laughter becomes louder when The Lonely Island crew cuts deep into Hollywood's insincere sanctimony and egoism such as when Conner releases "Same Love" inspired "Equal Rights" which reiterates Conner heterosexuality one too many times.The film is littered with an obscene amount of musical celebrity cameos ranging from Danger Mouse, and RZA to Michael Bolton and Weird Al Yankovic many of which play themselves and give sit down commentary on how their music was inspired by Conner's "superior" abilities. This in itself is a funny premise but the movie takes it to the nth degree allowing celebrities to savagely mock themselves and each other with the absurdity of A$AP Rocky hawking school lunchables. Let's face it, any movie that begins with holographic versions of Adam Levine dry humping himself while Conner sings "I'm so humble" in the background is clearly setting a mocking tone.That said there are some jokes that just don't work, the most egregious of which is Popstar's parody of TMZ, CMZ. The set-piece hopes to coax laughter out of sycophantic shrieking and Will Arnett's need to always have a straw in his mouth. This along with tour sponsorship being handled by washing machine manufacturer Aquaspin are more bizarre than funny.Yet with the sheer amount of visual humor, clever dialogue, goofy- comic setups and a richly layered meta-text, you can't help but enjoy a movie so crudely and gleefully nutty (in more ways than one). The musical interludes are boat loads of fun; Lonely Island's "Finest Girl (Bin Laden Song)" being the real showstopper. Andy Sandberg, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone are clearly at the top of their game and with any luck, still have a few more witty tunes to churn out in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping (2016): Dir: Akiva Schaffer, Jorma Taccone / Cast: Andy Sanberg, Jorma Taccone, Akiva Schaffer, Tim Meadows, Sarah Silverman: Like the underrated Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story here is a mockumentary about the rise and fall of fame. Andy Samberg plays Conner Friel who fronts Conner4Real where he gives exaggerated performances that are mock by the media. He leaves his previous band the Style Boyz by walking over everyone with his ego. He announces his new album that offensively addresses themes of gay marriage. Jorma Taccone plays his DJ who is reduced to wearing a blinking lights oversized helmet on stage. Akiva Schaffer plays Lawrence, a song writer who left the band to become a wood worker on a farm. He resents Conner because of his ego and taking credit for his writing. Tim Meadows plays Conner's frustrated manager, and Sarah Silverman plays his publicist who must present a dose of reality to Conner when he is shamed and reduced to a drunken state at his mother's house. There is numerous celebrity cameos that are usually involved in mock music videos. Taccone and Schaffer also serve as directors and they blend comedy with the reality of fame. The production is flashy and fit the mood but the humor may draw protest from those who are not interested in seeing Samberg autograph a penis that emerges through the rolled down window of his limousine. Theme regards egos and fame and the crash that occurs when they meet. The result is funny and innovative but doesn't walk as hard as Dewey Cox. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

A lot of famous stars are interviewed, all proclaiming how amazing Conner is. That itself is so funny! The events portrayed are just so funny! I'm particularly amused by Seal making fun of himself.

		<fullReview>When I first looked at the movie, I thought it was so boring that I almost fell asleep after watching twenty minutes of it. I'm really disappointed with Lonely Island including Andy Samberg, they are just so talented and funny. However, I didn't find it funny or enjoyable, I found it just too slow for me. All they do is talk too much crap and nothing more, I like the songs but without liking the movie, it would be the worst experience for me to waste time looking at it. Why did they have to make Samberg look like a Justin Bieber type, that look doesn't suit him... He's just better to act as himself when he was on SNL ages ago. Or they could've just done a movie about Lonely Island with having a story-line, not a mockumentry..I think this isn't the best movie that Lonely Island and worse, this is the first.

Although the movie doesn't have you busting your gut through the entire showing it has it's moments. So if you like The Lonely Island, or Andy Sandberg's humor, go see the movie! In addition I will say I found the music in the film quite entertaining.

		<fullReview>This is a silly gut-busting delight, the kind of movie that I'd see with my dad if I saw more movies with him - it's basically what I'd call "Son of Spinal Tap" and like when you got the "Son of" movies of old (Song of Kong, Son of Frankenstein, whatever) it's not up to par with that, but then that's among the funniest comedies of all time. The "Lonely Island" team may take on some targets who are almost so obscenely ridiculous in real life - ie Justin Bieber's comments after leaving the Anne Frank house - but they have an excellent instinct for taking on these targets in the pop music world of today, which is just about unlistenable in many respects, and throwing on the silliness and vulgarity but the vulgarity works because it's from a place that's not really mean.The main character of Samberg's, "Connor 4-Real", is one of those lovable self-obsessed idiots of the movies who works because he is so unaware of how dickish he acts to people around him. There are times where the improv approach as it's an Apatow production by the way goes on a bit too long, mostly in the second half of the movie (the first half fires on all cylinders and largely in part due to the songs and music videos with themes like "I'm so Humble" and f***ing a woman as if it was killing Bin Laden!) But on the whole I found a lot of really sharp actors around Samberg - Tim Meadows, Sarah Silverman, Justin Timberlake, and many other 'real' people (and a helluva running cameo from Will Arnett, the highlight of the movie for me as a "CMZ" chief editor ala TMZ) - that makes it consistently funny.And it's the kind of dopey modern satire I like if it has to be done this way at a big studio level: keep the gags and jokes coming, even if they involve penises (and this movie has one of the better ones), and if there's a gag that falls flat there's one in a minute that will keep the pace back up, whether it has to do with "10 seconds to Mars" (it's a band, not a fact) or unexpected celebrities like Seal and the Rza. Call it a semi-guilty pleasure but I had a lot of laughs here, and more than some other SNL movies I can think of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeper Thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many viewers believe that this movie is rather stupid; however, I believe it is quite the opposite. On an intellectual level the movie takes many celebrity stereotypes and impresses them on one person. Using humor the movie sheds a light on how trivial this idea of a popstar really is. With the character of Conner we see hints of stars like Justin Bieber (a kid that grew up in the business and having issues with handling adult situations) and Justin Timberlake (a once boy band front man turned huge solo act). The movie also messes with the idea of the over popularized love for boy bands and comebacks. Much like the Backstreet Boys, the Style Boyz had been a band for years. People in the movie grew up listening to them and worshiping them so when they broke up it was heartbreaking in return when they got back together it was an long awaited and emotional experience for the world inside the movie. At the same time with songs like "Finest Girl" and "Equal Rights" the movie not only shows how much freedom we give to famous people solely based on their celebrity status but also how much we as a society care about current and past events. For some this movie may just seem like a big joke and never give it a second thought but beneath the surface this movie is more than a mockumentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'd think the mockumentary genre was played out by now. If you asked me before I watched this movie, I'd probably think so too. But the humor that the boys of the Lonely Island have concocted is not only completely fresh and well thought-out, but will prove to be ahead of its time some day.One-third of the comedy team, Andy Samberg, stars as Connor4Real--a Justin Bieber-esque pop icon--who's former hip-hop group broke up when he decided to start his solo career. Experiencing the downward slope of his fame and his slow decline to "has-been" status, his ego is too big to realize or admit it. Along the way, we get documentary-style interviews from real-life "contemporaries"--such as Usher and Mariah Carey--who give commentary on Connor's career.The movie is filled with at least a half-dozen songs, which are all catchy enough to be on the radio. But upon further attentiveness to the lyrics, they're laden with totally crude and offensive- -yet hilarious--content. So many jokes are completely off-kilter and have no ounce of necessity, but we're glad they happen. The humor, both subtle and broad, showcases the comedy trio's range. They use the Seth MacFarlane rapid-fire approach, but in a way where the jokes are much more uniform and cohesive. And if one doesn't work--or merely goes over the audience's head--there's another right around the corner to make us laugh and forget about it.It finds a nice balance between antics and story. But the Lonely Island have made their brand by successfully fusing political incorrectness, awkwardness and silliness. And the trio has taken it to the next level here. They have such a tight grasp on not only what's funny, but what's topical and realistic--making everything that happens in this movie feel like it could actually happen--or is actually happening. It's a great feeling to completely trust your filmmakers.The movie is directed by, and featuring, the other two members of the Lonely Island, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone. Together, with Samberg, the three of them have established such perfect chemistry over the years, that they probably don't care if you're not laughing at all because it's obvious they believe in their work and make themselves laugh, all while having a great time doing so.The humor may seem very easy to think up, but is in fact, pretty inventive. Some jokes may prove to be a bit more esoteric for those not in the industry, but there are plenty that aren't.Usually a lack of laughter comes from something not being funny. But there's an ode of confidence exuding from this film that you feel like, if you're not laughing, you just don't get the joke. Ever so slyly, the movie's main theme is a mockery of the self-absorption and self-aggrandizing of today's media and society--especially within the millennial generation. But it's never preachy. In fact, for those most caught up with what's hip, the jokes may not come of as jokes at all.Samberg has so much conviction in his role. It seems as if he truly believes every naive thing that he says and does. His character is so over-the-top, but Samberg makes him so real that it's never over-exaggerated.While a tad predictable, that's not the point. Popstar never tries to be any other film. So many times have we seen American comedies give their best shot at shamefully replicating--or reinventing--a Judd Apatow/Adam McKay/Todd Phillips/Seth Rogen style of comedy, and lose their own vision. But these guys take their own vision and have their way with it. Samberg and the Lonely Island have influenced comedy a lot in the past decade or so. And now they're changing the rules all over again.Twizard Rating: 93</fullReview>

I get what's happening here though regarding the undeserved high rating. Put simply...I am a Catholic but would not feel the need to stand behind a film purely because of it's Catholic cast if you catch my drift...also there are not as many Catholic movie producers in Hollywood that would artificially inflate the rating of a film with a predominantly Christian cast...thank er... God lol....this principle was lost however, on the 4700 delusional individuals that found this film worthy of their support.This is an awful film pure and simple with humour that appeals to a more juvenile audience....and almost a direct rip off of Aussie comedian Chris Lilley's S-Mouse Rapper.I found myself actually embarrassed for the cast as all of them have done far better work than this. Chelsea Peretti for one is a hell of a lot funnier than the appalling un-funny cringy dialogue in this movie suggests. I baled after 35 minutes...see how long you can last.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lonely Island crew return to the big screen. It has been some years since Andy Sandberg's starring role Hotrod. His star power has ebbed and flowed over the year and from the abysmal box office performance of this first film's opening weekend, it looks like he can't carry a summer movie to a large profit. Despite the low performance, Popstar is a decently funny film.Sandberg extends a Saturday Night Live skit into Connor4Real, a clueless pop icon on the verge of releasing his second solo album and recording a documentary. The story hints a lot oat Sandberg's other two Lonely Island bandmates Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer. Early in Connor's career, the group formed the StyleBoyz and became popular from a ridiculous dance known as the DonkeyRoll. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SNL Sketch That Lasted Too Long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Popstar:Never Stop Never Stopping", Andy Samberg-That's My Boy, Hot Rod; Jorma Taccone-Grown Ups 2, Hot Rod; Akiva Schaffer-Neighbors, Hot Rod; Sarah Silverman-A Million Ways to Die In the West, There's Something About Mary and Tim Meadows-The Goldbergs_tv, Grown Ups 2.This is a mockumentary about a fictional rap group called The Style Boyz. It is written, directed and stars a real group called The Lonely Island-which consists of Andy, Jorma and Akiva-with Jorma &amp; Akiva directing and all 3 writing &amp; starring in it. I guess it could be about a lot of artists in the business but they have said that it is loosely based on Justin Bieber. Andy, Jorma and Akiva grew up together as best buds in a boy band-The Style Boyz-and had minor success, before Andy decided to go the solo route. Sarah and Tim work for Andy in a manager type capacity but Andy doesn't seem to become as popular on his own, as he thought he would be. There are lots of cameos from the music and entertainment world; one of the funniest is Justin Timberlake as Andy's personal chef. Most of the real music cameos will praise Andy and mention how much their lives have been influenced by him. There are a few funny parts but overall, it was like a SNL sketch that went on for a little too long. There is a scene just as the end credits start but nothing at the very end. It's rated "R" for language, drug use and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 26 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I don't think I would rent it, either. If you really want to see it, I'd wait until it comes to cable if I were you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only ONE-WORD explains this film for me......S T U P I D Walked-out of theater within first 45 minutes...surprised I lasted that long?? Was expecting something so much better after viewing Trailers?? I thought it was going to be an actual Feature-Film and Not a Documentary-Type Format Film, along the lines of 2003 Malibu's Most Wanted with Jamie Kennedy, but only better, especially with this All-Star Cast......Very Disappointing! I'm convinced that it was more of the "Film-Format" that I disliked than the Content and Acting. Only thing left-missing was to Stamp SUCKER on my forehead as I exited. Surprisingly, theater management allowed me to see another film at their complex, so my time &amp; money was Not Totally Wasted. BTW= Connor4Real?? Think that was the Name of My Drug Dealer in the 70's or maybe I'm think'n of Pee-Wee Herman(Derek4Real)in Film "BLOW" with Johnny Depp?? Yeah, that's probably where they got the name!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly the worst film I have ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many films in this world. Millions. Billions, maybe. I cannot profess to have seen all of them, but I have seen at least 1,000, and probably more. Furthermore, I do not pretend to be hypersensitive to the fine arts. I am a viewer, not a trained filmmaker. Nevertheless, I have seen some really awful films. Now, granted, the definition of awful changes from person to person. However, Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping (2016) is the single worst film I have ever laid eyes on.I have been cooped up in my apartment for the last few days, and was in the mood for something fun. I heard this film was a comedy. Ha! The joke's on me! The reviews looked pretty good, and I have not seen the previews, so I read some of the reviews. Those couldn't possibly have been reviews for this film. They said that although this film missed some of its mark, it remained smart, entertaining pop culture satire. Pardon me, I am laughing as I write this.One minute into Popstar, my reaction was, "Seriously?" Three minutes in, my reaction was, "My God, this is horrible! I wonder if I should leave?" Five minutes in, I thought, "This is in no way entertaining. I hope this is just a joke that ends soon." Seven minutes in, it dawned upon me, "Holy cow, they are completely serious." This is how they wanted to make the film. Finally, nine minutes in, I decided to stay for the entire damn movie, because I was going to watch them destroy pop culture, rape my mind, and ruin America. Sorry if I seem overwrought, but the film really is that bad.It's not that Popstar doesn't try; it tries very hard. It tries to be the worst, most tasteless film ever produced by humanity. The film follows a popstar, Connor4Real, played by Andy Samberg, as he comes out with his second solo album. He used to belong to a group called Style Boyz, whose members are played by Samberg's real-life "comedy" troupe, "The Lonely Island". Connor's second solo album starts to tank, and he makes music videos, goes on tour, and interacts with people in his life and business, who are played by a veritable Who's Who of D-List celebrities, except for his publicist, who is played by comedienne Sarah Silverman, who definitely does not give her all for this film. This film insults a number of A-List celebrities by using stock footage of them to associate them with the goings on in the film. A number of other celebrities appear throughout the film to talk about turns of events, and you get the feeling that most or all of them had no clue what they were signing up for.The film contains many songs authored by The Lonely Island. The songs have the most artificial, forced, intentionally offensive lyrics that one can contemplate. It is stretching it too much to call them music. There are a number of jokes, but they either have no punchlines, or the punchlines do not meet up with the setup. There are only a couple of jokes that actually make you laugh, and you get the distinct impression that those were mistakes on the parts of the writers. The writers, of course, are also The Lonely Island. There is gratuitous nudity, including director Judd Apatow's penis shoved brazenly in your face. He of course directs this film. Popstar film is meant to scandalize, and does not shy away from alienating many populations when possible. This film is also extremely gross, involving turtle vomit and fecal pancakes among other things. This film will have you cringing, sighing, gasping, groaning, and hiding behind anything and anyone just to catch some peace. This could have been an incredibly successful satire of the modern pop culture phenomenon. Instead, it is absolute, unmitigated trash. At the end of my viewing, I laughed and clapped for several minutes straight. I truly did not know that such a horrible film was possible. Hats off to the cast and crew for lowering the bar of film by several degrees. This film is endemic of a huge problem with this country, and to some degree the world. America is constantly dumbing down, but that assumes that some vestigial amount of intellect is left. This film has no intellect. Common sense has been murdered with a butter knife, and shut down the port-a-potty.ConclusionPopstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is, to my knowledge, the worst film ever made. On a 1 to 10 rating scale I give it 1. On a 1 to 5 rating scale I give it 1.Good God, this is horrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty silly and fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scene in the new comedy POPSTAR: NEVER STOP NEVER STOPPING that made me laugh the most was when the out of touch POPSTAR played by Andy Samberg autographs a penis. If this set up sounds like something you might get a chuckle out of, keep reading. If not, you may go back to whatever else you were doing.Okay...that should have gotten rid of the contingent that this is movie is NOT for. For the rest of you degenerates, I would highly recommend POPSTAR: NEVER STOP NEVER STOPPING as a laugh out load jokefest that skewers just about everything in modern POPSTAR-ism.Andy Samberg stars as white rapper Superstar Connor who is living off the enormous popularity of his first solo album. When his 2nd album tanks, Connor tries everything in his power to stay on top. And those things are pretty silly, crude, funny, grotesque, inappropriate, foul...you get the point. If that type of humor appeals to you (and it does to me), then you'll enjoy this.Samberg co-wrote this film with his THE LONELY ISLAND compatriots Jorma Taccone (who co-stars) and Akiva Schaffer (who co-stars and directs). These 3 grew up on Saturday Night Live and this film has the feel of a variety of sketches tied together, fairly successfully, into a film. Samberg brings the right amount of cluelessness, selfishness and charm to the role of Connor which gives us a character that we can root for and against. He is ably assisted by co-stars Schaffer and Taccone as well as a litany of comedy and musical guest stars - mostly in cameos. The likes of Maya Rudolph, Bill Hader, Sarah Silverman, Tim Meadows, Joan Cusack, Will Arnett and Kevin Nealon all join in on the fun as well as musical stalwarts Carrie Underwood, Usher, 50 Cent, Ringo Starr, Adam Levine and Mariah Carey, to name just a few. They all come on the screen with great energy and play along just right.Is it a "classic" comedy? Well...no. But it's a pretty good one that gave me enough laughs - including the penis joke belly laugh - that enables me to strongly recommend this film. If you're looking for a 90 minute escape, then you will be well rewarded by POPSTAR, it's well worth seeing.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what it is but I call it the Family Guy and Ricky Gervais effect. People try to act and sound like the Family Guy characters or in the UK like Ricky Gervais. It is a kind of way they speak, they keep a joke going on too long and add words that don't need to be there for comedy affect. They talk over each other because they think it looks 'more authentic' as in the way real people speak. Pitch Perfect 2 being a perfect example of this. Comedy now is just a cringe fest. It is not funny at all. If you look at comedies pre 2008 they are some great really funny, well done classic comedies. I wish that Family Guy had never happened because it has single handedly destroyed comedy, even The Simpsons try to copy it and it is the worst, most un-funniest show that has ever been on TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously if you don't like goofy movies you're not going to like it. But it you love the lonely island this movie is a 10. I loved it. It's a laugh out loud funny movie if you like their style of jokes. I'd watch it again.Makes fun of a lot of people inside and out of the music industry. Most of the new songs in the movie fit very well as it pertains to following a story-line. An R rated happy go lucky movie. If you want to leave the movie theater with a smile on your face rather than disappointment of the world's tragedies I can't suggest this movie more. It's a 10/10 for me. Average audience I'd say a strong 7/10. No stupid over used Seth Rogen jokes in this movie. Thank the LORD!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly spot on satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like the previous songs and videos of the "Lonely Island" than you will love this film, if you didn't, than you might want to spend your money on something else. This movie was a brilliant on the nose satire of the way of life being lived by a lot of the stars that cameo in this very movie. The jokes walk a fine line between being stupid (but still funny) and clever wit disguised with a "stupid joke" coating. All in all it was a good movie, one of the best new comedies I've seen in a while, and I would definitely recommend it. It can be difficult to create a comedy movie because it's hard to keep a joke going for an hour, Popstar does a great job of this task.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it constantly laugh out loud funny? No. Is it worth a watch? Yes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to go into this movie knowing it's satire. There are so many reviews interpreting this as a serious movie, and it is not. Basically, this is a "mockumentary" sort of movie about the fictional character Connor and his solo act "Connor4Real". The mockumentary format can be a bit offputting to some, so keep that in mind. I got used to it pretty fast, though. Most of the jokes were met with that slight "heh" and exhale you do when something is funny, but not funny enough to warrant an actual laugh at. There were a few scenes where everyone in the theater lost it, though. This plays out like a long SNL/Lonely Island sketch, and for some people that is good, and others it is bad. If you enjoy the Lonely Island's previous work, you'll most likely enjoy this. Check out their official Youtube channel; they've posted some clips from the movie if you want to see the kind of comedy in it.If you have some time to spare, go see this movie. If you have to make time to see it, I would wait until it is released on DVD or streaming. My reaction to it is an "Eh, it was good".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Popstar: Never Stop Never StoppingDirected by Lonely Island's own Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone, Popstar is a faux-documentary comedy about the rise, fall of Conner4Real. Originally apart of a boy band, Conner4Real leaves his group to go solo only to get full of himself, similar to other real life pop stars. The film pokes fun at real pop stars throughout the film.Conner4Real is played by SNL and Lonely Island's Andy Samberg. He plays the silly, ignorant and sometimes stupid pop star. There was no real acting done since Andy was playing himself. I didn't like That's My Boy, or Hot Rod, and the only film I liked him in was I Love You, Man where he played a small but memorable role. Jorma Taccone plays Owen, Conner4Real's best friend and one third of Styleboyz which is their boy band. The other third is Lawrence the last of the Lonely Island, Akiva Schaffer. Owen is the friend that never left, where Lawrence plays the one who left. This adds a bit of conflict for a film that really is just a conglomerate of music videos.The problem with the film is that I had already seen many of the funny moments on YouTube. I know a majority of movie-goers don't follow the Lonely Island and it shows in the box-office. I counted three times the film made me laugh, but I imagine if I had not seen the publicity and went in blind I might have laughed more.Verdict: I can't say don't see the film. It is going to offend an older audience, 100%. It's funny, and that's what a comedy is supposed to do. For that I recommend watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fans of Andy Samberg's film Hot Rod have waited a long time to see something that matched the humor and feel of that classic comedy. The Lonely Island has brought its unique brand of comedy to the small screen with SNL skits, and Popstar is a classic return to the big screen. While bizarre and goofy, it was filled with funny moments, especially to those who have seen all the music videos of The Lonely Island. With many references to previous skits, it will be enjoyable for fans of the show, but I could see how those unfamiliar with The Lonely Island will find the movie somewhat dumb and lacking in humor. I found Popstar fairly funny throughout, with a few laugh out loud moments. I will admit the story line was stretched and ridiculous, but it was never meant to be taken too seriously to begin with. I would probably see this again, and would recommend it to those who are familiar with Andy Samberg and Company's previous works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but in our house..the score was a solid 10 from all of us.What is puzzling to me...if you are not a Samberg fan, nor a fan of Lonely Island, why in the world would you go see this, and then score it low? There are dozens of choices out there; movies are $10+. Why, if you either don't like their humor or, worse yet, don't "get" their humor, why would you spend your money?For those of us who are fans (and some who didn't really know what to expect) the movie was nothing short of brilliant Pitch perfect in most spots; laugh out loud funny in the rest. Just really well done. The cameos are a hoot, the plot is serviceable, but the star is the music. Those Lonely Island songs are hysterical.Oh - and the helmet worn by Jorma as Samberg's DJ should get a billing of its own.I am puzzled by posts from people who question that "30 seconds to Mars" joke. If you honestly don't get that joke (and believe it was in the trailer) then please, save your money. If you didn't think that was funny (or you didn't get it) I'll just say, kindly, don't go. This is not for you.And for those who are whining about it being filthy and disgusting - - oh my gosh, it's Samberg and it's rated R. You're either an idiot or you don't understand the movie rating system.Great movie. Hope the boys take this and roll with it and give us some more Style Boyz...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amusing mockumentary in the vein of Spinal Tap. Andy Sandberg stars as vapid pop star Conner, who came to popularity through a hip-hop group he founded with his two best friends (the other two members of Lonely Island and the directors of the film, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone) but who has recently gone solo. Taccone has stayed on as his DJ, but he mostly just plays music through his iPod at concerts. Schaffer was infuriated with Conner's behavior and has gone rustic and become a farmer. The film is very silly and a lot of fun, with plenty of great gags, hilarious songs, and entertaining cameos. I do think it runs out of steam as it nears the end - it has to wrap up the plot and becomes semi-serious, and it kind of harms the momentum. I must beg AMPAS to recognize "I'm So Humble" and/or "Equal Rights" for Best Original Song next year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lonely Island get a funny movie out of Popstar: Never Stop Never Stoping, even if the joke runs out too soon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best movies about show business are usually done as mockumentaries. Somehow, the style feels more real when ironically, nothing about the characters are real themselves. A lot of it comes down that the people making the mockumentary probably understand the most about troubles and tribulation on what goes on behind the curtain. They know that the biggest stars are the craziest people around. They've figured out how unforgiving that show business world can be. They especially know how hard life can still be with the fame (or without it). Though there are plenty of regular feature films that have parodied the show business world fine enough, the mockumentary style somehow makes it look more unsentimental.At the top of my head, the best movies about entertainment are A Hard Days Night This is Spinal Tap, and the lesser-known Waiting for Guffman. All three portray the world of show biz with some really funny characters (or in the case of the Beatles, exaggerated versions of themselves), and a relatable story on the hardship of trying to make it and how they manage to continue onward. Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a modern day look at the music industry. The mockumentary is a look at the fictional band Style Boys and their frontman Conner Friel (played by Andy Samberg). Conner is a musical prodigy and has always counted on his friends to support his dreams. After years of working together and making a mark on the charts, they break up when one of the members Lawrence (played by Akiva Schaffer) is not given credit for a song nor is even thanked when Conner wins an award for it. His other friend Owen (played by Jorma Taccone) stays on and moves into the background as Conner's DJ, while Conner reinvents himself as a Justin Bieber-like singer called "Conner4Real".His first album Thriller, Also is a hit and advances him to massive stardom. His ego (and low intelligence) pushes him to make reckless choices and surrounds himself with yes-men who only encourage more bad ideas. His second album Connquest is met with critical bashing and a bad publicity stunt that causes massive blackouts (I can't tell why, it's too funny). He attempts to continue a world tour with opening act rapper Hunter the Hungry starting to gain more popularity then it's main star. The movie is filled with interviews from real life icons like Simon Cowell, User, Carrie Underwood, Seal, Pink, Arcade Fire, and even Ringo star.When you really get down to it, Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a film version of Andy Samberg's parody band Lonely Island. Though comedic, Lonely Island has generated real hits, real concerts, and has even been nominated for an academy award. Andy Samberg clearly understands the world he comes from, as he makes some sharp criticism about the music industry. All the songs featured here are very funny, catchy, and oddly sound like something that I would hear on the radio. What Samberg also understands is how guys like him could make it in the world. Though obviously exaggerated, I can't help but think that some real life musicians are as naive as Conner is here. As funny as the joke is, I'll admit that it does start to run out of steam sooner then it should. Though running short at an hour and twenty minutes, it still felt way longer then it should be. Perhaps if we saw some more fake musicians that Conner is up against, we might have seen some justification to go on longer. Though this will probably play well on the digital market, it barely makes it as a movie. I'll give this seven Lonely Island albums out of ten. The joke is funny, even if it's not as substantial as it wants to be. Most music fans and those that have liked Andy Samberg will probably enjoy this parody. I'd say give the Lonely Island music a listen too first and them maybe check this movie out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We got lucky to see the advanced screening of Popstar. It is a very straightforward and predictable story. But that is intentionally so, taking a dig at the pop movies. It parodies every aspect of pop media, the TMZ, the paparazzi, the entourage, the egos, the commercialization etc.The cleverness and comedy is not in the story. It is in the telling of it. It is what happens along the way. It is one of the funniest movies you'll see the whole year. The acting by the Lonely Island group is spot on with their comedic timing. The whole "The Office" themed documentary style also bodes well with the theme. And at last the music. The whole idea behind the movie, according to Andy Samberg, was to 'showcase the music they created, so they made a movie around it'. Now I won't go as far as to say that the music will win Emmy's but it sure was catchy and funny! It is a one time watch movies that will not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pop, Lock, and Jab At Hollywood. Popstar is Clever, but a Bit Over The Top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You see them on E network. You read about them in the popular tabloids. The life of a star is on display for everyone in this world and we eat it up like pies in a fair contest. Heavy are the heads of those who wear the crowns of stardom and many will do anything to keep the light on them. This weekend, Samberg and his crew release a movie that attempts to poke fun at the silliness that is music artist drama. My review is on Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping. Let's get startedThe GOOD: ? Clever presentation. ? Lots of jabs at Hollywood trends ? Lonely Island Songs Filling The AirThe first thing I loved about Popstar was it's clever presentation in the form of a documentary, or in this case a mockumentary. Popstar is a tale about Conner, a former pop sensation who is trying to go solo in an attempt to keep his fame high. To help promote the album, the arrogant, na?ve boob hires a crew to capture his life on tape to portray to the masses (the audience). In this format, we didn't just get to see Conner's screw-ups, but observe the thoughts of those involved in his entourage. Various celebrity cameos riddle the interview scenes, making hilarious comments that show the fickleness of the Hollywood scene. This dual approach kept things interesting, and provide a variety of comedy styles that shows some people still have originality. Popstar's plot also allows for opportunities to jab at Hollywood stars, who enjoy a few too many benefits due to their status. I can't tell you how many times I smiled when they threw a celebrity under the bus, or parodied an incident that some dopey star has done in the past. You know that what is being done is stupid, and Samberg's overacted antics only make it more ridiculous. But it's satisfying to hear someone bash a celebrity for acting so juvenile. While I can't say they hit everyone, Samberg and company cast a wide net to cover a lot of musical entertainment follies while also extending into the obsessions of the general public. Yes?you the audience also get to be jibed as they emphasize just how absurd fans can be about everything and hurtful they can be thanks to the Internet. And what better to way to poke fun then a Lonely Island musical number in all its?interesting qualities. The vulgarity and aggressive nature of their songs remains just as colorful as their albums. THE BAD:? Offensiveness ? Banter gets old ? Overacted at partsDespite how much fun the movie is though, someone is sure to take offense to some of this movie's more assertive jokes. The opening number about Not Being Gay is sure to rile up some community's twitter account that will black ball Samberg. I agree that there are some moments that cross the line, but audience members need to put their big people pants on and realize most of this is a joke, or don't see the film. Still Samberg and his crew need to watch where they travel to in terms of their comedy, especially when it further stains the image of America to foreign countries. As I mentioned earlier, the comedy is very diverse and spans a number of styles that keep it fresh. One of those happens to be the banter routine, where Conner and some poor schmuck get caught in a rousing game of idiot tennis. Much like the T.V. shows that plague cable these days, Popstar has plenty of these moments, where the characters go round and round on an issue. Some of these arguments are pretty good, especially with the writing. However, there are other times where these banters are annoying, or a bit too stupid to be enjoyable, (which happened around the third or fourth time), as they rant on and on (much like this review). This was especially true in the TMZ parodies, which was a farce that needed to be two minutes and dropped like a scalding cup of coffee.And much like the banter, sometimes the acting itself goes too far into the overacting territory. One certainly sees the SNL roots at times, particularly in Samberg's moments of overemotional whining or screaming. Some may like this silly style of acting, but when it is drawn out?well that's when I lose interest. Even the supporting actors trail in this territory, but fortunately the writing bails them out and we move on with the film. There are even a few stunts that didn't fit well into the movie, depriving the more emotional parts by hamming it up with a cheesy interlude. Fortunately, much of these weaker parts are short-lived and the low running time only further helps. The VERDICTI was pleased with this movie and for the most part found it entertaining compared to half the comedic crap that comes out of the woodwork. Popstar's creative presentation and diverse comedy style will surely bring a little something for everyone. Sure there are moments that things get out of hand, and there are lots of moments I wish were cut out or edited down to say the least (especially more mature male organ parts). However, Popstar indeed stands out and certainly deserves a chance for those wanting a laugh. Worth a trip to the theater? Heck no, it lacks pretty much everything I praise for a movie. But I encourage a rental when you get the chance. My Scores:Comedy/Music: 8.0Movie Overall: 6.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Popstar Never Stop Never Stopping was the funniest movie I ever saw in my whole life non stop laughs. Andy Samburg was Fantastic. The comedy was genius on point nothing better then it. The movie was flawless superb nothing like it ever made. It had some of the best cameos ever. Parents this movie is rated R so if you want to take your little ones you may want to see it yourself because it does have a lot of profanity but at the same time it is super super hilarious. The Lonely Island are legends and after this movie it will get them even bigger then they already are.The movie was a hit in my books. It is in the top 15 movies that might save Hollywood and I am sure that Popstar will save it.You won't be sorry</fullReview>
