		<shortDescription>Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seem to be finding rather mixed reviews about this movie everywhere and I just felt it necessary to write my own review.First off, the movie itself has so many flaws that it's nearly impossible to take seriously. I really wanted to like this movie, as I do have an interest in Hayley Kiyoko and Sarah Hyland, and because I love other movies with similar aesthetics (Spring Breakers, for example) but I guess they could only work with what they had. I don't understand why either of them would stoop to this level of garbage, but sure enough they did. Money is more important than substance.The writing. The writing is so god awful that it's almost painful to watch it play out on- screen. The acting was obviously not top-notch but I blame that mostly on the terrible script itself. The characters were stereotypical and had very little redeeming qualities, not to mention they were so thinly written that you could care less about what happens to any of them. The story itself was also bad; nothing that exciting happened throughout the entire film and there were so many moments that randomly turned into an entirely aesthetic-fueled music video. In addition, the script seemed to find it very difficult to find any balance between negative and positive exploitation of the EDM festival scene. I constantly kept asking myself, "Is this trying to mock festival goers or is it trying to embrace them?"The only redeeming qualities about this movie was the music (as an EDM fan, I did appreciate the soundtrack choices). The only other thing I would say was moderately decent was the visuals. Many of the visuals were well-done while some were very cheesy, so it was a mixed bag in that department. I was looking forward to this movie and was extremely disappointed because they could have done so much more with the story. Overall, I would not recommend this movie unless you simply want to watch it for the aesthetics, visuals and music. Do NOT expect a good story going into it and you may end up liking it more than I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Appealing visuals and alright performances, it's neither a slow jam or a banger.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>XOXO tells stories about six different people that revolved around an electronic dance music festival. A young DJ, a manager, a hopeless romantic girl, an apathetic man, and a struggling couple. Their paths will collide and somehow, the music festival will brought out their worst and their best.Plot-wise, this movie is really generic. None of the twists and resolutions are shocking nor original. The same can be say for the characters, as they were taken out of boring overdone tropes that previous movies has. The actors did an okay job, with Brett DelBuono rises among the rest. Sarah Hyland could be much better, given her Modern Family roots.The visuals in this movie however, are appealing and engaging. Although there are no jaw dropping shots, this movie managed to capture the festival's spirit (which basically just a lot of people taking drugs and jump around til they're tired) just right.If you like EDM and are looking for visual references, go ahead and watch. Otherwise, save your time. You're really not missing anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the perspective of someone who attends these events, the movie was very enjoyable, albeit a bit predictable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I am a raver, a DJ, and a straight edge, meaning I don't drink, smoke, or do any sorts of drugs at these events. Just to give you a bit of perspective on where I'm coming from.Personally, I really enjoyed this movie. It captured very well the many different aspects of festival culture, from the bro-tank crowd, to the slutty girls, to the people only there to take an extreme amount of drugs, to the people who come to enjoy the music and hardly if at all participate in the party scene. The chaos and bliss of walking around a massive, multi-staged arena of people who are just there to enjoy themselves in the best way they know how, dancing to the music that we all love. Even the shocking and thrilling experience of running into your best friend in the middle of a crowd, in a festival with 24,000 people in it, something that has actually happened to me, as unlikely as that sounds. The depiction of PLUR was a bit cheesy, not that there is really a non-cheesy way to portray that element. The film also captured a bit of DJ culture, and the constant struggle between the people who are in it for the music vs. the fame, which I appreciated, although that might not resonate so much with the general audience.With a solid combination of outright, and background comedy (pay attention to side characters that are being talked over), and serious plot, this movie is a good example of what a 'dramedy' should be. Without spoiling anything, the plot has enough twists to keep you engaged, although it does grow a bit predictable as it goes. Some parts did seem a bit forced, plot-wise, but that's to be expected in film nowadays.I would have liked if the film had more diversity in the music, as it was almost entirely main- stage house in the soundtrack, but to be fair, that is the only type of EDM that really works with general audiences, so I understand why they choose to stick so closely to the genre.If you've never been to a festival, do not by any means form your opinion of what they are like on this movie, but if you have, sit back and enjoy, and let XOXO take you back to what is, for many people, the most surreal and magical few days of their entire lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1 hour and 30 minute of clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many clichés that i had to finish the movie in 3 sessions.The biggest cliché. The love interest. She meets the guy and hes of course dumbfounded and cant speak. Shes all smiley and we already know that these 2 are getting together. But wait, shes got another guy shes meeting and rejects our hero because hes an awkward little boy, who stutters a lot, and has 100% Prakinsons making it impossible to insert a USB-stick. And also he f#*ks up his set, and I'm sitting here like awwww, this is gonna end so badly for him. Like embarrassed on his behalf. But lo and behold, he manages to pull of a good set at the last minut of the movie, like just before the end with all the scrolling names. Shiit, talk about perfect timing. And he also gets the girl, because hes a bigtime DJ now. Golddigger. And also, wtf is up with the couple going into the sewers? 1st they lose the tickets because riot, naturally. Then they go into the sewers. Then they get lost, take a nap, break up, get back together and magically finds the ladder they need just around the corner. 5deep3me man. Edgy story.Only reason i give it 3 of 10 is because of Tariq and his drug overdose that gives him a great revelation. No its not, its because he crawled into a RentaLoo and that was a true wtf moment for me.OK, ill give it 4 of 10 because they got the stereotypes of rave correctly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rave on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dance music is kind of difficult to capture in film. Even portraying dance music in a pop show on television never really works, because outside of a rave club, watching dance music is a bit boring.Director Christopher Louie in XOXO has gone with a Robert Altman route of six mainly young strangers colliding on the way to and during a rave festival.Graham Phillips has the main role as he plays DJ Ethan a YouTuber who with the help of his friend and manager Tariq gets to DJ at the festival. However he does not have the necessary passes and the equipment he uses is not compatible with that of the festival. Tariq is unavailable as he gets lost in a drug haze as he has been inadvertently spiked. There is an older clubber who seems to be bitter about something and past business relationships. There is a beautiful young girl who is planning to hook up with someone and a young couple who give their tickets away and then trying to gain entry into the rave. There is a hotshot DJ who leeches the work of younger talent.It is all shown in bright vibrant colours with lots of young beautiful women and plenty of texting. The music was supervised by Pete Tong and after a shaky opening when you might wonder if this film is for you, it actually settles down pretty well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminiscent Of A Few Others...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Per a friend's recommendation, I managed to watch this brand new Netflix original movie the other night. This put me in the mind set of a few other movies like it -- 1999's "Go" and "200 Cigarettes", along with some of the teen flicks of the eighties. "Modern Family" star, Sarah Hyland, heads up an ensemble cast of characters trying to make it the big rave that is known as "XOXO". There's the party bus that breaks down, the budding star trying to make it big as a DJ, and of course all the DRUGS!! Haha I really enjoyed this; would definitely recommend checking this out when you get a chance...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vibrant, colorful, and passionate!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>XOXO is the perfect film for the millennials. It's vibrant, colorful and passionate. I really enjoy this film and personally I think it's because it speaks to the younger self in me that's wishing I could party at a music festival but now at my age I don't know if I have the energy to do it.Written by Dylan Meyer and directed by Christopher Louie, XOXO is essentially about six early 20-something strangers at the biggest EDM festival in America and their lives collide in one dream-chasing hopelessly romantic night. Graham Phillips plays DJ Ethan who gets to perform at the festival, he finally gets his big break, but situations leading up to that are quite rocky, plus his manager is going through his own separate ordeal. This is one of those ensemble films, meaning it features several key characters and all of them have equal share of screen time and you see their respective stories cross paths with each other.First of all, I think any of you who've been to a festival before can certainly watch XOXO and plainly see the lengths to which this film went in order to accurately depict such event down pat. And once the sun goes down, the place is jumping with all kinds of folks, some are even there to just get high on drugs. It's basically a mini woodstock but with ten times the energy. The emphasis on the lighting, the wardrobe, all kinds of colors, the way the characters' lips or eyelids just glow in the dark, XOXO sure wants you to know that you are in for a party film where everybody is just there to live in the moment. The film features some of today's young talents and rising stars who are just right for their roles whether it be to captivate or inspire. At the heart of the story is this struggle or a conflict between following regular norm or hoping for something different like pursuing your passion or pursuing romantic encounter, as silly as that may sound to people, which is why I said earlier that this is the perfect film for millennials because we are the generation of not knowing what the future holds for us, we are the generation of taking chances and hoping for something more to come around. For all intents and purposes, XOXO is here to tell us that despite uncertainty and anxiety, somehow everything's going to be OK.-- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a young guy (22) I can relate very closely to this film. Since turning 18, I've had my far share of raves, and while watching XOXO, it made me want to get off my feet, go party, and have a good time. But looking at it from a film perspective, it felt like there was too much going on between the many different characters that all led up to a very minimal pay-off. Two characters specifically, the boyfriend and girlfriend, I felt could've been cut from the film entirely. They really didn't have much to do with the plot as a whole, and the creators could've used that to build more on the more centralized plot. The film had great acting and a good idea, but I personally felt that there could've been more. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shockingly bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am hugely disappointed by this film. I'm not sure what the story was really trying to do, it wasn't amusing or in any way entertaining. If you want to watch a good festival film watch Under The Electric Sky because it's actually good. This film portrayed loads of typical festival/drug stereotypes like everybody at these things is a total moron, that's not been my experience. Acting - awful. Music, not enough of it and mostly boring. Spend your time doing something other than watching this, trust me! Also, why does it need to be so cynical? I suppose it's not cool to be nice anymore. Why can't more people make good party films? Relatively simple concept and a lot of fun but so few people seem to have got it right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredible movie that makes you feel infinite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie!! I have to say I am not normally one for movies like this but It was so good. They made it not only funny but so emotional which can be a really hard to do in a good movie. Each character was so different but all of them felt important. It really took me on a journey. For so long I tried to find a movie that would make me feel really happy and open about life. - and there are not many. But without even trying I stumbled across this one. The neon colours and psychedelic patterns intrigued me so much! I was worried that they were just using them as a cool design to get people to watch it but they really haven't. It makes sense and fits in with the story so well. I have to say overall please watch this movie TO the END. Because you have nothing to loose and will feel like you're apart of the adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It a PLUR not life!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been to my fair share of raves but I never understood 'PLUR' lifestyle. It seems like a capitalistic and vapid culture. And I'd be hard pressed not to admit that a majority of artists follow suit. And many concerts are just an excuse to take drugs, dance like a crazy person, and possibly get intimate with strangers. But before I go on a tangent on rave culture, lets decipher this movie. Do you enjoy films riddled with clichés? I mean constant ad naussiem clichés one after another. Here are some you will experience: The un-offensive popular new kid on the block that made it a big debut online, the over-exaggeration effects of drug use, disappointed father who doesn't believe in his son's potential, vapid slutty 'squad' chicks that are less than one-dimensional, jaded "true fan" that is holding on to the past but breaks free of his cynicism/nihilism, couple that is breaking apart due to relationship problems going to an event for a last hurrah, girl who believes in true love against all odds gets bogged down by the truth (but ends up with the right person).... Etc. This is mixed with repulsive story elements. It's sets up a storyline of multiple perspectives with awfully written dialogue. Among all these people in the film the plot is stretched to thin to tell a story or make any good point. Every modern convention of film is shoved into this piece of garbage and even if some would work in another better film, the execution is the problem. Is this an advertisement for xoxo fest? It certainly feels that way from all the music and awkward crowd shots. The best part is when the couple decide to go down into a sewer to get into the sold out festival. Probably because they get covered in poop which is a good metaphor for what this film is.Nothing seems to be redeeming about this movie. It's predicable, vapid, has no real point to make, and doesn't even have a memorable scene. This is starting to prove that Netflix will cut corners and shove any material out there is see if it sticks. It's certainly cheaper than hiring good talent or purchasing already good content to stream. Stay away from the sewage stained garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As someone who loves raves - This is a great romantic comedy and movie about the scene.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm someone who spent their youth in the rave scene. I've loved movies like Go, Groove, and Midsummers Night Rave. But now I have a new favorite. A contemporary rave movie that really hits home with the modern day scene, but what is so much more than that, this is genuinely a beautiful romantic comedy, about friendship and love.There is so much reality to this movie about the spirit of the scene, great acting, superb soundtrack, and a well put together story.I don't understand the low rating on IMDb, but who cares. If you have the heart of raver, you'll really get this movie. If not, maybe you'll love it too.I laughed so often during this movie, but what really shows the power of screen writing, was it's ability to bring me to tears at least 5 or 6 times during the story. What an amazing movie, it's like they got everything right that its predecessors missed (Go, Groove, etc). I give it 10 out of 10 because I'm a big fan of rom-com, but the set of the movie and soundtrack really throws it over the top to make it an all-time favorite of mine. Yea, you are not going to see Brad Pitt, Meryl Streep, or whoever the Oscar winners are. So don't confuse my rating with one of those huffy-puffy Oscar award type level movies. No, instead, this was a movie that hit home for me, and I loved every second of it. My only complaint, is it wasn't long enough.I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Visuals, Soundtrack, &amp; Casting. Decent plot. Sometimes misses on script/character dialogue.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are into EDM or the festivals that bring the EDM culture (or both), this movie can help you get your fix. If you are new to this style of music and/or its culture, I am not really sure what this movie would do for you. Personally, I enjoyed it. I have been to plenty of festivals, produce my own music, blah blah blah. Big music festivals are a trip, an experience, a journey. They are an environment unlike anything else. This film does a great job of recreating most of the aspects the journey to, from, and during the festival. Everyone experiences them in millions of different ways. 'XOXO' creates a realistic scene of these festivals from multiple points-of-views (it made me really regret that I didn't go to a big festival this summer).The visuals and SFX are great. They play a central role in the film's plot. Its really fun to watch the integration between SFX, dramatic irony, and storyline. The soundtrack is pretty much up-to-date, which really helps to create the proper vibes within the film. I really like film's stories that only take place throughout the course of 1 day. This film generates a fun sense of anxiety (if that makes sense?). Just the anticipation that builds after months of planning, the journey, then the culmination off all things to create a night to remember. My only (unprofessional) critique is parts of the dialogue. I feel like the script really dumbed down Sarah Hyland. I think she is a good actress that could've really shined. Her scenes felt rushed.Chris D'Elia's character provides comic relief and his jokes hit well with people familiar with this culture (or that hate what it has become). I want to see more of Graham Phillips. He does really well with the script he is given, and plays his part well. To me, he is believable in his parts.I just think the script could've provided an outlet for all actors involved to shine, and it let's them down. They do well with materials provided. The visuals and soundtrack will draw you in... enough to keep your attention to see how the night ends, and leave you missing your last festival. A fun film to reminisce on your past festivals. It is fast-paced, but it has a lot of character's stories to keep up with, unfortunately, this where the writing let's the film down.</fullReview>
