		<shortDescription>Good ol' fashioned disaster-and-rescue drama is better than the "experts" would have you believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Finest Hours" (2016 release; 117 min.) brings the telling, "based on a true story" we are reminded, of a daring rescue attempt at sea. As the movie opens, it is "Wellfleet, MA, November 1951", and we get to know two Coast Guarders who are out on a double date. Bernie (played by Chris Pine) is immediately smitten by Miriam *played by Holiday Grainger). The movie then shifts to February 17, 1952, where Bernie and Miriam are attending a party, and they decide to get married in April. Later that night, as a nor'easter is bearing down, the Pendleton tanker is in serious trouble, and before we know it, Bernie is ordered to assemble a crew and go out to find any survivors of the Pendleton. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is a big budget movie from Disney Studios, directed by Craig Gillespie ("Lars and The Real Girl"; "Million Dollar Arm"). If you have seen the movie's trailer (which as been inescapable in the theaters in recent weeks), you know exactly what you are in for: a bigger-than-life, against-all-odds rescue attempt of the crew of the Pendleton tanker, which has split in two, by a four man crew of the Coast Guard in Chatham, MA. Don't ask me how the Pendleton's remaining half tanker doesn't sink! I think it has something to do with the boat's balancing tanks, but in the end it doesn't matter, as we are here to witness some of the wildest open sea disaster scenes you'll ever see. In a sense, this reminds of "Titanic", except that the action scenes are pumped up and on steroids. Chris Pine (as Bernie) and Casey Affleck (as the Pendleton's main guy) are fine, but to be honest, they and the rest of the gang are all second fiddle to the special effects. I know that it's all CGI, yet it looks so darn realistic! The movie has a great orchestral score, courtesy of veteran composer Carter Burwell (his score for "Carol" received an Oscar nomination). Also make sure to stay through the movie's end titles, as we then get a bunch of period pictures from the Boston Globe and other news sources with the real life people from the events (and likely the source of the costuming for the film). Last but not least, this is released both in 2D and 3D, but just know that the movie was shot in 2D and then converted into 3D (I saw it in 2D). Bottom line: "The Finest Hours" is a good ol' fashioned disaster-and-rescue drama that is much better than the "experts" would have you believe."The Finest Hours" opened nationally this weekend, and the Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great. somewhat to my surprise. Regardless, if you are in the mood for an effects-heavy but very realistic disaster-and-rescue movie, I encourage you to check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray (although a movie of this kind just begs to be seen on the big screen). "The Finest Hours" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you liked The Perfect Storm, then give The Finest Hours a look.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Takes place in the early 1950's where a giant storm dominates the seas by breaking a tanker truck in half, with only a few hours left to survive, the crew id does what they can survive. A rescue ship is sent to try and get to them, but the question is will they ? I love the early 50's look, it captures it so perfectly. Everybody gives a good performance, almost nobody stands out. The storms scenes are also well shot, you'll feel caught up in the storm also. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's easy to compare this to The Perfect storm(2000), it has the same feel to it. I hope you won't be disappointed by this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved this movie, the whole family will love this pulse pounding roller coaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This director has pushed the bounds of new camera angles. The story was brought to life in a very dramatic way.A story about people who run into burning buildings when were all running out. Told in a new novel way, that draws you in.This movie riveted me to the seat, read the amazon reviews for the book...same thing.I've been very suspicious of Disney movies recently and will only let my kids watch them after I've seen them. This movie is safe for the family, a little to intense for the young. But it is the way movies should be made to create role models for the youth to emulate. Real Men, Real Heroes I believe there is a move to discredit movies like this.I'm been on sail boats in waves 1/4 the size in this movie and I was wondering if I was going to make it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three intersecting stories, of which one works very well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Finest Hours" presents three stories, or perhaps one story from three perspectives. The stories are perhaps better described as intersecting rather than interwoven as developments in each storyline have relatively little effect on the other story lines other than points of intersection. The most successful story is one of survival aboard a doomed ship in a fierce storm. Casey Afflect delivers a brilliant performance, possibly the best of his career, as an engineer who must win the respect of the crew and devise a seeming impossible plan to ensure their survival. But the putative hero of the story is played by Chris Pine as a disgraced seaman thrust into a leadership position who manages a heroic rescue by alternatively slavishly adhering to regulations and blatantly disregarding them, but steadfastly pressing on by sheer obstinacy and succeeding by dumb luck. The least successful story is a romance between Pine's character and a local girl who somehow manages to afford a car on a switchboard operator's salary, walks through snowdrifts in high heels without slipping or marring her shine, defies convention and embarrasses her boyfriend by proposing marriage, and barges into the all-male preserve of the Coast Guard station to demand that the commander commit an unconscionable act of cowardice in an exchange that might have been ghostwritten by the screenwriter's five- year-old daughter. Having never read the book, it's difficult to tell what parts were embellished for dramatic impact, but much of the story seems hopelessly contrived. Critical pieces of equipment (radar, compass, radio) malfunction and miraculously return to service as if on cue. At one point, a large group of bystanders race off in support of the rescue effort and one expects them to activate certain items, but strangely nobody does until the love interest does, almost as an afterthought, and everybody else decides to follow suit, leaving the audience wondering why they went there if they didn't intend to do it in the first place. At another somebody shouts out a number referring to a group of people he could not possibly have counted. This is another film that the #OscarsSoWhite and advocates of gender pay parity would rather audiences not see. It's basically a story of real men in the 1950s male-dominated era doing manly things while the womenfolk stay at home being supportive, raising children and mourning those who sacrificed their lives supporting their families. It was only four years after Eisenhower ended segregation in the military and the Coast Guard and various maritime labor unions were probably about as integrated as the Ku Klux Klan. But this would never do in the twenty-first century when studios feel pressured to compromise dramatic structure in favor of political correctness. Consequently, two subplots seem to have been added and/or expanded to provide more diversity for audiences who prefer diversity over drama. One involves a black seaman whose cowardice results in the death of a Caucasian who takes him under his wing. The second is the romantic subplot, which is given roughly equal weight and screen time with the two other through lines. The story is not particularly interesting. The girl is a typical chick flick heroine ? pretty but not gorgeous, more cherubic than voluptuous, virtuous and steadfast to a fault, with an anachronistic feminist streak. Both subplots could have been easily eliminated. Perhaps the film would not have been quite the critical or commercial disappointment if they had been sharply trimmed or eliminated. The theme and moral seem weak. A theme concerning luck and happenstance undermines some of the effect, as do several plot contrivances, such as the equipment malfunctions. The episode is supposedly one of the greatest sea rescues in history, but it's presented as the consequence of doggedly plodding along in blind subservience to duty rather than anything one would ordinarily equate with heroism.Technically, the film is top shelf. The period props, costumes, settings and make-up all seem authentic. There is a refreshing lack of distracting jiggly-cam shots. The special effects seem realistic. It lays on the schmaltz fairly heavily at points, but what can one expect from Disney? It might have been more compelling if it had concentrated on the survival story, eliminated the love story and trimmed the rescue story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edge of your seat action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The FINEST HOURS is a rip-roaring, edge of your seat action thriller that will keep you guessing all the way to the end.There....that should get me on the poster.That said, I will have to admit that I had low to middling expectations going into this film and it exceeded my expectation in almost every way.Starting with the Cast. Chris Pine (good ol' Cap't Kirk) stars as Bernie Webber a mid-level Coast Guard officer who is flung into the forefront when an oil barge splits in half in very rough sees during a storm. Pine presents Webber not as a square-jawed hero, but a real person with doubts and insecurities but a strict code of ethics and when his Capt. (the always capable Eric Bana) sends him out for what could be a suicide mission, he goes out.While Pine holds down half of this movie, Casey Affleck holds down the other half as the leader of the group of survivors on the oil tanker. Normally, I am not a big fan of Affleck's work, but in this movie, I sure am. He is a man of few words and tells much with his expression. If there is a "squared jawed hero" in this movie, it is Affleck.These two are supported by a veritable who's who of "that guy" actors. Ben Foster, John Ortiz, Michael Raymond James and good ol' Abraham Benrubi are just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak, of wonderful character actors filling the roles of other Coast Guard members and crewmen of the doomed ship.Only Holliday Grainger as Pine's strong-willed fiancé fails for me, but I blame a weak written character more than her acting for that one.But, make no mistake, it is the action that makes this movie exciting. From the opening where the oil ship splits in half through the attempt to get out to the ocean to find the doomed ship to the actual rescue itself, I was on pins and needles, literally vaulting myself up out of my seat to get over a wave at one point. Director Craig Gillespie, not known as an action director, does a nice job of leading us through these scenes, I am anxious to see what he takes on next. I hope it is another action flick.Is it a great film? No. The opening (after the tanker accident) drags and the movie bounces around in tone trying to find out what kind of movie it wants to be, but once Pine and company goes out to sea to rescue, the movie zips along just fine.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While it has its heart in the right place, The Finest Hours can't seem to rise above its sappy melodramatic storyline.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Finest Hours tells the harrowing and courageous true story of the most daring rescue mission that the U.S. Coast Guard has, to this day, ever had to accomplish. Starring Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Ben Foster and Josh Stewart, the film's cast is stacked to the brim with talent but the director, Craig Guillesspe takes away from their efforts by telling the story in the sappiest of ways. The film starts with Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) on a blind date with his friend as he looks forward to meeting Miriam (Holliday Grainger), the woman he has been talking on the phone with for months on end. It is a sappy way to start the film but that sappiness is soon discarded as soon as we are introduced to the USS Pendelton and its crew. The crew, headed by Casey Affleck's brilliant and film carrying performance as Ray Sybert, is in the midst of a terrible winter storm and they struggle to maintain control of the ship. After being battered by the brutal waves off of Nantucket, the ship is split in two and must stay afloat until help arrives. The film takes its shape during the scenes with the Pendleton and it's crew. Casey Affleck gives a good performance that remains as one of the most interesting of the film coupled with some truly gasp-worthy scenes of suspense and action. This is one thing the film has going for it, it has some truly breath taking action sequences that will leave you clawing at your arm rest and holding your breath. While an abundance of CGI is used, it still feels the way its supposed to. Cold and brutal. While the film is no match for the conditions shown in The Revenant, it still will make you shiver once or twice just looking at the weather these brave souls have to go up against. While these sequences and qualities make The Finest Hours a thoroughly watchable and enjoyable film, unfortunately the film compromises, what could be, white knuckle action and substitute it with a half-assed love story between Bernie and Miriam that borders on annoying after the first hour and equally annoying and poorly done Boston accents. The accents show Pine and Grainger as the biggest culprits. Grainger's performance as Miriam is annoying and wildly unrealistic and Pine is spineless in his rendition of, what many consider, one of the bravest men that ever served in the Coast Guard. Grainger's Miriam serves as more of a nuisance than a help to the film, which is rather disappointing because the role screams for a more able actress to take on the role and another screenwriter to make her character more than just a poorly written female character. It really throws the film for a loop, making it as lopsided as you can get. Despite this, the film moves through its main storyline with tenacity that is hard to match. One sequence in particular features the rescue crew trying to pass over the Nantucket ocean bar, a point in the ocean that features out going and incoming waves crashing against one another. The sequence is harrowing, the pacing of it is brilliant and the sheer intensity is one that the film can't seem to match for the remainder of the film. The film, while it does get your heart pounding, lacks character drama and depth. While we care about the characters, we only care about the actors playing them. If lesser known actors were in these roles, it would be clearer that the film could have used another rewrite and a stronger female character. Overall, The Finest Hours is a decent rescue film that serves its purpose of entertaining you but it does little else in the way of separating it from every other film of its type.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>real life Disney heroes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. The U.S. Coast Guard has played a role in many movies over the years, but only a few have placed this service branch directly in the heart of the story ? most recently The Guardian (2006), which was little more than a cheesy, too-talkative water-based rip-off of Top Gun. Director Craig Gillespie (Lars and the Real Girl, 2007) takes a much different approach as he presents a look at one of the most legendary and heroic real-life rescues in Coast Guard history.The Oscar-nominated writing team behind The Fighter (2010): Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, and Eric Johnson have collaborated on the screenplay based on the book from Casey Sherman and Michael J Touglas. It's a worthy tribute (and clearly Disney-influenced) to what is described as the greatest Coast Guard small-boat rescue. It combines a boat-load (sorry) of tension-filled ocean-based sequences with some pretty interesting character-based sub-plots within a Massachusetts community that has become all too familiar with storm-based catastrophes.Chris Pine stars as Bernie Webber, an awkwardly shy and obsessive rule-follower, who has lived under a cloud of doubt ever since a previous rescue mission failed, resulting in the death of a local fisherman/husband/father. We first meet Bernie as he bungles through a first date with Miriam (Holliday Grainger, a young Gretchen Mol lookalike). The film then jumps ahead to 1952 when they become engaged and Bernie is ordered into a questionable mission by his "not-from-around-here" commanding officer Daniel Cluff (Eric Bana). See, a huge storm has literally ripped apart not one, but two giant tankers, leaving crew members battling for survival. It should be noted that Bana the Australian, tosses out a laughable southern accent that is a joke within the movie and within the theatre (for different reasons).Bernie and his crew: Richard Livesay (Ben Foster), Andy Fitzgerald (Kyle Gallner), and Ervin Maske (John Magaro), take off against all odds in a too-small boat against too-big waves in a desperate attempt to rescue the tanker crew that includes brilliant engineer Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck) and characters played by John Ortiz and Graham McTavish. Affleck excels as what can be termed a quiet leader. Of course, we know how the story ends, but the heroic efforts against a very powerful Mother Nature show-of-force make for compelling movie watching.The special effects are stout, though not be as spectacular as The Perfect Storm (2010) or In the Heart of the Sea (2015), and it's the human-factor that provides more than enough thrills, excitement, and tension. In fact, the biggest issue I had was that I saw a 3-D version which is an absolute disservice to the film. Most of the story takes place at night and at sea, so the 3-D consequence of dimmed light and muted colors results in a far too dark and dull look to the film. I spent much of the movie sliding the 3-D glasses down my nose in a simple attempt to enjoy a bit more brightness. The recommendation would be to skip the higher-priced (money grabbing) 3-D version and take in the more pleasing "standard" version.Disney makes feel-good movies. Their target market is not cynics or the overly critical among us. The romance pushes the "corny" meter, but keeps with tradition of other Disney movies based on true stories like The Rookie (2002) and Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story (2005). Keep this in mind you'll likely find this one pretty entertaining. Stick around for the closing credits as a slew of real photographs from the actual 1952 event are displayed, as are photos of the real heroes from that night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Daring Rescue of a Crew with a Small Rescue Boat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1950, in Cape Cod in Massachusetts, the US Coast Guard station in Chatham receives a distress signal from the oil tankers SS Pendleton and SS Fort Mercer. Commander Daniel Cluff (Eric Bana) assigns the crew formed by Bernie Webber (Chris Pine), Richard Livesey (Ben Foster), Andy Fitzgerald (Kyle Gallner) and Ervin Maske (John Magaro) to rescue the crew of the SS Pendleton in a small enclosed lifeboat. Cluff is warned about the intensity of the storm by Bernie and also by his girlfriend Miriam (Holliday Grainger) but he keeps the order. Meanwhile the SS Pendleton has broken and lost his forward part and his skilled and experienced engineer Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck) assumes the command of the survivors. He uses his abilities to steer the stern in a safer position, grounding it on an unstable bank of sand to avoid sinking."The Finest Hours" is based on the most daring rescue of a crew in a blizzard with a small enclosed lifeboat-rescue boat. The heroic work of the US Coast Guard crew is impressive, saving thirty-two survivors from the SS Pendleton. The ability of the engineer Ray Sybert is also praiseworthy. The film is technically impressive with breathtaking action scenes of the rescue operation. The romance is silly and only completes the running time. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Horas Decisivas" ("Decisive Hours")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts kinda slow and unrelated to the story ( you expect to see) and it is rather slow paced at the beginning, but soon it gets more packed with action and rests until the end.I enjoyed the film. It was even touching at the end. The fact that it is based on the true story does give it a plus. The breaking of a ship ( two, in fact) in haft because of the storm was really wow! I really got into the scene when they showed the first breaking of the ship. It was intense and really well done. I guess I liked those scenes which were filmed inside of the ship and all the hard work being done to prevent the sinking of it that caught my attention the most and the ones I really enjoyed. However, the relations between the sailors ( in the ship and at the land were somewhat superficially done and yes, you get that some of them are not liking each other, but, why is that is not rally explained and I though it should have been)The love story that also goes parallel to the disaster at sea is sometimes sweet but most of the time is kinda blah and maybe it should have been cut in entirety from the film. It does add something to the film, but not that much in reality. But I guess it is important as it is one of the true facts.All in all, not bad. I give it a rating eight!</fullReview>

It's filled with so many factual errors (wrong type of engine room for one), that my entire review could be just about that. And let's talk about Webber, the coxwain, taking off his life jacket! No Coastie would ever do something so stupid. EVER. Let's add in an unnecessary love story that simply drags the movie down. Did the idiots at Disney think women wouldn't go see a movie about one of the greatest rescues in history if there wasn't a love story in it? This movie is just a poor effort, and I'm not surprised at all that it bombed at the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE FINEST HOURS is simply one of the finest movies I have ever seen. From the opening scenes where Young Bernie Webber is pulled into a blind date by his friend and He meets the Woman that becomes his wife. To Bernie's dedication to the coast guard. Chris Pine is totally engrossing as Bernie. The Story is one of Heroism sacrifice. And Skill and courage under fire . During a Winter Storm on Feb. of 1952 Two Oil Tankers fall victim to the raging waters one of the Ships the S.S. Pendleton breaks in half. The Men trapped on the floating Stern Are forced to work together to keep the floating hulk afloat. The Head Engineer Played brilliantly by Casey Affleck has the knowledge and the skills to keep them alive until they get rescued. But so far no one knows they are out there. And The other Oil Tanker commands all the attention. When the Pendleton finally gets the message out. The picking for rescuers are slim and Bernie is ordered by his commanding officer To mount a rescue . Bernie in command picks a crew and takes out the only boat remaining. A small boat. And in those waters agitated by the storm it amounts to a Suicide mission. As Bernie tells his men. "They tell us to go out. They don't tell us to come back"! Bernie is also working under the spectre of a failed mission in which he failed to save the lives of a sinking ship the year before. So Bernie is looking for redemption. That and the fact that Bernie is driven to save those men. All lives matter to Bernie and to him failure is not even a option they'll do it or die trying.The Special Effects are spectacular. But they pale in comparison to the acting and the story. Both are the finest kind you'll see in any movie released this year. This movie easily climbed on to the top of my favorite movie list. The style of the movie is beautiful and makes one long for the simpler times back then. And makes us believe in heroes again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We can't leave them out here alone, that boat won't last. We all live or we all die." Bernie Webber (Pine) is a member of the Coast Guard that does everything by the book. After word of a drowning ship gets to the guard the only boat they have left is a tiny 12 person craft. Against all odds, and the advice of his superiors, Bernie and his 4 man crew set out in the middle of cold winter night to rescue a group of men clinging to hope. I was looking forward to this movie. I really liked the Perfect Storm and was hoping for something similar. Before watching I wondered why this one seemed to come and go so fast without any real hoop-la. After watching I understood why. This is a good movie and for the most part I did enjoy it but it was lacking something the Perfect Storm had; drama and emotion. The fact that this is a true story helps a little and does add something but to me this was just a little to generic and "Disney-fied" to have any real punch. That hurt the movie for me. Overall, a good movie that is worth watching but a very very watered down Perfect Storm type movie that I'm not sure I'd watch again. I disappointingly give this a B-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely predictable, old fashioned Disney filmmaking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'THE FINEST HOURS': Three Stars (Out of Five)Disney's new historical disaster flick, directed by Craig Gillespie; who also helmed Disney's 'MILLION DOLLAR ARM', as well as 'LARS AND THE REAL GIRL' (which is outstanding) and the 2011 'FRIGHT NIGHT' remake! The film was written by Eric Johnson, Scott Silver and Paul Tamasy; and it's based on the 2009 book 'THE FINEST HOURS: THE TRUE STORY OF THE U.S. COAST GUARD'S MOST DARING SEA RESCUE', by Michael J. Tougias and Casey Sherman. It tells the story of four Coast Guard members, who daringly faced one of the worst storms in East Coast history; to rescue the crew of a sinking oil tanker. The movie stars Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, Holliday Grainger, Eric Bana, Kyle Gallner and John Ortiz. It's classic, and extremely predictable, old fashioned Disney filmmaking.The movie is part disaster flick, and part corny romance film. It focuses on Bernard 'Bernie' Webber (Pine); a crewman for the Coast Guard, stationed at Cape Cod. He falls in love with a young woman there, named Miriam Pentinen (Grainger). She proposes to him, and while Bernie is asking his commanding officer, Daniel Cuff (Bana), for permission to marry Miriam (which was custom then); one of the worst storms, in East Coast history, hits the area. Bernie then volunteers, to lead a four man team to rescue the crew of a sinking oil tanker (the SS Pendleton). The film is cheesy, and just like dozens of other movies, that came before it; but most of those came out dozens of years ago (with the exception of 2000's 'THE PERFECT STROM'). It definitely has a classic, old movie feel to it; and Gillespie's direction is very fitting. The film has a few good inspiring moments; but for the most part it's corny, too long, and dull. The effects are good, but the acting is bad (especially Pine in the lead). It should please it's target audience though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/b_aLk3J5gh4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is like many other "based on a true story" film - the outcome is true but how they got there is pure fiction. The main characters in this would have to be superhuman to be able to hang on to that boat and survive in that storm with freezing temps, huge waves, high winds without wearing Arctic like apparel, helmets, heavy duty straps, the ability to withstand impacts that chopped tankers in half, headphones and microphones to hear each other, and too many other things to list. Even with all of those things they could have never made it anyway. Then, on they way home, the weather stops on a dime, nobody knows where they are, the people on land turn on their headlights to maybe help the boat members locate land and lo and behold, they are right there a couple hundred feet straight ahead. Wow, no compass or directional equipment, all should be disoriented, frozen and half dead, and the entire time on a direct coarse home during the one of the worst storms in history - really. This mess in an insult to peoples intelligence - or maybe not - after all it is a "true story". Finest Hours in right up there with Revenant as the most implausible, overblown, impossible, made-up based on a true story ever made. Good Actors couldn't even save this. It is garbage.</fullReview>

Members of the American Coast Guard, Bernie Webber(Chris Pine), Richard Livesey(Ben Foster), Andy Fitzgerald(Kyle Gallner) &amp; Ervin Maske(John Magaro) make a daring rescue attempt, as ordered by their superior, Daniel Cluff(Eric Bana). The Coast Guard's mission is to rescue a group of shipwrecked coast guardsmen, after a pair of oil tankers got destroyed on their ship. These events occurred off the coast of Cape Cod, during the blizzard of 1952. The Finest Hours is a mediocre film, at best. At worst, it is a really slow film that has pretty much, the same extended scene throughout its run-time. The movie opens as a romantic drama. These first few minutes of the film are really dull &amp; the so called chemistry between the actors feels forced &amp; cringe worthy. After this, we are thrust into the Coast Guard life of Bernie Webber &amp; his pals. So, 15 minutes into the movie we are given two perspectives. One perspective is from, the ship stranded in the midst of the roaring blizzard. Here the movie revolves around, Ray Sybert(Casey Affleck). The second perspective is from the rescue boat on its way to save Sybert &amp; his fellow coast guardsmen. The scenes on the ship are mostly technical, with the crew indulging in manual labor. The exciting scenes happen on the rescue boat as Webber &amp; his compatriots are right in the middle of the roaring storm. However, since the majority of the movie takes place on the rescue boat &amp; the ship, these scenes get repetitive. The viewer will be left wondering, when will this movie end. The visual effects are the only highlight of the movie. The most recent film in this genre is, In the Heart of the Sea(2015). In the Heart of the Sea(2015) is a masterpiece, compared to this barely sincere attempt to bring to life, an incredible true story. The 3D in this movie is terrible. It is a waste of the extra money. Not even a single obstacle pops out of the screen &amp; the three dimensional immersion is hardly noticeable. There is almost zero character development. Therefore, the actors' performances have very little impact. Nevertheless, Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, Eric Bana, Holliday Granger, Kyle Gallner, John Magaro &amp; the rest of the cast, do a decent job with their respective roles. The Finest Hours is not worth a watch. In fact it is so dragging that, I dozed off quite a few times during the film &amp; I never fall asleep while watching a movie! Skip this one &amp; wait for it to come out on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray or, just watch it on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This old-fashioned sea story of The Finest Hours can't save itself from a weary tone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a lot of people, I'm terrified of the idea of having to swim in the dark. It doesn't matter where the water source is (the ocean, a swamp or even a regular swimming pool), but if I can't see what's beneath me, then who knows what could be down there. In a way looking at dark water is like looking deep into space with the both environments being unknown, mysterious and could turn on you in a heartbeat. If there's nothing in the water, then I still hate thinking that if was in the middle of the ocean in the middle of the night. If I can't see my own toes, then there's something unsettling about that. Luckily, the job of jumping into that dark water rests upon the coast guard who are the first responders to any sea emergency. It was only before I stepped in to see The Finest Hours that I realized that very few movies that are about the Coast Guard. It's fair to say that other military branches tend to get more attention then the sea bound team. The Finest Hours chronicles one of their most dangerous rescue attempts that will make you glad to be wrapped in blanket on those cold nights.It is 1952 where Coast Guard crewman Bernie Webber (played by Chris Pine) makes a life for himself in Chatham, Massachusetts where he meets and falls in love with a young woman, Miriam Pentinen (played by Holiday Grainger). They set April 16 as the wedding date while winter is still upon the Cape Cod town, covering the city in a nearly whiteout storm. Bernie asks for permission for marriage from his commanding officer, Daniel Cluff (played by Eric Bana), but is insulted for having to ask to be married. It is then Bernie sees that the rest of the Coast Guard crewmen see him as a guy who only follows orders.Meanwhile, an oil tanker, the SS Pendleton breaks in half during a storm while out on the ocean. The surviving crew, which consists of engineers, cooks, and the lone sailor, Ray Sybert (played by Casey Affleck), see that their not too far from land, but still need rescue.Bernie gets called to go rescue the survivors with only a few crewmen on a lifeboat, even though the nor'easter is still fiercely rough. Despite having a small boat, his compass gone and cold weather beating him up, he still attempts one of the craziest rescues in military history.The Finest Hours has plenty of material to make a great story from a likable real life solider to a stormy sea that even Moby Dick would have found too rough. It's a shame that the final product was simply too forgettable and surprisingly dull. It seems that the tone of the story was to make this more of a typical day then a major rescue (at least until towards the end). I can understand doing that to make the Coast Guard characters more relatable, but it can backfire, and it does here. If these people don't see this as something major, then why should it's audience?The best thing about the movie are the two stars, Chris Pine and Casey Affleck who are both playing different kinds of leaders. They do their parts well enough, but it's the rest of the characters that have little identity aside from their jobs. I know I should be worried about those on the oil tanker, but the movie needed more time for us to get to know these people better. Instead, the narrative only seems to be to do it's sea job, go to the next and do the next job.I'll give this five Coast Guard boats out of ten. The old fashioned story of the coast guard has it's moments in the second half, but are not enough the fixed the deluded tone that the first half is seemingly stuck with. The Finest Hours might make for an okay history lesson, but not a satisfying action movie nor a romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The effects in this movie were pretty spectacular. Most of the water scenes were actually filmed really well, and they had a lot of intensity. However for the most part, the rest of the film really falls flat. The characters felt incredibly underdeveloped, and a lot them felt very unnecessary. The back story that was given to the characters was incredibly boring and didn't feel at all important. None of this compares to the overly boring love story between Chris Pine and Holliday Grainger. It was highly unnecessary and it felt like they were jamming it onto the audience, it really didn't feel natural. Every time the film would jump back to Grainger's character on shore, I would immediately become bored and annoyed. The production value was very impressive, and it had a lot of intensity the way it was filmed. This unfortunately doesn't make up for the boring back-story, the unneeded love story and the underdeveloped characters. It could have been really good, but it only became an okay film. It's very forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent action movie but do not expect to see "a true story"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was keen for this movie when I saw the trailers some time ago, as were my kids. At the time, I totally missed that it was "based upon a true story." A few days before seeing the film, I got a hold of the book and was thrilled to learn that it was an actual event and what's more, the anniversary of when it happened was in just a few days, February, 18th! Well, I challenged my kids to finish the book and I'd take them to see the movie. We all read it and were completely bowled over by the book and were eager to see the film.The film is well worth seeing. It's a ripping action film. The action sequences and suspense are riveting. The seas and storm, while not nearly as impressive as the actual event are impressively done. The acting was superb, though the characterizations were positively rotten. Chris Pine, Holiday Grainger, Casey Affleck and the rest were a joy to watch, not one bad performance.Though the performances were entertaining, the characterizations were not. The screenplay diverges wildly from the reality and that's a shame. Bernie Webber/Chris Pine was not riddled with self- doubt and ambivalence, nor was he ridiculed or held in low esteem by his co-workers and neighbors. Miriam/Holiday Grainger and he were married before the events took place and she was home in bed sick through out the entire event so had no role whatsoever. Grainger's character and scenes are whole-cloth and the character's behavior while quite believable in today's world would have been unheard of in 1952.Other reviewers have opined about why this or that happened, why a particular decision was made instead of doing something else. The staging of the story, as written for the screenplay creates quite a bit of confusion, whereas the reality of the situations really left no viable alternatives. Bernie Webber made the best decisions he could have made under the circumstances. Chris Pine's character got dragged along by the storm surge.As an aside, I think this movie showcases the disregard Hollywood holds for it's audience. Hollywood seems to think we are unable to grasp complex ideas so they feed us flashy special effects instead of solid stories. It is really a shame, especially in regards to a story like this where the heroes are real and we really need heroes.The heroism of the "coasties" shines in this story but not as brightly in this movie. I strongly urge anyone inspired by this film to read the book and I would recommend the film to anyone who enjoys man-against-the-elements adventures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely dreadful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I barely know where to start. What is with these entirely unlikable characters? Besides the Captain and ...the guy with the beard... none of these people seem to have any business being anywhere around ships. They are all far too timid through the entire film and this is especially true of the protagonist. He's annoyingly meek yet brave enough to head out in the storm. Follows orders to the tee except, inexplicably, for a rather important one in the second half. He is successful in the mission and rather than feel accomplishment for overcoming whatever PTSD he suffers from, he looks like he'll have a panic attack. What was with the million shots of the concerned girlfriend? Did anyone actually care about this character? Was this movie trying to be Titanic? The final 20 minutes were painful to watch. I had the notion of shutting it off every so often but the sinking ship scenes would pull me back in. I wish I had gone with my instinct.Casey Affleck is the only thing good about this film - but he can't save it by a long shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film as easy to dismiss and forget as a wrong number</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "The Finest Hours" is by no means the dreary, ostensibly never-ending mess that was last month's "In the Heart of the Sea," it's by no means even close to matching the quality of "The Perfect Storm," one of the best swashbuckling films of recent time. This is another by-the-numbers Disney film, that turns an incredible true story into a series of shortchanged and theatrical instances of peril that has numerous studio executives crossing their fingers, hoping it will somehow lumber its way to be a huge financial hit in a season when few films of more than average quality are out.If all of Disney's eggs are in "The Finest Hours"'s basket, as I'm sure they aren't but just for the sake of argument, then it simply shows what this time of the year really does to Hollywood. There's nothing fundamentally nor glaringly wrong with "The Finest Hours" other than it's a painfully average, uninteresting slog that does so very little to assure any kind of practical methods were taken to really get to the heart of the helpless characters and those brave enough to embark on what seemed like nothing more than a suicide mission.The film revolves around Bernie Webber (Chris Pine), a member of the Coast Guard stationed in Massachusetts on Cape Cod. Bernie's duties are pretty laidback, until the same day he plans to ask his commander Daniel Cluff (Eric Bana) for permission to marry Miriam (Holliday Grainger), the girl of his dreams, he is ordered to guide a lifeboat and a small crew to rescue the S.S. Pendleton. The gigantic ship has just broken in half after getting caught in a violent nor'easter off the coast of Cape Cod, and Bernie and his three-men crew have to figure out a way to track down the ship and rescue as many or all of its thirty-two passengers.This is exactly the kind of remarkable story that we would be calling implausible had it not been based on a true story (same goes for films like "Argo" and even "Trumbo"), and because of that, it's a film that was ostensibly going to be a bit alienating from the start. The reason being is that when you have a film telling this extraordinary of a story, if you don't make the film about the characters, or at least confine the setting and the focus where it appeals to basic human emotions and practices, such as connection and survival, it's going to feel cold and empty. "The Finest Hours" doesn't go for the survivalist route of "All is Lost," showing its characters at their most helpless and hopeless, nor does it opt for spectacle as it revolves around two developed characters like in "The Perfect Storm." What's left for "The Finest Hours" to do is produce a simple, well-shot action film that does a good job at giving us a chronological timeline of the Coast Guard/Pendleton rescue back in 1952, but nothing else. There's no staying power thanks to thin characters, and there's few enticing or memorable action sequences because we're too often cutting back and forth between what is occurring on the water and Miriam's constant worrying over her husband (in yet another vague and almost entirely worthless female role), providing for desperately little continuity.The film was directed by Craig Gillespie, who seems to be one of Disney's go-to directors for basic live-action entertainment that makes caricatures out of characters and makes the factual seem like the overblown (Gillespie also directed "Million Dollar Arm," another almost instantly forgettable film). In a month when films have ranged from the average to the barely tolerable, perhaps it would've been better for "The Finest Hours" to downright suck because it would've given me a better, more exciting review to write and a funnier, more relevant review for you, dear reader. Instead, I feel, much like a captain of a ship when all is going well, on auto-pilot as I reflect on a film that is about as easy to dismiss and forget as a wrong number.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine work all around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Finest Hours depicts the true story of what is called the greatest US Coast Guard rescue in history. In 1952, Chris Pine, a junior officer, and his small team of men, get dispatched into a raging storm to attempt to rescue survivors from a horrific accident that ripped an oil tanker in half. Pine apparently had failed in a previous rescue attempt, and in the small New England city town, this stain stayed with him forever. But his young bride-to-be brings an out of town attitude that kicks people in the butt, getting them to move, when she sees her spouse's life endangered. There is just enough of that plot to have you rooting for the young couple, but not too much to sap the main story.Casey Affleck delivers from the other side, as the chief engineer on the ship that is going down. The ideas he devises to gain time and give the crew their only chance for survival are incredible. The special effects of the powerful storm, the rescue craft trying to make it thru the breakers, the sinking oil tanker, and the incredible rescue will leave you gasping for air. Despite the Hollywood ending, the fact that the basic facts are true leaves you in awe of these kinds of people, who, when faced with a disaster, run towards the problem, not away. It certainly makes me appreciate the Coast Guard a lot more than beforehand. These are tough people. The Finest Hours is a tough, solid film, with superb acting and high drama. I think you will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney movie, dramatization of a real Coast Guard rescue in 1952.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I saw this at home on DVD from our public library. The two "extras" are short but interesting.It was the winter of 1951/1952 in Massachusetts. A storm was brewing and the Coast Guard station gets a radio transmission that a repaired, welded oil tanker in high seas has broken apart in the rough seas. It is now nighttime, and two Coast Guard rescue crews are dispatched. One of them had to turn back, but one of them continued. This is the story of the ones who continued and against great odds, without compass, found the half of ship with 32 aboard. As the captain later said "It was probably just luck that we found you."Chris Pine is excellent as the captain of the rescue boat, Bernie Webber. As well as Casey Affleck who was playing Ray Sybert, the key leader who managed to figure out a way to get the remaining half ship to a shallow area to ground it, preventing it from sinking until after the rescue.Being at night much of the picture is often indistinct but I suppose that couldn't be helped. Overall a fine movie, and the sound is filled with deep bass at appropriate times, lending to the realism.The character I most enjoyed however is British actress Holliday Grainger as Miriam. I had seen her as Bonnie in a "Bonnie and Clyde" miniseries a couple of years ago, she is very pretty and also a good actress. Here she is the telephone operator who becomes Webber's fiancé and she is among the ones monitoring the events of the evening from the Coast Guard station.The characters here are real people, the ending credits has some photos from the 1952 incident and its aftermath.</fullReview>

It can not be Denied that the Film Battles the Storm and the Sea with State of the Art Gusto, but the A-List Actors Battle to Find something to give Their Characters any Depth at all.It's Sea-Going Action and that's all it is. Everything Else seems Inserted by Committee with Focus Group Approval. Its Flat, Unengaging, Repetitive, Safe Filler to Satisfy Brand Expectations. It all Comes Off as Corny and not Fun Time, Good Corn at that. This is the way the Production 'Thinks" it was in the Early 1950's, but it's more the way it was on Movie Screens and TV Shows. The Only thing worse than all the Tepidness is the Awful Acting and Shallow Characters, especially Chris Pine and Casey Affleck who Both seem Out of Their Depth. Ben Foster just Stands Around most of the time and for an Edgy Actor like Foster, that's a Waste.Family Friendly to the Extreme the Film is Likely to Please the Disney Fan Base and won't Disappoint Fundamentalist Check-Listers. It's Safe for the Whole Family just like an Episode of TV's "Sea Hunt'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Finest Hours is good thrilling adventure movie with good VFX ,engaging screenplay and decent performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Finest Hours (2016): Personally I feel that movies which involves any natural disasters are truly chilling ones because it always makes us to imagine ourselves in their positions.The Finest Hours in one such movie which is based on true events which involves a daring heroic act.Plot: In 1950, in Cape Cod in Massachusetts, the US Coast Guard station in Chatham receives a distress signal from the oil tankers SS Pendleton and SS Fort Mercer. Commander Daniel Cluff assigns the crew formed by Bernie Webber, Richard Livesey, Andy Fitzgerald and Ervin Maske to rescue the crew of the SS Pendleton in a small rescue boat. Cluff is warned about the intensity of the storm by Bernie and also by his girlfriend Miriam but he keeps the order. Meanwhile the SS Pendleton has broken and lost his forward part and his skilled and experienced engineer Ray Sybert assumes the command of the survivors. He uses his abilities to steer the stern in a safer position, grounding it on an unstable bank of sand to avoid sinking.Plus Points:1)Screenplay: Rescue operation movies mostly involves same type of screenplay but the way it builds up thrill plays the major role.The Finest Hours has engaging screenplay which is entertaining at its best.There is no dull moment in the movie and its mostly racy.2)VFX: VFX plays a key role in these type of movies because showcasing a historical natural disasters is not an easy work.The Finest Hours crew has gave their best output and it really helped a lot.The gigantic waves and the rescue operation in the storm are showcased very well.3)Performances: All the actors gave good performances.Chris Pine,Ben Foster,Kyle gave brilliant performances.Minus Points:1)Misses Logic in few scenes: Few scenes have missed logic which is not convincing.In movie they show that all four of our heroic crew crosses dangerous bar with gigantic waves without even getting strapped to anything on their boat.How can it even possible???So The Finest Hours is good thrilling adventure movie with good VFX ,engaging screenplay and decent performances.My rating 7.25/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Test your sea legs until it runs out of steam.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starts its engines slow but is a hell of a ride once she's fired up and gets going. Obviously the studio was bent on spending its budget to create a cinema experience so immersive that frankly, it feels like I'm still seeing waves on the screen as I'm typing out this review.A tale based on a real life coastal rescue, the 50's world has been beautifully restored and provides warmth as bleak coastal towns withstand the storm. It's the kind of a movie that takes you on a ride however, the characters only have a hand in holding the tiller but not the way the direction of the current is headed.Bernie's case for example, he goes through some serious stress emotionally and physically but gets extremely lucky once already but when the ultimatum of making his return journey uses the same formula, you can't help but notice that the studio just ran out of steam by this point to be able to offer a proper closure as to the whole of the journey we've just witnessed. Who could possibly blame them though, when the sailors are no longer in danger and it's over surely we can pat ourselves on the back and head on home. I wish it is as simple as that. and in a way it is, as the movie offers nothing left to be picked up from it the experience. Queue obligatory cuts of factual photos, which falls way short in terms of doing any justice to honour the man, and what we must take home is a mild nausea and the eerie feeling that someone high up in the studio was playing God because we are thankful to be back but not for its providence. A highly enjoyable movie whose fuel is all but burnt on that big ride out that the journey back seems to never have surfaced in the thoughts of the producers. Had it not been based on a true story we may have never come back.For those that want more intrigue than build ups, I also recommend The Deep (2012), about a fisherman to incredibly have survived a shipwreck in freezing cold waters.</fullReview>

The story of Bernie and Miriam made for a good fill in to the story about the coast guard.The visual effects are not as impressive as I thought they would be considering the mock up for 3d. I felt that the effects were a little distracting more than they helped the story arch.I did like the the sets. The peaceful town covered in snow was a great effect that went with the storm at sea.The ship's did look big and made for a lot of suspense, and watching the coast guard try to get over the giant waves of CGI waters was appealing to see. It was definitely an exciting an encouraging rescue made more dramatic by the music.It's on home viewing mediums now and I would suggest you see for yourself.</fullReview>

Chris Pine is a fine actor along with other actors he re creates the magic of history. Cinematography, specially the long shots are really amazing. The body language of all the characters is so good that you feel like they are from the fifties. It's a simple film and you all movie watchers already know the story but i can assure you with one thing that it's good and it is handled with proper care.

		<fullReview>The effects are great. But, the directing was pretty poor. Chris Pine plays the hero Bernie Webber and spends an inordinate amount of screen time at the wheel of this little boat in the middle of a raging gale looking down at nothing. The compass is gone, so he's literally looking down at nothing. In real life he'd never take his eyes off the churning water around him. Very poor directing and way too much melodrama. Too bad because the real story is one of the U.S. Coast Guard's most amazing and mostly successful rescue missions in history. The best actor in the movie is Casey Affleck who does a pretty good job play the quiet, thoughtful, level-headed crewman aboard the stricken tanker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The moments of high suspense work, troughs between the waves not so much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main story worked well. The action scenes and effects were great. I found it quite suspenseful.The attempts to wring every last bit of emotion out of the quieter character moments were sometimes forced and made me want to shout at the screen, "So get on with it!"--Like the moment when all the freighter crew are aboard the rescue vessel and Casey Afleck is asking Chris Pine if he knows the way back to shore and Pine's explaining to him, "Well the wind was coming from my left on the way out, so I figure if I keep it to my right I'll be heading back in and if we just look out for some lights. . . " Which seems like a reasonable enough plan. However, in the meantime, some of these men have actually fallen overboard and must be dying of hypothermia but Captain Pine stands there brooding over the helm with the boat's motor idling, discussing his plan instead of JUST GETTING ON WITH IT. You can talk and drive at the same time, right Chris . . ? Same with a lot of scenes with fishermen huddled over coffee mugs telling us how dangerous it is to be out there on the water on a night like this instead of just getting the camera out there and showing it (which eventually the movie does; it just takes its sweet time about it).SPOILER ALERT: So, was anyone else bothered by the fact that, as the rescued freighter crew climbs, one by one, off the rescue boat and onto the dock that they all (with the exception of Pine) appear to be BONE DRY? I mean, some of these crewmen were actually overboard, floundering in the ocean, just a half an hour earlier. And it's been snowing ever since.So how did they dry off in an open boat? An open boat that, by the way, appears to have the abilities of a submarine in a few scenes. How does an internal-combustion engine run underwater like that? Without air?Could've used one of those on the freighter.</fullReview>

Actor Chris Pine did a wonderful job as the lead, Bernie Webber, capturing the action and emotion behind his courageous voyage. It is really thrilling and scary to see people like those in the Coast Guard that put their lives on the line to save others. It's so commendable and director, Craig Gillespie did a fantastic job of capturing that. The cast overall did a wonderful job portraying their real life characters. The cinematography was incredible as well. Filming such a large at-sea feature is not an easy task and it was done very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cheese-0-meter is broken - permanently</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I semi-slept thru the first 1/3 of the movie. When I work up, I started realizing how horribly cheesy this film was. The movie is so full of clichés it looked like it was making fun of disaster movies. Some examples: "We all live, or we all die." (Chris Pine's response to the overcrowding of the rescue boat.)Tiny saying to the young scared seaman just as they disembark on the sinking ship: "If I can make it, then anyone can make it." (Whereupon he - Tiny - gets crushed against the ship - what a surprise.)People flinging themselves off the sinking ship to be caught by the men on the rescue boat - as cleanly as my catching a Ding Dong before it hits the floor.And the worst of all, Fitz who was holding on to the railing in the very front of the rescue boat, getting flung into the air when a giant wave about destroys the boat, only to land back on the boat. Pllleeeeeaaasse!!!!It was so hokey, it was laughable.The interesting thing is that this really was a true story - while the credits rolled, they showed actual photos of the participants with the actors staged next to them. The newspaper clippings also gave credence to the events.It is just to0 bad they had to cheese it up with so much Hollywood, trite melodrama - which made me doubt and dislike the entire movie.This is a poor testimony to the brave men who really lived through this experience.Sorry I paid $2.79 for this movie. I over paid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot deny that this movie kept me on the edge of my toes with its thrill packed sound and picture effects and the not knowing if the rescue mission will succeed or not. However these were the only positive elements for me. I was just a little bit disappointed by the performance of Chris Pine who, in my opinion, over acted his role as Bernie, as I felt like he was trying too hard to look like a genuinely good and honest man that it was clear that the man was acting. The thing is he doesn't need to try so hard because his face and his eyes, if utilized well, will do the job for him. Another disappointment was Casey Affleck's performance as he was the total opposite of Pine, because he was not trying at all and looked like he was not drawn to the character or the story, even looked bored in some scenes. Eric Bana, one of my favorite actors, was the most disappointment for me as he did not look interested in the character he was playing and overall it was weak performance for Eric Bana. My overall experience watching this movie was somewhat enjoyable .. the love story did not seem necessary for the plot nevertheless it was not necessarily bad either..the movie focused on its main goal which is the rescue mission and the bravery of Bernie and his men and in that it succeeded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent old-school survival drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on an event that would be entirely unbelievable if only it weren't true, this survival-at-sea drama has an unpretentious, old school charm that wears its heart on its sleeve and its optimism as a badge of honour. When an oil tanker splits in half during a raging storm, Casey Affleck's chief engineer Ray employs ingenuity and nerves of steel to lead the remaining men ? all of whom are stereotypes yet not mere caricatures ? through an impossible situation. Meanwhile Chris Pine's by-the-book Bernie, a Coast Guard who has recently tasted failure in his line of work, must overcome personal adversity and harsh conditions in his rescue attempt undertaken in a small boat with a crew of only four. These two intersecting stories are thrilling, interesting and affecting enough to carry the film, so it's a damn shame a third of the runtime (including a slightly too-cheesy ending) is given to the town folk nervously waiting to see if their loved ones will make it home. Every time it abandons the ocean-set exploits in favour of checking in on the families ? in particular Bernie's infuriatingly na?ve and misguided girlfriend Miriam (Holliday Grainger) ? the suspense is undercut and the momentum is stifled. Huge credit must be given to the production designers and visual-effects artists though, the multi-layered set of the (slowly) sinking ship's engine room is epic and immersive, whilst the wide shots seemingly composed entirely of CGI are convincing and seamless. The Finest Hours is far from perfect, but it's a refreshingly simple family-friendly tale with a pleasant, old-fashioned approach to storytelling that celebrates the human spirit without a hint of irony.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately I have been to sea on an old converted (to a bulk carrier) T2 Tanker ... and worked on and stood a watch in the engine room. These ships 'engines' were Steam Turbo Electric. The only way these engine rooms could have been that quiet ... is if the plant was completely shut down.The men on the tanker would not have been able to stand up. There is no "engine intake" or "ahead" or astern" nozzles. So, for me, that part of the movie was pretty sad ... at least give these men the respect of attempting to make it realistic?The Coast Guard scenes? Don't know wasn't in the CG. However ... for that little boat to completely submerge (several times)and still have the engine running? The men involved earned some respect here ... this movie fails miserably and fails to acknowledge (through any kind of realism) the acts it took to bring those men home. The other period details were pretty good even though it was mostly CG.Maybe they should have somebody that has actually been to sea? So I'm going with the lowest I can give. Basing a movie on a true story is not a license to degrade it.It is 117 (wasted) minutes of my life I will never get back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as fine as you would expect from this cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In the coast guard they say you go out, they don't say you gotta come back."Director Craig Gillespie and Disney team up once again following their 2014 film, Million Dollar Arm. This time the true story is based on the 1952 Coast Guard rescue attempt at Cape Cod. The film counts with a stellar cast starting from the always charismatic Chris Pine, and including some strong supporting performances from the likes of Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, Eric Bana, Holliday Grainger, and John Magaro. The Finest Hours captures the fifties with delicacy while also remaining old school. The film is by the books and told in a way that most movies based on true events are, so it doesn't stand out. The effects are believable but they never accomplish much visually. There are some thrilling moments and the film slowly builds the tension during the final act, but it does take a bit too long setting the premise and trying to establish a love story that doesn't seem to be all that interesting or relevant. The Finest Hour begins by introducing us to the hero of the story who is about to go on his first date with the woman who will eventually become his fiancée. Chris Pine is Bernie Webber, a shy man who follows orders and likes to do things by the books, while Holliday Grainger is Miriam, a woman who is set on going after what she want. The love story lacks emotion and therefor it is the weakest link in the film. It is the reason why the first half of the film didn't work for me and why I wished the film focused more on the events taking place in the split oil tanker during the storm. Pine is playing against type here since his character is rather timid and that takes away a lot of his charm. I will give him credit for trying to play a different character, but I don't think he was the right choice for the part. Casey Affleck is the true standout, playing one of the crew members in the oil tanker fighting for their survival. He reminds us what a great actor he is and I wish the film focused more on his character. The rescue mission is exciting and thrilling, but the film takes too long to set itself up. Perhaps The Finest Hours is one of the better films being released in January since this is considered the dumping ground for most movies, but it still isn't good enough to get a fresh grade from me. The film has its moments and Casey Affleck should be getting bigger roles, but other than that the movie does fall flat and lacks the emotional depth other rescue films have. I'm usually a fan of Chris Pine, but I didn't enjoy his performance here and this is one of the few films from him that I haven't liked. If you are nostalgic for old-fashioned adventure films than this might be the right film for you, otherwise skip it.</fullReview>

I believe that I got to this situation for two reasons.First,the plot wasn't been managed well.For example,the HYPE scenes where you actually thrilled are too short and involved with bad effects that makes you not comfortable and bored.Second,except Chris Pine and Holliday Grainger the acting was very bad and not convenience enough something that made feel not emotionally connected with the characters. Also,the dynamic between the actors didn't satisfied me.I truly don't understand why this movie is so well rated,it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,almost no action,no intense or interesting plot.

		<fullReview>I find it puzzling when people rate this movie less than 7/10. My question is - Have you seen it? Or you were you half asleep? First of all the acting is superb, so it directing, music and everything else in this movie. Rescue missions are one my of favourite genres and this movie could not have been made any better. Rotten Tomatoes says "The Finest Hours will satisfy those seeking a traditional rescue drama ? but may leave more adventurous viewers wanting more". OK, then Avatar will satisfy those fond of sci-fi movies but will not be any good for comedy lovers. It is an excellent and well made rescue drama and that's how it should be viewed because it is based on true events, it would've been wrong to make up and some adventurous character to it just for the sake of satisfying more viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT.I wanted to caption this "Salvaged by Fabulous Ending" but that would have been a spoiler in itself. But that's my real title.Why is it so hard to make good sea movies? The music and setting of this reminded me of so many TV movies. But the understated approach paid off at the end, and I could not stop the tears.The movie plays off a fantastic real-life rescue by some very brave Coast Guard seamen. It will make you proud to be a human.I had the movie as a "6" until the last 5 minutes. "6" is just below the point I'll rewatch a movie, and "7" is my minimum rating for a "good", rewatchable movie. I might have gone with 6.5 if IMDb had half ratings.About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of "terrible", with 5 being "mediocre" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very Good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding.

		<shortDescription>A very much acceptable film that inspired by a real event except long pauses and too much ineffective sentiment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A disaster drama-thriller based on the true account of the 1952. So much better film than I anticipated. But there are a few things I did not like; like the frequent pauses in the narration where nothing really happens other that space given for the emotional background score to pull the viewers in. In a result, it did not work, definitely not for me. Yeah, in the many important scenes, it froze like it happens in the chess games before anybody move their pawn.In the crucial part of the narration, when the boat was overcrowded, there was an unnecessary pause which annoyed me. It was surely a remarkable segment of the story, but sentimentally failed to appeal or maybe you can call it a too much of the sentiment. Honestly, I liked the story, but the film exceeded its runtime to slow down the portrayal of the event which is surely a drawback than any kind of benefit.I loved the performances, everybody was good and so the CGI, which was not a top notch yet acceptable. Especially as it takes place in the dark time, they had the advantage to depict the atmosphere as much as close to how it would have looked 65 years ago and as well to avoid the errors.I never saw its trailer or the teaser, but I knew about this project and after seeing its posters I though it would be about the offshore oil rig. When I saw the film, I realised I was wrong and surprise do such thing happen in real.The film was also did not let my interest fall. Thanks to the director who always try different genre yet he's not a mega budget filmmaker. A good film, but like I said should have been even better. Especially should have out classed in the sentimental segments. I don't know how good was the digital 3D version of it, but still this regular version is worth to give it a shot.7?/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very straight forward rescue tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You might enjoy watching this movie if you are in the mood for an adventure/rescue movie with some romance set in a 1950's feel era. This is a very simple movie, you won't find any surprising plot twists, but it does a lot of things right. The acting is good. The cinematography, costumes, and setting are all interesting to look at. I'm always fascinated by stories of rogue waves and the power of the sea. Some of the open water scenes in this movie with massive waves are really exciting and probably the highlight of the movie. As another reviewer mentioned there are basically three different story lines that the movie bounces back and forth between. The romantic story line is definitely the weakest and the other two do not feel especially interwoven. Overall, I would recommend it as entertainment but would caution against any expectation of greatness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Life Heroes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sixties delivered to us something that was fresh and new at the time, the rise of the anti-hero. This would be someone of lesser moral compulsion who usually took the wrong way to do the right thing. While it was fresh and new at the time in more recent years it's become the norm rather than the exception. So when a movie offers good old fashioned heroes it's nice to see. When those characters are based on real life people it becomes inspiring.Based on the true story of the 1952 rescue of the crew of the SS Pendleton, the movie doesn't just cover the rescue itself but the men involved as well. Chris Pine stars as Bernie Webber, a Coast Guard crewman in Chatham, Massachusetts who's shy, quiet and dealing with a tragedy that happened a year ago under his watch. Meeting with Miriam (Holliday Grainger), a phone operator he's been talking to for some time now, the two begin dating and reach a point where they make plans to get married. All Bernie thinks he needs to do is get permission from his commanding officer.But before that can happen a terrible storm sets in and two different oil tankers split in half. The crew of the SS Pendleton watch in fear as the front half of their ship plunges beneath the surface with all who were aboard that half of the ship. Still in control of the engines but dealing with a crack in the ship that's allowing water to build up, head engineer Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck) directs them to rig a way to steer by hooking girders into the rudder. It's slow but gives them enough control that they head for the nearest shoal with the hope of grounding the ship until help can arrive.Back on shore at the Coast Guard station one boat sets out to help with the rescue of the first ship. As the only one left behind to command a second ship towards the Pendleton, Bernie takes on three other crew members and heads for the ship. With winds blowing and waves reaching over 70 feet in height, Bernie and his crew also have to deal with what is known as the bar, a series of shoals that are treacherous to go through even under the best of circumstances and the cause of his defeat the previous year. As the small boat and crew make their way through this deadly option viewers will sit in awe and fear gripping the arms of your seat waiting to see the outcome.These two tales intertwine to make an incredibly suspenseful film. A third plot line of Miriam attempting to deal with the fact that the man she just agreed to marry is in harm's way and may not make it back to shore. She deals with his commanding officer, the folks on shore she is now getting to know and the family of members who were lost the previous year under similar circumstances. All three stories combine to move the film forward and to intensify the action on screen.Not knowing the outcome of the movie or having read about this event I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen. The severed boat could go down with all on board or at least a large percentage of them wouldn't survive. The small vessel captained by Webber could find itself in even more disastrous circumstances and no one onboard that ship might make it back. And Miriam could find herself a widow before the marriage even took place. All of these concepts are tossed around much like the ships in the high rising swells of waves on screen but by the end of the film all are resolved.The most refreshing thing about this movie was that it played out like a classic heroic movie of the past, where black and white good guys and bad were easily identifiable. What these men went through is truly heroic and depicts the Coast Guard in a way that will make you never consider them a low level branch of the military ever again. This is a film that young people should be sat down to watch, giving them a chance to see an example of that old school greatest generation of our time at work. And the fact is that other than the amount of suspense found on screen here it's a movie that kids could watch as well with no foul language or exposed body parts as well. Who would think that in today's age that was even possible any longer! Pine does an amazing job here displaying acting talents that for me haven't been seen before, at least not in the depth that he offers here. Affleck turns in another great performance as well as the man doing his best to save his crew while dealing with those who are willing to look for shortcuts towards survival that he knows will only result in death. The movie is an inspiration and one that, as I stated, needs to be seen. It didn't do as expected at the box office and that's sad as good a movie as it is. Perhaps that will change with the release of the film on DVD. I can only hope so. Take the plunge and watch this one today.</fullReview>

It was a good mix of personalities. The movie was overall outstanding, had realistic staging, special effects and cinematography.

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic History Lesson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On February 18, 1952, the SS Pendleton oil tanker broke in two just off the coast of Cape Cod during a violent Nor'easter. The Finest Hours is the heroic tale of the four Coast Guard crewmen who defied all odds and pulled off one of the greatest rescue missions of all-time. Starring Chris Pine as soft-spoken Bernie Webber, the Coast Guard Captain who piloted the tiny rescue boat into the storm and came back with 32 Pendleton survivors aboard, The Finest Hours is a beautifully realized history lesson that is full of emotion. While some might call this movie old-fashioned, that is the reason I like it. This is a movie that represents everyday men and women full of courage in the face of insurmountable fear. In short, if I had to sum up this movie in one word, it would be bravery. From the bravery displayed by Bernie Webber and his fellow Coast Guardsmen, to the crew of the SS Pendleton led by Casey Affleck's Ray Sybert, all the way to Holliday Grainger as Miriam Pentinen, Bernie's fiancé who is doing everything on land to make sure Bernie comes home safely, it was the bravery of all of the individuals involved that created such a fascinating story. Of course, what makes The Finest Hours stick with you is the relationship between Bernie and Miriam. Pine and Grainger have a magnetic chemistry that has you rooting for them to be together, with Grainger exuding a screen presence not too dissimilar from many starlets of the Golden Age of Hollywood. It is this ability to emotionally connect that makes The Finest Hours more than an interesting true life adventure story.I give The Finest Hours a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is based upon a true story.In 1952 a severe storm off the coast of Cape Cod causes the oil tanker, SS Pendleton, to break in half sending 34 men to the stern of the ship in the hope of a rescue. Head Engineer, Ray Sybert (Casey Affeck) believes the only hope they have is to run the ship onto a shoal otherwise the ship would be at the mercy of the 70-foot waves. USCG Commander Cluff (Eric Bana) sends Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) and his team out to rescue the men on the Pendleton. The real danger in this is going through the bar, a series of shoals that are very dangerous to go thru even in calm weather. Oh, oh.This is probably one of the best rescue movies I have ever seen. I sat there cringing all the time even though I knew the rescue would be successful. How many of the scenes were shot is beyond me. Yes, I knew CGI played a big part in this but???still??? I mean it was like I was actually there being tossed about inside that half of a ship, and those waves outside were more than menacing. Kudos to the director.The acting all around is excellent, but the cinematography should win some awards as it was nothing short of spectacular. It looked like they shot the movie in the worst part of winter with ice all around and if that was CGI, it was exceptional. Kudos. (maybe movie magic?)Just like any trip we take, the longest part of the journey is getting there. Coming back doesn't take as long. And this was true within this movie. Took a long time to get to the half-ship, but coming back hardly took any time at all. See? (yes, very clever)There are no twists to look for, but keep in mind Bernie and company lost their compass and really didn't know where the Pendleton was. And after the rescue, Bernie didn't know where the homeland was to return. Bernie says on the way out he kept to the left and on the return he kept to the right. Seemed to have worked.Watch at the end to see what happened to all as photos are shown of the actual USCG crew.A statement at the end also says this was one of the greatest rescues in USCG history for small boats. I say this was probably the greatest rescue in history period. We salute the USCG, and, of course, all military personnel, firemen and policemen who run to the problem and not run away from it. Kudos and thank you. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Finest Hours is just plainly put, serviceable, albeit in an old-fashioned way. There are some exhilarating sequences of problem solving and rescuing on the deep sea, but they quickly fizzle off and become a melodramatic lull; it feels more comfortable being there. This being a Disney movie and all, hard and gritty is not the tone it is going for, which means just like the sailors and rescuers we will be chest-deep in sweet syrup in the end. I didn't mind that so much. It just feels like a missed opportunity to be something different. The thing I hate the most is the love angle - feels like a last minute afterthought to give the dude a reason to come home from an arduous rescue. Emotionally, it doesn't resonate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Finest HoursThe worst thing about being in the Coast Guard is that the only bribes you ever receive are in the form of crustaceans.Thankfully, all of the navel officers in this drama seem on the up and up.On the day he's to ask his commanding officer (Eric Bana) permission to marry his fiancée (Holliday Grainger), First Mate Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) and a skeleton crew (Ben Foster, Kyle Gallner, John Magaro) are dispatched to a grounded oil tanker off Cape Cod.But Bernie's tiny vessel, and the relentless nor'easter, could keep him from saving all 32 crewmembers (Casey Affleck, John Ortiz, Graham McTavish).While it is a satisfying seafaring saga inspired by actual events from the 1950s, this Disney derring-do is never as harrowing as it should be, or as romantic as it tries to be.Moreover, doesn't maritime law decree that Coast Guard officers can only marry mer-people?

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of an oil tanker that is split in half by unforgiving storms. Over thirty crew members struggle to survive, while four US Coast Guards mount a near impossible rescue mission to save the crew members."The Finest Hours" starts off slow and tedious, as the subplots they introduce only serve as the backdrop for the later adventure. I would have liked more of the rescue effort shown on screen, and less time on land. Maybe it is for this reason that the film does not grip me and touch me as it should have done.Once Webber and his crew start the rescue mission, the film picks up pace significantly. The visual effects of the storms and the enormous waves are very good. Even though the ending is to be expected to end this way, it is quite touching nonetheless to see the outcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie does an good job of portraying a convincing 1950s, innocent ocean town and its people. The casting and acting is strong, and the story, once it gets going, is quite gripping. The special effects of the storm, and waves, the wreck and rescue are handled well and not over-done.With a film based on a true story like this, it's easy to overlook its qualities and focus on fact checking instead. Unfortunately the movie does stray from the facts, the main discrepancies being depiction of events on-board the SS Pendleton, such as the attempt to ground it on a shoal and the dramatic argument among the crew. These are fictionalised. When it comes to the actual rescue mission, however, events are followed accurately and there is an extra sense of drama knowing that this part of the move happened in real life in much the same way.A rare movie that not only entertains but, being based on a true-story, also informs and inspires.</fullReview>

Unlike 'The Poseidon Adventure'; this film made me swear off going on a cruise. Some of the Boston accents were a little overdone; and some of the acting was a little forced. A little more time could have been spent on the primary character's back story. But overall, this film showed what true heroes are. I would not allow a child under 12 to watch this film, it is that intense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not much to say about this film. I came out of this film unsatisfied and couldn't figure out why. Then I saw 'the guardian' for the first time and realized what it was-there's no attachment to anyone in this film. There was no character development at all, they throw you right into the action and that's it. I wanted to watch this movie in theaters for the big screen epic effect but it's unnecessary when the story doesn't work. The only character who changed is the Michael Raymond James character who starts as a selfish all for himself guy and finally gives into teamwork. Other than that, no interesting characters or performances here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Baddest Melodrama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, when a movie proudly proclaims "Based upon a true story" I have learned over the years to expect one of two things.Either, it will take a real story, butcher it mercilessly but somehow still manage to make an entertaining film. Or, it will take a real story, butcher it mercilessly and then dare you to find fault with it because it is "based on a true story".The Finest Hours is in the latter camp, sadly. The story of a brave sea rescue sounds just dandy in synopsis form, but the realisation of that rescue just ended being badly executed.The first problem is the utterly unnecessary "love-interest" story tacked on to the movie. If you completely removed the Miriam character from the movie we would have a simple one hour thirty movie about a rescue at sea. But no, because of the "Scriptwriter 101" Bible, we have this romantic subplot badly shoehorned into the movie. And it is bad, trust me. Miriam's character comes across as horribly needy and controlling - in short, an unlikable character - and serves no useful purpose to the film's main story, except as a means to break up the sea scenes. Additionally, her character is entirely at odds with the time she is in. Jarringly so, in fact. But Disney, I guess, couldn't have a hero without having the obligatory "woman waiting for him to return" on shore plot.Beyond that, when we finally get to the rescue, I expected some sort of crazy maneuvering by the coast guard ship, or some clever way to get the men from the stricken tanker onto the rescue boat.But no, apparently basing a movie on a real life story and mucking it up a lot didn't include the notion of making this pivotal sequence interesting. So instead of something clever, we are treated to men climbing down a ladder and jumping either into the sea, or directly onto the lifeboat.There is some good in the film. Pretty much any of the scenes aboard the tanker are nicely done and far more interesting than watching the antics of either Chris Pine (who here acts as woodenly as his name), or his pushy, control-freak of a girlfriend.The tanker crew's struggle shows where all of the imagination in this script was. In fact, if the movie had been told primarily from their perspective with the coast guard crew as a secondary plot, and little miss annoying nowhere to be seen, then the movie would have been far more satisfying.As it is, however, the film is somewhat dull and heavily weighted down by its own suffocating melodrama. Far too cloying.SUMMARY: Horrible romantic subplot, dull rescue scenes and entirely too much melodrama to make this one worthwhile. Characters that all seem to be in various stages of depression. Perfect Storm, this ain't!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Finest Hours wasn't the perfect storm. It was bland. This movie is not Semper Paratus!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired by true events and based off, the 2009 book of the same name, by Michael J. Tougias &amp; Casey Sherman. This movie directed by Craig Gillespie tells the story how a small boat of U.S. Coast Guardsmen pulled off the most daring rescue in their service's history. Set in Massachusetts in 1952, the film follows the men daring enough to rescue the 30+ man crew trapped aboard the sinking SS Pendleton, an oil tanker bound for Boston that was ripped in half during one of the worst storms to ever hit the East Coast. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, since the movie is based on real-life events. There is little to look forward to. The movie is just too predictable and full of old fashioned clichés. Despite that, it's still, somewhat worth checking out. The acting in the film was pretty good for the most part. In spite of some of the supporting characters being very unlikeable due to cowardly or stupidity. At least, the main character, wasn't that bad. Yes, he's a dull milk-toast kind of a guy, but I kinda like Chris Pine as Coast Guard Captain Bernie Webber. It's nice to see him, played a character, with a strong sense of justice, morality, and righteousness, while also being very obedience and rigid to the rules of his command. It's so different from his normal roles of playing captains that were also brave, but somewhat selfish and brash with their action. By far, he's the best character, in this film. However, I really wasn't very invested in the relationship, his character had with Miriam Pentinen (Holliday Grainger). Holliday Grainger is a fine actress, but I found her character to be a little too dependent to care about. She's so selfish. Miriam repeated, forceful demands that the rescue effort be called off to keep Bernie out of danger was really bad! I really didn't like her. Honestly, what did she think was going to happen, if she was going to marry a Coast Guard!? I'm glad, she got kicked out of the Coast Guard station over it. If that wasn't enough; she stupidly hits a snowbank and had to be bailed out by a housewife whom husband is trapped on the Pendleton. I get that it was supposed to be character development for her, but it came across as too annoying and all-time waster. Those scenes were really too distracting from the gripping main plot of the rescue mission. Anyways, the real Miriam was just in home in bed with the flu. Not only that, but she was already marry to Bernie a year and a half prior to the Pendleton rescue, so she knew that she was getting herself into. By the way, in real-life, Bernie met his wife, Miriam over the telephone, not in a blind date, if you wondering. Another thing, that wasn't true to real events is how Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck), the first assistant engineer and now de facto leader of the Pendelton crew, wanted to run the SS Pendleton aground. In truth, this decision would be, very stupid, because the ship would had broken up faster in the relentless surf. Anybody who is a Chief Engineer would have at least, known that. In real-life, Chief Engineer Ray Sybert actually decided to keep the Pendleton's stern as far offshore as possible, fearing that the ship might sink faster, if he did. Another thing, that Sybert didn't do, is cut the lifeboats as most of the crew, knew, already that the idea of escaping the ship by boat would be nuts, because how the monstrous waves were acting. If they did try to escape the ship by lifeboat. They would likely had been crush against the hull for sure. That's the reason, why none of the boats were ever launched. As much as I kinda like the Pendleton crew in the movie. I found most of the characters on the ship to be one-dimension. First off, you got the doubter, D.A Brown (Michael Raymond-James) who has nothing else to say, besides fighting with everybody. The old man of the ship, Frank Fauteux (Graham McTavish) who should be leading the crew, but isn't. Then there is the over-the-top jolly big fella, George 'Tiny' Myers (Abraham Benrubi) who should be scare, but isn't for some odd reason. Then you got the young greenhorn, Elvin Maske (John Magaro). Every one of them is clichés. Even Casey Affleck as Ray Sybert was kinda average. I'm sorry, I know he's a great actor, but he's so typecast, here. Honestly, it seems like Casey Affleck, only played characters that are shy, reticent people! It's a bit tiresome. He always talks like he has marbles in his mouth. Way too depressing. I also hate, how cool and collected, everybody is, despite the fact that there is two ships that are sinking. Everybody takes their time to get to the ships. There is little to no stakes. The action scenes in this movie is not that exciting. The movie didn't even, bother, showing the other ship that broke in half. Where was scenes of the coast guard, rescuing the SS Fort Mercer? The rescue of the SS Fort Mercer survivors was just as incredible as the SS Pendleton. I don't get why, they didn't show it. Anyways, the 3D isn't worth it. It's way too dark, blurry and rainy to tell, what's happening on screen. Also, the CGI storm, looks a little too fake looking for my taste. I really didn't like the ending with all the fake-looking car lights. It was too unrealistic. Overall: While the movie does a good job in capturing a sense of the post-WWII era with the sets and costume &amp; the fact that the music by composer Carter Burwell was good. This old timey tale of heroism sunk for the most part. I can only recommended this as a one time watch. It's alright, but not good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A survivor tale that goes dodgy mid-way, scrabbles towards the end with an insipid feel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately for this one, I can't say my two hours were the finest hours of my life. The movie's dramatic quotient is bland.SPOILERS: Chris Pine is an absent unimpressive Coast Guard hero who seemed oddly placed in the shoes of Bernie Webber. OK, so he was trying to depict a sheepish introvert, yet Craig Gillespie just makes him disappear like an apparition. He does the opposite with Ray Sybert played brilliantly by Casey Affleck though, the guy who kept the Pendleton afloat for hours in a punishing storm. Casey looked engrossed in his job, very intelligent, and despite being scared was trying to save lives of the people around. Ray, au contraire, just wanted to get married to Miriam, and follow orders. It seemed in the beginning the way he slouched around with his team that he didn't really care about people's endangered lives.Screenplay is very shoddy, doesn't have anything interesting for word-freaks. The love story that Casey Sherman and Michael J. Tougias have endeavoured to weave makes you indifferent towards their romance. It starts out pretty good though but then is lanced by mediocre lines, and unfelt romance. Editing is below average and often makes you wonder out loud what should have been shown and what we could have lived without.There is literally at one point a "What-the-hell" moment when Miriam Webber walks into the office of the Coast Guard, and refuses to leave, and "orders" the Coast Guard officer to bring the boys back. When Daniel Cluff (played by Eric Bana) retorts, she storms off in her car only too drive into a snow mound. I mean, that entire affair will make you go "Whaaaaaaaaat!" It was supposed to be subtly written and should have packed in the right amount of sentiment, which was clearly missing. But it all seemed so stupid with her weird acting that you can't really shake it off.The Finest Hours misses big time on its much needed emotional trauma. You don't feel a thing for anybody. If it was helmed properly, you would. At the end of the movie, Bernie doesn't get a hero's welcome as he disembarks the CG-36500, but rather his lover's warmth, which leaves you actually vexed. You wish it was milked more or maybe shown in subtlety.The Finest Hours is good but it could have plunged in better waters to be honest. A one time watch if you want to know about the Coast Guard bravado, a rare feat that saved 32 lives on just a mere lifeboat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Pine stays in condition for captaining a starship in the off season by captaining a Coast Guard rescue craft. There's a brief and slightly stiff opening setup of the love interest where he awkwardly asks Miriam Webber out. Holliday Grainger radiates Fifties wholesome cuteness with almost painful intensity. But then comes a really bad day where two ships simultaneously break apart in the same storm off Cape Cod. With all resources tied up on the first rescue, Pine has no choice but to take a small craft over a treacherous bar in heavy surf to deal with the second ship. Of the 41 men aboard, 32 were saved. Eight died on the bow section and one, as shown in the film, died when a wave slammed him into the ship. Casey Affleck, as Ray Sybert, plays the unpopular ship's engineer who keeps the ship functioning long enough for help to arrive. But mostly it's the sea and the unrelenting tension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It takes "The Finest Hours" some time to find its bearing, afterwards it's a nice sail through the rocky storm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as disaster movie goes, "The Finest Hours" is atypical of the usual mold. It seems vanilla, slightly timid in the execution, which is still fine due to its production quality, but it does overturn it from more harrowing promises. There's also quite a bit of spotlight given to the romance subplot, this feels unnecessary and in some events might break the pace. However, when it gets the steam rolling, it produces a delightful display of blue cold waves and breaking steel.This is a real life story of the rescue of the sinking tanker in 1952 told mainly in two perspectives; the Coast Guard Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) and the tanker crew led by Sybert (Casey Affleck). It continuously shifts between the passive yet courageous Webber and equally resourceful though apprehensive Sybert as they struggle through their respective trial.Chris Pine is good cast, Webber is not like his previous roles, he's more reserve and quite. It's a "shine in peril" kind of role and he delivers well in momentous scenes. Meanwhile, Casey Affleck as the engineer is trying to keep the tanker afloat despite disdain from his colleagues and collapsing morale. These two leads also have the same predicament, Sybert and Webber are not the squad favorite, so it builds up a nice underdog story as well.One can argue that Miriam (Holliday Grainger) is given the third point of view since her angle takes a few good chunks of the runtime. It's understandable to introduce motivation of loved ones as well as shedding light on Webber's back story, although her parts seem prolonged as some of them are less crucial and the movie could do without them.For a movie filled with nautical terms, it tries to acclimate the audience to the increasing tension as accessible as possible, concentrating on the race against time with daring attempts and ingenious makeshift means. Visual and audio are a match made in stormy sea. The editing for the more extreme sequences are well crafted, it even portrays the ocean so vastly grim it is borderline romantically ominous.The ordeal could've been told in crueler and faster fashion, but the direction for an inspiring triumph is appreciated as well. It is a fine venture to the freezing water with warm home to return to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>based on the trailer, I wasn't expecting anything different from other similar films. the very slow start hangs on a mushy romance and I'm thinking what about the boat broken in half. but hang on. we do get to it. the surprise is that there are two stories, both exciting and heroic. the scenes and action on the disabled ship are very real and seem quite dangerous. while the chris pine piloted boat goes on an adventure of its own. Affleck is very good in his role as an anti hero and pine does what he can. handsome young men have to get into their 40's before talent rears it's head. I did not choose 3d. I don't care for the glasses-I don't think I missed much. I have seen a lot worse movies. really, give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good movie... but with Disney's stigma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really a shame that good movies like this one, and based on true events, are not received as is deserve. This is a good movie, great scenes in the sea, emotion, suspense, and with a love story very well embedded, like Titanic did it, even when this time it is not the center of the story (for good). And even more amazing, is that the real story has enough heroism... all of us know that sometimes scripts are adjusted for the big screen (sometimes to dramatize more than the necessary).But the main problem is the stigma of being a Disney movie. Disney has accustomed the moviegoers to sea monsters or a funny guy like Sparrow, walking like he was drunk in the crucial moments (unfortunately, for a lot of people, that is a generalized idea when they listen Disney... sometimes bad movies without any kind of message, and just for kids).But no, Disney has confirmed, and most recently, that they know how to make good movies, and not just movies like "Frozen"; don't get me wrong, Frozen is an excellent movie (I really liked), but is a very different movie. In fact, my disappointment is that "The Finest Hours" reminds me of course with a totally different plot, another great movie of Disney which bet to originality, and which unfortunately was not appreciated as had to be: Tomorrowland... a gem very underrated (in fact, I think until now, Tomorrowland is the best Disney movie outside the animated jewels that they posses, because the originality of their story and its message).Maybe they need a new brand for the promotion of really good movies like this one, or another kind of publicity, or a different approach to the audience, because the Disney brand is resulting a bad reference for the promotion of some of their greatest films.My final thought is: If you like an adventure movie and with the human touch, you must watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good way to honour brave men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>26 February 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Finest Hours. Well done Disney. This was a film filled with intense drama and although I wasn't on the very edge of my seat, the action had me firmly pushed into it. Based on a true story, it depicts the events of 1952 when two cargo ships had the misfortune to be broken up by a big storm. The bravery of the coast guard is honoured by this portrayal of the dangers faced, just in getting away from the land and before setting out to find the remains of a ship in zero visibility and freezing temperatures. Chris Pine plays Bernie Webber, a quiet, by the regulation, member of the Coastguard, who sets off with a crew of three to do the impossible. If this was a work of fiction you would be hard pressed to believe it, but being based on a true story I found myself willing the tiny lifeboat to mount each wave, not turn over and attack the next one with the fervour of men on a mission. I do like a good disaster movie, and this definitely falls into that category, but is much more sombre because it's true. Please stay and watch the credits, there are photos and newspaper cuttings of the real people involved with these events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story, but needed more character development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We find something universally appealing in stories of rescue. A story of humans risking their own lives to help other humans lifts our spirits?and perhaps reminds us of the value inherent in each one of us.So does The Finest Hours?the rescue movie from Disney opening this weekend? deliver?The movie stars Chris Pine and Casey Affleck and is the true story of the 1952 Coast Guard rescue of men whose oil tanker literally broke in half during a violent storm. The actual story is pretty incredible, considering the odds against the men in the hull of the tanker and the odds against the small Coast Guard boat.What makes any rescue movie so poignant for the viewer is a connection with the characters. When we bond with a character, we want him to make it. The Finest Hours attempted to do this by giving us some back story on Bernie Webber (played by Chris Pine), the man leading the rescue. But for me, it just wasn't enough.I was more interested in Ray Sybert, the man aboard the tanker (played by Casey Affleck) who took charge . The movie hinted at a back story? relationships issues with the crew?but the director instead focused on the action sequences on the boat. In the end, it seemed Sybert's heroic actions were downplayed.I'm not giving anything away; it's a common fact the rescue was successful. The movie is awash (no pun intended) with special effects, but in the end, it was just a boat rescue with no heart connect with the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Movies I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked into this movie looking for a good adventure/drama and walked out believing in miracles. First, this tanker breaks in half directly in the middle of a tank causing very little damage to the water-tight bulk-head. Second, a young Coast Guardsman does the near impossible and not only gets his boat out of the harbor, but does so without losing any of his men. Third, without a compass, stars or visibility he finds the Pendleton's stern. Fourth, the tanker has ended up on a shoal making the coast guard boat the only that that has to be maneuvered around (if I understand correctly a little movie-license was taken here as the crew was actually trying to stay off the shoals). Fifth, 33 men climbed down the ladder in near impossible conditions, dropping into either the boat or water and only 1 was lost. Sixth, a boat designed to carry a crew of 4 with 12 passengers (where an experienced crewman estimated the most they could hold was 22) actually carried 36 people. And finally, without any navigational aide the massively over-loaded boat made it back into the bay and to the town's dock - without losing one person along the way. If I didn't know it was a true story I would have thought I was watching somebodies over-done imagination. But each of the above items is true and did happen. Forget the incredibly great special effects, the story alone is worth going to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for The Finest Hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie The Finest Hours is based on the true event of the wreck of an oil tanker ship in the North East Atlantic ocean. The crew of the S.S. Pendleton lose communication and have no way of notifying anyone that they are sinking. Due to the heavy storm, most of the Coast Guard has been dispatched on other rescue missions and no one is looking for the Pendleton. It's by chance that the Coast Guard is made aware of the ship and only a four men set out on a small boat, in extreme weather and current conditions, to rescue the survivors.While there is a love story set up in the beginning, the best parts of the movie take place out at sea. There is some character development in Chris Pine's character, Boatswain Mate 1st Class Bernie Webber. Throughout the whole, movie they set up Webber to be a shy guy that always follows the rules and doesn't question his orders. There is little bits of information here and there about his past. In the end, Webber acts against his character in order to save over 20 lives and become a real hero. There is some solid acting in this movie from all of the performers. The accents from Pine and Eric Bana were not great but not distracting either. Ben Foster was practically unrecognizable, and Casey Affleck, who plays the Chief Engineer of the Pendleton, shows a lot of the strength and confliction within his character. Actress Holliday Grainger plays Pine's love interest and does a great job playing a strong 50's lady, who is not the typical housewife type of that time. Other supporting actors also bring strong performances and you often forget the period the movie takes place in.The visual effects in this movie are great. The shots of the boats out in the water going up against giant waves looked amazing. There were a few moments in the small boat that seemed unrealistic, but for the most part, everything on the water was done well. The grand scale of the oil tanker was a magnificent reveal. There is very good cinematography in this movie, even the snow storm on land had a great feel to it.There is not a lot of bad in this movie. The opening scenes could have been done a little bit quicker while still establishing the characters properly. There are a few edit choices where it cuts back from the action in the water to land, that feels a bit off. Perhaps that was on purpose to undercut the suspension, but it's not that bothersome. For the most part, the movie sets everything up well and explains to the audience what is really at stake between the two ships and the characters on them. It is amazing to think that this event ever took place, and it is nice to get a good solid Coast Guard based movie. It is like the last half of the Titanic meets The Perfect Storm, some might say it's probably not as good as those movies, but it is one of the better ship disaster movies and it being based on a true story gives it more credibility. Overall The Finest Hours is a very good movie, mostly family friendly. It has great action, suspense, and a decent love story. If you are looking for a well paced, entertaining film to enjoy, then this is a good recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb rescue operation. Something this film needed as well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We're sinking."This looked like the movie "Titanic". The iceberg was absent though. But still, the oil tanker was broken in two like a toothpick by the raging sea and went to the bottom of the ocean. There was also a romance. Only this didn't happen aboard of the sinking ship. The final result is a Disney disaster movie, suitable for couples. The female audience can melt away because of the love story. A tribute to invincible love and a prove that infinite love can overcome every pesky obstacle. An example of how kindred spirits can find each other telepathically and use each other as a beacon to be united again. I never expected that such beacons consist of a row of old-timers with their headlights directed to the ocean. The male audience can enjoy the exciting rescue operation initiated by an engineer. His ingenious plan was to run the broken ship aground on a sandbank. Expect some nerve-racking scenes and liters of salt water. The fact that this is a Disney product, means that it also contains a happy ending. Well, most Disney films have one. Those who have expertise in maritime history, will know that this film is about a true incident in 1952. The US Coast Guard successfully conducted one of the most daring rescue operations. Guardian angel on duty is Bernard Webber (Chris "Z for Zachariah" Pine). The way he maneuvers his lifeboat CG36500 over a treacherous sandbar, endangering his own and his crew's life, is beautifully filmed and a thrilling moment. A hallucinatory boat trip over (and under) giant waves, which reminded me of "The Perfect Storm". A successful interpretation by Chris Pine as the colorless, timid little officer who grows out to be a determined and heroic captain. Casey "Out of the furnace" Affleck also played a brilliant part as the introverted Ray Sybert who usually hides in the lower levels of the SS Pendleton and who manages to save the ship temporarily in a resourceful way. A subdued and sober character. Personally, I think this is one of his better performances.Unfortunately a dose of romance was necessary again. And this in the form of telephone operator Miriam (Holliday Grainger). A spry woman with a big mouth. It was as if she was the founder of the feminist movement. She asks her boyfriend to marry her (probably unseen and unacceptable in those days) and briefly wants to have her say in this male bastion ruled by the Coast Guard. She hadn't taken officer Cluff (Eric "Deliver us from Evil" Bana) into account, who threw her out immediately. The only thing Mary could do was to hope and pray (together with the other women) that her future husband would return safe and sound.The most annoying thing during the exciting rescue, were those intermissions where they showed the desperation and fear of the housewives who stayed behind. As a result, the rising tension was constantly interrupted. The only thought I had was "Why don't you just go cook something and wait patiently?". At least I could have enjoyed the action on the halved ship. That and the ridiculous, sentimental ending (they ignored the hero completely) were the reason that I finally thought this movie wasn't so great.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT</fullReview>

Webber (played by Chris pine) (May 9, 1928 ? January 24, 2009) was a United States Coast Guardsman. He was a petty officer assigned to Station Chatham, Massachusetts and part of his duties were that of coxswain of Coast Guard Motor Lifeboat CG 36500. Webber and his crew of three rescued the crew of the stricken tanker SS Pendleton, which had broken in half during a horrific storm on February 18, 1952 off Cape Cod. Webber manoeuvred the 36-foot lifeboat under the Pendleton's stern with expert skill as the tanker's crew, trapped in the stern section, abandoned the wreck of their ship on a Jacobs ladder into the Coast Guard motor lifeboat.It was kind of weird the way Chris pine played this role but knowing this was based on a true story i assume that how Barnard was , which if i can assume must of has slight autism just but the way he was taking &amp; acting its a brilliant performance from Chris pine. Holliday Grainger playing the love interest &amp; future wife of Bernard's Miriam Webber who he married in April 16th 1952 stayed married for 58 years until Bernard death in 2009 at the age 81. Her performance in this film was just outstanding in showing a worried engaged woman worried for her future husband to make it back safe in the most dangerous environment on earth. It without a doubt one of the most intense , heart breaking roller-coast film that like perfect storm , of men trying to survive the most dangerous sea's while trying to keep half a boat afloat until they are rescued. It because a film of will they survive which make this film hearting breaking , intense &amp; very satisfying to watch with good special effect &amp; visual effect to add the scene believable at sea during a storm. Special with almost a full cast of stars your probably recognise like Chris pine, Casey Affleck , Abraham Benrubi ( who actually looks like WWE Kain ) , Keiynan Lonsdale , Josh Stewart ,Graham McTavish , Holliday Grainger , Kyle Gallner , Eric Bana &amp; Ben Foster bring you a spectacular film.If you love perfect storm this is a film i highly recommend , its easily a film to dismiss if you not sure about it but trust me this film is brilliant &amp; worth checking out.Dislikes : There isn't really must to say about anything in the film being unbelievable because stranger things have happened in life, but for half a boat to that smashed in two the front half of the ship sunk taking with it its captain &amp; other crew mange's to stay a float for 5 hours at least before sinking.Now if you were to nick pick at that yes you would see that as just dramatising the film a bit, but accord to the report this actually happened which is nothing short of a miracle if that was true. But apart from that there isn't anything else to say was not believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>70's style disaster movie with better special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the Finest Hours was released in the 70's I think it would have done a lot better at the box office. Unfortunately this type of film can't find the proper audience that it definitely deserves.It's quite a different film from Craig Gillespie, but he does a great job here, especially with the action scenes.All performances are great, especially Pine and Affleck. Some of the smaller roles are a bit less developed, but are still played well by great actors like Eric Bana, Ben Foster &amp; Graham McTavish, who do a lot with what they are given.Unfortanately I had to watch the 3D version, as it was the only showing in the cinema. The 3D added nothing to the overall experience. Luckily the film was good enough to rise above this.One drawback of the film was the love story aspect. I understand why it's included in the film, and I don't have a problem with this part of the story, only that at particular points of the film it would cut back to the girlfriend on the mainland. It ruined the tension in a couple of scenes, but overall the film was still great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>certainly not the Finest movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I was very excited for the movie after seeing the trailer, knowing it was Disney and the cast was great. But then I saw the movie and I was very disappointed. I think mainly because the trailer spoiled a lot of things for me and was somewhat misleading. So do yourself a favor, if you haven't seen the trailer yet, watch the movie without watching the trailer because it might be a better experience.Anyway I want to start saying what I did like about this movie and why it's above average. The movie is about the coastguard saving people in a ship that is torn in half on the sea so whenever they're on the sea, the scenes are great. There is a good build up to the scenes and the look of it is very good. Disney continues to show they can do great live action movies with intense scene.Also the actors act well, for what source material they've been given, the acting is good. Especially Eric Bana and Casey Affleck played their roles very well and I liked seeing them in this movie.Also the movie is based on a true story and I think they showed it well. I didn't know the story behind it but after seeing it, I cared for it more so I think they translated it well.But then we have a list of things I don't like, first off the character development. When the movie starts it tries to give a back story to the main characters but they rush it and I couldn't care too much about them. I honestly believe they could've spent a little more time on setting up the characters so that we could care more about them.Then what I found annoying is that it tries to be funny but it isn't. I know when a movie tries to be funny but when the entire audience in my theater doesn't laugh at all during the entire movie, it's not funny. So I hated that the movie tries to be funny but isn't.But my biggest complaint about the movie is that I was bored a lot during the movie. I think they could've cut about 20-30 minutes out of it and it wouldn't hurt the story or anything. When a movie loses my interest and I actually go to the bathroom because I won't miss a thing, I don't like it. I also found the movie very predictable, everything happening I saw coming before it happened. I guessed the end before the halfway mark which I hated.So that is what I think about the Finest Hours, I didn't like watching it but when I thought about it afterwards it wasn't as bad as I initially thought so that's why I gave it 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to watching this film since the trailer looked amazing and I love these kind of action movies. Unfortunately, Chris Pine spoiled the movie for me during his appearance on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Not everyone knows about nautical accidents so for him to go on the show and say exactly what happens in the film (to the point of saying how many people died, etc) ruined the film for me. I think he needs to be prepped by the film's marketing/pr manager next time he gives an interview...Watching a film where you already know what is going to happen kind of takes the suspense away from it. Thank you, Chris Pine...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aw, goldarn it, shucks honey! From the opening shot this screamed Turkey and I inwardly groaned that a great story of heroism had been pulped into a simpering stew of sentimental Disney cliché. I admit I got as far as the ship scene thinking it could only get better but nope. As the crew all stood together discussing their impending doom in half a sinking ship, in a gale with 15 meter waves, they barely moved. It was almost as if they were on a stage set, which of course they were. At that point I had had enough and left. There is nothing new about the cinema sausage machine cranking out bland rubbish. There is a huge audience of drooling, infantile morons who will lap this kind of drivel up. It also helps to employ and enrich the less gifted of the artistic community. I then found some cocktail sticks to push in my eyes, trying to drive out from my shrieking memory what I had just seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, that's what I call a good film. It may still be January, but The Finest Hours definitely doesn't feel like a film that came out in the midst of Hollywood's dumping ground month. It's directed by Craig Gillespie and stars Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, Holliday Grainger, and Eric Bana. It tells the story of one of the most daring and dangerous U.S. Coast Guard missions in history as Bernie Webber, played by Pine, led a crew aboard a motor boat to save the survivors of the splitting of the SS Pendleton.First off, it's unbelievable that this is even a true story. I constantly thought to myself throughout the film that there's no way they actually get through this alive. It's even more amazing when you see the real life pictures and records of the events in the closing credits. It's also one of those films that makes you enjoy your time away from the storms on water and appreciate every second on land. But besides the remarkable story, I got sucked in with the acting of Pine, Affleck, and Grainger. Grainger plays Pine's love interest back home in Massachusetts and at times the screen time on her can become distracting. Grainger was good in the role, but the time spent on the motor boat and Affleck's crew on the ship was much more intriguing.Another understandable complaint this film has been getting is its noticeable CGI. When you compare it to films like Life of Pi, Interstellar, or even Titanic from 20 years ago, it doesn't even come close to holding its own against those. But with its lower budget and poignant story, I think you can forgive some of its more obviously green screen moments. The film does have plenty of 'true story clichés' used to bring our emotions to the breaking point, but I never felt like they over did it. I was so enthralled with what was happening that when the film does get to its emotional climax, I had to hold back tears. That's a tribute to Gillespie's direction and the incredible score by the newly Oscar nominated, Carter Burwell.+Unbelievable story+Great lead performances+Timely score-Some CGI overstayed its welcome-Some cuts back to Grainger's character weren't necessary7.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the goings get tough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few observations, based on 2 3D viewings, in Dolby Surround 7.1, on digital 3D screens.This movie is done a disservice by its marketing department, since it 'boasts' one of the most by-the-numbers trailers, which, thankfully, I did not let influence me, especially since the flick itself is engaging from beginning to end, and is a throwback to adventure/rescue movies of yore - think 'Das Boot', 'The perfect storm', 'White squall', 'All is lost', et al. It is also one of the recent movies where the 3D augments, and does not distract, or distort, of course, depending on whether the cinema you patronize maintains their projection and glasses in ship-shape or not.The meat of the screenplay revolves the main plot taking 3 paths after its 15 minute point, followed by long, slow, engaging peeks we get into each of those paths from that point on. Gillespie, of 'Lars and the real girl' and 'Fright Night' (remake) fame, brings his deft, sure touch to the proceedings, never allowing a single plot- point or character to take the main stage, but allowing the plot to be the movie's anchor, so to speak. One aspect that was kinda disappointing, as is always for me, is the based-on-a-true-story trope, which ensures that surprises will be at a minimum, except perhaps for those who have no idea with what happened off the port of Charleston (MA) in 1952 with the Pendleton and the MA Coast guard, or seasoned veterans of watching rescue mission movie plots unfold (or for those among us who read spoiler- laden reviews to be sure that we're watching stuff that others in the mainstream have praised). Chris Pine (his career-best?) and Casey Affleck (a really good year, with this one and 'Manchester by the sea' coming out), on (each of) whose shoulders is placed most of the leadership duties, acquit themselves very well, with each of their characters having well- defined arcs that begin at a point where they're treated like underdogs (in 1 case, deservedly so, while in another case, not so much), and quietly (yet surely) rise up to the occasion when called upon to do so. They're ably supported by Ben Foster (still the best thing about most of the movies he's been in - The messenger, Hostage, Lone survivor, Ain't them bodies saints, 3:10 to Yuma - remake, Contraband - remake of Reykjavik|Rotterdam......), Eric Bana (under-used, possibly miscast, but still damn good), Holiday Grainger (with an arc not as well-defined, but, considering the writing, she does a pretty credible job) and the other stock supporting characters, from among whom John Ortiz, as always, stands out. Along with the trailer, one more thing I thought was super-corny was the tag-line I saw on the poster, which said, "We all live, or we all die'. However, in the context of the movie and the situations it covers, though spoiler-y, the adage is apt. A friend of mine had complaints about the sound design throughout, even through the character-making low noise sequences in the beginning, excessive use of miniatures and CGI etc. I do not see eye-eye on most of those, though he is more knowledgeable on some of the set design and situations having to influence sound design, even in which case, I'd be on Gillespie+Team's side for making choices needed to keep the movie stayed cinematic. It's a mainstream outing, after all, and I'm all for those outings that stay away from the Michael Bay school of quick cuts and edits (inspired, of course, by the master of those music video-inspired techniques, the late Tony Scott).Over time, and in hindsight, I also find myself disagreeing with most of the criticisms being leveled against the Holiday Grainger led path/arc, since it stayed true to the contexts set at the beginning of this flick. In conclusion, this is surely one to be viewed on the biggest screen possible, maybe more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Picture the setup of The Perfect Storm. The Finest Hours is dreadfully similar. A clichéd American civilian becomes a hero by defying the odds (and the sea gods). There's two of them too: the not-so-liked sea-man Casey Affleck who's stranded on a ship in Cape Cod with 31 other men, and awkward coastguard Chris Pine is one of four men braving the terrible storm. The main characters are under-developed, so caring for them is challenging. The high seas are crawl, constantly barraging our saviours with terrible waves. When Pine and his crew (which involves an underused Ben Foster) reach the Chatham bar, the tensity rises and the adrenaline starts pumping. But once it's over, you'll be wishing nature would rise up again, and boost the interest levels once again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The finest hours is a good film, but one that could be great. The story is amazing and epic, and it has so much potential, but in the end the film never feels epic or lives up to its potential. It has a great cast, lead by Chris Pine and Casey Affleck, both giving really great performances alongside Holliday Grainger. The production values are great, the score is great, but the film is really dark, there's many parts of the films where you cant really see anything, and this is made much worse by the 3D, which the film never really makes much use of it.There's great possibilities for grand action scenes, but they are just good, and there's never really a sense of suspense. The film feels rather straightforward. Its truly old school and you can almost taste the 50s. It could have been so much more, but it does something so strange that makes something so epic feel rather low key, and it has a few quite emotional scenes for sure, but it never lives up to the true story, nor really makes it justice. But a good film nonetheless, just one that wastes its potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The finest hours starts off as a romantic drama, but slowly transcends into a thrilling rescue story. Though the film is in itself predictable, it has some good acting display, top notch production values, amazing Special effects and music. The film is beautifully old-fashioned and though it offers nothing new, this film deserves at least a 7 for its visual splendor and heart.On Feb. 18, 1952, a massive storm splits the SS Pendleton in two, trapping more than 30 sailors inside the tanker's sinking stern. Engineer Ray Sybert bravely takes charge to organize a strategy for his fellow survivors. As word of the disaster reaches the Coast Guard in Chatham, Mass., Chief Warrant Officer Daniel Cluff orders a daring rescue mission. Despite the ferocious weather, coxswain Bernie Webber takes three men on a lifeboat to try and save the crew against seemingly impossible odds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Really Good Stories and One Mediocre One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a bit of a sucker for inspiring true stories so this is right up my alley. What the coast guard and the people on the tanker were able to do is amazing and really shows off just how resilient humanity can be. The movie has a few problems that keep it from being a really great film but it's still enjoyable enough and the plot is pretty good. Craig Gillespie directed this one and I thought he did a fantastic job with the scenes taking place at sea. Let's get to the story.This film follows three different stories that are happening concurrently. An oil tanker breaks apart and an engineer named Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck) is working to get the tiny bit of ship that he and his men are on to a safe place to wait for a rescue. The Coast Guard sends out a rescue team led by Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) to try and find the ship and help the men that are still alive. While all this is going on, Bernie's fiancé Miriam Webber (Holliday Grainger) is trying to convince Bernie's commanding officer, Daniel Cluff (Eric Bana) to give the order to bring Bernie back home. She also learns more about what it's like to be married to a Coast Guard man.The cast does a pretty good job for the most part but not everyone handles their accents very well. I thought Chris Pine gave a great portrayal as Webber and managed to give us the innocence of the character as well as the quiet determination needed to see everything through to the end. I also really enjoyed Casey Affleck's portrayal of Sybert. He's also a very quiet and determined character but he's more standoffish when compared to the affable Bernie. I thought Grainger also did a decent job but her scenes are some of the most dull in the entire film but that really isn't her fault. The one I had trouble with was Bana's portrayal of Cluff. His accent made me feel like the character was supposed to be a bad caricature but in a movie filled with so many real life people it just felt awkward to me, and this is from someone who ordinarily really likes Bana's work. I enjoyed everyone's portrayals for the most part though.The scenes taking place at sea are easily the best part of the film. It actually comes off as terrifying what the sea can do and these people are just trying to avoid the brunt of it. Human ingenuity allows them to just barely survive but it's nothing but hollow victories until they finally make their way home. The scenes on land are done well enough but they tend to drag a bit compared to the action taking place on the ocean. One second we have people fighting for their very lives and desperately trying to come up with a way to survive for just a few hours more, and then we have poor Miriam hitting a snow bank. Don't get me wrong, hitting a snow bank sucks but, let's be fair, it is nothing like what the Coast Guard and the tanker crew are going through.I feel like this movie is made up of two really compelling and exciting stories and one sort of interesting but kind of boring one. I wouldn't have cut it out entirely or anything like that but they could have probably shortened it up some to focus more on what we actually want to see. Still, I have to admit that I really enjoyed the film for portraying what it did. I just love these true stories about humans overcoming seemingly impossible odds. I would definitely give it a recommendation but remember that some parts can be a little slow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie yesterday and when I decided to look up some information I was shocked to see that this movie was a disaster in theaters and has mixed reviews and not as good rating as I thought. I red a lot of comments, reviews and still don't get it. I waited for this movie in a long time without even knowing it. I never heard of it before yesterday and was skeptical when I found it but after the trailer I said to myself "why not?". I would want to underline the fact that I had 0 info about movie, that includes the part based on true events. If I knew about it I would have had high hopes and never would hesitate to watch it. Usually for me it's the first 10 minutes of the movie that talks to me, I know if the movie is interesting after that time or if I'm going to be bored. Obviously I wasn't disappointing. Once you see this parallel view on the rescue mission, one from the boat where we get to see their side of the story, how they cope with danger, second one how these rescuers decide to go on this suicide mission, you're completely hooked. There is everything, love, courage, honor, cowardness etc. We have heroes that are real, they make us wait in suspense because you know this is just an average man trying to survive or just do his job. I couldn't stop watching, Casey Affleck nailed his role and I fell in love with his character, he is not just a crew member, he is a hero on the background of others. But he doesn't even knows it, he just wants to live, like everybody, the difference is his coolness and patience. I also liked Webber but I had the feeling that he was miscast, Chris was not looking as a humble and average rescuer. The fact that we get 2 heroes in one movie that are so different but still similar gives this movie originality. This is not just a rescue mission, this is about the crew that does everything in their power to survive. I felt like I saw 2 movies in one. One about how the rescue mission was done and other how the crew managed to survive. The only minus that I saw in the movie, it was something that was out of the place. Miriam. I understand that more and more directors want a female character that is somehow daring for her time but it was really unnecessary for this film. I am a feminist and I love a movie with good female character but she was out of her place. And I'm not talking about her proposal or daring look or they way she speaks but the fact that she is given the honor to rescue the rescuers. I mean why would she be the one who does it? It's clear that places like that have lighthouses and it's impossible to have 0 light, complete dark in these situations, why would she had to be the one that gives the light? It kind of seems that the director pushes her in our throats and it's a little annoying. She takes the crown from the heads of those who actually did something. And considering that in the real story she sleeps through the whole thing I would say that the director made a mistake by making a character out of nowhere for no apparent reason but to satisfy the modern society that look for bad ass women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Finest Hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt: the true event portrayed in The Finest Hours is one of the most amazing samples of courage, skill and heroism in high seas; an authentic triumph of the human spirit. That's why I don't think the excessive and unnecessary emotional manipulation added by co-screenwriters Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson, taking it to almost cloying extremes, was necessary. Seriously, there was no need for such many ornaments and sentimental digressions to make the true story more captivating. The simple truth would have been enough. Why employing cheap soap-opera tricks? Oh, sure... The Finest Hours was produced by Disney. To be honest, I liked various live-action films produced by Disney very much (such as The Parent Trap -1998-, Tron and Sky High), and they didn't include this emotional manipulation. However, I think I know the reason for having made that decision: the technical details of The Finest Hours are quite complicated, and I frequently felt the need of a diagram or detailed explanation about the actions taken by the crew of both ships in order to increment their hopes of survival. Yes, the premise is quite simple: a ship is sinking, and another ship must rescue it before it's too late. But many minutes of The Finest Hours are invested on the repairs of the tanker split in two, and the difficult sailing of waters full of obstacles which would be dangerous even with a good weather. So, in order to distract those of us who don't know such many sea terms, Silver, Tamasy and Johnson employ very elementary narrative decoys: Bernie's fiancée suffering on land while her boyfriend risks his life to save strangers; the conflicts in a small town where rancours last for a long time; and a painful past which needs atonement to redeem the main character. I understand the function of those clichés, but I didn't find them less cumbersome and artificial because of that. On the other side of the coin, we have the solid performances from the whole cast. Chris Pine feels credible as the hero, while Casey Affleck brings deepness and genuine marine "salt" to his character and Eric Bana also makes a good work as the strict superior officer of the Coast Guard. Holliday Grainger brings a decent performance as Bernie's fiancée... even though she was given the lachrymose part. I have to mention the fact that my previously mentioned complaints only apply to the first half of The Finest Hours. The second half, when things get complicated, earns strength, and the film becomes an intense experience with agile edition and brilliant special effects which perfectly combine practical and digital techniques. So, despite my complaints, the general balance of The Finest Hours falls on the positive side, and I can give it a moderate recommendation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yesterday myself,my mom and my younger brother all went to see The Finest Hours yesterday. Surprisingly there was no one in the cinema only us 3 so that made it even more great. The film is based on a true story about a ship that got stranded in a stormy night and its up to Bernie(played by Chris Pine)to save the 32 oil tankers who are lost at sea on a ship. The story of course opens with Bernie(Pine) meeting his love(played by Holiday Granger from the 2015 Disney movie Cinderella)and Bernie works for a man called Daniel Gluff played by Eric Bana(the original Hulk) and he discovers that his friend played by Casey Affleck is stranded on a ship along with his working buddies. So Bernie and his co brace the stormy weather to save his friend and his working buddies. Now I know what you are thinking, haven't we all seen this film before,and your right you did see this film before as the film reminded me an awful lot like Titanic. As we see the boat sinking and I said to myself this film is sorta ripping off the Titanic even though this film The Finest Hours is set in 1952 America not 1916 in Liverpool where the Titanic first left.The effects in this film were brilliant as I loved seeing the special effects on the ship as like in Titanic it was so real looking. The rest of the actors were very good and for a Disney movie it didn't feel like a Disney movie at all it felt more like a 20th Century Fox film.But having said that I really enjoyed this film and I was glad to have seen it,as a friend of mine recommended me to see it. My rating out of 107/10Out of 5 I would say 4/5.</fullReview>

I just don't get it why the American people will rather watch Deadpool than this movie or rated it higher? DP is garbage, this film is a gem. I have watched DP too. Anyway if you thinking of watching this film. Please do and bring your children along. Its good to show them what the old good American people used to be. About heroism, bravery, selflessness, leadership and faith. All this are the essence of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie. Bring your life jacket.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie. Tense story, excellent acting, lots of action and an upbeat theme. The movie keeps the audience engaged and entertains. Now one might write off this movie as being just the latest addition to the natural disaster movie genre but that would be only partially correct. There is little in the story that is contrived. That is, the story has plausibility. It does not seem to be stretching literary license (though some is taken). The heroics are not overblown. Actually, what is depicted is amazing and admirable. Coast Guardsmen conduct a rescue operation in almost impossibly abysmal conditions. Yet it happened. You can look it up. The movie does raise a question: why was the US Coast Guard so undermanned and poorly equipped? This movie gives cause to compare it to the blockbuster Titanic (1997). It compares favorably. Chris Pine and Casey Affleck are excellent as the two principal characters who are most responsible for saving a lot of lives. This movie is worth watching. Just make sure that you're wearing a life jacket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am really not sure what movie the people were watching that wrote negative reviews on here. Boring? Not a chance, Slow? Not a chance, Wooden acting? No way, Disaster with Disney heroes? maybe, exciting? Yes, Heartwarming story? Yes, Well made? Yes. I don't really understand why some people watch movies, because there was absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. It had believable characters, a very good story and great special effects and in my opinion if you did not like it, you really have no business watching movies, because nothing will please you. I hope the few negative reviews don't keep people from watching and enjoying this great American heroes story. Watch and enjoy. And, be proud you are an American.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad for a January Release</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Finest Hours is one of those unfortunate titles that is forgotten as soon as you hear it. Whenever someone asked me what I was going to watch, all I could say was it was the Coast Guard movie. This is no reflection on the story but more a reflection on Disney's quixotic handling of this mid-January release. Movie after movie this year and last featured a trailer of The Finest Hours. Casey Affleck heroically keeps half a ship afloat while Chris Pine utters the manta "Coast Guard says you gotta go out, they don't tell you you gotta come back" in a thick Bostonian brogue.Chris Pine plays Bernie Webber, a Coast Guard crewman who defines his decisions on the rule book as if it were a crutch. He even insists that before he marry his sweetheart Miriam (Grainger), he ask his superior officer as per Coast Guard regulation (though really just a formality). As a large winter storm approaches his corner of Cape Cod, not one but two oil tankers miles off the coast are split in half by the waves. The SS Mercer was able to send out a distress call and tie up Coast Guard resources while the SS Pendleton remained nearly invisible save a radar blip. Ship Engineer of the Pendleton Ray Sybert (Affleck) makes a desperate gambit to save the crew by constructing a rudder and running the aft of the ship on a shoal to slow them from sinking just long enough to get noticed and rescued.The concept for a movie of this kind would sound ridiculous if it weren't true. In 1952, two tankers were indeed split in half and after the main crew left Chatham Station for one, a second crew was alerted to the Pendleton and braved the dangerous coastal banks to reach them in a tiny CG36500 lifeboat. The script based on a novel by Casey Sherman and Michael J. Tougias is so old-fashioned, it immediately brings to mind the sea adventures in Captain Horatio Hornblower R.N. (1951) or Sea Wife (1957). What sets The Finest Hours apart are the modernized special-effects and Craig Gillispie's dynamic direction.The Finest Hours is far from perfect. The movie takes it's time to develop the relationship between Webber and heartthrob Miriam who does very little but delve into histrionics. It's a shame too because Grainger is an absolute vision who typifies the 1950's model of beauty and womanhood. Every scene she was in was certainly distracting from the story but for once I didn't much care. There's also something clearly wrong with the station's Commander Daniel Cluff (Bana). It's never clear how the audience should feel; is he closer to the vein of Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny (1954) or is he just an outsider trying to do his best given the situation? Also there's Disney's insistence that 3D is the way to go; yeah not so much. This is a movie whose main set-piece is a nocturnal nautical rescue thus wearing 3D glasses makes everything too dark to appreciate.The scenes involving the Coast Guard lifeboat trudging through open ocean are the most riveting, barely surpassing the Pendleton's attempts to run aground via game of telephone. Throughout the movie people spout a torrent of nautical terms which appeared to go over the heads of audience members, yet what was clear were the stakes and the results of such a daring rescue. People will no doubt compare this film with The Perfect Storm (2000) which apart from it also taking place in the Northeastern United States, only makes sense as far as critical reaction.I for one enjoyed this film, which is competently made, has some show-stopping, hair-raising scenes of seafaring mayhem and had some great low-key performances by Pine, Affleck and Grainger. Disney definitely crippled this film by giving it an instantly forgettable title and shoving 3D and IMAX 3D in our faces. It's a real shame too because the added disadvantage of having a January release and lukewarm reviews by critics all but guarantees this story will ever get the audience it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was pretty bored, nice ending though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found it hard to connect to the characters on any kind of emotional level. This made the overall experience pretty boring because I just couldn't get into this movie. It didn't grab me. There were moments toward the end that started to grab me and the ending was sweet. I just feel it could have been done in a much more powerful way. In all fairness I was a little late getting to the movie theater so I missed the first bits, so maybe I missed some of the initial character building and bonding, which may have engaged me more. I also got basically strip searched by the theater when entering the film so I was a little annoyed and on edge about that. So maybe it wasn't as bad as I thought it was. Who knows. I know its a true story, so I probably shouldn't judge it by the plot. The action sequences in the waves were certainly riveting, although not very believable. It felt a little disjointed the way they told the two stories simultaneously. I suspect this movie would be received best by military or marine-going families.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on a true story in all its terrifying detail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Finest Hours is a Walt Disney film that is filled with much determination that captivates your mind on a realistic approach of being in the ocean on a boat wondering if you will survive. This moved me because you have to be a thinker, organizer and strategist in order to achieve the obstacles that you will be encountering. I really loved this movie because it is in 3D which makes everything appear to be coming right at you and you feel like you are a part of the film, especially during the ocean scenes. This film is based on a true story and it is filled with action, drama and history. The director, Craig Gillespie draws you into this film by his realistic portrayal of events. One of the worst storms to ever hit the East Coast struck New England in February 1952. It damaged an oil tanker off the coast of Cape Cod and literally ripped it in half. On a small lifeboat faced with frigid temperatures and 70-foot high waves, four members, Bernie Weber (Chris Pine), Ben Foster (Richard Livesey), Andy Fitzgerald (Kyle Gallner) and Ervin Maske (John Magaro) of the Coast Guard set out to rescue the more than 30 stranded sailors trapped aboard the rapidly-sinking vessel. The captain gives the orders and sends them out to accomplish the goal.My favorite part of this movie is when Bernie Weber and his fellow crew members set out to find the people on the sinking ship. They lose connection with the captain and also lose their compass. The crew members want Bernie to turn back around, but he says, "no point". Bernie just keeps on going to see if he can find any type of vessel. He becomes obstinate and passionate about his Coast Guard duty.The setting is a 1950s snowy and cold day with distinguished vintage cars the town people drive. The women's dress is classy and stylish and they definitely make a statement upon arrival to any event. I recommend this film for ages 12 to 18 and I give it 5 out of 5 Stars because it is action-packed with some romance and tense moments. Younger audiences may not understand and might be scared.

		<shortDescription>Great Motion Picture with Hilarious Regional Accents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a New Englander I'm probably more sensitive to regional accents than others, but this movie had me rolling in the aisles laughing. It seems like only one quarter of the cast got their accents right and the rest of them fumbled through, sounding like a mix between Valley Girl and Goodfellas. It's too bad, because I really enjoyed the movie. It has everything an action movie should have: sappy love interest, tension, drama, and enormous scary stuff. But the spoken lines put this production on a whole new level of disaster movie.I think they gave up on letting the Australian actor Eric Bana try to emulate a Down East dialect and switched him over to a southern accent, with amazingly dismal results. When he's not drawling the wrong word endings, he's reverting back to an Aussie outback bush bogan or something. I guess it all has to do with how an actor is able to interpret a character, but his performance is positively schizophrenic.What is especially disconcerting is when an actor or actress nails the accent right on, as Rachel Brosnahan does in her role of Bea Hansen. It becomes quite obvious which members of the cast spent some time learning to pronounce their lines and which of them decided to mumble their way through the parts they couldn't get right. This is a perfect example of the current derailed Hollywood machine; over budget, zero schedule and maximum apathy. It's too bad because this is a great motion picture, best viewed with subtitles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to give this film 10/10. When I first saw the previews I thought it was another "perfect storm" film or a remake and I didn't have much back story or even knew that the movie was based on real life. My friend asked me to go see it and I did without any expectation at all. I was completely blown away! I'm a sucker for films that base man against nature and defying the odds. This film achieved all of that. There wasn't a subplot in this film that didn't tie in with the ending and serve a purpose to the main theme. The acting by Chris Pine and Casey Affleck, as well as the other actors, was convincing. I felt the emotions they were trying to depict. The action scenes and CGI did not disappoint either they had me gripping the edge of my seat - very convincing. I was holding my breath a lot in this film. It still blows my mind that this was a true story. It's an incredible depiction of human grit, man vs nature, faith and going above and beyond the call of duty. If you like these types of films then this is definitely one for you. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great depiction of the era and New England Coast Guard outposts provide foundation for harrowing rescue saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie does a magnificent job of setting the table for itself. It took me back to the early 1950's in New England without so much as an echo of a false note. The dances, the cars, the attitudes, and the not-so-esprit-de-corps-except-when-it really-counts attitude among the Guard members at the outpost are all presented with remarkable accuracy. It was just like stepping into a time capsule.I don't understand some people's criticism of the acting as wooden. I found it anything but. Casey Affleck (Gone Baby Gone) is a fantastic dramatic actor who is stereotyped too much from his Oceans movie roles. Here, he steels the movie from Pine, Foster, and the rest. Not that Pine and Foster were bad - they were pitch perfect as the determined and focused rescuers with lives of their own. As the Commander, Eric Bana gave the film's most thankless role everything he could.I thought Holliday Grainger was a revelation as the spunky and unconventional Miriam. The subplot with her pushiness and combativeness was well told and did an excellent job of providing context.As for the action, it was magnificent with the saga well told both in magnitude of the task, dissension on the big boat, human courage and weakness in the face of death, and of course, the rescue itself. I did go to the 3D version and the effects and motion of the waves made that well worth it for me. It is a great film for the entire family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little development on characters, but it's definitely one tense ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picture the setup of The Perfect Storm. The Finest Hours is dreadfully similar. A clichéd American civilian becomes a hero by defying the odds (and the sea gods). There's two of them too: the not-so-liked sea-man Casey Affleck who's stranded on a ship in Cape Cod with 31 other men, and awkward coastguard Chris Pine is one of four men braving the terrible storm. The main characters are under-developed, so caring for them is challenging. The high seas are crawl, constantly barraging our saviours with terrible waves. When Pine and his crew (which involves an underused Ben Foster) reach the Chatham bar, the tensity rises and the adrenaline starts pumping. But once it's over, you'll be wishing nature would rise up again, and boost the interest levels once again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story reflecting the quiet dignity of real people facing challenging situations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw The Finest Hours for the third time in a week and I loved it even more the third time around. There are three stories inter-mixed; the townspeople, the tanker crew and the rescue team. In all three stories regular people faced challenges and ultimately tried to do what was right; people growing emotionally while we witnessed their trials. I do want to stress that in each story people came together after debating what to do and pulled together as a team. That is an inspiring message for today's world. We can have our differences but if we want to succeed we have to at some point make a decision as a team and take action. Look how well it turned out for all concerned in this very fine film.The music and sound effects were amazing. I really felt the roller coaster ride across the waves and the strength it took for those aboard the tanker to survive and the rescue crew to get over that bar.Chris Pine is more than a leading man; he is also a wonderful character actor. This was his most appealing role; he was both vulnerable and shy and I could read his every emotion in those astonishing blue eyes. He has the ability to completely morph into his roles.Chris is mesmerizing to watch but a lot of his roles are not particularly likable men and I've seen all of his movies.Eric Bana did seem miscast in his role.I just wish there was some back story on the girlfriend so we know why she was drawn to Bernie. The biggest mystery is why she wasn't at all cold without her coat during a February blizzard. I thought this story held up very well. The actors behaved how real people would in such trying circumstances (no super heroes or macho personalities). I found the rescue operation very exciting. I will see it again at my local movie house and will definitely buy it when it comes out on DVD.P.S.: I saw it in 2D all three times and am glad I did. I think 3D is often a distraction - paying more attention to the visuals than the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I developed Thalassophobia in seeing this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes some time before the film plunges to action as it gets out of the way the film's romance first. Chris Pine downplays his on- screen charisma and jumps from spaceship captain to "space"-less ship captain (get it?) in playing the role of Bernie Webber, an introverted coast-guard officer. It is 1952 and Bernie is about to go on a first date with Miriam (Holiday Grainger). Flash-forward a couple of months, and Miriam asks Bernie to marry her (yes, not the other way around). Bernie, having known her for basically less than a year, initially says no but as she walks-out of the room and cries, Bernie follows her and takes back his answer (tears, indeed, are a woman's weapon). Their engagement gets postponed when chief warrant officer Daniel Cluff (Eric Bana) sends Bernie to a suicide mission to rescue a crew from an oil tanker ship, the S.S. Pendleton, that's split in half during the winter storm. O.K., hold up, a ship split into half, one part sinks and the other stays afloat?how insane is that? The events that occur this film seem improbable that I myself have journeyed to research; however it turns out, most of these events, including this one, really happened.From this point, the film is forked into three story-lines which happen concurrently: Bernie's rescue mission with his volunteer crew; the events happening back in the mainland; and the struggle of the men inside the oil tanker ship led by engineer Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck). Bernie's arc holds the message of the film?valor and humanity inevitably comes through at the most improbable odds. "In the coast guard they say you go out, they don't say you gotta come back," Bernie says before they trudge on to the raging sea and get tossed by its gigantic waves. In these intense moments of distress, Chris Pine delivers an admirable performance as the underdog rising to the occasion.This old-fashioned rescue story is sure to be taken back to films such as Titanic (1997), The Perfect Storm (2000), or The Guardian (2006). Viewers will whine from the onset: "I have already seen this film years ago", and they will be right. The Finest Hours certainly isn't the "finest". This film is quite the outlandish choice for Disney's usually colorful productions. In closer inspection, you understand just why: it sends a powerful and uplifting message about resilience, leadership and faith?characteristics that the outfit so admirably adamantly promotes.Full review here: http://goo.gl/ilmQ8i</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Craig Gillespie did his best. The story line is gripping and makes you feel the danger and emotional turmoil each character is going through, very intricately. The film starts on a very romantic, slow pace and gains momentum as the entire East coast is hit by a snow storm. What stays in your head is everything you are watching on screen - a true account of the 1952 United States Coast Guard rescue of the SS Pendleton, after it split apart during a nor'easter off the New England coast.Leaving the few stretched on ground moments, the entire film is a nature versus man thriller, where courage wins over all odds. Go for this one if you loved the 'The Perfect Storm' and 'Titanic' etc, this one will take you back on that dreaded journey to the sea. As Miriam puts it in the film, "It's not the water that scares me but what lies beneath it."My Rating for this great movie is 4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Imperfect Storm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cargo ship splits in two during a fierce North Atlantic storm, and the surviving crew clings to hope aboard the floating half, while a small Coast Guard boat sails from Cape Cod on a rescue mission. Based on a true event that took place in the early 1950's, "The Finest Hours" is at its best when the focus is at sea. However, viewers may initially think they wandered into the wrong theater; the first twenty minutes detail a sappy cute guy meets cute girl for a date; cute girl asks cute guy to marry her; cute girl frets about cute guy in danger. The shallow unconvincing scenes on dry land are set in a faux-1950's and should have been left on the cutting room floor, because this lame date-film wannabe makes "The Perfect Storm" look like a masterpiece.Chris Pine as the young rescuer, Bernie Webber, finds that navigating a small boat in a storm takes more skill and daring than piloting the Starship Enterprise. However, Pine's performance at sea is far more convincing than his underplayed romantic acting opposite Holliday Grainger, who plays his girlfriend. Grainger plays Miriam, the stereotypical 1950's woman; always immaculately made-up and coiffed in designer dresses, even during raging snow storms. Neither rain, nor snow, nor blistering wind can muss her well permed 'doo nor mar her porcelain make-up. The Miriam character is annoying throughout, and her repeated order to the Coast Guard commander, played by Eric Bana, to call back her boyfriend from danger sounds like the whine of a spoiled petulant teeny-bopper. Led by Casey Affleck, the crew aboard the sinking ship fare better than Pine and Grainger, although some appear too casual in the face of mortal danger.The scenes of the storm and the tossing cargo ship are often exciting as are those that depict the tiny rescue boat facing 70-foot waves. In contrast, the snow storm ashore looks more like a Norman Rockwell Christmas card than a threat. Perhaps "The Finest Hours" needed an experienced action director, a writer who could pen some decent dialog, and an editor to excise extraneous romantic scenes that add nothing to the action. The ingredients for a thrilling true-life rescue film were there, but some genius decided the studio needed a feel-good date film. "The Finest Hours" should find its audience on DVD, where viewers can fast forward through the romantic drivel and enjoy the exciting sea rescue.</fullReview>

Though this True Story takes place in 1951-1952, Disney makes clear that it is targeting the 21st Century chick with "Miriam," by having HER propose to the tale's hero. According to THE FINEST HOURS, women think with their Hearts--NOT their Heads. Disney proves that if it were up to Miriam, the 32 survivors of the oil tanker Pendleton all would have drowned. If THE FINEST HOURS bunch had made GONE WITH THE WIND, that yawner would have been 2 1/2 hours shorter, because Mrs. Lincoln would have commanded Abe NOT to contest the Rebels or their Lazy Plantation "Colonels'" Racist Black Slavery System. (Of course, Mrs. Smith would be too busy picking cotton nowadays to raise any Oscar ruckus, had women like Abe's Mary Todd and THE FINEST HOURS' Miriam been able to successfully influence their men.) With its FINEST HOURS, Disney is telling America NOT to be hasty in electing a Woman President.

OK, I admit that during the last huge wave, one of them loses his hat...But only because the director Gillepsie did not want to make other takes without the hats, concerning the previous waves scenes...

		<shortDescription>A Fine Movie, but Not Unique Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Finest Hours, yet another heroic tale about individuals who defy the limits of nature to pull off miracles. Disney certainly enjoys capitalizing on these tales in the early seasons don't they? Chis Pine leads the cast in this story about a small band of coast guards ordered to brave a massive storm to rescue a crew onboard a capsizing tanker. Can this inspirational drama stand out from the sea of other similar tales, or has Disney just pumped out another feat of mediocrity in an effort to obtain money? Let's analyze shall we?When it comes to a drama like this an engaging tale is required as the backbone of the movie. Fortunately the Finest Hours manages to accomplish this by taking a straightforward plot and presenting it in fantastic way. The film follows the whole incident from three different perspectives that intertwine across the full two hours. This dynamic approach gave you the full picture and continued to spice things up as they illustrated the dangers faced on all fronts. As such, there is sure to be some part of the tale that audiences will enjoy that will bait your attention in this straightforward tale. Unfortunately, the tale is very predictable and lacked suspense for me, especially knowing the outcome thanks to the trailers with only the ambiguity of who would survive the ordeal. At least the love component is not to mushy to become cheesy and annoying so that's an added benefit. Let's jump to the acting now. Chris Pine grabs the part by the horns and takes it full throttle. His portrayal of Bernie Webber was a nice balance between bravery and hesitation as he tackles the challenges before him. While his accent is funny to hear at first, it eventually grows on you and adds some endearment to the character. Holliday Grainger's portrayal of Miriam was okay, a nice portrayal of a strong, brave woman whose verbal and non-verbal acting brought the courageous nature of this woman to life. However, the trailers made her out to be more involved with the process and I was disappointed with her limited interactions in the film. But best actor in this film goes to Casey Affleck, who played the deepest role of the bunch as the chief engineer. The emotions to which he had to balance were challenging, but I feel Affleck kept the character grounded and realistic on all fronts, thereby making his feats all the more impressive. All the other actors hit their mark well, but there are too many to cast in such a short amount of space. Perhaps the strongest quality of the movie though is the cinematic magic and special effects that brought the true suspense. The Finest Hours' computer animation is on point, with the deadly snow storm brought to life with high-definition details and incredible sound editing. I was brought into the storm, feeling the misery and despair the foreboding nor'easter brought to our sailors as the fury of the sea was unleashed. In the belly of the tanker, the chaos of sinking ship was brilliantly recreated that didn't involve the over use of pyrotechnics and explosions (take a hint Michael Bay). Special effects aside the cinematography was a key aspect in bringing the emotions to the scenes. Our cast of characters do a nice job delivering their lines, but it's the nonverbal acting that really delivers the punch. The camera-work is stable through and through (again pay attention Bay) and captures all the detail despite the aggressive winds and waves. And the symphony soundtrack only adds an extra kick to subtly make the scenes complete. The Finest Hours is certainly not the most original, or unique movie from Disney's collective vault. However, while it is not the most entertaining tale, it does highlight the important qualities of faith, duty, honor, and a slew of other morals that people harp on. The visual effects of this studio are certainly the highlight of this movie, which may be further enhanced by a 3-D showing. Overall, I'm satisfied with the work Disney studios did and feel this a movie most will enjoy. My recommendations for audience members who will like it are: older generations from that time period, fans of inspirational tales, and those who appreciate good cinema magic. I also believe this movie is worth a trip to the theater, thanks to the cinematic qualities. My scores overall: Action/Drama/History: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coast Guard rescue against what appear to be improbable odds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of this film was a little slow and I wondered if I had inadvertently walked into the wrong theater. Character development and the formation of relationships was obvious during the first 20 minutes; however, in my opinion, less time should have been devoted to the romancing and more to the backgrounds of the three other coast guard crewmen and the main characters who were rescued. In the second portion of this film Director Craig Gillespie demonstrates a talented affinity for placing the audience right in the vessel as it gets slammed by monster waves. Indeed, I was a bit dizzy by the time the end approached! In that sense, the feeling in the pit of one's stomach rivals and at time exceeds the sensations of reality experienced in such films as "In The Heart of The Sea" and "Perfect Storm." The contrast of the rescue scenes with the early part of the movie is sort of like two different movies that were spliced together, with the first part being rated a 6 and the second part a 10 for an overall score of 8. In any event, most people will be pleased that they went to see this movie and even be encouraged to face and to conquer the adverse ocean of monster waves in their own personal lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a great movie - did not expect that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know what... some people will never give a movie with some cheesy romance a 10, but today I do, as the romance just helped support the main story, a true story been told to us in a remarkable way. I normally don't enjoy movies set in the olden days like the 50's etc, but this movie must have caught me on a good day. The lead acting was so good it really made me feel like these people were from another time, definitely not a time I know of personally.I even think the special effects were spot on. I mean, chaos is chaos, so people who want to see amazing special effects, but want the realism of a storm, are just been ridiculous. Some times in this movie you actual don't know what's going on, only making you feel the fear and frustration experienced by the crew you are watching. So that's it, my first ever review on IMDb. I have not enjoyed a movie this much since I watched Pearl Harbour... good old Disney fun with the family - the kids can join by the way - they totally enjoyed it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful awe inspiring story based on a true event. Casey Affleck is wonderful as the ingenious engineer and Chris Pine is fantastic as the silent expert coast guard. Heart warming and earthy if a bit exaggerated (it is Disney after all) when tugging at your heart strings.2 hours passed really quickly and even though I knew what the result was going to be I felt engrossed with it.Well done a great watch, fabulous photography and scenery. Add to that good acting and production.An excellent watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Finest Hours is a fun action thriller with a romantic core!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's Coast Guard rescue thriller kept the pacing accelerated through the first part but suffered from a slow ending. The Finest Hours was divided up into several stories that intertwined between rescuers, lovers and the sailors at risk. The beginning focused on the love story between Bernie Webber played by Chris Pine and Miriam Webber played by Holliday Grainger. They met after talking on the phone for a while so there was some interesting chemistry, and director Craig Gillesphie did a good job quickly establishing their romance. The plot rapidly moves to the storm that threatened the crew of the T-2 tanker with Casey Affleck's Ray Sybert taking the lead. The whole crew was staffed with good actors like John Ortiz, Graham McTavish, and Josh Stewart. The acting was pretty superb throughout this movie. Eric Bana was the Coast Guard chief and brought some depth with a Souther accent. Rachel Brosnahan who had a great role in House of Cards also pops up near the end. Ben Foster was part of the crew and he delivers a good performance as usual.Check out more of this review and other at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but next time hold the cheese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the winter of 1952, the SS Pendleton oil tanker found itself disabled and sinking during a severe nor'easter blizzard. A single vessel was able to save dozens of crew-members in what is still the Coast Guard's single greatest small boat rescue to date. This is their story.Chris Pine plays Bernie Webber, a by-the-book Coast Guard captain with a need to prove himself, especially to some locals who blame him for a failed rescue a year earlier. But the real star of the film is Casey Affleck, the engineer of the Pendleton, who is forced to take command and engages in more and more audacious and creative methods to keep his crew alive long enough to be rescued.The film suffers from some unevenness, mostly from trying to tell two simultaneous stories, and also trying to shoehorn in some added drama via a romantic relationship between Pine and Holliday Grainger, which leads to incredibly flat and disappointing denouement in the final ten minutes. Excuse me, garçon, I did not order this film with extra cheese.There's a somewhat deflated sense of stakes as well, as we know from the title and premise that the rescue attempt is ultimately successful. But it's the journey, not the destination. The film also slyly continues to tell you how impossible the odds are, helping to increase the suspense as you wonder exactly how they're going to make this rescue happen. But when the film is on, it is on. As mentioned before, it all grinds to a screeching halt with an incredibly overwrought and cheesy ending. The human drama and true story was enough to keep the audience engaged. It needn't have been so trite and predictable.But overall, this a feel-good film from the people who know feel- good: Disney. And this is about the mildest PG-13 you've seen in a long while. For a movie about sailors, these boys all have squeaky- clean mouths.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible Heroic True Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Finest Hours", starring Chris Pine-Kirk in the new Star Trek movies, Unstoppable; Casey Affleck-Interstellar, the American Pie movies, and yes, he is Ben's brother; Holliday Grainger-Cinderella_2015, The Borgias_tv and Eric Bana-Star Trek_2009, Hulk_2003.This is based on a true story about the U.S. Coast Guard's most daring rescue mission. It happened in 1952, off the coast of New England and Cape Cod, where 2 oil tankers-in close but separate locations-split in half due to the violent stormy weather. Chris is a by the book Coast Guard seaman that has just gotten engaged to his rather brassy-for that period of time anyway-girlfriend, Holliday. She is the one who proposed to him. Eric is the commander in chief at the Coast Guard station that Chris is stationed and sends Chris and 3 other volunteers out on a 12 man boat to rescue the survivors of one of the ships. Casey is the chief engineer on the boat that Chris is headed for and Casey is doing his best to keep the ship from sinking-it is split in half, remember? Everyone thinks Chris is on a suicide mission, what with being in such a small boat in such bad weather. And even if Chris makes it to the rapidly sinking ship in time, how can he rescue 32 men on his boat that is built for 12, including him and his 3 fellow rescuers? It is an interesting and thrilling story, especially since it is true. I enjoyed it. It's rated "PG-13" for sequences of peril and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 57 minutes. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be a great rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw it. I think many will enjoy this movie definitely worth the price. I will buy it on DVD as well. I usually don't write reviews, but had to as this was a nice story. How can you not enjoy what our men and women's sacrifice for our country trying to help mankind. Some movie critics must be nuts! Loved the story and the adventure scenes. I actually served in the USCG and was in something similar. Brought back a lot of memories. Anyone who doesn't like this film must be unpatriotic and not into saving lives. You will enjoy this movie as the Coast Guard is always helping our people everyday. I was surprised this was a Disney film, but they did a great job. The acting was good as the actors were not top stars, but did a good job reenacting the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow to start, but grows into a great action-disaster flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie approaches perfection in disaster films. The acting was superb, the special effects amazing and the story unbelievable - but true. My heart was in my throat - and I already knew the whole story from earlier research of the true-life incident - who lives and who dies. They actually skipped some elements of the day's work for the Coast Guard, probably because no one would believe it.The only weakness I saw with the movie was that it was a bit slow in the start, too much romance in the beginning and not enough exploration of our four Coast Guard heroes. We only really meet and get to know Webber (Chris Pine), and it spends too much time exploring his romance. The movie makers attempted to shove some strong female characters into the story - beyond a brief introduction to establish Webber's motivations and history, they really didn't belong in the story.But in the end it was worth it because the scenes of the crippled, broken SS Pendleton are edge-of-your seat stuff, and once Webber and his crew get in their little 36-foot motor lifeboat and head out into 60-foot seas, you're in for the ride of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Outstanding Film Combining Action with Human Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for a contemporary action movie with car chases, gun fights, and super heroes; this is not the film for you. Instead, it takes on the challenging task of capturing real-life people who do extraordinary tasks because they come with their job. Reality is always more powerful than fiction when it is captured with care, but we are not used to seeing this and unfortunately this film has therefore not met all reviewer's expectations. In part, this is a sad commentary on our times.The Finest Hours is about real people whose strength and courage come through but with honesty and subtlety. The film has a powerful love interest, but is nevertheless primarily about men ... unlikely heroes who rise to unimaginable challenges and subsequently return to worlds we can see in our neighbors. Visually it is a dramatic and technical masterpiece. Its original score is powerful but works with the unfolding events. There are no (as yet) big-name stars, but instead an ensemble cast that captures real lives and normal people. In short, it is a courageous movie about real people who despite their strengths and limitations do what must be done and emerge wiser and stronger for their accomplishment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating and Intense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found enough that was fascinating in it, both in the characters and the action - each scene gave my imagination time enough to roam and wonder. There were certainly gripping moments, both with the action and the emotional, and even the sweet romantic clichés worked as intended. Characters: They were period-fascinating, offering enough variety to engage one's wonder, and they were quite believable in character - I was taken back to those times in several ways. Action: Bring a winter coat - just watching the cold and frozen scenes will chill you to the bone. Story Line: They took a few liberties in order to place more focus on the main characters - I did not notice, but those who had read up on the story did, and it will be those people who will drag you to go see it. I don't regret going - it is the kind of movie that will define a region, time, and people for you (that you probably will never visit) for the rest of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IMAX 3D was made for "The Finest Hours" -- Excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMAX 3D was made for "The Finest Hours." The technology is fully exploited and realized as it takes you in to the immediacy of the fact-based story. I didn't expect much. So many films made for 3D and/or IMAX are strong on FX and weak on story. At my age, story is paramount, and if the FX can be enlisted to that end, we could get a good film. "The Finest Hours" is an excellent film.So many of the films for IMAX 3D are fantasies which probably would have engaged me in my younger days, but as I've aged I have increasingly related more to "true" or "real" stories like "The Finest Hours." I'll also mention that it was a relief to everyone in our party to not be subjected to a barrage of what is euphemistically called "language." That has become the movie norm in an effort to dial up realism or tension or whatever. None of the people in my life ever talk that way and "The Finest Hours" demonstrates that realism and tension are both well off without it.IMHO, "The Finest Hours" was excellently cast and excellently performed. The two male leads both give subtly nuanced performances as just plain guys trying to do their jobs and not seeking recognition or leadership positions, who find themselves in situations forcing them to take charge, and portraying their gradual personal progression as they have "greatness thrust upon them." In IMAX 3D, the effects are jaw-dropping. One review, an outlier, complains that the price of 3D is reduced brightness. I thought it was worth every penny. Another review complains that the film lacks human drama. The writers' adaptation from fact to film story and script relies on some well-worn devices, but everyone in my party thought it succeeded beautifully in limning consistent and plausible back stories, portraying women of implacable strength in what might have been strictly a male story, and wrapping the whole tale in a tender romance.I'm interested now in reading the book. In case you are too, note that there are two versions, one for Young Adults.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coasties get no respect. At least, not as much as soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines get. Even the word may sound derogatory to an outsider, but coastie is actually the most widely accepted term for Coast Guardsmen. Less complimentary terms include the "Navy National Guard", "the Navy's little sister" and "puddle pirates". See? No respect. Even though the roots of the U.S. Coast Guard go back to 1790 and its current missions make it as valuable in peacetime as in wartime, and its focus is jobs that none of the other armed services undertake regularly (if at all), few people know much about coasties. I blame the movies. There aren't very many Coast Guard movies out there. 2006's "The Guardian" is the only one I could think of before 2016's "The Finest Hours" (PG-13, 1:57), which really is an "incredible true story"! In this film, Chris Pine takes a break from the bridge of the Starship Enterprise to captain a much smaller ship, but one in no less danger than his ship in the "Star Trek" movies. Pine plays Boatswain's Mate First Class Bernard Webber, stationed in Chatham, Massachusetts in the early 1950s. As a coastie, he's very capable, but meek. As a man, he's handsome, but shy. Nevertheless, Bernie rises to any occasion when presented with a challenge. He wins the heart of a pretty and assertive local girl named Miriam (Holliday Grainger) and soon they're engaged. On the day that Bernie plans to officially notify his commanding officer (Eric Bana) that he's getting married, he gets sent out into a nor'easter to rescue about three dozen merchant mariners whose ship was one of two disabled in this especially severe winter storm.The ship in question is the oil tanker, SS Pendleton. Due to a series of unfortunate events so bad that they'd make Lemony Snicket shudder, Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck), the Pendleton's engineer, ends up leading the efforts of the crew in trying to notify someone of the ship's location and keeping it afloat long enough for the men to be rescued. Ray has to contend with the ship's greatly diminished capabilities, the rising water inside the ship and the members of the crew who strongly disagree on the best course of action. Fortunately, Ray has on his side Seaman Wallace Quirey (John Ortiz), the ship's jovial and hulking cook (Abraham Benrubi) and an old salt named Frank Fauteux (Graham McTavish), but their loyalty only helps so much ? especially in this weather! As the men on the Pendleton are fighting for survival, Bernie is fighting to get to them in time, and Miriam is doing what she can from the shore. Bernie can only find three other men to accompany him on what some openly call "a suicide mission". Without telling Miriam that he's going, he sets out with Seaman Richard Livesey (Ben Foster), Engineman Third Class Andrew Fitzgerald (Kyle Gallner) and Seaman Ervin Maske (John Magaro) on a motorized lifeboat meant to hold no more than 12 men. How these four men in this small boat are going to make it through this storm over a major sand bar, find the Pendleton and rescue up to 41 men are the serious problems facing Boatswain Bernard Webber's crew."The Finest Hours", based on the book of the same name, and as produced by Walt Disney Pictures, is an excellent, if not completely accurate tale of heroism. First of all, you're struck with how incomprehensibly gutsy simply undertaking this rescue mission was for Webber and his crew ? and how utterly hopeless the situation seemed for Sybert and his seafaring comrades. It's simply great storytelling. Part of the story's effectiveness lies with the important role Miriam and her impending marriage to Bernie play in the story. Although Bernie and Miriam did marry in real life, much about their relationship and her role in the events portrayed has been fabricated for dramatic purposes. It feels like unnecessary embellishment of an already dramatic story.The acting is one of this film's additional strengths. I feel that this was one of Casey Affleck's best roles and finest performances to date. Pine is very good, but having him play a good-looking guy who is insecure about his looks seemed a little silly. The rest of the cast is solid, as is the directing of the little-known but versatile Craig Gillespie, and the quality of the writing in this adaptation by Eric Johnson, Scott Silver and Paul Tamasy. The gale-force visual effects are the best this side of 2000's "The Perfect Storm", while the 3D, and, if you have access to them, D-Box seats, really enhance the experience. This film tells a relatively simple story and feels a little old fashioned, but that's part of its charm. Come to think of it, with its complete absence of sexual content or mano-a-mano violence and its light use of adult language, "The Finest Hours" also works very well as a family film. This movie will give you two of the finest hours that you and/or your family are likely to have watching a movie this year. "A-"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has three main threads: 1. the coast guard's efforts to save the tanker 2.the chief engineer's efforts to save his ship 3.Miriam's efforts to see her loverIf the beginning is slow and too romantic for my taste, after the introduction the movie starts building the tension. The visual effects are mostly toward the design of the waves and the dynamics of the motion. Imagine if the oil tanker's bulk seems diminished against the vastness off the sea, how did the small rescue boat look! The cast was good, several of them even looked like the real characters. The main actors (all three of them) did a great job by transmitting their feelings, the pain, the despair, the courage and the love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Finest Hours" just might be the worst two hours ever committed to celluloid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Finest Hours" is based on the true story of the miraculous Pendleton rescue of 1952 ? an event still considered the greatest small boat rescue in the history of the Coast Guard. Though bravery undoubtedly surfaced throughout the real experience, here, sheer luck appears to outweigh intrepidity, ignoring all opportunities to display undaunted heroism in its place. This is a major mistake for any picture, but especially so in a disaster movie.Every character thrust into the middle of insurmountable danger radiates overwhelming timidity, uncertainty, and even, on occasion, idiocy. "They'll listen to you!" Graham McTavish's Frank Fauteux blazons to Casey Affleck's soft-spoken Ray Sybert. But why would they? Confidence and conviction never emerge from any of the seagoing protagonists, causing frustration and annoyance for the viewer. No matter how spectacular the setting of Mother Nature's wrath upon the miniscule entities invading her waters, no entertainment can be derived from witnessing jellyfish tossed about in a sea of skepticism.In the winter of 1951, shy Coast Guardsman Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) meets Miriam (Holliday Grainger) on a blind date - and the two quickly fall in love. The following year, the assertive young girl asks Bernie to marry her, but his shaken courage from an earlier rescue mission that resulted in tragedy affords him marked hesitancy. When a violent storm splits two massive oil tankers in half, Webber is given a chance to regain his resolve. Intent on saving the survivors of the SS Pendleton, the determined coxswain and his crew of three sailors, Engineman Andrew Fitzgerald (Kyle Gallner) and seamen Richard Livesey (Ben Foster) and Ervin Maske (John Magaro), must conquer monumental obstacles to reach the imperiled vessel."The Finest Hours" starts right in with the character development, forgetting almost immediately that it's supposed to be a disaster movie. And a January disaster movie at that. Too much attention is given to Webber's personal life and in all the wrong areas; instead of focusing on the tragic events that lead to his shattered confidence asea, a formulaic romance is initiated, where a cherub-faced redhead exhibits enough control and pluck to make Pine's lead just that much more inadequate.This might not have been an unwanted contrast were it not for the addition of several other fainthearted, shy, ineffectual players. Affleck's Sybert and even Eric Bana's officer-in-charge Daniel Cluff are mousy, incompetent, and permanently unsure, incapable of producing a hint of leadership or purposefulness. There's not a respectable character in the entire picture, nor is there a genuinely salty tar (save for Graham McTavish) among them. The various roles exhibit stupidity more routinely than bravery, which is problematic for a film that should, at the very least, disguise stupidity as bravery. "The Finest Hours" is entirely devoid of heroism; luck, insubordination, and cinematic segues prove to be solutions to predicaments rather than the typical common sense or grit."The Finest Hours" wants to be more than just a disaster film, but it doesn't know how to achieve that. In fact, it doesn't really know how to pose as a disaster film, either. Every time a suspenseful scenario is orchestrated, the editing and dialogue and actions manage to stymie the anticipation. There's no tension or fearfulness or believable peril. Perhaps this is because it's a Disney production, in which blood and death must be at an absolute minimum. But likely it's because director Craig Gillespie just doesn't know what to do with the screenplay, which is crafted so generically and so ploddingly that the special effects of crashing waves and suffocating waters are unable to cope with the slow pacing and pitiful personas. Some of it is so bad it's almost hilarious ? but unfortunately, it never goes far enough to be truly funny in its artistic dreadfulness. Instead, it's mostly just unwatchable.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>
