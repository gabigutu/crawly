		<fullReview>Once every few years, you're presented to a slapstick comedy so hilarious you instantly forget how LOW this form of entertainment actually is. I can't give a scientific explanation to state how come it's funny to see someone (preferably wearing glasses) getting hit in the face by a ball?it just is. Dodgeball is vulgar, crude and without substance?but your stomach will hurt from laughing and don't we all need that from time to time? In case you really want to defend this film, you can always say it features tons of unsubtle criticism towards modern American image of exaggerated health-obsession. Ben Stiller's character is the personification of the obnoxious fitness guru: 'We're better than you, and we know it'. Opposed to him, there's Vince Vaughn as the chilled-minded, lovable guy who owns a fitness center for the underdeveloped wimps. Due to his financial situation, he risks losing his gym to Stiller except if he and his teams of misfits manage to win the world-famous dodgeball tournament. The film is a series of cheap chuckles, eccentric characters and outrageous one-liners. It's pretty funny to hear Stiller yell out lines like: 'You're a skid mark on the underpants of society'. Or the always-amusing Rip Torn encouraging his team with the words: 'you're as useful as a cock-flavored lollipop'. The acting is great as it can be with Ben Stiller and Rip Torn who go delightfully over the top and lots of enthusiast cameos (Chuck Norris, David Hasselhof, William Shatner and even Lance Armstrong). It sure isn't Schindler's List but Dodgball is great entertainment and stress releasing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the Nay Sayers!!, This is a Damn Funny Movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched Dodgeball last night and I can't remember laughing so hard at a movie in years, from Vince Vaughn finally being cast as a person you can like to Rip Torn who is always at his best as the sarcastic coach who is full of colorful one-liners, and I didn't start out as a Ben Stiller Fan, but his movies have seriously picked up in quality latelyFrom the supporting cast and the cameo's everyone does a top notch job, Gary Cole is especially amusing as the sports announcer and his always missing the point sidekick, The Dim bulb Chris Klein type Dimwit on Vince Vaughns team adds to the hilarity, and Missy Pyle(What A Babe!!)Forget what all the Negativity from the other reviewers state, this is a comedy, a comedy is meant to entertain, it is not Casablanca or the Producers, but it is not meant to be(****) Out Of (****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>superior slapstick comedy - tightly scripted, it gets immense mileage out of the flimsiest of gags</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Go and see it. It's one of the best comedies of the year and a lot funnier than it should be given the flimsy premise. Ben Stiller has a big 'Globo' health club worth millions (it even includes cosmetic surgery facilities - they know that 'fatness is genetic, like baldness or necrophilia'). The lovely Christine Taylor is his lawyer, charged with getting rid of the 'Average Joe' gym across the road so they can build a parking lot for Globo customers. She takes a liking to the 'underdog' owner of the Average Joe gym though, and helps them in their plan to win a Dodgeball contest in order to get the money they owe. Dodgeball is an 'obscure' sport that mostly consists of throwing a ball to hit your opponent (look it up on the Net - Dodgeball fans take it quite seriously!) Even when I describe the film, I think 'it sounds awful' - I probably would have avoided it if it hadn't been recommended so highly - and I recommend you stay till the *very end* of the credits for one of the best scenes (which also takes a swipe at the US film-making industry!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very silly but fun despite the odd patch of misses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter La Fleur runs a second rate gym that is populated by non-paying members who are, shall we say, on the edge of society. Peter's relaxed existence is made difficult by the fact that a large gym across the road aims to shut him down. When the Average Joe gym receives its final warning from the bank, they face a 30-day deadline to come up with $50,000 or lose the gym to competitor White Goodman. After their initial ideas fail, they discover that the national dodgeball contest has a prize of that very amount ? with a little help from an ex-champion, they set out to make it to the finals and save the day.This film came to the UK on a wave of hype and praise but I was a little wary because I knew that the style of humour that it has can be very hit and miss. The film has the same plot that all these sorts of sports movies have and you pretty much know where it is going from the very start but, to be honest, how many people have come here for the engaging story? No ? me neither! The humour is very silly and it will not appeal to everyone but I found it pretty funny with the out-of-the-blue stuff being the funniest; if you find it funny to hear the line 'thank you Chuck Norris' said with sincerity then this will be the film for you. It isn't as consistent as I would have liked because it does have a couple of patches where there are more misses than hits but generally I had a good hatful of laughs and, when not laughing I still had a smile on my face.Of course, like I said, this isn't for everybody and I'm sure many will see it as a juvenile ? and it does seem to have been aimed at the young male side of the market. The downside of this is that the majority of the laughs are pretty basic and, as we are seeing too often recently, the old audience draw of girls kissing is wheeled out yet again. The casting also helps to a certain degree and do help a bit to cover the basic humour. Vaughn is cool and relaxed and, although you wouldn't call it 'acting' he is a likable lead. Stiller has a few dry moments but generally his 70's fitness freak steals every scene he is in. Taylor is pretty but you can't help feeling that the film is only using her when, for no reason other than titillation she is revealed as bisexual (with a girlfriend). Torn is funny if basic and Azaria is also funny. The support cast is more about off the wall characters than good writing or performances, but Long, Root, Moore, Tudyk and others are all OK. Cameos from Hasselhoff, Norris, Shatner and Lance Armstrong are all briefly amusing and, just like Best in Show, commentators Gary Cole and Jason Bateman do spot on spoofs of low-grade sports commentators and have lots of great lines between them.Overall this is not the funniest film EVER, as some critics have absurdly claimed ? it simply isn't consistent enough for that accolade but it is still a pretty funny film if you are in the mood for silly humour and some pretty basic jokes. The use of easy draws such as female flesh, lesbianism and physical jokes is a bit of a downer when you think about it but I doubt many will complain when it is on. The cast generally do well and the material is funny and energetic enough to do the job, producing a silly film that is hardly memorable but will be fun while you're watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh my God, this movie is funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in years. That's all I can really say about this movie. It's stupid, sure, but it's so hilarious, you don't care.I could not stop laughing. There are so many jokes in this movie, you don't even have a chance to rest before the next one comes along.Ben Stiller as the "evil" White Goodman -- it's a classic character that should go down in the annals of comedy greatness. The announcers for ESPN 8 "The Ocho" (Gary Cole and Jason Bateman) had me rolling in the aisles. Stephen Root is a comic genius as well, and Alan Tudyk as the random pirate (why? who cares!) was pure gold.Oh, and make sure you stay till the end of the credits... Ben Stiller does a routine that's absolutely hysterical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Silly metaphor, I know. The film "Dodgeball: A true underdog story" while maybe be offensive at times, the film really brings it back up to place with the humor. You really can't help but laugh at the movie a couple times. Sort of like "Zoolander", another great flick with Ben Stiller, it's so stupid you've gotta love it. I would recommend this film for a good laugh. As of movie of the year or comedy of the year, no, this is not the film. But it was a good one to watch. A true film for any Ben Stiller fan, that's for sure. I will warn though, if you get offended easily, this maybe not the film for you.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty much as funny as they say it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When average Joe's gym, run by Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) is under threat of take over by White Goodman (Ben Stiller), La Fleur and his gym members must raise $50,000 to save it. The only way to do it is Dodge Ball, and with the help of a seasoned professional, maybe they have a chance.Great characters, and a hilarious script make dodge ball a Hit, Ben Stiller's and Rip Torn's characters are particularly well written, but none of the characters fail to get a laugh, and there is a good blend of them on show.Definitely worth a look for anyone who fancies a laugh. It's not a classic, but it doesn't fail to entertain with it's slapstick style.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the funniest slapstick comedy ever. Ben Stiller was funny as always and Vince Vaughn was surprisingly funny. Stiller plays White Goodman and he is the snobbish owner of his up-to-the-style Globo Gym whereas Vaughn plays Peter La Fleur and he is the owner of Average Joe's. The gyms find out that there would be a dodgeball tournament held in a few weeks with a grand prize of fifty thousand dollars. Average Joe's need that money or else the gym goes to Globo Gym. The gyms ended up going and making it to the finals. But who wins? The movie will tell you that. All of the supporting actors were funny especially Rip Torn as Patches O'Houlihan. If you like Ben Stiller, you will like this movie. I rate this film a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun piece of camp comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's funny about dodgeball? First, it's a movie about a group of non-competitive and somewhat eccentric adults playing dodgeball to save a not-very-impressive gym from the clutches of a competitive monopolistic chain gym. Second - Ben Stiller. Stiller is over-the-top and hilarious as the evil nemesis of average Joe Vince Vaughn. Vaughn - playing the slightly less than average Joe owner of Average Joe's gym, plays the perennial hard luck loser to the hilt. The supporting cast is terrific. Alan Tudyk, Rip Torn, Christine Taylor and Stephen Root are a great ensemble.This is a rather extreme and rather Hollywood camp comedy. Although a lot of the humor is adult, the film is also refreshingly clean compared with the averaged 21st century comedy. Dodgeball also doubles as a spot-the-cameo film, since a whole host of odd celebrities pop up here and there throughout.The first time I saw this film, I was charmed and I laughed a lot. Although the film remained entertaining, like most comedies it lost a bit of its luster in its second viewing.Why only a 6 rating? Despite the campiness and good solid humor, this is still a very formulaic film and it does tend to vaporize after a viewing or two.Strongly recommended - for one viewing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not intended to be a great work of art and no one will win an Oscar for it because it is just a film packed full of laughs that leaves you smiling afterwards - that is, with the exception of the few posters here bereft of any sense of humour.I am not a great Ben Stiller fan - generally, I find him rather unfunny but he scores highly in this film and Vince Vaughn also deserves recognition among others for fine comedic timing.The guest appearances also add to the general fun and the wheelchair-bound coach, played by Rip Torn is just a hoot.This is definitely one to hire from your local rental shop - me, I'm going to buy the DVD!</fullReview>

Within its genre this is definitely 10/10.......against Schindler's List or other such films, then it's struggling.....but then that isn't what it is meant or wants to be.Just sit back....strap yourself in and laugh out loud....then replay the ridiculous White Goodman monologues with your friends time and again!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic tale of the underdog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film because of Ben Stiller (who I think is fantastic). This film had me in stitches from the moment it started to the moment it ended. Ben Stiller is great as White Goodman (a neurotic gym owner on a power trip) and, for me, steals the show. Rip Torn plays the part of a former Dodgeball champion and, for those of you who like physical humour, had me in pain from laughing so hard.The story has been well thought out and put across to the audience in a way that everyone will relate to at least one of the characters. It is the type of movie that you can watch without really thinking about it. By that, I mean that you can watch it and laugh (and you will) without worrying whether or not you're gonna be too loud and miss vital plot points. The movie is sheer comedy. You watch the screen and you laugh... it's that simple. All the family can enjoy this. My son is also a very big fan. I know that when I sit down to watch this movie with my son that there are no times when I have to block the screen or shield him from any dirty or disgusting dialogue. Yes, this is one for the whole family... from children to the senior citizens.If you haven't seen this movie yet then I advise you to buy / rent it now. You don't know what you're missing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The supreme pinnacle of the fitness industry is GloboGym, owned and operated by large-haired, small-brained fitness fascist White Goodman (Ben Stiller). Next door is the pitiful competition: Average Joe's, a run-down, homely gym run by amiable slacker Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) who is always ready with a little advice and encouragement for his misfit gym members and who is quite prepared to let people pay their fees a little late.Unfortunately, Peter's lack of business acumen means that his gym is in foreclosure, and unless he comes up with ?50,000 dollars in one month his gym will be bought by White Goodman and bulldozed to make way for a new car park. Determined to save Joe's, Peter and his friends enter a dodgeball tournament where first prize just so happens to be ?50,000 dollars, and find themselves an efficient (but completely nutty) coach in the shape of former dodgeball champion Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn). But White discovers their intentions and the fun really starts when he puts together his own team of champion dodge-ballers to thwart Joe's ...I remember this movie being something of a sleeper hit, and can see why: there's something for everyone in terms of humour, from straightforward slapstick (usually with a wrench) to classic verbal sparring. Vaughn is the calm centre to the film, wisely playing it straight amongst his oddball team (Steve the Pirate is my particular favourite) Rip Torn is suitably OTT, but scenery-mastication honours must go to Stiller, easily delivering his funniest performance since Mystery Men. The plot is straightforward and you can see the end a mile off, but a number of fun cameos and a continual stream of jokes keep the laughs coming. Just plain fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Picked this up on DVD for ?3 ($6) - didn't know anything about it We thought it one of the funniest films we've seen for some time. Thought I'd check out the rating and was surprised how low (6.6) it was. Then checked out some of the "Hated It" comments to see why this could be I guess that a lot of people find this film offensive, with stereotypical attitudes - like how a bisexual woman could kiss both a man and a woman (an extraordinary observation). Or that it was unfair to poke fun at someone who spent all his waking hours dressed up as pirate. I think that comment came from a member of the Long John Silver Alliance.Lighten up! Comedy - like any other artistic endeavour is subjective - all I can say is that I laughed and found that at many points the jokes were coming faster than I could process them - always a good sign.A good combination of slapstick humour and smart-ass comments delivered at a rapid pace And an ever-popular theme: will the underdogs triumph?

		<shortDescription>Another Frat Pack movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was the 'Rat Pack', the 'brat pack'. Now there is the 'Frat pack'(made it up on the spot). The 'Frat Pack' consist of Ben Stiller, Will Farrell, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Vince Vaugn, and some of their friends. These actors have their hold on Hollywood and they basically can do most comedy movies they want because they have can make a good amount of money doing these movies. Other Frat Pack movies include 'Anchor Man', 'Starsky and Hutch', and Old School'. I'm not saying these movies are terrible or i don't like the actors. It annoys me seeing the same actors playing the same comedic parts and the studio expects that just their presence should make us laugh.I'm not trying to insult fraternities. I call them the frat pack because they appeal more to those guys.I always enjoy a good comedy, but if the next 10 years is going to be comedy movies like this then i might just watch reruns of 'The Simpsons' or 'Family Guy' for comedy.The game of dodgeball is humorous but it doesn't mean you should make a movie out of it. If anything, you should only use this story within an episode of a t.v. show (ex: South Park) instead of dragging two hours of this nonsense.We are supposed to laugh whenever we see Ben Stiller while he plays one of his 'crazy' characters. He looks funny but his character gets real annoying real fast. I liked Stiller at one point but after 'Zoolander' and this movie, I'm starting to worry about his future (granted he's making more money now compared to when he was funny). We're also supposed to like Vince Vaugn but he plays the same 'takes no gruff' character. The pirate character was the most annoying of the cast. 'HA, HA, a man dressed up as a pirate in a gym. Excuse me while I change my pants'.This story plays out the same comedic formula as most mindless comedies. I guess when you do a movie about dodgeball then you can't really do too much with it. A lot of people apparently have seen this movie and liked it. So if you like pointless comedy that has no intelligence behind it then you will enjoy this movie. If you like a plot and some intelligence in a comedy movie then stay away from this one.I'll probably skip the possible sequel 'Kickball', but from how much money they made from this one, I'm sure they're planning the sequel right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a film for average Joe's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter LaFleur {Vince Vaughn} is the owner of Average Joe's Gym, barely making any cash, LaFleur looks like losing his Gym to corporate big hitters, Globo Gym. Globo Gym, run by sleazy White Goodman {Ben Stiller}, is the complete opposite to Joe's, big money, big client?le and big ego's. So when the few hardy members of Joe's decide to enter the Vegas Dodgeball Tournament, in the vain hope of winning the cash prize to save the gym, it's no surprise that Goodman enters his own team to hopefully thwart their plan.A joyous, crude and eminently quotable underdog story that demands repeat viewings to fully catch all that is going on. Dismissd on release as being a throw away comedy from the Stiller/Vaughn frat pack brigade, Dodgeball has since gone on to surpass expectations and rise towards the top of the sports comedy table. A true ensemble piece {tho Stiller's preening Goodman takes the honours}, few films of its type have fused a character based heart with such dumb shenanigans and gotten away with it. These are odd and even sad people, but unity is a fine thing, even when wrenches are bouncing off their heads and balls are thudding into the groin! Yes it's that type of film, and we are all the better for the experience. Boasting smart use of cameos from such luminaries like William Shatner and Chuck Norris, Dodgeball is a testament to how good physical comedy can be, and of course it's always great to shout for the underdog. No matter how bizarre they may be. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well what can I say? Hugely enjoyable, silly yes but manages to be enjoyable. Yes with a predictable story that occasionally loses its lustre and some flimsy gags and a number of clichés. But what makes it watchable is the hilarious script, the good-natured spirit of the film, likable and relateable characters and fun performances from Vince Vaughan(really cool in one of his better movies- and performances as well), Ben Stiller, Rip Torn and Hank Azaria with an amusing cameo from David Hasselhoff. The direction is also good, and the film is nice to look at with a cool soundtrack. Overall, not perfect but watchable and funny. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have all seen sports movies at least one. Like Hoosiers or Feild of dreams. But never before have we seen a film like Dodgeball: a true underdog story. Never before have we seen a sports movie that has to do with Dodgeball in the first place. The Film stars Vince Vaughn as Peter, The owner of a little gym. Ben Stiller stars as White Goodman, the owner of a large gym called Globogym. One day White comes to the gym and tells Peter that if he doesn't get enough money by the end of the month, he'll knock down the gym. so Peter and his nerdy and odd friends compete in a Dodgeball competition in Vegas. They are going to be competing against Globogym. The gang soon gets some assistance from Kate(Christine Taylor)a chick who works at the bank. She kicks ass at Dodgeball. She is better than almost all of them. White and Peter both have a crush on her. We can all tell who she picks. Dodgeball is a very funny movie. I don't think it for everyone because a lot of people might think it is silly. I am not doubting that it is silly. It sure as hell is silly. But the film is really funny and I give it a thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is great. Very funny from start to finish, and just goes on and on with the farce humour. There were a few things that I felt went a bit to far. I mean, it was just too gross for me. Like the masturbating with a pizza. I mean, come on! Was that really necessary?One thing that really really bugs me, is the so called "alternative ending" Where globo gym wins, and not "Average Joes." They wanted to do it that was because they wanted to tell us that you can try in life, but you don't always win.OK, here's the problem with that. We know already! We don't need multimillionaire Hollywood celebrates telling us average Joe's and Josephine's that! We freaken know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So mister director guy, who had a problem making an ending that didn't depress us, nor one that pointed out the obvious that the average person doesn't always win, go make an independent movie or something to make a more "artistic" or "depressing" or "meaningful" movie. Hey you would have less of a budget, and make less money, but that's not what's important right? Plus, the movie ends tightly. Brings in all lose ends. If you see it, you will know what I mean.And, on top of which, the ending brought in Chuck Norris. Chuck Norris! He's freaken awesome! See the movie! The whole one! And ignore what the director says in the "alternative ending." It's better with a good ending, and just flat out better to end with Chuck Noriss anyways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sets an extremely high bar for future nonsense comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nobody makes me bleed my own blood. NOBODY", White Goodman (Ben Stiller) in Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.This ridiculous quote (don't bother searching for inner logic within it, you won't find any) is taken from one of the most zany, crude and remarkably dumb movies that were made for the silver screen in recent years. Guess what? The formula, absurd as it is, actually works. With the right cast, inexplicable cameos (Chuck Norris, Lans Armstrong and William Shatner all in one), and just the right amount of grown-up actors who are willing to embarrass themselves at any cost ? Dodgeball is the best sports comedy made in the 2000's (miles better than Will Ferrell's overrated Talladega Nights).Dodgeball tells the ludicrous story of a bunch of losers (A high school student with aspirations of becoming a male cheerleader, a man who thinks he's a pirate, a spineless nerd married to a male-ordered Asian wife and more) who work out together in a gym conveniently named "Average Joes". The manager of the gym is Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn, in his last pre-Wedding Crashers days), who has an ongoing dispute with one White Goodman (Stiller), the owner of a mega-successful chain of gyms who looks to take over La Fleur's gym as well. La Fleur, who is also in deep financial debts, has to come up with 50 grand as soon as possible, in order to prevent Goodman from executing his devilish scheme. When he and his brethren of losers learn about an obscure Dodgeball competition with a 50,000$ award tag attached, they must learn to play the game fast, and overcome Goodman's competing team in the finals.The movie is very short, and very accelerating (I knew nothing about Dodgeball upon my first view, but hooked up with the rules of the game as the film went along), and pumps you up towards its adrenaline packed finale. The main course, however, is Ben Stiller's character, Goodman. Stiller gives out his best performance to date by portraying Goodman as the dumbest bad guy you'll ever see. The narcissistic head of the competitive chain of gyms is a goofy character, who speaks illogical sentences, often contradicting himself; greases himself up and masturbates with a Pizza slice (don't ask me how this works). Stiller gives Goodman the most outrageous gestures and one-liners I've seen in a while, especially when confronting Vaughn's character on screen; and comes out as a complete arrogant jerk. Stiller's real life wife, Christine Taylor, is the bisexual bank accountant who comes to La Fleur's aid and eventually falls for him (more or less). Taylor and Vaughn's chemistry with Stiller is a definite advantage that helps carry the movie throughout its comedic sequences, setting an extremely high bar for future nonsense comedies.If you love sports and comedies, and you don't get offended easily, Dodgeball is the place to be for relaxation and guilty pleasures.</fullReview>

This was among the three funniest of the year next to "Anchorman" and "Naplolean Dynamite". This movie is just so funny. It has a great cast. It is very well written. It has a good story for a comedy. This is one of my top ten favorite comedies and is one of my top 30 favorite over all. This is a funny movie. This is one of the funniest movies ever. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rip Torn steals the show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off let me say I am not much of a fan of Ben Stiller but his role was actually funny in this movie.Vince Vaugn does a competent job as the owner of Average Joe's Gym and the cast of misfits were well played.Rip Torn absolutely steals the show with his hilarious antics as the dodge ball coach. "If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball" while he throws wrenches at the team.Yes the movie is dumb and mainly slapstick humor but it is slapstick humor that is actually funny! This is an excellent comedy that only strives for laughs. This is funniest movie made in a long time.If you even mildly are interested in movie then you are probably going to find it funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superbly simple comedy which delivers laugh after laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as slapstick comedies go there are few which manage as many laughs as Dodgeball. The film sees Vaughn play a lovable gym owner who is both friendly and lax with his bill payments. The latter of these characteristics gets him in trouble with the bank and fellow gym owner Stiller threatens to buy out his gym if he doesn't find $50,000 by the end of the month. OK so the story up to now is a bit weak, well it doesn't really improve, but as Vaughn and his band of 'Average Joe's' decide to enter a dodge-ball competition to get the money the laughs come thick and fast. The group is later joined by Rip Tom, an eccentric ex-player who believes that "if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball" and star thrower Christine Taylor. Many of the laughs maybe juvenile and slapstick but there something about a guy getting hit in the crotch with a wrench that never stops being funny.What's more every member of the cast seems to fit into there roles perfectly from Steve the Pirate (Alan Tudyk) to the 'out of it' commentator Pepper Brooks (Jason Bateman). In fairness the film won't appeal to everyone, it's got a simple story line with uncomplicated gags and it's fronted by Vaughen and Stiller who's names in a film nowadays promise one of 'those' sort of comedies.But for me the film is laugh out loud funny with superb characters.I'd recommend anyone who enjoyed Acchorman or The 40 Year Old Virgin to take a look.</fullReview>

He wants to buy Average Joes Gym and make it part of Globo-Gym. Well, Peter and his band of misfits are not going to give up without a fight. So, they decide to play dodgeball!

		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite films ever! I know that might sound bad, but this is an unbelievably funny film. It might not be to some people's tastes or type of humour, but I enjoyed it so much!!! Some people do not like it, whereas others just love it. I even went out and bought the DVD and I can still watch it over and over again. I loved Ben Stiller in this film, he really was a classic and probably without him the film wouldn't have had the same comedic effect! However there are still plenty of other uniquely, strange and hilarious characters to enjoy and laugh out loud at! I had to be dragged to the cinema to see this film, because I thought it looked rubbish and was just another low-budget comedy, but how wrong I was indeed! Definitely not one to miss, I urge you to see it!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ballistic Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took some balls to develop a film based on the sport of Dodgeball! How can a movie based on an endangered sport entice moviegoers? Well, the formula worked! "Dodgeball: The True Underdog Story" was a box office underdog hit! The film was hilarious! Vince Vaughn stars as Peter LeFleur, an Average Joe gym owner who is struggling to keep his what-else but "Average Joe" gym open for business. Moreover, "Average Joe's" reality show comes into play when White Goodwin, the competitive successful owner of Globo's Gym, threatens to buy out the Average Joe Gym for it to be utilized as a parking garage for Globos. Peter LeFleur must come up with $50k in less than a month to avoid the buyout. For Pete's sake, Why do "Average Joels" I mean "Average Joes" finish last! Ben Stiller as White Godwin was an undeniable laugh riot! His White Lies make him out to be a womanizing entrepreneur when in fact he is a self-absorbed insecure rat. However, his self-absorption creates a comical fixation to us viewers for the Globo master who's bubble has burst! Stiller continues to instill laughter in movies with the best of them. Back to Peter! In order to come up with the $50k cashola, Peter and his Average Joe entourage gym members decide to enter a Dodgeball contest in Las Vegas. The problem is that the only thing these guys have ever dodged in their lives are punches from the bullies who have harassed them their entire lives. Justin Long, Stephen Root, Joel Moore, Chris Williams, and Vaughn himself executed better than average performances as the Average Joes! Rip Torn was also mesmerizing as Patches O' Houlihan, an old-timer Dodgeball legend who coaches the Joes. Christine Taylor, Stiller's real life wife, was watching as Kate Veatch; the lawyer representing Goodwin who decides to become an Average Joe dodgeballer herself. "Dodgeball: The True Underdog Story" is the funniest film I saw in 2004! Hats off to Writer-Director Rawson Marshall Thurber! His marshall comedic plan was filled with raw laughs! It's a doggoned or should I say underdog classic! ***** EXCELLENT</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is something funny about stupid films. Just look at the Montey Python series. This film is stupid. This film is daft But it is very funny. White Goodman. What a legend. Ben Stiller created the perfect 'villian' in this. Villain i suppose is a strong word, as you end up falling for his stupid comments, and actually feel a little bit sorry for him at the end. Vince Vaughn is good as Peter La Fleur. However, towards the end, i actually prefer White Goodman. If 'Le Loser' didn't have a bunch of great and very lovable characters on his side, then id have been rooting on Stiller. Justin Long is great. The flashback to his cheer leading audition is one of the funniest things i have seen for a long time. However, the best part is the dodge balling itself. Half of this film is the tournament itself. And boy is it great. Patches O'Houlihan has the best lines in this section, and until his demise, was becoming as good as Goodman. A favourite quote being 'Your about as useful as a cock flavoured lollipop'. Great stuff. People talk about this film as being predictive and obvious. But who cares. Its not called 'a true underdogs story' for nothing, and no matter how many times i see a Dodgeball hitting someone, i still let out a little giggle. This film is a dig at other films like 'Mighty Ducks'. but this is funny. This is the funniest 'sports' film ever. Bring on Dodgeball 2, or a film about Beachballing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is allot better than Zoolander, a similar film. If you hated Zoolander than just pretend this was never made. This is not a movie to make us think, in fact it could make us dumber but it is allot of fun.Stiller's White Goodman owns the large corporate entity Globo Gym, complete with cheesy yet hilariously up-front ad campaigns ("we're better than you, and we know it!"). Vaughn's Peter LaFleur manages Average Joe's gym across the road, running losses and heading towards bankruptcy because he's too nice to chase up overdue gym fees. Before long the bank starts circling Average Joe's, forcing them to come up with the magical figure of $50,000 to avoid closure and an impending takeover from the big guys across the street. Later that evening one member stumbles upon an ad for a dodge ball tournament with, you guessed it, a $50,000 first prize. But the gang doesn't have a clue how to play, save for schoolboy Justin. After watching a video on the ins and outs of the game they decide to give it a shot. Not surprisingly Globo Gym gets wind of their plans and gleefully takes part as well, which is where the fun begins.It certainly isn't award-winning film-making, but first time director Rawson Marshall Thurber does a great job at capturing the absurdity of adults playing dodge ball in an organized ESPN tournament and provides just enough laughs to suffice. Stiller and Vaughn fans in particular should dig this one, though those two are by no means at their best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fast-paced and filled with slapstick moments, Dodgeball is one of the more delightful films I have seen in a long time. Thurber, Vaughan, Stiller and all the rest of the outstanding team deserve lots of credit. The overall story is well presented, and the dialog sparkles. There are plenty of raunchy innuendos--and some not so innuendo! I viewed this movie also as a satire on big- money big-time sports in America and the do-or-die attitude of many of its stars who often play with injuries and in great pain in order to satisfy terms of their contracts with wealthy team owners.This all seems to be neatly summed up at the very end of the movie with Pete LeFleur's surprise--not to be revealed here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best comedy films I have seen in some time. If the Cinema I was in had aisles, I'd have been rolling in them with laughter.Almost every type of humor, from subtle sarcasm to physical pratfalls to gross-out humour, are represented here. Jokes for all.Some of the story is a little by the numbers, but as the jokes keep rolling you just don't care. Sit back and enjoy the ride.Stiller's evil gym owner and his cronies are the perfect enditment to the American media's obsession with physical perfection (one reason why the film plays so well to a British audience). whereas Vaughn's band of misfits contain at least one person anyone who wasn't picked first for teams in the playground can identify with.It stands up as a comedy, and as a (admitadly obscure) sports movie.With Stiller, Vaughn et al on top form, I'd recommend this film to anyone with a sense of humour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was best of the movie of the year, well at least so far. It was so funny. There was barely a minute that passed when there wasn't any laughs. I won't go into the plot because you probably know it but let me tell you if you don't laugh at this there is not much else you will laugh at. The last time I laughed so hard at the cinema was when I saw Austin Powers Goldmember. Anyway Ben Stiller was superb in this movie along with the rest of the cast, but Stiller really did steal it for me. He was brilliant as the villain and the last scene in the movie had me laughing all the way home.Go and check this movie out right now and have yourself some big laughs!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoilers for a FANTASTIC film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realize that there is a lot of what some people would consider "low brow" humour in this film. But when you consider the entire premise of the film is a game where you people get hit in the nuts by rubber balls, it's not surprising there is an element of "mindless humour".But there is a lot of subtle comedy, a lot of amusing one liners and a joke in latin near the end. And I think it was the latin joke that made me really love the film. The plot is fairly obvious, and you can see it coming a mile off. But the thick and fast stream of comedy coming out of most of the characters is the reason for seeing the film (and learning more about dodgeball of course. I didn't know there were actual rules to the game!), not an intelligent plot that will keep you guessing.If you don't like bad language, slapstick violence, crude humour then this really won't be your type of film. But if you like a film with a really good sense of comedy of all types (subtle, in your face, slapstick, gentle) and a nice "happy feeling" then you will really like it and I advise it to anyone.And I really mean it about the latin joke!</fullReview>

It's like all those TV programmes/films we all watched at kids where it was necessary to win the local random sports contest in order to save the local community centre/hospital/whatever from the evil developers. Like the "Ass-pen" episode of South Park, "Dodgeball" was sending up the whole "do it for Timmy in the hospital!" genre in a sympathetic, well-judged way.And Ben Stiller's character White is pure comic genius.

		<fullReview>Remember "Rocky"? "Escape to Victory"? or even "The Karate Kid"?As much as I love these and countless other sport-related films, there is always a nagging problem - they take themselves far too seriously. From the initial defeat to the final, against-the-odds triumph, the reverence for competitive sports is carried like a religious icon.The antidote to all this, is this hilarious debut from writer/director Rawson Marshall Thurber. Grounded in a smart and self-aware script, Dodgeball's gags come fast and frequent, as Vince Vaughn's band of losers are transformed into a team of ball-dodging allstars. Vaughn, as Peter LaFleur, at times shows touches of the 1980's Bill Murray-style wise-cracking everyman.Gary Cole and Jason Bateman too, put in a brilliantly accurate portrayal of the banality of sports commentary.A queue of cameos have varying levels of success. (Hasselhoff - good, Lance Armstrong - bad.)But it is Ben Stiller who steals the show. His narcissistic fitness fascist White Goodman with bouffant blonde hair and Village People 'tache has all the best lines. "Nobody makes me bleed my own blood".Dodgeball is unpretentious, shameless, silly, and all the better for it.</fullReview>

Speaking of which, we get Gary Cole and Stephen Root (Lumbergh &amp; Milton! from Office Space), we get a very funny minor role from Patrick Bateman, many cameos, and constant near-the-knuckle innuendo (most of which you'll miss first time around).One of the earliest scenes is a flashback to a cheerleading tryout, that went horribly wrong. That had the entire audience in stitches, and just keeps going.. the bag of wrenches.. the car wash.. the training film from 1938.. the teams at the Dodgeball championship (the Germans' mascot / even a sneaky banner for the MILF's!!).I actually cried with laughter. Sign of a great comedy - you'll notice more gags in the dialogue &amp; the background on repeat viewing. The DVD is going to be pretty special.</fullReview>

Well, there is a new clubhouse leader. There was nothing outstanding about this movie...nothing. The acting was substandard. The plot was substandard. The writing was substandard. The lighting was substandard. It was a cross between "Austin Powers", "Delta Force", "Rocky" and "Charlie's Angels." The problem is that it was the worst part of each of those movies. Soooo you may think it is strange that I say that you have to see this movie. It was one hilarious romp after another. You can't watch this movie with a straight face--especially if you were a guy.

I thought the small part Lance armstrong had in the movie was amazing. Christine Taylor is very attractive as the sexy sophisticated reporter/lawyer that she usually plays in comedy films. Rip Torn (best name ever) was an unexpected yet great addition to the story and the game of Dodgeball is amazing so the movie is a good representation.

From a beginning that sets the scene and introduces the characters to Patches O'Houlihan and the history of dodgeball to the final dodgeball showdown, laugh follows laugh as the "cheerleader" remembers his audition for the school cheerleader scene, the Average Joe's Gym dodgeball players take on girl scouts in the regional finals to qualify for the tournament, and a great cast for the Average Joes (A cheerleader, absolute geek, a guy who thinks hes a pirate, and other not so average joes) who really seem to be rejects, great announcers at the dodgeball final, and "f*n Chuck Norris" and Shatner cameos.

		<shortDescription>Actually enjoyable..(I know...I couldn't believe it either)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So really, it IS funny to see someone get hit in the face with a dodgeball. Really. Rawson Marshall Thurber (who?!) wrote and directed this little number with quite some flare, bringing Stiller to the screen as an annoying uber-gym owner, and Vaughn as the 'obviously going to win' underdog. It was refreshing to see a slapstick comedy without as many crude gags as is the norm nowadays, and although there were a few, it's kept to a minimum and I was grateful for this. I admit, I was expecting utter crap, but was pleasantly surprised. Much of the humour present here is a result of people getting hit with dodgeballs or wrenches (yes, wrenches) but since this is a movie, and therefore NOT real, it's OK to laugh (probably). This movie's heart is in the right place, and although I'm not saying this is the best movie I've ever seen (far, far, far, far, far from it), it IS enjoyable, light-hearted, amusing, and just downright fun. What more can you want? It's a solid popcorn movie.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dodgeball" is the fourth movie starring Ben Stiller this year, the others being "Almong Came Polly", "Starsky and Hutch" and "Envy." Only two of those four are worth seeing, and "Dodgeball" is one of them (the other is "Starsky and Hutch"). "Dodgeball" is the story of Peter La Fleur (Vaughn), the owner of Average Joe's Gymnasium. La Fleur is 8 months behind on his rent, and the owner of Globo Gym (Stiller) is going to buy and demolish Joe's if La Fleur can't pay his $50,000 debt in 30 days. There's only one way to get this money: Dodgeball. The plot is just a set-up for gag after homophobic, hilarious gag. Rip Torn is probably the funniest of any of the actors in the movie, as all of his jokes are extremely mean and extremely hilarious. There is also a great abundance of people getting hit in the balls/face/stomach. I laughed my a**e off, and I'm sure you will too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I took my seat in the movie theatre I knew I was going to be laughing through the whole movie, and thats what happened. Ben Stiller plays White Goodman one of his funniest displays of talent I have seen in a Ben Stiller movie in a very long time. Rip Torn has a big part in a small amount of time he plays senior Peter O'Houlihan with his hilarious line, "If you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball." It had a great and funny plot to keep you watching without getting bored. The movie was great, the casting was great, and well, the jokes were great. Definitely recommend it to someone who likes to see something entertaining for ninety-something minutes. Justin Long also had a hilarious part along with Chris Williams(Dwight) and Alan Tudyk(Steve The Pirate) never stopped being funny. Vince Vaughn(Peter La Fleur) had a funny part also. Great cameos by Chuck Norris, and Lance Armstrong made the movie a non-stop riot of laughter, sometimes I could'nt even hear what the person was saying at first because everyone was laughing so hard!Brilliant, just Brilliant: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful performance by Ben Stiller and ensemble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the advertisement for Dodgeball, I waited with anticipation to see if it would be like one of my favorite Stiller movies Zoolander.I wasn't disappointed to discover that Stiller's White Goodman had a charming connection to Derek Zoolander. Stiller does a wonderful job of making over the top characters memorable and funny, where other actors might simply be annoying. He deserves a lot of credit for bringing the absurdly silly White Goodman to life.I was also excited to see extremely polished performances from Taylor, Vaughn, and Torn. Vaughn is completely believable as the laid back, clever, gym owner. Taylor has quite a few funny moments in the movie. Torn sometimes steals the show with his gruff style and dirty delivery.Notable appearances include Hank Azaria (who needs to work more), and Arrested Development's Jason Bateman, who left me laughing at every cut.Overall, I think fans of Zoolander will love Dodgeball. I would also encourage those who didn't like Zoolander to give Dodgeball a chance, in many ways, it is a superior movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the line of Heavyweights, zoolander, and meet the parents ben stillers character is comic genius, as is vince vaughn. everyone in the theatre didn't stop laughing during this movie, so many classic lines could come out of this movie its ridiculous. If you liked old school, starsky and hutch and any other movie with stiller or vaughn you will love this movie... in fact you may pee your pants out of laughter, it really is that funny... and if you didn't like those movies... you can suck it and learn how to laugh cuz seriously you might have something wrong... seriously if you try over analyzing these movies then your killing it and trying to ruin it for everyone else... stiller, vaughn, the Wilson brothers (owen and Luke), and jack black seem to be the new pack and with few exceptions their movies are genius, they'll never win awards but they become comedy classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not one for a long, or great review, but I can say this; this is one of the funniest movie's I've ever seen. I've never laughed as much in the theater as I did at this movie. There were only a few moments I wasn't laughing! It may offend some of the more "uptight" viewers out there, but if you don't mind a few cheap shots, you will laugh. There are several low intelligence laugh's and a few that you will have to listen to get, but all are just plain funny! I recommended if you want to laugh you want to go see this. This is one of the few movies where the funniest parts are not in the commercials. Even the team names are funny. I may even see this movie again just to catch all the little jokes that you have to look closely to see. I say go!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball: A True Underdog story gave me the most laughs in a movie than any others including beating out Caddyshack, Stripes, Heavyweights, Aiplane!, Happy Gilmore, and others. Ben Stiller stole the show. He is a comedian genius. His voice and his lines in the movie were brilliant. He had better lines than any of my other favorite comedian actors. I've never had a movie where I laughed the entire way through. I did love The Passion of The Christ very well but Dodgeball beat it barely. An excellent performance with beautiful performances by Rip Torn, the losers, and especially Ben Stiller. A must-see comedy!!10/10!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Peter Lafluer(Vaughn) needs $50,000 to pay off his Average Joes Gym before he loses it to the state of the art White Goodman(Stiller) owned "Globo Gym" he is struck with an idea by the losers of all losers in films Mr. "I believe you have my stapler" Gordon(Stephen Root) to compete in Las Vegas for a dodgeball tourney for a $50,000 prize the losers of the Average Joe's go for it. With the help of Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor!) a banker seeking payback on Goodman who brings Globo Gym powerbodies to take on the Average Joes in Vegas. The Joes rely on their urine drinking coach dodgeball legend Patches O' Hoolihan (Rip Torn) to coach them in grueling, crotch punching ways. Will the underdogs prevail? Find out in this true underdog storyOf course Stiller forms very well back into a stupid studly Zoolander character and couldn't be funnier, Vaughn is very good as the Joe of the Average Joes who leads the squad and this movie is the one of the funniest if not the funniest you'll see all year. It's a real treat for sports fans as the nonsense of dodgeball is captivated by warlike ballads in the backgrounds but this movie is really a comedy for well, most people. For a good comedy go with this, don't learn from it just have fun, and OH! It's harmless! Hey, why not-10/10 Not to mention some darn good cameos wink wink</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grab your ball(s) and go see it! *** out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember laughing good and hard at the previews for Dodgeball but was still skeptical about seeing it. I mean how many times have the studios shown all the funny parts but only for one to discover after watching the movie those were the parts that were only funny. Ok, you can all put your hands down now.Happily, there is a lot of funny stuff in Dodgeball to make you want to see it a second time. Nice guy Peter La Fleur (played by Vince Vaughn who has been on a roll the last 1 1/2)is the owner of a small gym that is on the verge of foreclosure unless he can come up with $50,000. Even if the mortgage payments were current, the club is so outdated that it looks more like a place where homeless people crash for the evening.In a desperate attempt to save the gym Peter hires an accountant Kate Veatch (played by pretty lady Christine Taylor) to go over the books. The problem is that Peter hasn't looked at the books since Clinton was President so her help is to of no avail.Things have gotten even worse because a rich spoiled brat has built a beautiful gym right next door. The brat is played to absolute hilarity by Ben Stiller who has his own unique way of impressing the ladies.(Hint: puff puff the magic dragon).By sheer coincidence there is dodgeball tournament at Las Vegas that will pay-yep you got it, $50,000 to the 1st place team. Since Peter and his friends have virtually no talent, they bring in coach Patches O'Houlihan for training. His training includes tools of steel(literally)to ones face that will adjust them to the agony of being hit by a ball. (That part was included during the sneak preview but I laughed even harder the second time around).Two other characters also add to the fun. Gary Cole (Office Space) and Justin Bateman from Starsky And Hutch play the sport announcers and Bateman isn't exactly rowing the boat with both oars especially after he hopes that the outcome of the game won't be affected when Vaughn's team has to forfeit.For the directing and writing of Dodgeball I was expecting to see the name Zucker or Wayan. Instead the credit was given to some guy by the name of Rawson Marshall Thurber. If I see that name for the upcoming Scary Movie 4, I'll take a chance and see that one too.P.S.

		<fullReview>"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story" provides just enough good-natured low brow humor to make up for the fact that the film is not always as funny as it intends to be.Vince Vaughn takes on the role of straight man as Peter La Fleur, the owner of a third rate gym called "Average Joe's" that caters to the?.um?how shall we say it?? less athletically inclined, less single-mindedly health-conscious consumer. Pete's patrons are all "losers" and social outcasts who find Average Joe's the one place where they can find camaraderie and be accepted for who they really are. The problem is that, through poor business management, Peter has virtually bankrupted the establishment to the tune of $50,000 that needs to be paid off pronto if he is to maintain ownership of the place. Enter White Goodman (Ben Stiller), the self-made, egomaniacal owner of a top-of-the-line gym across the street who is determined to force Peter out of business and make it part of his own franchise. To raise the money, Pete and his comrades form a ragtag dodge ball team and head to Las Vegas to compete in the national championships. When Goodman gets wind of the plan, he forms his own team to take on Average Joe's less-than-average players in a David and Goliath showdown broadcast on nationwide TV.Most of the humor in "Dodgeball" is of the Three Stooges/hit-one-another-in-the-groin variety that works pretty well for the most part, even if it does tend to become a bit strained and repetitious after awhile. Vaughn and Stiller have a fun time playing off one another, with the former carefully low balling his performance while the latter bursts forth in a no-holds-barred display of manic energy. Christine Taylor is also lovely and fine as the bank accountant who starts off rummaging through Peter's financial records and winds up as a star player on his team. The other cast members are all entertaining as well, and the film features a host of effective cameo performances from the likes of William Shatner, David Hasselhoff, Jason Bateman, Chuck Norris, and Lance Armstrong who really makes a mark in his short, but pivotal and well written scene near the end of the film. But the real acting honors go to Rip Torn as a crazy, wheelchair-bound coach who uses some mighty unorthodox methods to whip the boys into shape. Torn is the undisputed comic force at the center of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Patches' Mends This Tired Formulamatic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, here is yet another sleazy PG-13 modern-day comedy that also has genuinely funny characters and scenes. For those of us who care it's a shame we have have to put up with the bad stuff if you want laughs out of about any comedy made in the last 30 years....and this is a prime example. By the way, this is an "R" all the way, if any concerned parents are reading this. You need a computer to add up all the sex jokes in here and the last 30 minutes are really, really stupid. Both of those are typical, too. Yet, most of my friends said this was hilarious and to check the film out. Prior to the typically-dumb ending are some very funny moments, mostly provided by Ben Stiller's over-the-top fitness guru, "White Goodman," a man who runs an ultra high-tech fitness center. Vince Vaughan plays the likable good guy small-gym owner who is in competition with Stiller, sort of like David against Goliath, the nerds against the jocks.....another formula that is so often used these days in comedies because it's always fun to see the little guy knock off the arrogant big jerk. Christine Taylor is the token young "hottie" that you also see in these kind of pictures: skinny, pretty, but not exactly the wholesome type.Rip Torn almost steals the show as "Patches O'Houlihan," the old man who helps coach the underdog volleyball team using some unorthodox methods. I laugh every time I think of him. In fact, "Patches" puts the added edge in this film to elevate it slightly above a "fair" rating.A lot of the humor in here is the improbableness of the whole story. Of course, it's an insult to anyone's intelligence but that's part of the charm and one does get a decent amount of laughs for an hour-and-half, so it's not all bad.</fullReview>

And I know I shouldn't be so pessimistic but after messes like The Internship, Fred Claus, Starsky &amp; Hutch, The Cell etc. I find It hard to have faith, which Is why Dodgeball is a surprise to me. It's just a hilarious movie through and through, Ben Stiller is hilarious, Rip Torn is perfect and yes, even Vaughn does well. Mind you that's not to say It doesn't have the problems that usually come with this brand of slapstick humour, but the genuine hilarity and brilliant characters more than make up for the faults that It does have. Dodgeball is a comedy laugh fest that I'd recommend to everyone, sure It's not The Big Lebowski but It's not The Love Guru either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts and ends well but there simply aren't enough laughs in between</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughan) is the owner of Average Joe's Gym which is located next to Globo Gym which is a much larger multi-chain gym owned by obnoxious and self-obsessed White Goodman (Ben Stiller). When LaFleur discovers that he has 30 days to pay off $50,000 he panics and his first attempt at raising some quick cash fails. One of the members of his gym sees an advert in a magazine advertising a Dodgeball competition and the prize for winning the competition is $50,000. Seeing this as being their only option to earn that amount of cash in the time frame required, LaFleur and his gym members form a team and get trained by former Dodgeball champion Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn). However, when Goodman gets wind that LaFleur is entering into the Dodgeball championship he assembles his own crack team and enters the competition himself to win the money and put an end to LaFleur's hopes of saving his gymnasium.The start of the film is quite impressive with Stiller's monologue being a parody of the sort of thing that you'd expect to see on Teleshopping or QVC. This aspect is funny as I myself don't take a lot of what these channels say seriously and I can see that this was the effect that was trying to be achieved here. The film then shifts focus on to Vaughan and it's clear to see that he's a pleasant enough person, but clearly has no idea how to run a business. The problems for me started when the film started to establish the actual plot....Once the plot kicks in then it becomes fairly obvious that writer and director Rawson Marshall Thurber has gone for very easy targets in order to generate laughs (most of the 'laughs' on offer here stem from seeing people being hit with a ball). OK you may argue that it's a film about Dodgeball and that's the point. Fair enough... I would expect some of the laughs to stem from this, but surely a better scripted film would have us laughing at the characters for what they say as well as what they do. I'm not a fan of comedies that seem to just rely on physical humour as I think it's lazy and sadly this really is a lazy film. The characters all fall into the usual clichés with Thurber deciding that one of them should act like a pirate all the time which was never funny and grew more annoying as time passed.The performances from Stiller and Vaughan weren't brilliant if we're honest; the former overacts most of the time and crosses the line between being funny and being annoying on almost every occasion. Vaughan fares slightly better as his performance feels more natural, but I still felt that he underplayed his role slightly meaning that I couldn't engage with him as a character quite as much as I should have done.The final sequence of events seems to thrown in every single cliché in the book and all of these events lead to a fairly safe and predictable ending - barring one surprise that LaFleur has for Goodman which I'll admit was pretty funny (I liked that as I do like the idea of the little people getting the better of the big people).All in all then Dodgeball is a fairly forgettable film with a fairly standard story which aims for cheap laughs far too often. For me, an underdog story will always have some merit, but the truth is that Dodgeball is too basic and just simply isn't funny enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004): Dir: Rawson Marshall Thurber / Cast: Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, Rip Torn, Hank Azaria: Amusing and somewhat unique sports comedy about life's curve balls. It stars Vince Vaughn who owns a fitness gym called Average Joe's that is threatened to be demolished into a parking lot by fitness instructor Ben Stiller of Globo- Gym. Vaughn must come up with $50, 000 and the method of payment becomes a dodgeball competition, which Globo-Gym also enters. Dodgeball becomes the deciding factor. Effective premise exploits fitness clubs and the image pressure to look good. There are the expected clichés such as the stereotype players made up of characters more or less from better movies. Directed with comic insight by Rawson Marshall Thurber with many great sight jokes. Vaughn fares well as Average Joe's front man out to win this competition and gain predicted respect. Stiller steals scenes with his outlandish behaviour that will ultimately lead to his downfall. Christine Taylor plays an attorney in what can only be described as a romantic prop. Rip Torn plays an aged dodgeball trainer whose sudden dismiss seems too cliché. Then there are a slew of effective actors in comic form playing the standard dimwits who play types over personalities. Theme suggests we dodge images thrown by fitness club egos. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball is a movie about a group of misfits that enter a tournament to save their gym. Timing is everything in a comedy, so the editing in this film was very important, and they nailed it. I liked Vince Vaughn's character, for once he's not the prick or douche in a movie. Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller have a great chemistry. Their stature difference is also very funny. The movie has many classic comedic moments like the car wash or their first match with the girl scouts or the suitcase with a million dollars. Justin Long has one of the funniest slapstick moments. One of my favorite ones is the wrench thrown at him. It gets me every time. Hank Azaria as young Patches was genius casting. Though casting Christine Taylor as the girl that played better than everyone else was a bit cliché. There were awesome cameo appearances by Jason Bateman, David Hasselhoff, Lance Armstrong, William Shatner, Chuck Norris, and many more!Overall, it was a very fun movie and a comedy classic. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is a fast-paced and very funny sports comedy that scores points for being centered around a sport that hasn't been the subject of too many movies.The movie stars Vince Vaughn playing one of his most likable characters, Peter LaFleur, the owner of a gym that is about to go under who puts together a rag-tag team of misfits to participate in a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas in order to win the large cash prize.Prior to this movie, I had no idea that dodgeball was a team sport that has Olympic-like rules, displayed here In a hilarious training film that Peter shows his team. This premise sets up a classic Revenge of the Nerds-esque confrontation between Peter's team and a team from a rival gym that wants to buy Peter out, owned by the arrogant White Goodman (Ben Stiller).A romantic triangle is also set up with the presence of an accountant who has been hired to help Peter, but White ends up trying to pursue her as well. Ironically, this role is played by Ben Stiller's real-life spouse, Christine Taylor, who first caught our eye as Marcia in the two Brady Bunch movies.Vaughn is actually the straight man here to Stiller, who is hysterically funny here, as are Stephen Root, Chris Williams, and Alan Tudyk as members of Peter's team, Missi Pyle as a beast from White's team, Gary Cole and Jason Bateman as color commentators at the tournament, and especially Rip Torn as Patches Houlihan, the alleged Dodgeball legend who agrees to help coach Peter's team.Funny dialogue, music video-paced direction and cast that aims to please help to make this comedy worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is a good film and has plenty of laughs - as long as you're a fan of Ben Stiller. Maybe you'll find love, laughs, and satisfaction in the film even if you're not a huge fan of Stiller, or even Vaughn. I mean, it's a good film and all, but it's not that funny. Some scenes, in particular, are funny, but only a decent four or five scenes. Maybe it's because of who's actually in the film - Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller. They're decent actors but i'm not big fans of them, and i never really have been big fans of them. Like, in all honesty, I only LOVE two or three Ben Stiller films, and i don't even like any of Vince Vaughn's films, really. If you're into Dodgeball, or Sport, for that matter, you may end up enjoying it too. Some rad moments, tip-top, lengthy-laughs, etc....but not much of it. It runs out ever-so-quick and rapidly disappoints and it becomes less funny, and less funny, and so on. Like all comedies, they're either funny or they're not - there's not really an in-between.I would rate the film a 6.5 out of 10, and ***/*****. If I had given it any more than an 8, it would've gained ****/******, and any higher than a 9.5, then it would've gained *****/***** - but oh well, you like what you like, I suppose. With mild laughs, some decent humour, and a "not too bad" cast, that's my review on the film Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. Not the worst comedy i have ever seen, but not the best.6.5/10. ***/*****P.S. my favourite in the film is probably Justin Long, and Vince and Ben are "ok" in it - i'm just not they're biggest fan.</fullReview>

I have no idea if there are any actual proper dodgeball leagues/competitions like in this film but I think there should be.As for this film, well the title says it all really, its an underdog story where the underdogs emerge victorious against all odds, the end. This film doesn't try to be anything other than what it clearly is, a complete dumbass of a film with in your face laugh out loud moments. Nothing here is clever or particularly original its just childish toilet humour utilising every trick in the book to get a giggle, no stone left unturned.The cast is a mixture of some Frat pack members and good character actors who all take the opportunity to let loose and just play it to the extreme. Good old Ben Stiller has to be the main attraction here as the narcissistic gym owner with a Vidal Sassoon hair style. I did also enjoy the satirical take on flashy modern day gyms filled with overly tanned models who merely like to look at themselves whilst getting fit.Stephen Root rehashes his 'Office Space' character to great effect, Alan Tudyk is a pirate, why? no idea but its amusing and Vince Vaughn simply plays the same regular Joe character he always does but he does it well doesn't he. There are many other funny performances here and quite a lot of cameos, too many to mention but none of them ever undermine the films comedy. Kinda funny seeing Lance Armstrong going on about his Tour De France victories though, ouch!The whole idea here is so basic its amazing they got it off the ground really. Chock full of cheap laughs, naughty visual gags, lots of crotch slapstick, cheesy lines, weight jokes and pratfalls, the film does feel very infantile at times but at others it can be very funny indeed. Its not really about the plot for all intense and purposes, you just watch to see Vaughn, Stiller and co act the fool and crack hokey lines. Its all about the hammy acting and rude visual tomfoolery but the bonus is its a good little feel good flick too.Yeah you know what will happen, you know the slimy slow witted Stiller will get his comeuppance in the end, there aren't any surprises here. You know exactly what you're paying for with this and you get it, like I say the film doesn't pretend to be anything else other than a stupid comedy much like 'Dumb and Dumber' or other frat pack flicks.Upped to the max deliberately with daft spoof-like moments for optimal belly laughs and finishing off with the all too common parody of the classic coming from behind victory. Its admittedly a bit of a one joke flick for sure but you don't need to look into it that much, its just an easy going fun entertaining hour and a half.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes, underdogs win.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty funny movie about a group of underdogs and misfits, who enter a Las Vegas dodge-ball tournament in order to save their local gym from a much larger Global Gym run by muscular and athletic men.At 92 minutes, this movie is pretty intriguing from start to finish, nothing too drawn out that would render the movie boring and unremarkable. The story goes straight to the point of pitting the average joes against the athletes, telling us that even if you do seem like an underdog or are outnumbered, your perseverance will triumph over your adversaries. There are some corny moments, but this movie isn't meant to be taken as a serious drama.Vince Vaughn does a pretty good job in his role leading the underdogs, and Ben Stiller does a devilish job in portraying the leader of the Global Gym, trying to buy off Vaugh's local and struggling gym. And, it is a real treat to see some cameos from big stars such as Chuck Norris, Gary Cole, William Shatner and David Hasselhoff.Overall, a pretty fun film good for some laughs and surprises.Grade B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can You Dodge A Wrench?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a storm of horrendous new comedies to come out at the beginning of the millennium (Aside from 2000's "Meet the Parents"), most were memorable yet others remained easily forgettable. Then came "Dodgeball" and suddenly I fell in love with a sport I barely knew existed, and a comedy where Ben Stiller's notoriously cartoonish nature just shined throughout."Dodgeball", is literally your "Average Joe" movie. Featuring dumb yet very lovable main "Joes", against the eccentric nut balls "Cobras" (A hilarious satire on people too much nowadays obsessed with physical perfection). But really if you came to find clever and wittiness in this movie, switch it off now because really if you're like everyone else you wanna see some DODGEBALL! Some of the hits in this movie will make you cry with laughter, and with teams like "Skillz that Killz", and the "Las Vegas P.D" etc. The film is very self aware and just has fun with itself.Vince Vaughn is a very likable character, and then you got Rip Torn who dishes out insults just as well as Seargent Hartmman did in "Full Metal Jacket" (1987). Add hilarious, yet pointless cameos from the likes of Lance Armstrong, William Shatner, David Hasselhoff and even CHUCK NORRIS no less. "Dodgeball" just gets funnier every time I see it.Final Verdict: Dodge, Duck, Dip, Dive and... Dodge. 7/10. It's a highly re-watchable kind of silly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Physical Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>White Goodman (Ben Stiller) is a raging douche and owner of Globo Gym. Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn) is a slob and the owner of Average Joe's Gymnasium. Peter LaFleur needs $50,000 or else he'll lose his gym to Goodman. LaFleur and the slackers at his gym figure on winning a dodgeball tournament. Goodman forms his own team to stop LaFleur.This is a stupid comedy. It's the good kind of stupid. We're allowed to laugh at the stupidity. That's a gift in the comedy world. Ben Stiller goes way out there as the amped up physical fitness guru. He has a good scene pawing his real life wife Christine Taylor. Even the dodgeball scenes are great. This is great slapsticks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clearly, Dodgeball isn't an exceptional movie, but it does its job and it's hard to not find it at least a bit entertaining.The plot isn't new or particularly original, except maybe for the sport of Dodgeball itself, but the script is coherent and the rhythm is sustained for an 1h30. The scenes follow on each other seamlessly in a very fluid way, making it almost impossible to get bored or to find that time passes slowly.The gags aren't hilarious but it is pretty fun overall, like the crazy character of Ben Stiller, who, by the way, does very well compared to a monotonous and relatively transparent Vince Vaughn.</fullReview>

But his rival gym is a super high-tech, fancy gym right across the corner.Peter must get 10,000 dollars to stop the evil owner of the other gym taking over his gym, and buying it. Peter, and his crew of people who go to his gym, see a dodge-ball tournament slot open for grabs. The prize: 10,000 dollars!Peter and his team barely make it through the first round, beating the Girl Scouts by disqualification because one of the Girl Scouts was using steroids. Ben Stiller is a great bad guy, and he proved it in this movie. It is very exciting to see Peter's team advance through the playoffs and eventually win the whole tournament.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same old stupid comedy. But it works, and somehow it's actually really interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really have much hope for this film. I saw an ordinary, stupid Vince Vaughn comedy featuring Ben Stiller. How wrong I was. It's not the best written of scripts, but oh well, it's funny. Ben Stiller is especially funny in the role of the "villain". I really enjoyed the story as well, I was really interested in the dodgeball, and by the end I was really rooting for the underdogs. The characters were surprisingly well developed. So it's a bit stupid at times, but who cares? It's enjoyable, I enjoyed it. It had me laughing for hours. I don't like Vince Vaughn, but he was watchable in this. If you're looking for a light-hearted comedy for just relaxing and not having to think about, this is the perfect choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really..that's it..VERY basic, no need for thought if you're watching this movie..seriously...You have a great cast of comedic actors portraying funny characters...some good physical comedy as well..Stephen Root's character of Gordon is great! Plus Steve the Pirate..Steve the Pirate? Yea..Steve the Pirate!! cmon..Just the name of that character alone rules!!(and the character himself is pretty damn good) Throw in Rip Torn as Patches O Hoolahan, and Hank Azaria playing a younger Patches (in a wonderful B&amp;W instructinoal video from the 1950's telling Timmy to take a break from that fine lead based paint to learn the wonderful game of Dodgeball) and you got soem serious laughs....and remember..this movie IS stupid and that's the whole point..go with it. To be honest, I resisted watching DODGEBALL because I didn't care much for recent comedies. I also avoided anything with Ben Stiller after several of his unfunny stinkbombs. He really needs to be more picky with his scripts because he is a genuinely funny guy (check out "The Ben Stiller Show" to see that). But Stiller is very funny in DODGEBALL, along with everyone else. I wish there had been more Stephen Root and Rip Torn. I also loved Hank Azaria's spoof of old educational films on the history of Dodgeball. After OLD SCHOOL and this movie, Vince Vaughn is becoming the Bill Murray of his generation. Most of this movie is predictable and derivative but it keeps the laughs coming. Funny, funny stuff. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vince Vaughn, Christine Taylor, Ben stiller, Rip Torn, and Justin Long star and deliver excellent performances in 'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story'.It's a witty and funny comedy that takes the actual sport and turns it into an hour and a half of crude humor and slapstick violence, some of it involving dodge ball.One of my favorite characters in this movie would have to be Ben Stiller's character.He may play a very mean and sex crazed man, but he does a hilarious job in this movie and should consider doing more sport comedies.If you like 'Wedding Crashers' with Vince Vaughn and 'Tropic Thunder' with Ben Stiller, then there is no doubt that you will love 'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story'.Just remember this:"If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A well meaning and good-hearted, but not fully competent, gym owner needs to save his gym from being taken over by an arrogant owner of the neighboring much larger gym. The result is a great underdog story and a hilarious spoof of the sports industry.There are plenty of slapstick gags, but the story is much more than just non-sequitor gags... notice that the film isn't called "Sports Movie." There is an actual story here and an actual comedic theme here. The humor is more than just exploitative sexual gags or simple vulgar humor. White Goodman is one of the most hilariously absurd and bizarre villains who by himself is a send up of many things - from the cutthroat businessman to to an arch-villain in an action movie. Then there is the game of Dodgeball; most people remember it from elementary school gym classes and seeing is as a nationwide spectacle is... well odd. However, it says a few interesting things about sports fanaticism.It's a fun, feel good movie done right. --- 8/10BsCDb Classification: PG -- crude content</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts off slow, but the laughs keep coming and coming consistently</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the movie Dodgeball I thought that the story was starting out kind of slow and that the dialog was kind of corny in the earlier scenes. But once the movie picked up and began to turn the story into what it was I began to laugh consistently throughout the entire movie. This movie really is a reliable movie that will keep the laughs flowing throughout the 90 minutes. Ben Stiller performs in a very hilarious form as the fitness powered mega gym owner White Goodman. I really recommend that anybody that is a fan of Ben Stiller and his goofy antics at times, then go rent or somehow see this now. You will not be let down.</fullReview>

Ben Stiller on the other hand as White Goodman is a very funny guy and he's hilarious. He's the "evil" character in the movie and is the enemy of Peter. The rest of Peter's teammates are funny too, especially Justin and Kate (SEX)this movie is truly a funny comedy to watch, the acting is great and its filled with a lot of slapstick comedy. Its funny how they get hit in the head with the wrenches, lol "If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball"The end of the movie is really surprising and unpredictable, it has a good flavor and excitement to the film, its a joke all the way around.One if the funniest comedies of that year!!!

		<fullReview>This movie has got more cameos than anything else I've see. Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn are at it again. Only this time the roles are reversed. In "Starsky &amp; Hutch" Vaughn was the villain and Stiller was the hero. In Dodgeball, it's the other way around. Vaughn plays Peter Lafleur, a gym owner who's down on his luck, and Stiller plays White Goodman a gym owner who rules his with an iron fist. Both gyms will compete in a dodgeball competition, when Average Joe's Gy gets a lesson in attitude, Global Gym puts the 'p" in Pain! With all the cameos in this movie, no wonders it's a riot. William Shatner, Chuck Norris giving Average Joe's the nod, David Hasselhoff speaking German. He has spent time there being a singing sensation there. It's funny when he ridiculed the entire team for losing the competition. And most of all, it goes to show what White really was in the beginning of his life: A big fat loser! Great movie, greater cast, this movie really will make a big winner out of you! 3 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004, Dir. Rawson Marshall Thurber)White Goodman is the owner and founder of Globo Gym, and would love nothing more than owning Average Joe's Gymnasium. Peter LaFleur doesn't want to lose his gym to Goodman, but couldn't find anyway to get $50,000 in time. Peter and his gang of gym buddies, think of ways to raise money, finally settling on winning a dodgeball tournament. White Goodman even creates his own dodgeball team to finish off Peter. Peter's team doesn't do too well, that is until legendary ADAA champ Patches O'Houlihan turns up ready to train them.Ben Stiller's comedies are very popular and if you've seen any of them, then you should know how successful they are, and this is no different. A wonderful script has been written with everyone can deliver with, including Rip Torn. Rip Torn is hilarious in this movie, and delivers most of the best lines. The physical comedy doesn't always work, but it often does in this film, with many objects hitting the different actors. There are some great cameos appearing, including David Hasslehoff and William Shatner, and just all out fun. Make sure you wait until the end of the credits because this is where one of the best scenes is."I'm gonna put on "The Thong Song", an we'll tear this place apart." - Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn), who owns a exercise gym for average men titled "Average Joe's". But Peter is losing his gym, because his business is failing and he owns money to the bank. When he meets Kate (Christine Taylor), who works in the bank. She tells Peter that he has to pay $50,000. His adversary White Goodman (Ben Stiller), who owns a gym across the street that is more successful but Goodman is actually dumber than he looks. But Goodman wants to buy La Fleur's failing business. When Peter's loyal friends and customers (Justin Long, Stephen Root, Joel Moore, Chris Williams and Alan Tudyk) wants to help Peter to save his gym. When one of his friends looks in the article in the magazine. He sees that they could save the gym, if they enter in the "Dodgeball" tournament at Las Vegas and a chance to win the grand prize. Which it's enough money to save the gym. But Goodman hears that La Fleur is in the tournament, he thinks he could beat La Fleur and his team. But La Fleur and his friends are not really good at this sport. One day, an old "Dodgeball" player Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn) thinks he could help La Fleur's team to get in shape. While Kate gets fired from her job, since Goodman lied about her not doing her job well and others. Since Goodman thinks she would go with Goodman after she lost her job. Now Kate is mad as hell and she decides to join La Fleur's team to get her revenge at Goodman. Now it's about, who's the best team wins the tournament and the grand prize.Written and Directed by Eawson Marshall Thurder (The Mysterious of Pittsburgh) made an amusing silly comedy with a game cast that seems to have a great time. This film was a surprise big hit, when it was release in the summer of 2004 and the reviews were surprisingly good as well. The premise might be familiar to "BASEketball" to some degree. But this movie plays it much more realistic and players to get to play more than the three lead players in "BASEketball". Which, of course both movies have different sports. Perphas the problem with the picture, it's the script. Which the humour at times never hits the bull's eye. But it has enough funny moments to be viewed as a fairly good entertainment comedy flick. Fans of Vaughn and Stiller will have a great time watching this movie. Look for amusing cameos and bit parts as well. Unrated Version is also available. Super 35. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Germans call it Schadenfreude', says the director/writer in a 'featurette', 'and they're right'.And that about sums it all up - especially if you make a note of the two strategically placed sprayed down curls of hair he always has on his forehead in exactly the same places.Extravagant manoeuvres like that are fine if you're eight years old, at the photographers, and your parents are grooming you. Remarks about Schadenfreude are also all right if you're totally lacking in polyglot chops, sophistication, and all-around intelligence quotient.In other words the movie's about pain - more specifically pain to the skull and nether regions. And that's funny, says the director/writer.Not that the movie is a total wash-out - after all, it's rated a '2' instead of a '1' - but it takes quite a lot to climb up that single rung of the ladder, not the least of which are VV and above all Christine Taylor who presents incredible eye candy.Hey! You might like it! Not to worry about subtleties like the fact they waste more time and money on scenography than on developing a truly humorous script - it's got a lot of gags and dumb one-liners and three second cameos from people you'd least expect to see and hope you wouldn't have to see.So renting this one won't be a total waste. Unless of course you have better things to do with your evening. Unless the local gym is fully booked and you can't get in a game of dodge ball of your own. Unless your goldfish are tired of playing charades with you. Unless you're a total loser.So go ahead - rent it! Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure, over the the top Stiller humor. Think of it as Jock-lander.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like Stiller, you'll love this. I've seen this several times on cable, and I'll watch it again if it is on. (I watch TV in the background while I work at my computer) To me it falls into the category of movies that you can watch piecemeal, pick it up anywhere and just enjoy it scene by scene. It's funny stuff. I don't understand how people try to compare this type of movie to a major drama, or mega action movie. This movie is neither, and those who judge this by those standards are probably the same people that drive a huge SUV by themselves everyday to work, or try to move a mattress by strapping it to the roof of a little compact car. This movie is a cheesy frat humor flic, and hits that target perfectly. By the way, it only cost 30 mil to make, but pulled in four times as much at the box office. That is a good return on investment. Yes, it may seem like an SNL skit, but a really good one, with very good execution, and perfect editing. It's got a good pace to it, and there's little sub-references here and there to keep it interesting. For example, there's a banner that says "Go Balls Deep" over the playing court. Another one is "Deus ex Machina", which is a reference to ancient dramas where something sweeps in and saves the day. In this movie it's a treasure chest full of cash. And of course, William Shatner as a game judge, doing a little 'Kirk' voice style in the locker room. And a cameo by Lance Armstrong giving Vince Vaughn the required "You can do it" speech, except instead, he give him a sarcastic 'I sure you won't regret this for the rest of your life" line. =================Minor Spoiler Below======================The characters are well cast, and the do the best with what they've got. It goes without saying, that there is a showdown, and the underdog saves the day, get the girls, and the bad guy is sent packing. (That's never happened before...I can't believe I just labeled that as a spoiler)I liked this movie, I laughed many times, I still laugh when I see it, or remember certain scenes.This is the a 'Zoolander' for Jocks. Much funnier than Fokkers, or Wedding crashers. Performance:7 Story:5 Comedy:8 Flow:8 (Flow is a combination editing and pace.)</fullReview>

Particularly the character of Ben; which is really funny especially the way he talk, and with all ego stuff going on. It is probably the best thing you not look for the good story here but to enjoy the funny man and his egomaniac team member with a funny dance.

Is it just me or is Jack Black copying Stiller a little bit in Nacho Libre with the hairstyle and the "stretchy pants"? Also why did the director of Nacho Libre make the film like Napeoleon Dynamite??? Unfortunately a couple of the characters in Dodgeball didn't do it justice (i.e Owen) so it has it's faults but as a little piece of fun to cheer you up on a Sunday afternoon it's absolutely faultless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great film with nearly everything in it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh man. This is one of my all time favorite movies I've ever seen. It's just the classic good guy vs bad guy plot line but with tons of humor and excellent acting. And with Rip Torn in it playing the great dodge ball legend, Patches O'Hoolihan, things get even funnier from dodging wrenches to dodging traffic and just dodging dodge balls. It's just one of the greatest movies I've seen in years. There's romance, drama, (maybe not much of either but they're still there!) comedy, action and maybe some more comedy. The acting is great in this movie and the fact that they have to raise $50,000 and they do an "all male" car wash to raise $50,000 on the same day where there is an all female car wash across the street is just plain hilarious. You can't really get a movie better than this one. It's just plain brilliant. Overall, this movie defiantly gets a 10/10. I can watch it over and over again (like I did 1 day I watched it 4 times in a row) and never get bored of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball is a good film Vince Vaughn puts on brilliant performance, as does Ben Stiller, who plays the evil White Goodman. Ben plays the part so well that he actually makes you want to hate him.The storyline is good and the actors play their parts well.This movie has an allstar cast, so you cant expect it to be bad! Can you? When it came out in the cinemas i didn't want to watch it, i thought it looked terrible. A bunch of grown men playing dodgeball for an hour and a half wasn't really going to get me laughing. But it was on Sky, one night and i thought, we'll so how it is .. and the next day i bought it on DVD. It is a great performance by all cast and it definitely is a must see movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is great! i think that this is better than almost every comedy iv seen possibly even better than the classic American pie!....OK to far there but its in my top 3 of the comedy films for sure! When i saw this first i laughed so much and i can watch it time and time again and still laugh that much at exactly the same thing the idea is quite weird but the characters are great they all are completely different than one another and each bring that little bit of brilliance to the film defiantly i think that EVERYONE in the world should have this in their collection. No matter what type of comedy you like you will like this, its got randomness, some clever bits, and some just ridiculously stupid parts. i think that if you are looking for a good laugh, that you can have over and over and over again you should rush out RIGHT NOW and buy this film. After watching it and putting it back on the shelf along side all your other DVDs it starts calling to you wanting to be watched over and over again and in the end you will start to wonder how you actually got along without this film in your life! seriously if you haven already closed this window do it NOW and go buy this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't my kind of movie so I might as well review it.Dodgeball is about 2 different GYMs one is an Average Joe GYM and the other is a much more cleaner and high tech GYM.When the Average Joe GYM is about to get bankrupt they must find a way to raise money to save the gym.They thought up of everything till they got it, Dodgeball. Not the old school game you'd find at school, but an actual sport in this movie.If they train hard they'll be able to win the prize money at the tournament. But when the rival GYM competes they're about to be in a world of hurt.This movie was OK. Had some funny parts, but can't say it's hilarious. Perhaps it's cause I'm not a huge Ben Stiller fan. But the Die hard Ben Stiller fans might like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Patchy effort lit up by show-stealing Rip Torn - 65%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always felt that this was one of those films that looked funny in the trailers but was actually a load of rubbish. Sport-based films tend to follow a very strict plot line and structure and this is their fatal flaw - an actual game where the underdogs win is genuinely exciting whereas the opposite is true if shown in movies. Increasingly, sport movies rely on comedy to help them through and "Dodgeball" is yet another of these tactless, in-yer-face comedies that are about as PC as Bernard Manning at a Women's Institute meeting. But sadly, it isn't as funny as it wants to be and is saved from total ignorance by a blistering performance from a veteran actor in a supporting role.Vince Vaughn plays Peter La Fleur, a regular everyman running a dilapidated gym called Average Joes opposite the corporate mega-structure of White Goodman's (Ben Stiller) Globo Gym. When Globo Gym threaten to take Average Joes over, Peter and his plucky group of losers find themselves entering a dodgeball competition in order to secure the prize money needed to keep them in business. But ego-maniacal fitness freak White is determined to get his way and enters his own team in the tournament. And given that both guys are chasing corporate lawyer Kate (Stiller's wife Christine Taylor), the clash is given an extra edge.Given that this is the basic plot, you can probably see the movie's ending from here. In fact, the film very nearly falls apart midway through as it just gets sillier and sillier the longer it goes on and it's not that clever to begin with. "Dodgeball" is, at times, an idiotic incoherent mess that does nothing new or remarkable at all, despite a few glimpses of genuine laughs. So why isn't it a total failure, I hear you cry. Well, it's all down to Rip Torn's hilarious appearance as wheelchair-bound veteran dodgeball coach Patches O'Houlihan who has all the best lines, the best put-downs ("You're about as useful as a c***-flavoured lollipop") and all the best scenes. He easily steals the film and when he's not there, the film really suffers although Stiller is also good as the obnoxious Goodman.With a tighter script and more consistent laughs, this could have been fabulous. But being kept firmly on the sports-plot railroad merely adds to the film's problems. It's daft and only sporadically funny, relying on Rip Torn to carry it through. Like "Anchorman", it can't maintain the humour right the way through and by the time the film ends, the whole thing feels cobbled together rather amateurishly. It's a great pity because Rip Torn is simply brilliant in "Dodgeball" and probably deserves his own show. But nothing else can keep up with him. Even if you're familiar with the "sport" of dodgeball (which we aren't in the UK), this film won't completely bowl you over. "Dodgeball" - you're out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was actually a pretty funny movie. I saw it on PPV (Pay Per View) and laughed so hard.Ben Stiller is really hilarious. I don't think I've laughed this hard at his movies since I saw Zoolander. What makes this movie good is the not the storyline, but the random parts in it. You'd never expect this or that coming, which makes you giggle at the stupidity of it.Anyways, I don't think I will own it on DVD, but it's still a very fun movie to watch.

		<fullReview>Dodgeball/2004/*** Main Stars:Vince VaughnBen Stiller Dodgeball was a good movie because White Goodman's (Ben Stiller's) comments made no sense but they were funny. In this movie White was supposed to be dumb. Another great thing about this movie was Patches O'Houlihan. I think that's how you spell it. Anyway, the reason why he was funny was because he was a strange character and he threw wrenches at people. The main point for this movie was for the Average Joes to beat the Cobras in the dodgeball tournament and win 50,000 dollars so they can pay for their gym. There are other details about this movie, but I wasn't told about this movie before I saw it so I want you to see it yourself. It was a great movie. I recommend it!

		<fullReview>Dodgeball is simply Ben Stiller operating at his peak. Sure he was good in There's something about Mary and Meet the Parents saw a good comic performance but Dodgeball is surely were his best role lies. The film tells the story of two competing gyms. One is run by a bunch of misfits and has serious financial difficulties. The other is a multi million outfit run by Stiller and his cronies. As the poor gym desperately trys to earn money the mega gym attempts to thwart it in every way until the poor gym come across the game of dodgeball. A championship is to be held this year and if the gym win they will have enough to continue their business. However the mega gym also enters in an attempt to put an end to their business once and for all. The cast are all awesome. Vince Vaughn is the likable hero and in Justin Long pain has never been so funny. Ben Stiller as I mentioned above is the star performance however and in many respects the man carries the movie. The film has good pacing even if certain comical scenes and jokes are stretched at times, plus the Dodgeball sequences themselves are very entertaining. The jokes do come thick and fast and 90% of them work perfectly. The other 10% do stick out a bit though. Some of these jokes also suffer from to much bad taste , such as the pizza down the pants sequence. All in all Dogeball is a great film for laughs and is certainly the funniest film 2004 offered us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Australia, we called it poison ball in primary school, and I loved it. Well, in the US it's called Dodgeball, it's growing in popularity and it's now the backdrop for another comedy "Brat Pack" feature.Vince Vaughan (Swingers) is Peter La Fleur, owner of cash-strapped Average Joe's gym ? a gym for "average Joes". But the body-beautiful owner of Globo Gym, White Goodman (Ben Stiller) is moving in for a takeover. Until Peter and his buddies form a rag-tag team to compete at the Las Vegas Dodgeball championships for a $50,000 prize.For most of its 92 minutes, Dodgeball is a hilarious homage cum parody of underdog sporting films. It's the first feature from writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber, who gave us Terry Tate, Office Linebacker.There's some hilarious supporting characters ? including Alan Tudyk (I Robot) as a pirate, and Missi Pyle as a scary Romanian Dodgeball champion. The comedy is rapid-fire and sometimes shocking ? "if you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball", says coach Rip Torn to the team. And there are some great cameos, including David Hasselhoff as an irate German coach.Unfortunately, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story does "drop the ball" towards the end and get just too corny for its own good. The scene where Vaughan is motivated by cycling star and cancer survivor Lance Armstrong was very schmaltzy, perhaps because its status as parody was unclear. Yet, if you're looking for a film where laughter will be torn from you, submit to Dodgeball. The first half of the film is worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just from picking the cover of this movie up you can see that this is going to be great, a totally original concept and two of comedy's best actors. This movie was designed for these guys, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrel would not have had the same effect! I feel a real character relation to Vaughn in this movie, an average guy trying to pay his bills, average confident lad who likes his own time but has plenty of friends, he really sums up the worlds average guy in this movie. His supporting cast in 'average joes' offer something for everyone also, its great they vary in age, appealing to all generations to watch rather than just teens. Stiller is great in showing that when people make a big change like his character does, it is not necessarily a good thing and can turn you into a bad person, like for instance someone might become famous and turn into a complete jerk and think they are gods gift, but evil always gets its come uppance in the end......Overall a great movie and I would say it is one of comedy's must see's!</fullReview>

This film is also good as it explains all of the rules as I had never heard of Dodgeball as a sport before.The reason I didn't give it 10/10 is because the plot was quite predictable and right from the beginning you could tell the rest of the film was going to happen.Overall, a very funny film!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben Stiller movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some things we've (I) got to admit and others I've got to accept. I've got to admit that Ben Stiller keeps reinventing himself, always succeeding; but someone needs to tell him he's still giving us the same thing. He might change the tone of voice and the hair, but he still invites Hank Azaria to do the same stupid accents (no disrespect with Azaria), if you know what I mean.I've got to accept that Rawson Marshall Thurber's first full-length feature has its great moments. I've got to accept that although Christine Taylor keeps working with her husband, she is a talented and charming actress, not mentioning a strangely beautiful woman. And last I've got to accept that Ben Stiller is not the only reason to watch a Ben Stiller movie.In "Duplex" other reason to watch his movie was one of the loves of my life, Drew Barrymore; in "Along Came Polly" it was the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman: in "Dodgeball" it's Vince Vaughn. Arguably the most natural comedic actor of his generation (and also a good dramatic performer if you want to watch), he leaves Stiller painted in the wall. And this is not a comparison; I just wanted to make clear that Vaughn never seems to be making any effort.Effortless is as much as this film accomplishes too, due to the fact that it has the most predictable script I've witnessed in a long time (well? "Honey"?). In addition, the writer/director relies on his cast presence to make us laugh, without realizing his lines are funny but not the way he places them in his picture. We know we could laugh, but it just doesn't come out.What surely gave Thurber the confidence in his project was his main factor: the sport. Yes, "dodgeball" or that kind of game we were watching Rip Torn training the characters. The man knew that with this, he would keep the audience until the end, no matter what; this is something everyone was going to stay tuned for. It was widely original, and that's the reward.Maybe it is just about bringing the audience in, like Robert Rodriguez did, when he gave two short appearances to a second-billed Salma Hayek. My point is that Hollywood these days is extremely dependable, and there's a scene in the credits that talks about it; stay so you can watch it.So what I mean is that the stars move a lot inside a movie, and I just wanna know what Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn's projects are. The second one will make a romantic comedy with Jennifer Anniston, and the first one will do? "Madagascar 2" or something?? Anyway, you have to choose because they're both big stars and I'm not sure they'll be pairing up for you; again. I'd go see Vaughn; I bet he'll surprise me? The underdog story, always seems to be true, but somehow this is "the true" underdog story. I'm just joking because it is the same resolution with an always interesting road. So I met the characters, the situations, the tournament transmitted by a once Brady (it's sad) and the final and most fundamental decision taken by?Chuck Norris (yes, Norris) leading to two different opinions: "Thank you, Chuck Norris""F***ing Chuck Norris!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dodgeball Grabs Its Nuts By The Balls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller's best roles have been the few that have almost burst his carotid artery through certifiably asinine overacting. (To date, that would only count *Mystery Men*, *Zoolander*, and cameos in *Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy* and *The Cable Guy* - add *Dodgeball* to that short list.) His early 90s comedy series, *The Ben Stiller Show*, though a fine showcase for his frenetic talents, was so underrated and misunderstood that it was actually cancelled first time outa the gate, only to be reinstated on Comedy Central at varying intervals. Unfortunately, in his gradual assimilation into feature film pap, his chunky monkey breadwinner is his Woody Allen Lite nebbish (*Your Friends and Neighbors, Along Came Polly, Meet The Parents, et al*; hell! - he even turned David Starsky into a neb!).*Dodgeball* is Stiller's welcome return to artery-busting form, as the corporate gym owner, White Goodman - entrepreneurial, avaricious, bombastic Bad Guy to Vince Vaughn's somnolent Pete La Fleur, who mismanages his own failing gym across the way. White has designs on merging Pete's fringe-dweller gym with his own commercial monster conglomerate and will go to any sweat-tainted lengths to corporately consume it.In this film fantasy where an independent, successful, sexy woman (Christine Taylor, Stiller's real-life wife, playing Kate the auditor, whom everybody wants to examine "under the counter"), can fall for a shiftless itinerant like Pete La Fleur, it is no stretch to discover that the only way La Fleur can raise money to save his gym is to enter a Dodgeball tournament with a cadre of his willing (though untrained) gym patrons. Due to the movie taking itself about as seriously as the inflated bulge in White Goodman's jockstrap, we go along for the ride.Hank Azaria and Rip Torn camp it up as young and old versions of legendary Dodgeballer, Patches O'Houlihan, whose methods of training La Fleur's dysfunctional, ubergeek squad would give any man pause for scrotal reflection.The tournament itself action-packs the last half hour of film, and climaxes with Pete and White facing off (- how'd you guess? You must be psychic!). During the game-play, director and writer, Rawson Marshall Thurber cannily transfers the volley of humor, which rested upon the main cast ? who has now taken to the Dodgeball court ? to the broadcast commentators, Cotton McKnight and Pepper Brooks (Gary Cole and Jason Bateman, hamming their roles with a vengeance and a copy of the Insensate Drivel Handbook).Any movie artful enough to tweak audiences into investing their alliance in a misfit dodgeball team has more going for it than just hot chicks and scrotum jokes. Who outside of the sixth grade even knew this sport still existed in mankind's repertoire? Anxiety churns my blood, for the internet can so easily resolve this mystery, yet I dare not make the connection, for I fear I will either discover a horror so demeaning that it will debase my already staggering lack of faith in humanity's intelligence quotient, or ? L. Ron Hubbard have mercy! - I may suddenly embrace the urge to squoze my scrote into a purple unitard and take one on the face for the team ? and if that image doesn't get your carotid artery throbbing, it's already burst?(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball is a funny movie. It's not the funniest movie ever, but it's not the least funniest movie ever. It's filled with puns and jokes that will make you laugh, even if most of them are pretty simple. The downside was all the sick-minded humor. They have hundreds of references to body parts. Oh well. It's still fairly funny. I mean, who could forget the part: "Okay. Goodbye crazy guy." "I ain't crazy, and I ain't a guy." And then, there is the part "Let me introduce you to my team: Blade, Razor.....Blazer," which is a bit funny. Yet, the film is a bit gross, and gets old pretty quickly.6/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Dodgeball last night, and I have to say - it's not that good. I'm not a big Ben Stiller fan to start with, and he thoroughly overplays his part in this movie.There's nothing special in the plot either. Vince Vaughn plays the owner of Average Joe's - a slacker hangout/"gym" where a bunch of misfits (of course) hang out. Stiller is White Goodman, owner of Globo Gym, the big corporate gym across the street that wants to tear down Joe's to make it a parking lot. The movie borrows a lot from others in it's genre, most notably Kingpin and UHF. Fate lands them in a dodgeball tournament, with the top prize being enough money to buy Average Joe's out of default.I could tell you how it ends, but it's not like you can't guess. Most of the performances are mailed in - actors like Stephen Root and Gary Cole are wasted on one liners and stupid facial expressions. This movie is OK, but I won't be buying the DVD any time soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this first came out, I had no intention of seeing it. I am not a big fan of Ben Stiller, nor Vince Vaughn and the marketing of the film turned me off more. But when this recently appeared on cable, I came in the middle of the unrated version -- and had to see it from the beginning.This is a silly, fun film. Ben Stiller was actually cast well, and Vince Vaughn had the straightest deadpan character with the funniest lines...sure most of the humor is sophomoric, sure the plot is formulmatic...but it worked.I loved this film because...I hated Dodgeball as a kid. This really blew up all of those childhood memories and made them hilarious. That's why I enjoyed this film. Then..there were the cameos and surprises that really were unexpected and fun.This is not a cerebral film...but when you get in the mood for silly fun, Dodgeball is at the top of the heap.</fullReview>

Peter's gym is, however, is going under and being bought there next door neighbor, Global Gym. In charge of Global Gym is health freak White Goodman (Ben Stiller) who has sought only to buy Average Gym. Along with Peter are his good friends Gordon, Owen, Justin, Dwight, and Steve the Pirate who are all determined to save the gym.Seeing it as there last option, they enter a dodge ball tournament in Las Vegas. The dodge ball scenes are all hilarious from Pack 417 to the Break Dancing Dodgeball team I was crying it was so funny. Vince Vaughn is funny and is able to bring the sense of a man being down on his luck while being funny at the same time. However, Ben Stiller takes the movie into the hilarious film it is. Being so determined to one-up Peter, Ben Stiller makes no sense in what he says and what he does, I fell out of my seat laughing watching the bar scene. Rip Torn, as there coach is probably the second best only to Stiller. With such great scenes as the wrench dodging scene, you'll find it impossible not to laugh.Christine Taylor is also in the film as the only female dodge ball player on Average Joe's. She isn't exactly funny but she does bring some quality acting. What was so surprising to me, though, was the way the writer was able to write so much simple comedy and make it absolutely hilarious. The cameos are over the top with appearances by Lance Armstrong, Chuck Norris, David Hasselhof, and William Shatner and make the movie even more silly. But no matter how silly, how stupid it got it continued to be funny and passed a good hour and a half.Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.

		<fullReview>This comedy featuring two of the best of the frat-pack... is a solid movie. Dodgeball achieves what it sets out to do, has some very funny jokes and scenes. There are some oddball comedy moments that are truly hilarious. Vince Vaughn is good in the lead role, pretty convincing as a local gym owner who is somehow faced with a dodgeball tournament to save his gym from becoming part of a franchise of gyms owned by White Goodman (Stiller). Stiller has some hilarious moments, but his acting in general is not the best, its a bit similar to a role i saw him in, in Zoolander. I liked Christine Taylor and Rip Torn were funny as heck and so was Stephen Root (Office Space). The films cast is great, Hank Azaria is hilarious in his cameo like role. The film isn't Oscar material, obviously, but its better than your average comedy these days. It was quite enjoyable. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes, a dumb, funny movie just totally hits the spot. And that's the case with this movie. Dodgeball is freakin' funny, but don't expect Noel Coward. To me, the funniest bit is watching Justin Long taking a wrench to the face, so that should tell you the kind of movie this is.But you have to be clever when you make a dumb movie, and this movie is full of cleverness. Gary Cole and Jason Bateman as the sports announcers were amazing; I never knew Gary Cole was so funny. And Justin Long has a real future doing physical comedy. As they say in the commentary, he is "a study in ham and cheese." MAN he's funny.Ben Stiller is awesome as White Goodman, the cartoonish bad guy. Some of his best humor comes from his screen time shared with Jamal Duff, who plays "Me'Shell," White's 'fitness concigliere.' And Vince Vaughn sort of plays a standard Vince Vaughn role, but he's still great. Stephen Root adds another classic character role to his impressive repertoire. And Alan Tudyk as Steve the Pirate totally rocks! When I heard that he was in this movie playing a guy who thinks that he's a pirate, I thought, "WOW, this movie must be stupid." You have to see it to get it. If you don't mind broad physical comedy and references to obscure, gross sex acts, then this movie is great for a laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great humour, great soundtrack, great actors....the whole set.Look, it's predictable in that you can guess the outcome, but the movie is very funny and each actor gives a little differently.I'll admit, when I saw this in the cinema, my wife and I did most of the laughing, so it probably isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it really appealed to us - perhaps we are just vulgarians. :) Anyway, get the DVD cos the extras are the icing on the cake - it's nice to see when they've gone to a little trouble for the consumer.Good to see "The Hoff" in a cameo too, he truly is a legend of...umm...something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie at the cinema, and thought it was hilarious. Being a film reviewer, I got free admission, but would have gladly paid the full fare with the advantage of hindsight. This movie was nonstop fun. Stiller is at his usual brilliant best, and Vaughn plays the laid back gym owner to perfection. Chuck Norris plays a small yet decisive cameo role. I cannot possibly fault this movie, other than to say the pirate character could have been better. A great comedy when you are not in the mood for concentrating to hard. Easy to watch, and completely enjoyable.Stiller plays the stereotypical American health freak brilliantly, and Rip Torn is ever so funny as the ex-champion dodgeballer, Patches Ohoolighan. It is amazing that it is still funny to see a grown man fall to his knees after being barraded by numerous balls. Torn's techniques as coach are tremendous. He says at one point "If you can dodge a wrench,you can dodge a ball!" And then goes on to hurl large amounts of various tools at an innocent team member. Classic comedy at its finest.MAssive. Big up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a totally ridicules and stupid movie this was...I LOVE IT! This movie is like the biggest load of nonsense you'll ever see. I mean an entire movie focused on the game dodgeball? What movie has a more ridicules concept than that? Fans of silly humor, this is a must see for you! The movie has several strong aspects. One and maybe the biggest are the characters. They are all extremely stereotyped and over-the-top but my goss I love them. Ben Stiller is especially hilarious as the 'villain' with his crazy hair and silly outfits.The dodgeball games are definitely the highlights of the movie. I don't really care much about what happens in the movie outside of the dodgeball games to be frank. Nothing beats seeing some silly characters like members of team kamikaze and team blitzkrieg, who are coached by David Hasselhoff, being hit hard in the face or a more sensitive body location, by some balls.The humor is totally wrong but you can't help loving it. The movie is filled with some truly hilarious moments and some well written dialog.If you enjoy silly humor, this is simply a must see!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laugh out loud mindless fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller manages to take silly humor and keep it funny. Playing a stereotypical "bad guy" with just a little bit of inadequacy coming in. Sure he's in shape now, but inside he's still the same fat guy. But Stiller keeps it fresh instead of cliché', or maybe he just makes the cliché' hilarious. The rest of the cast very good, it takes a while to figure out, where do I know ? them from. The storyline is there to showcase the humor, Vince Vaughan is the "no goal" (easier to attain that way) good guy. With his wacky crew of misfits, Alan Tudyk shines as the pirate. And every time Jason Bateman's Pepper opened his mouth, I was laughing. David Hasselhoff and William Shatner have very tongue in cheek cameos. And Chuck Norris was funny without saying a word. Best viewed with a group of friends with a twisted sense of humor!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting and Sharp Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dodgeball is a riveting and sharp comedy about a sport we all stopped taking seriously after our last elementary school gym class.Vince Vaughn plays Peter LaFluer, owner of a rundown gym called Average Joe's. His membership total consists of just five, but nevertheless, the personable LaFluer is happy to be of service to his clients, even if they are all pathetically out of shape and a little off the norm. His gym is in financial trouble, however, and LaFluer is notified at the start of the film that he has thirty days to pay off its loan or it will be shut down. LaFluer's gym will be bought out by Globo, owned by the villainous White Goodman. Stiller pulls out the stops as Goodman, taking every opportunity to make himself dislike-able so that his demise at the film's end will be all the more sweeter.In need of a desperate solution, LaFluer and his clients sit down in his office and brainstorm. The solution comes from Gordon (Root) who reads in his magazine Obscure Sports Quarterly about an upcoming dodgeball tournament in which they could win the required money, so the ragtag bunch sets out to learn the sport and win the tournament. Their biggest obstacle is that in order to ensure Average Joe's shutdown, Goodman fields a team of bodybuilders to win the tournament and deny LaFluer the money, setting the stage for a David vs Goliath match up in the upcoming tournament.If there's one thing, aside from the satire, that there is to love about this movie, it's the quirky group of guys who comprise LaFluer's team. With the exception of Dwight (Williams), whose quirkiest attribute is his hatred of his previous job at the airport, the group is a very creative assemblage of underdogs. Vaughn plays the straight man, next to Stiller, his own team, and pretty much everyone else in the movie. You'd think that the love interest Christine Taylor as the lawyer, initially hired by Goodman to shut down Average Joe's but ends up joining the team out of disgust for the villain, but she turns out to have her own weird attributes.In a sense, Dodgeball is sort of a quasi-sports film because it centers around a sport that doesn't actually exist in terms of a spectator base, and uses that to poke fun at some of the sillier aspects of our present-day athletic culture. Be warned, this film is merciless, attacking everything from bodybuilders to ESPN to team uniforms. I particularly found it hilarious that the tournament was broadcast on ESPN 8, which probably is only a couple years away at this rate, and that one of the sports commentators (Arrested Development's Jason Bateman) knew absolutely nothing of what he was talking about.The movie gets caught up in all the satire, however, and towards the end drifts off into an absurd ending that really left a bad taste in my mouth. The ending threw so much of reality out the window, that it felt like a Mel Brooks film, which is a shame because up until the last couple minutes, the film did a terrific job at cracking out hilarious jokes within the context of a story. Looking back, though, the first couple of hours more than make up for the last couple of minutes, and I would have rather the movie aimed high and missed a couple notes, rather than being safe and not being as funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller's movies getting worse after he became that popular. He has a funny face, and it is an expected thing, all producers are trying to make some money on it. Actually Vince did a wonderful Job in here too, I personally laughed him a lot..Anyway, movie is good, but it is not that funny, compared to; There is something about Mary, Zoolander, Meet the parents, Came Along Polly, Stusky and Hutch.. First movie characters are so artificial, that you can't feel the humor. Fun stuff has been exaggerated a Little. And that takes the "real" fun-humor away. Zoolander has a similar situation but it has a much more clever story.I can barely say that, this movie has been built on two best jokes (which everyone laughed their a**es off) at the movies Meet the Fockers (the scene Ben hits the ball on his fiancée's sister in pool) and Starsky&amp;Hutch (the Funny "Do It" character when Ben was undercover) So I think they came up with a character idea which should look alike at Stursky&amp;Hutch (different voice, big ego etc.) and also thought that "God, everyone laughs when we nail someone with a ball, so lets play dodge ball".....Thus, movie is ready to served.Not bad, don't expect much, have fun...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grab life by the dodgeball!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dodgeball is one of the most stupid, retarded movies I ever saw, and I absolutely loved it. The jokes in this movie are so bad, they're actually good. The story is standard good versus evil. The good guys are the underdogs from Average Joe's Gym, the bad guys are the muscular show offs from Globo Gym. And of course there's the love interest in the middle of the two protagonists: Christine Taylor (aka ms. Stiller). From there on it's all about slap stick and absurd dialogues. Try picturing a bunch of losers getting hit by wrenches thrown by a lunatic in a weelchair. Picture Ben Stiller as a wacky mustached work out guy getting aroused by putting a slice of pizza in his pants. This is what Dodgeball has to offer. One of the sparkling high lights of this movie is Stillers overacting in contrast with Vince Vaughns easy going 'play'. You're in for some stupid dialogues, man o man. If you want sophisticated humour in the likes of Woody Allen, than you rang the wrong door bell mister. But if you're actually smart enough to see through this thick layer of stupidness, and you can picture with how much irony this pic was made by Stiller and company, then you'll be a Dodgballer for life! I dare you: watch this movie without being cracked up. If you pull it off, I'll buy you dinner. If you can't: surrender yourself to the ball for it is your god.</fullReview>

With the help of an aging legend (Torn), they must enter a national dodgeball competition and lock horns with a detestable fitness egomaniac (Stiller) and his team of superior athletes. By the numbers, to be sure, in fact you'll probably swear you've seen it before, but it's well-cast with some good gags that make for more laugh-out loud moments than you'd expect.

		<shortDescription>Ben Stiller steals the show, cuts loose and shows what a great comedy actor he is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller has made a successful film career from being a great comedy character actor. With films like "Zoolander" and "Starsky and Hutch" Stiller has formed memorably hilarious characters people will still be quoting in years to come. His character in Dodgeball is no different but not only does Stiller steal the limelight of this picture but in my opinion pulls off one of, if not the best comic performance of his career Stiller plays "White Goodman" an egotistical fitness maniac bent on domination of the complete health market. He is determined to destroy another local gym Average Joes by what ever means he can, and when he hears the Average Joe staff are entering a dodge-ball tournament to pay off their increasing debts Goodman cannot refuse heating up the competition by signing his own team up in direct competition. Goodman is portrayed as the pinnacle of self improvement in both gaining the "perfect body" from being a seriously obese man and acquiring a fortune from his self build corporation Globo-gym. Stiller makes this character so over the top in his appearance from sporting a supremely blow-dried mullet and Fu Manchu moustache to wearing garish leather outfits not seen since the late 70's. What makes Goodman such a superb parody of all fitness gurus everywhere is Stiller's never failing ability to bring embarrassing laughs and cringes from the audience and make a complete fool of himself at the same time. In one memorable scene in this film he tries to "woo" bank officer Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor) by pumping up his crutch with an air pump and delivering supposedly witty lines (including some very bad punning on the word shackles) that was so cringe worthy and embarrassing it almost made me turn from watching it. I'm glad I didn't because every line Stiller delivers is perfectly timed and executed for its full comic value. Dodgeball without Stiller would have scored a very low mark on my rating as to be brutally honest as much as I love this film the story line is extremely corny. The Average Joes gym has serious debts and needs to pay them off before they lose the land the gym is built on. It so happens there is a Dodgeball tournament that will pay the winner the exact amount of money they needed to raise to save the gym. Of course with the addition of the Globo-gym team it was obvious from the start who was going to win the tournament and who the final would be contested between this predictability made the film seriously slow down in pace in the final third which is a little disappointing. The only thing else to really stand out from this film was the character of Patches O'Houlihan played by Rip Torn a wheelchair bound ex-dodge-ball all star who coaches the Average Joe's team with such methods and advice as "if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball" and "your playing like a bunch of retards trying to hump a door knob". However all said about the cheesy storyline, if you want a film where Ben Stiller steals the show, cuts loose and shows what a great comedy actor he is Dodgeball is definitely for you.</fullReview>

Even director Thurber wished this but they tried it on a test audience and they didn't conform to it so it was scrapped Anyway Ben Stiller saves this film from being a total disaster he was so funny and i have to say his best performance since ZOOLANDER!! and i have to say i thought the end quote by Christine Taylor was funny and just totally random "no...im bisexual" just out of the blue and completely random overall 7/10 star: BEN STILLER!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of misfits challenge the neighboring mega-gym to a dodgeball tournament in order to save their own.A very funny comedy made even more engaging by the performances of the cast. I'm not a big fan of stupid comedies, but this one had me laughing. Ben Stiller is a riot in a part he has done before, the egotistical exercise maniac who is unbelievably full of himself. Vince Vaughn is wonderfully deadpan as the owner of the run-down gym that needs saving. Christine Taylor is good as the banker who is the unwilling object of Stiller's affection; her scenes of disgust when acting opposite him are hilarious. But, the highlight comes when Justin Long's character is subjected to dodgeball torture by Rip Torn's oddball trainer. It's all hilarious from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sports movies are always the same. So much so that they are basically the same movie watched over and over again. Underdog team needs to beat the big guys so they can save the bar/house/club etc. Dodgeball is referred to as A True Underdog Story. And so it is. It is a clichéd, over-the-top, exaggerated version of the same sporting movies that have been made every year for the past half-century. Peter Le Fleur (Vince Vaughn) and his regulars at his gym, Average Joe's take on the professional, elite team of rival White Goodman and his own gym in the standard sporting movie plot. However, the game they choose to play is dodgeball, perennial favourite of American PE teachers and my PE teacher in High School. The object of the game at the school level is for big, sporty kids to pelt unpopular geeks like myself with balls over and over again. The professional dodgeball circuit portrayed in the film is sleek, sophisticated and apparently quite popular. Of course, it's all a big joke. Peter's team are the usual bunch of misfits. There's the geeky former cheerleader Justin, sad, mild Gordon and The Dread Pirate Steve. He is joined by Kate Veatch, the banker hired by Goodman to acquire Peter's gym. They are all coached by former Dodgeball champion Patches O'Houlihan, now a wheelchair bound, sex-obsessed loony who trains them by throwing spanners at them. The movie is very silly, but it's still amusing. There are a number of good sight gags of the slapstick variety, and there are some good one-liners, particularly from Stiller and Vaughn. Stiller plays the bad guy in this film, but it's a similar character to that from Zoolander; dumb, shallow and self-centred. Stiller plays the egomaniac so well I can't help but wonder if there's an element of reality in his portrayal. The movie is filled with odd characters who do and say odd things, which is OK because I respond well to that kind of humour. Dodgeball is not a great film. It's possibly not even a good film. But it is an amusing film. That's really all one can ask from a comedy. Anti-sport movies are becoming more common these days; the Australian film Crackerjack springs to mind, which is basically the same old story but concerning lawn bowls. Dodgeball works as a satire, or a spoof, of these movies but mostly it works as a way of raising a smile, even if the jokes are dumb and the plot non-existent. Enjoy it; genuinely funny films are rare. Good-o-meter rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were parts of this movie where I was literally in pain laughing so hard, namely the training sequence in the middle. What spoiled this movie for me was its shameless crude humor. I've seen movies with tasteless humor before (almost every Stiller flick), but this was especially disappointing because the movie would have been so uproariously funny without it! The last scene especially turned me off, leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth for the movie. If this happens to you, though, I would suggest watching the extra features which contain extra footage of the skinny kid getting pelted with dodge-balls. I was crying I laughed so hard.</fullReview>

The film has very good programming, and also shows glimpses maybe of a secondcoming? Maybe.Good reasons why to see this film. Ben Stiller and Christine Taylor are brilliant together, Vince Vaughn really gave a solid performance, the suspense is great, and also some of the effects they used are pretty good.Good reasons why NOT to see this film. Rip Torn looks like a complete moron as the as Coach Patches, the ending is very predictable, and also, Some parts are just well overdone, taking the beginning for example, it takes a good 5 minutes just to get his point across already! But, if you want to see this movie, it's something that you will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I've never been one for films that deal with sports but this film has really changed my view on how super they can be. I think one of the best things in this film is the comedy value, not only does it mix comedy with seriousness of the film but it also has symbolism of "Anything is possible, even if the odds are against you" and I think films that symbolise things of great importance to us really convey a spectacular performance. The whole cast was very well chosen and Ben Stiller really takes his part well when he becomes what he used to become at the end, a lazy slob.Anyway, the title may seem boring but the film is exquisite, it's a film that might not spark your interest into watching it but you will succumb to the temptation of watching it for the first time or again as there is always something that you want answered or if you just want to listen to a particular line. This is one of those films that you must see, granted, that can be said for a lot of films though this really is a film you have to see to be able to come to a judgement.</fullReview>

Peter has outstanding debts to pay and need to repay $50,000 in 30 days.They willingly enter a dodgeball competition to win the prize money of $50,0000. They do really well and get to the finals to face Globo..Whites gym.It's a decent enough film with enough laughs to keep you entertained. I feel Vince Vaughn is just amazing.

		<fullReview>SPOILERS Every year there are specific situations in Hollywood films which smack of unoriginality. Whether the underdog coming out on top, the romantic aspect or the geek hero turning good in the end, Hollywood grabs these stories by the horns and exploits them beyond a joke. So it's no surprise that major spoofs arrive on the scene. "Dodgeball", like other films over the last ten years has exploited the catalogue to provide a hilarious little film.Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) runs Average Joes Gym. A nice guy by all standards, La Fleur spends his time with a bunch of regular losers who work out at his gym. All things look set to change however when White Goodman (Ben Stiller), owner of a major corporate gym, threatens to buy the gym unless La Fleur can earn $50,000. Now La Fleur, his friends and lawyer Kate (Christine Taylor) will work together to try to become a successful team in one of the most dangerous sports of all. Yes, they're going to play Dodgeball.The beautiful thing about "Dodgeball" is just how daft it really can be. With some superb little jokes, it ridicules and pokes fun at every Hollywood situation in the book.With brilliant performances by Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, the film might never be a world best, but it remains hilarious and entertaining.It's hard to know what more to say about "Dodgeball" really. It's a daft, funny, little film with superb casting and some magical little moments. It ridicules Hollywood and it does it with style. Well worth a watch, but it's perhaps better if you appreciate how predictable Hollywood can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a pretty funny comedy that benefits from a great cast!. It had a lot of laughs lots of likable characters, and an amusing finale, predictable but amusing. It never takes itself seriously, and Stiller is excellent, plus the film had a lot of cool cameo's. Some of the jokes were a miss, but most of them were pretty funny, and it's good natured. It's predictable at times, but this mostly a pretty funny time that made me laugh quite a bit. The Directing is pretty good. Rawson Marshall Thurber, does a pretty good job here with keeping the film at a good pace, good lighting, great use of colors, and overall he did a solid job!. The Acting is very good!. Vince Vaughn does a great job here, he is likable, a good leader, and goo in the acting department, he is a very Versatile Actor and was perfect for this part!. Ben Stiller is HILARIOUS as always, and was great here, he could be an ass at times, but he was likable, and cracked me up. Christine Taylor is GORGEOUS!, and does very well, and had decent chemistry with Vaughn, and it's funny that her and Stiller are married in Real life!. Rip Torn does a very good job here, as the coach i liked him. Justin Long is funny, and very likable in a geeky sort of way. Stephen Root is very funny as usual and plays the usual nerd role. Joel Moore did what he had to do well. Chris Williams had a few funny lines but didn't have that much to do. Alan Tudyk is very funny here, especially in that Pirate getup!. Gary Cole is good as the Announcer, he is also an excellent character actor!. Lance Armstrong,Chuck Norris,William Shatner,David Hasselhoff do great in there cameo's. And Julie Gonzalo is very cute, and did her job well, as the cheerleader. Overall i highly recommend this one, it's good for a night of laughs! ***1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is not groundbreaking by any means... in fact it was quite disappointing, not enough fun or risqué stuff to really bother watching it for and it doesn't help that doorbell is about as exciting to watch as three legged tortoise. The film seemed very, very short, probably because nothing really happened apart from the obvious, doorbell practise, then doorbell tournament, bit of rivalry, etc... absolutely nothing new or even close to any originality. Ben Stiller is quite scary as the 'bad guy' a bit too far fetched, but i suppose it is in the essence of the movie. The only time I did laugh was with a scene near the end with Lance Armstrong... it is a classic moment in an otherwise poor film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buddies of mine have been telling me for ages how funny this movie is, and that I HAVE to see it. With such glowing praise from a bunch of unemployed anti-social stoners, how could I not want to see Dodgeball? Well, now I have seen it, and I'm sorry to inform you, my dysfunctional, drug-addled friends, that this movie is painfully AVERAGE.In saying that I must state that I think that this is vintage Ben Stiller!! Completely in his element as the character White Goodman. This movie isn't too bad if you like this kind of ridiculous, dumbass humour.I guess I was just built up by the hype, expecting the funniest movie I have ever seen, only to have a few chuckles and even fewer laugh out loud belly laughs.That's why I voted 5 for this movie. Just too 'hit and miss' for my liking.Sorry, Dodgeball, you missed me but you hit plenty of other retards!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodge Ball is a fairly funny movie. It certainly has it's moments, and if you like Ben Stiller then you'll probably like this film. The exchanges between Stiller and Vaughn are classic. Stiller just has to get the last word in regardless and it's hilarious! Some of the scenes with Patches O'houlihan are great too. "If you can dodge traffic, you can dodge a ball!" Hilarious! The cast is so-so in my opinion. I do like Vince Vaughn, but some of the characters in the movie are just kinda..well... stupid. I mean, what business does Steve the Pirate have in this movie? Still have not figured that one out. I thought the chick from Romanovia was a little much as well, but that's just me.This movie reminds me a lot of some of Adam Sandler's earlier movies like Billy Madison. The movie has it's moments and uses some of the same retarded humor but it's not a great movie by far. If you like Sandler then you'll watch any of his flicks. The same can be said here with Ben Stiller. If you like him, then you'll like this movie.Bottom line for me when commenting on a movie is this; Did it entertain me? Yeah. It's a decent movie with hilarious spots. Not great, but a fairly entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller is without doubt one of the most popular and finest actors on the comedy side these days; together with Owen Wilson, Will Ferrel and Vince Caughn they seem to have a brought a small revolution into typical Hollywood laughs.DODGEBALL features neither Ferrel or Wilson; but it's got Stiller in his ace and Vaughn with his clothes on, not revealing his body for sure. This is a comedy, it's very simple. The laughs come tight and in fine spirit they're filled with irony, childish comments and stupidity, and DODGEBALL makes it all very viewable. Stiller playing the top-trained White Goodman who's goal is to be the best, and he will do everything to bring the next-door training house Average Joe's down.David Hasselhoof has a great cameo, same with Chuck Norris (although he ain't that a laugh), DODGEBALL is packed with the perfect twist between true and pure pathetic comedy and smart belly laughs, and that keeps the movie rolling although it's storyline is surely not that good of a script. Dozens of fine dialogs and entertainment. But; the movie stumbles when it gets to the part of being hilarious. It never really scores that much points on the "laughing out loud" part, maybe because it's a bit too busy about keeping it all so glossy stupid and ridiculous that it doesn't make time for such.DODGEBALL is a very worthy Stiller movie, and does almost everything right on it's scale. Better than Zoolander it is, but not as good as Starsky &amp; Hutch. STARS: 4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing this movie for a while. I wasn't expecting much so I waited for it on video. The movie was about what I figured: stupid but in a good way. The story is anything but original. It is just a retread of "gotta raise money to save something" plot. Ben Stiller provides most of the laughs, as to be expected, but the supporting actors get some good gags too. Vince Vaughn plays the hero as laid-back as possible. Some of the humor misses such as Patches O'Houlihan's jokes played by an almost unrecognizable Rip Torn. If you aren't too uptight to enjoy a silly slap-stick comedy, give Dodgeball a rent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having played dodge ball many times in junior high school I thought the concept of this movie was great. And indeed, this movie had many hilarious scenes, including the numerous dodge ball shots to the head and groin. The tone and plot line were very reminiscent of "Happy Gilmore."However, some of the jokes fell flat. The pointless girl on girl kissing scenes in this and other movies are getting really old really fast, as was some of the unnecessarily crude language. Also some of the humor was just plain blah, like the whole subplot of the pirate.I won't buy it, but it wasn't a waste of a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't wanna take too much of your time here, so I'll make this quick. If you like slapstick, sarcasm, weird, crude, nonsense, or even dark humor: this movie has it all! I've never seen a movie that works on so many different comedy levels as this. The main characters are pretty much "homages" to other films. Namely Vince Vaughn and Steven Root's characters being an homage to Peter Venknan and Louis Tully from "GHOSTBUSTERS", and Ben Stiller is sorta reprising this same type character he played in "HEAVYWEIGHTS" and "HAPPY GILMORE". If you love Vince Vaughn playing his typecast wise-ass roles, this movie is for you. If you loved stiller acting obscene and weird, this movie is for you. If you love straight out slapstick watching the actors obviously in real pain, this is for you. I haven't seen a comedy in a long, long time that everyone I know likes as much as this film. I can only hope that this first time director is surrounded with as much talent the next time around because the script is great, but the actors really put some icing on the cake from the looks of it!</fullReview>

As is almost always the case, though, the trailer had already shown the funny scenes so there were hardly any surprises watching the film.However, you're not supposed to be surprised watching a movie called Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. You pretty much know what's going to happen when you've read the title. I didn't mind much though, because even though the trailer had shown almost all the funny scenes, those scenes were _really_ funny. Also, Dodgeball is constantly entertaining and never boring.

It would have been much better if they had, and would have made more money. The other films that I am talking about are Starsky &amp; Hutch, Old School, and Anchorman.All three of those movies had all guys in them, so it made them more amusing, and more people probably expected, but missed the guys in this one.Over all, i did love this movie anyway, and you will too, as long as your in to stupid movies, that are funny. I gave it 8 of 10. So would you, wouldn't you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball: A True Underdog StoryStarring: Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, Rip Torn, Stephen Root, Justin Long, Chris Williams, Hank Azaria, Jason Bateman, Joel Moore, Missi Pyle, Gary Cole, Jamal Duff and Alan TudykGenre: ComedyRated: PG-13Dodgeball is one of my favorite movies of 2004! Also another one of my favorite sport movies too. This movie is about a guy named Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn) who is a charismatic underachiever and proprietor of a rundown gym called Average Joe's. The facility's eclectic client of decidedly less-than-average Joes is comprised of: a self-styled pirate; a scrawny nerd who dreams of impressing an unattainable cheerleader; an obsessive aficionado of obscure sports; a dim-witted young man; and a cocky know-it-all who, of course, really knows nothing. Peter's humble gym catches the eye of White Goodman (Ben Stiller), the power-mullet-sporting, Fu-Manchu-d, ego maniacal owner of Globo Gym, a gleaming monolith of fitness. White intends to take over Average Joe's, and Peter's non-existent bookkeeping is making it all too easy for him. A foreclosing bank has stationed attorney Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor) inside Average Joe's to finalize Globo's takeover of the gym. But Peter's boyish charms win her over and Kate joins his team of social rejects to beat the odds and save the Average Joes gym from going out of business and winning the $50 million dollars in a winner take all dodge-ball tournament in Las Vegas with the help from a senior dodge-ball player Patches O'Houlihan (older version played by Rip Torn and the younger version played by Hank Azaria). After this movie came out in theaters back in June 2004, adult dodge-ball leagues began to play all across the country and Gary Cole was even invited to a pro dodge-ball tournament in Chicago, IL. Hope they start doing a professional dodge-ball league to the point where it is being played in arenas where NBA/NHL teams play in! But who knows? If you can watch this movie then you can dodge a ball!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I would call this a stupid comedy. And I don't mean the movie was horrible, I just mean it is the kind of comedy that has people saying stupid things that make you laugh. It is very much like Zoolander (comparing it to another Ben Stiller stupid comedy) with its humor, just with dodgeball and not models. For the most part, the dodge-ball plays out as believable except for *SPOILER WARNING* the final throw in the end, in which the Vince's character hits Ben's character while blindfolded after doing a matrix-esqe dodge. *END SPOILER*. The plot is likable but has places to be improved on. It is by no means the greatest movie of all time, and people who don't like stupid comedies will quickly throw is out the window, but for those who enjoy Ben's other works, I think they will find it good.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not sure where this film failed to be a gut-buster. On paper with the actors, and even some of the movies quotes listed at IMDb, it seems like it should have rated higher on the mirth meter. In retrospect, I think one problem is the film hangs so much upon Stiller's inflated lampooning of the White Goodman character. It's done somewhat cleverly and no doubt aggressively enough, but you never get the sense that behind it all Stiller feels anything remotely resembling a connection to his character. It's more of a class clown tour-de- force that just wears thin over the course of a full-length film.All "those beautiful people are really ugly and vapid" moments are kind of undercut by a culture that has already seen celebrities at their worst volumes one, two, ad nauseum.In addition, Stiller's character sort of obliterates Vince Vaughan whom I was looking to seeing more from. Vaughan's humor tends to be more subtly acerbic, and typically you're not so sure who's in on the joke. He's too cool to be cool, too dorky to be dorky?It's got to be so hard to write, rehearse, re-shoot and edit a comedy...and keep some sort of truly improvisational zip to it. I think that's why we hunger so much for the bloopers and outtakes. A big part of comedy is the juxtaposition of two really unexpected forces...but many of us have already seen too many "everything-and-the- kitchen-sink" comedies. Even the principals in the voice-over commented on this when talking about the dodge wrenches scene.More interesting was the alternate ending suggested with the DVD and again discussed in the voice-over. We are to believe the studios wrenched a happy ending for these Bad News Nerd Bears.That coupled with the end-of-the-credits lard of the Milkshake dance by Stiller, hint at a darker, stronger comedy. Plated with latex, Stiller taunts America with the payoff that they wanted... and says "You happy? Fatty make a funny?"The dance and play on the already too often parodied pop song are no big deal. However that one line was arrestingly funny for me.That left a mark for me. The other barrage of humor is a mix of hits and misses that will probably depend more on when and who you see the film with. So I guess Dodgeball hits square on the grundle, 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is as stupid as the title sounds its also a not very funny movie. In order to save their favorite local gym, a slacker (Vince Vaughn) assembles a motley group of friends into a strong enough dodgeball team to enter into an intensive competition in Vegas against the superstar team assembled by the corporation taking over the gym, led by White Goodman (Ben Stiller). The story is kind of new at least the dodgeball part but the underdog part has been used a lot. The trailer was really funny but as it always happens all of the jokes are used in the trailer and that there were no new funny jokes in the movie. The movie is only 92 minutes but it feels like its two hours especially when the theme is dodgeball and all they do is throw balls at each other. After awhile, watching someone get hit in the face with a dodgeball loses it appeal. The cast doesn't really save this movie either, first there's Vince Vaughn who is mildly funny in the movie but he should have been a lot funnier. This is Christine Taylor's first role since the hilarious Zoolander and she doesn't really add anything to the film nor does she take anything away. This is Ben Stiller's fourth film in six months and is the third best out of the four. His character is really annoying and is not very but hopefully he can rebound with Meet the Fockers. What saves this movie is the supporting cast as they bring in the laughs the best being Rip Torn and Missi Pyle. Director is Rawson Marshall Thurber, this is his first mainstream movie and he did a decent job. Rating 5/10, not a very funny film even with the talent involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe the underquote of 'Dodgeball' shouldn't be: 'A true underdog story', but 'how a comedy about the stupidest subject became one of the best of recent years'.So there's your typical group of losers, who all are connected to 'Average Joe's' gym, in desperate need of some money, or else they will be bought up by snotty Globo Gym owner White Goodman (Ben Stiller in yet another great role). They enter a dodgeball competition to get the needed 50 grand, but of course Globo Gym enter their own team. So, who's gonna make it to the final and who will ultimately become Dodgeball heroes? We all know the answers, but that's OK, 'cause Dodgeball has so many fun to offer we don't even care. As I said, Stiller's hilarious, as are Joel Moore and Stephen Root, but the true star is Rip Torn. His characterization of coach Patches O'Houlihan, once the best Dodgeball player around, should deserve him an Oscar. And I mean it.One more notable appearance: Christine Taylor again is a nice surprise (as in Zoolander), I noticed she's not really doing anything now: how come? All in all: great fun, some fantastic comical deliveries (although Vince Vaugn is a bit of a let-down), a comedy for everyone to watch. 7/10.</fullReview>

Although the film proceeds along a predictable path of good guys fighting bad guys, I thought it was interesting to find out (in the DVD commentary) that the director wanted to end the movie by essentially having the bad guy defeat the good guys. I have no idea why he would think a light hearted goof-ball comedy should suddenly get all serious and realistic at the end, but I actually thought the fact that he did was pretty funny in itself.

Stiller learns of their plans and tries to stop them by entering a team into the tournament. Rip Torn is excellent in this film. Rip Torn plays Patches O Houlan, coach for Average Joe's Gym and ex-dodgeball player. Besides Rip Torn, I also liked Ben Stiller's portrayal as White Goodman. Average Joe's team also consists of a geek, a nerd, a man who thinks he is a pirate and Christine Taylor. However, the movie is a little predictable, but overall I gave the movie a 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

Ohh and make sure you watch through the credits, i wont ruin the surprise but just don't forget the Kleenex you will laugh so hard u cry. it is hilarious and as of this moment is the best comedy of the 2004 year, until Anchorman the legend of Ron Burgundy comes out.

The misfits from Average Joes enter the national dodgeball competition to win $50,000 however Global Gym enters a team to knock them off.Like Stiller's other quirky comedy roles, there is some very silly dialog that is humorous, but the majority of the humour involves the games of dodgeball. While the underdog theme is common, it's the twisted stupidity of Stiller's character and the involvement of dodgeball that makes the movie good.</fullReview>

Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson &amp; Jack Black are the core. "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story" is probably one of the best films this group have helped produce!Not Vince Vaughn's finest hour though, he is the main character in Dodgeball and doesn't really have to try in this film as his character is a nicer guy than his other past acting roles with good lines in the script. Not like his characters in "Swingers", "Made", "Old School" and "Starsky &amp; Hutch" where he plays a moron with a mouth! This film is pretty much all about the Ben Stiller performance showing off his best comedic creation. He's a mix of Derek Zoolander and the Elderly Carer in "Happy Gilmore"The film is immature and sometimes that is what you need! Christine Taylor, Stephen Root, Rip Torn &amp; Justin Long all proof more than adequate support cast in a very funny film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrific movie. Comedy of the year so far (if we just forget about Along Came Polly which was another Ben Stiller classic). Acting was definitely up to par for each of the actors. Christine Taylor (Ben Stiller's wife in real life) was very good and looked the same. Rip Torn was good, not great, but Hank Azaria (who is also on the Simpsons and brilliant there to) who plays Patches when he was younger gives an outstanding cameo. Vince Vaughn did every thing possible with a not exceptional role. Certainly would have really helped his comedy career though without a doubt. Alan Tudyk was alright, but of course the star as in all his movie (literally) was Ben Stiller who was just so entertaining throughout the whole film. Whenever he was on screen you were excited because you knew it wasn't going to be boring. He seems to play dumb people very well in all his roles. What amazes me is how someone who can act with that much energy and enthusiasm in his role can change himself so much that he's able to play a role like his one in Along Came Polly which is basically the exact opposite. He's definitely one of the best comedy actors of all time even up there with Jim Carrey and Mike Myers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>predictable with delightful comic details and nuanced performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller is very bright and very funny and he is one of those presences that is just really nice to have in a movie, and is always memorable. This character is great, with his mustache, feathered hair, over-the-top one-liners, slimy outfits, creepy smile with teeth that are ridiculously white.However, I felt torn about the movie. The opening, with the infomercial for Ben's gym was a hysterical parody of those genre of infomercials. The movie itself, however, wore its plot on its sleeve and was predictable and paint-by-numbers. I suppose it was a send up of several other underdog-type sports movies ala Mighty Ducks and Bad News Bears. It worked on many levels and at points was very very funny. I guess, although it felt like an "I've seen this before" type flick, it still had redeeming qualities. I've been watching lots of offbeat indies and European films recently, so watching a Hollywood flick that follows Syd Field's screen writing books to a tee, where the good guy wins and the bad guy loses out; where the plot follows a very very well-tread line, is difficult to watch without being uber-aware of how overdone this type of plot is.That being said, the quality of the movie depends on leaving certain pre-conceptions at the door. I mean, it's kind of childish, socking-dodgeball-players-in-the-balls sort of humour. But it is funny. The painting in his office of him wrestling a bull (taking the bull by the horns), the pumping up the crotch area of his silver hip hugging pants before seeing the girl ("the" girl)... i mean, it's about the details. Ben Stiller is a comedian, a comedic writer and a wonderful comic actor. I thought The Cable Guy was brilliant. Other movies he's been involved with have been really great and really funny. This may not go down as a classic, but it's got some really funny moments... yet on the other hand, moments that make you cringe because you know you've seen them before, or because they are there simply to progress the plot towards the next plot point, and they feel awkward and forced. Overall, though, Stiller did a pretty good job lampooning workout places and that whole scene, even if it was somewhat predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely Stuff!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films like this come and go like J.LO's husbands but when Ben Stiller is apart of it you always know a little something extra is going to be the appetizer of the entire film which is Ben Stiller really.His performance completely takes over the entire movie. When every scene with Vince Vaughn and co shows up I keep thinking to myself when are they going to bring White Goodman on for more time? I love the whole story and all the characters but I would have loved an entire film on Goodman. Overall the films a complete blast and should be merited on that but I just can't get enough of White Goodman and his phrases out of my head. If Ben Stiller carries on the way he is at the moment then he will be a legend in no time what so ever. Great to see Rip Torn back in the saddle but Freddy Got Fingered is still his NO 1 comedy but he shines in this.They have to make a spin off for White Goodman and there should be a petition online as we speak to make this actually happen and of course ask Ben Stiller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious and Entertaining... A Good Time Had By All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** "Dodgeball" in itself is a hilarious, amusing concept- knock the other guy out with a ball while you yourself not getting hit to survive in the game. Try incorporating this into a summer comedy, starring the ingenious comic of Ben Stiller, and the result is nonstop hilarity, entertainment, and a good time well accounted for its price. In "Dodgeball", you have a group of adult misfits, contending with another imperious group for control of their place of activity- the gym. This invites an amusing premise- why not challenge the "big bad wolf" in a dodgeball tournament, the winner gaining control of the gym and its stakes? So ensues a relentless, hilarious adventure of the underdogs going for the gold. Enter the insanely funny Rip Torn as the team's instructor, educating them in Unorthodox manners the rules of the game ("Dodge a wrench, dodge a ball"), who provides the film's greatest laughs and amuses the audience throughout the duration of his screen time. Perhaps somewhat too zany, particularly toward the end, as some of the characters overstep their roles (e.g. "the pirate") and the finesse being too contrived and predictable. Yet overall, the hilarious content and execution of this delicious concept made for one happy experience at the movies this summer. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge fan but slightly annoyed at the layout of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't want to come off on the wrong foot I am the biggest fan of this new wave of comedies hitting the big screen like Old School, Starsky &amp; Hutch, Dodgeball, and eagerly awaiting Anchorman. In short I love the actors that star in these movies; Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller and Jack Black (waiting for him to join the gang).But I was quite annoyed with the delivery/layout of Dodgeball. Now I don't want it to look like I'm backtracking on what I said before I did love the film but I felt the way that the director basically was setting up the dialogue so that Vince Vaughn could say something humorous. It simply felt forced and unnatural. With a character saying something stupid or unwitty just so Vince could comeback with a clever quip. Ben Stiller was a laugh a minute as the egotistical White Goodman (I'm sure there's a race related joke in there somewhere; White Good Man) and I also thoroughly enjoyed Steve the pirate, who is one of the most random characters I've seen in a while with no explanation as to why he thinks he is a pirate. If that was a nail in comedy you just hit it on the head.I am now in a state of limbo waiting to see Anchorman so that I can finally decide who is my favourite comedic actor Vince Vaughn or Will Ferrell and unfortunately at the moment I think I'm leaning towards the Ferrell beast.Overall a good laugh and worth a watch if you like this batch of comedy although I would have enjoyed seeing a few more of the Dodgeball teams. One especially; the She Mullets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball is a fairly standard noughties comedy. For what it's worth Peter La Fleur (Vaughn) runs (in the loose sense of the word) a struggling gym. White Goodman (Stiller) is extremely successful and wants to buy La Fleur's gym to turn it into a car park for his own empire. La Fleur tries desperately to raise the cash to save his gym, but eventually bands together with the gym regulars to win the money they need via a Dodgeball competition.Most of the jokes are visual with the script offering few outstanding moments. The best bits are when the coach Patches O'Houlihan puts the team through their paces. It's a pleasant enough way to spend an hour and a half, but you'll probably not be able to remember too much about it after a couple of months. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know the story from the previews already? A quick recap: Good vs. Evil, Big business Vs. Little guy and so on. It's an over-used plot line in movies and an excuse for Ben Stiller ( as the somewhat strange White Goodman, owner of the high tech Globo gym ) to make some one liners and do a bit of slapstick with on screen cohort Vince Vaughn ( as Peter La Fleur , the lax owner and friend of the locals at Average Joe's gym, conveniently located right across the street from Globo ). Vaughn's character needs $50K in 30 days to stop Goodman from acquiring his gym and they enter a dodgeball tournament.With the pre-amble out of the way I honestly enjoyed this movie, had me chuckling right along at the gross-out jokes and the obvious humor which is Stiller's forte and Vaughn's lovable lackluster character and well delivered one liners. Stiller's wife, Christine Taylor is the leading female unless you count Missi Pyle's incredibly large and scary 'other side of the Iron Curtain steroid type' woman who could certainly take the lead if she wanted it!The best on screen has to go to the psychotic Patches O'Houlihan, Rip Torn and there are some great cameo's including Hank Azaria, William Shatner and even David Hasselhoff having a laugh at himself. Chuck Norris also pokes his nose in, as does Tour De France legend Lance Armstrong ? who should stick to riding and leave acting to the pros. Finally a mention for Jason Bateman as Pepper Brooks, the Gen-X, extreme sports type commentator his delivery and performance is perfect.Other support cast like Steve the Pirate, ably played by Alan Trudyk and Justin, Justin Long, with his horrible flashback to the cheer-leading incident keeps this movie rolling along. Many memorable moments and good laughs here, plus a bit of a surprise for the romantic side-plot, especially to the parents of the five year olds in the cinema.7.5/10*TIP* Hang round for the entire credits!</fullReview>

Coincidentally, a dodgeball tournament is happening in Las Vegas where the grand prize is 50k. Peter and his friends must compete and win this tournament to keep their gym, but of course not without White Goodman, the owner of Globo-Gym, in the same tournament.I'm just gonna say this: Ben Stiller makes this movie. Given that their is a great supporting cast, Stiller steals every scene. Besides that this movie is hysterical. Along with "Anchorman" this is the second "stupid" comedy of the summer, and I loved them both. Just about all the jokes work perfectly.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Basically this movie has an onslaught of jokes, all of different caliber so everyone who sees it will laugh at something even if they find the rest of the movie simply idiotic.This movie is all over the place with its jokes and acting, but remains fairly watchable.

		<shortDescription>Funny on the Fringe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Making, much less seeing "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story" is bizarre, beyond the fringe of the most remote element in popular culture. The fact that the movie title includes a clarification that distinguishes it from perhaps the "other" Dodgeball movie is both ridiculous and unsettling. That being said, Writer and Director Rawson Marshall Thurber's "Dodgeball" is very stupid, and extremely funny. Vince Vaughn as Average Joe's Gym owner, Peter La Fleur, emerges as today's most talented comic straight man. This year Vaughn has appeared in smaller comic roles in such movies as "Starsky and Hutch" and "Anchorman". Vaughn has a cool and ease about him, always playing insightful in the midst of brain dead chaos. Dodgeball's world class stupidity is embodied in Peter's crew. Its paragon of stupid is White Goodman, owner of the rival Globo Gym. As played by Ben Stiller, White Goodman is dumber than a post. On a certain level, one has to admire Stiller's bold performance which is so over the top, that you can virtually hear the brain cells dying in White Goodman's head. Not only is White beyond the realm of stupid, he is also arrogant and completely self-absorbed. Yes, he is perhaps the most annoyingly funny character in all of movie-dom. In a clueless White attempt to seduce, Kate Veatch (cute and smart Christine Taylor), he asks her if she is okay. She responds, "I just threw up in my mouth... a little." Whoa. Kate is the bank auditor assigned to review Average Joe's Gym's financials. The gym is in foreclosure. White makes a hostile takeover attempt for Average Joe's, and for Kate. Kate, however is sympathetic to Peter, though everyone in Average Joe's think she is a lesbian. Go figure. Where White's Globo Gym is for the "beautiful" people, Peter's Average Joe's Gym is not. Not at all. Peter asks high school member Justin (charming and geeky Justin Long), "Wait, so you want to join the cheer leading squad so people don't think you're a loser?" Peter's members are not an athletically inspired group. Okay, they are a bunch of pathetic losers-- athletically and socially. It is so absurd, that one of the guys thinks he's a pirate which goes unnoticed by most of the group. Peter must raise $50,000 or lose his gym to foreclosure, and eventually to Globo Gym. Fortunately, one of the guys, Gordon (very funny Stephen Root from "Office Space"), discovers in his issue of "Obscure Sports Journal" that they could earn the money by winning the Dodgeball Tournament in Las Vegas. After gaining a tournament seeding following a scandalous Girl Scouts match, the boys enroll legendary Dodgeball coach Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn). Patches is apparently this Dodgeball Yoda in a wheelchair, uttering such sage advice as "If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball." Kate (Taylor) demonstrates a special talent, and joins the team in their quest for Dodgeball glory. My only familiarity with Dodgeball: The Game was as a grade schooler during recess and P.E. Then I saw Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn promoting "Dodgeball" on MTV providing color commentary at a Dodgeball Tournament. I was unaware of this whole sports culture. So when Thurber adds the winning combination of Gary Cole and Jason Bateman as Dodgeball color commentators, Cotton McKnight and Pepper Brooks, on ESPN8 (the Ocho) the effect is no longer absurd. It becomes surreal. "Dodgeball" unexpectedly has the most funny inspiring speech I can remember from a movie. At the emotional arc of the movie, Lance Armstrong playing himself shares with Peter (Vaughn) that being diagnosed with brain, lung and testicular cancer drove him to win 5 Tour de Frances (at that time). He then asks Peter, "So what are you dying of...?" Classic. Then again Thurber's "Dodgeball" is full of surprises. The biggest one is that this stupid story is truly funny, for the most part clever, and has a unique charm. Even amidst the sometimes bottom of the barrel scraping humor, the movie has a genuine fondness for it's cast of lovable losers. We all pull for Peter and his team to reclaim the greatness deep inside themselves... buried very, very deep inside.</fullReview>

Jason Bateman's performance was also hilarious. The banter between his character and that of Fred Willard was superb.

		<shortDescription>2004's Happy Gilmore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story" was a goofy, but hilarious movie that had me laughing all the way through. It was truly a story of underdogs proving that are just as likely to succeed, even if it is only by luck. Those who enjoyed "Happy Gilmore" may or may not enjoy this film - it depends if you like movies that have striking similarities to one you've seen before.The main character in this film, White Goodman, is played by Ben Stiller, who was a nursing home orderly by the name of Hal in the 1996 film Happy Gilmore. In both films, he uses his power to his advantage, using every opportunity to make anyone feel bad. The striking similarities between the two films goes beyond this. The basic plot lines are essentially the same: the ownership of a large asset is threatened, the character takes up a sport they've never played before in order to win back that asset, and the champion of that sport, who is imminently to take over that asset, feels threatened and will do anything to stop them. In Happy Gilmore it was Grandma's house that was threatened; in this film it is a gym business. In the same sense, golf versus dodgeball.In addition, product placements are found in this film, and they are sometimes the same as what is found in Happy Gilmore. Pepsi was seen a number of times in both films. Also, some golf events in Happy Gilmore were covered by ESPN, and in this film, the dodgeball championships in Las Vegas are covered by ESPN - ESPN 8 "The Ocho", that is. Fortunately, we didn't see Peter LaFleur eating three Subway sandwiches a day.To put it another way, if you didn't like Johnny English, you won't like this film. The antics are very goofy throughout.</fullReview>

Well, what do I expect but a month later I'm in the theaters, crackling my gum-loud and fast. Urgh! I didn't want to see this movie. I was dragged there with a group.

Come on, who doesn't like to see people get smacked by a volley ball? It's pure entertainment!!! Quotes such as "Nobody makes me bleed my own blood" and so on made this movie a summer hit. EVERYONE I know is quoting it constantly. I'm not saying this is the best comedy out there- it is NOT. Not even close. But it does make you burst out laughing even when you don't want to. Oh, one more thing. Why is it that every other movie has to have a bi or lesbo/gay thing slipped in? I'm NOT against them, we're all the same-people, but Hollywood can be so pathetic sometimes.

		<shortDescription>Average Joe's Become Dodging Underdogs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2004 comedy Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, appears to be the summer's comical hit. Vince Vaughn plays Pete LaFleur, the underachieving owner of Average Joe's gym. The place is an eyesore with motivational posters having mottoes like "Failure IS an Option." It's the sort of place where the members' workout clothes droop, as much as their bellies. Ben Stiller plays his competition, White Goodman, a cocky guy who's body fat percent and IQ both seem to equal zero. He proudly owns neighboring Globo Gym, where physical perfection is mandatory. Because of his inattention to business details, Pete's gym mortgage is in jeopardy, with banker Kate Veatch (Taylor) assigned to oversee the foreclosure. Unless Pete and his wimpy clients can raise $50,000 quickly, White will buy Average Joe's and raze it. Their only chance is to win the National Dodgeball Championship. Globo Gym enters to see that Average Joes doesn't win. It comes down to both gyms resulting in victory not by winning the match, but by cleaver trickery.The critical intention from director Rawson Marshall Thurber is to prove that underdogs can overcome all odds. Even though they are shot down by White and have to work hard to prepare for the tournament, even they can result in victory using smart tactics to outsmart Globo Gym. Through this comedy, the story tells people that even if you are an underdog, it doesn't mean that you cannot overcome things. It also shows that no one is above anyone else even if they have more money. Intelligence overcomes all else.There are many critical techniques used to present this funny story to viewers in the best way. Camera angles and lighting make the movie's moods more intense and exciting for viewers. Exciting music is also used to intensify the exhilarating competition. There seems to be bits of comedy placed at perfect spots in the movie to adequately create comic relief during rough times for the Average Joes.With a creative plot, encouraging purpose, and fantastic film techniques, Dodgeball comes out on top of the summer's film listings. It is a great comedy that proves not to be a film underdog.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004/Marshall Thurber)As I went to see this tonight, the first thought that came to my mind was, "What could I have done with the 8 dollars I am about to waste?" After the movie, I was pretty happy I had seen it. It's one of those movies that you have to laugh at just because the idea is so bizarre.The story is about a man named Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn), who owns a beat down gym right across the street from one of the best gyms in the US, which is run by White Goodman (Ben Stiller). When Peter finds out that he must earn $50,000 to keep control of his gym from Goodman, he organizes a bunch of his friends to think of an idea to get the money.After thinking about it, they find an ad to win the money in a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas. When Goodman finds out about this, he organizes his own team of built and strong players to compete. Which team will come out on top?I actually learned a lot more about dodgeball from this film too. It actually is a pretty interesting sport. This is probably the best comedy to come out since 'Bad Santa' in 2003. This was a surprisingly funny movie about a surprisingly interesting topic. -Pat7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is actually a lot better than you'd think merely looking at the ads. Ben Stiller (who seems to be in virtually every goofy comedy that comes out these days) is absolutely hilarious as the evil health club owner, delivering each line with perfect tone and comedic feel.He even has a decent cast with him, and the Marcia Brady girl looks hot as always. I personally have always sucked at dodgeball in school, so it was pretty hilarious seeing the makeshift team learn so fast and defeat championship teams from all over, teams with players named "Blade," "Laser" and "Blazer."All in all this was a decent comedy good for some laughs. I won't buy the DVD but it was a good way to laugh for 90 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stupid but funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dodgeball was funny, as long as you don't think too hard about it. However, if you want a better example of the turn-off-your-brain-and laugh movie go see Anchorman, as it is funnier, in my opinion. Ben Stiller is hilarious as the dense, insecure White Goodman, owner of GloboGym. Goodman is a cross between Stiller's earlier characters of Zoolander and the the evil nursing home attendant he played in Happy Gilmore. Vince Vaughn plays our hero, Peter LaFleur, a laid back slacker who owns and operates a "competing" gym called Average Joe's. He has to get $50,000 in 30 days or else he loses his gym to the obnoxious, nefarious Goodman. One of LaFleur's few clients, Gordon, comes up with the idea of competing in a Las Vegas dodgeball tournament where the grand prize is $50,000. This leads to countless shots of people getting hit in the crotch with dodgeballs, which as the producers of America's Funniest Home Videos, can attest is always funny. The tournament itself is funny, and appears on ESPN 8 or "The Ocho" as it is nicknamed. Gary Cole and Jason Bateman hilariously play the commentators. As far as Jason Bateman's character goes, think of a younger version of Fred Willard's character in Best in Show, and you will get the idea. The cameos are funny and include William Shatner, David Hasselhoff, Chuck Norris, and the funniest one of all, Lance Armstrong. All in all it was funny, but could have been better. During the training montage, it would have been so much better, if they would have played a cheesy 80's style heavy metal song. obviously, when you go see a movie like Dodgeball, you don't expect Oscar material, but as long as you just don't think too hard about how stupid it is, it is definitely worth killing about an hour and a half. I give it 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb, but fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit it, the only reason that I went to this movie was because it didn't cost me anything. I went to see Spider Man 2 at a drive-in, and it was a double feature. It was a work night, but I decided to give it a try - how bad could it be? Besides, I could always leave if I didn't like it.It's a stupid movie, I'll admit that. But it is fun, it is funny, and is a great send up of the sports movie genre. Some of the reviewers are bound and determined to be offended, but it is a fun movie. The movie works well because it doesn't take itself seriously at all. Worthwhile if you are not in a serious mood, and especially worthwhile if you didn't pay for it. If you are uptight, you might not like it, the movie can be a little vulgar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 90-minute kick in the groin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only feasible explanation for the rave comments found here is that DodgeBall is being supported by a large staff of eager publicists.I like dumb comedies -- I laughed through "Something about Mary"; I consider "Caddyshack" a classic. But DodgeBall is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It isn't just stupid, it's insulting and offensive. And, worse than that, it's lazy and dull-witted. Ben Stiller and co. seem to think that silly voices, old people cursing, and kicks to the groin are the building blocks of comedy. Over and over, in places where you expect a punchline, Stiller uses his Zoolander voice to repeat what another character has just said. He does this again and again and again. If we're lucky, we then get to see the love interest smash Stiller's head into the wall. Vince Vaughn looks sedated throughout the movie, and the screenwriters must have been visiting the same medicine cabinet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film I decided to catch primarily because I wasn't sure how long it'd be out in town and we don't have a "Dollar movie" theatre anymore. Also,I'm sort of a fan of Ben Stiller,so any chance to see him go unleashed in a film is a welcome spectacle. I'd hardly call this a great film by any measure. It's sophomoric and contrived to a fault. The humor certainly isn't for everyone and the plot seems stolen from previous gross-out comedies like "Kingpin" and :BAseketball". But the gags are so enthused and rapid-fire that you don't get a chance to dwell on the bad gags for the ones that do work(and quite a few do). Plus, Vince Vaughn's easy,relaxed comic presence counterbalances Stiller's unhinged bodybuilder freak tops out a cast that seems inspired in their playing basically one-note characters. A bonus is watching real-life wife of Stiller,Christine Taylor, having no problem resisting the advances of her husband's character. The celebrity cameos are cleverly inserted and some of the minor characters--most notably Bateman as a dense sports color commentator and Root as a meek member of Vaughn's gym and Dodgeball team--steal their scenes. Bottom line:this is a good,hearty laughfest(for those who appreciate raw,raucous,well-meant humor) that is a good comedy respite or palate-cleanser between summer blockbusters. 7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball was my favorite playground game and as I watched this movie I wished I'd kept up on it through the years! It's a fun sport that won't let you take yourself too seriously.Factor in Vince Vaughan and Ben Stiller, and the gorgeous Christine Taylor, and you have the silliness and laughter of a Zoolander or Something about Mary well worth the ten dollars. Ben Stiller's pseudo-intellectual overcompensating 'White Goodman' left me in tears, right down to the end of the credits. If you already saw it and missed the credits, make sure you watch them all the way through on the DVD or you'll never experience the best part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest movies of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dodgeball: A True Underdog StoryFirst off i want to say that this is one of the funniest movies i have seen all year. If you enjoyed "Mean Girls" "White Chicks" and "Anchorman" you will definitely love this movie.This is the story of an underachiever name Peter LaFleur he owns a small gym called "Average Joe's". His competitor White Goodman owns a much bigger gym named "Globo Gym"; all of a sudden he becomes interested in buying Peter's gym. Peter is behind on his payments and the only way he can maintain his gym is by paying a large amount of money. Of course Peter does not have this money so he has to find a way to get it quick.Peter assembles a dodgeball team made up of: -A man who thinks he's a pirate -A nerd who wants to impress the hottest chearleader -A man obsessed in obscure sports (such as "the midget toss" -A man who is not to bright -And a man who thinks he knows it all but knows absolutely nothingThe only way that Peter can keep his gym in by winning first prize in a dodgeball competition. This movies is full of funny surprises and exciting twists. And of course it contains two of some of the funniest actors in movies. Ben Stiller-Vince VaughnI loved this movie and i think that anybody that has a good sense of humor should see this movie.Overall Movie Rating 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprisingly moved by this film. It had a perfect combination of goofy comedy (coming mostly from Ben Stiller, who was absolutely hilarious) mixed with that intense feeling of wanting the little guy to win.I say that this is the ultimate underdog story of our time because I can really relate this film's theme to our present sociological/political struggle. That being the battle of our corporate sell-out, self-obsessed selves versus the side of us misfits who love life, not money/glamour.Funny cameos, too! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly mindless, but thoroughly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not something I'd show young children, but the funniest movie I've seen in a long, long time. As mindless comedies go, this is destined to be a classic.I have to admit, I wasn't expecting much, thinking that after There's Something About Mary and Zoolander, among others, that this movie would be the inevitable mediocre one that I probably wouldn't watch again, but I was dead wrong. I think, overall, this is the funniest one yet. Ben Stiller is arguably better as an antagonist than he is as the protagonist, and Vince Vaughn fits his part perfectly with his nonchalant and dry manner and deadpan delivery. Furthermore, there are an awful lot of unexpected little things that elevate it from funny to hilarious. Jason Bateman's character, for example, provided some of the best (and most unexpected) laughs. I wasn't expecting much in the way of plot, either, but I found it mildly entertaining, after all. Of course, it never gets in the way of the laughs, which keep on coming.Obviously, this movie isn't for everyone - and some people might be quite offended or put off by it. For the rest of us, it's another great mindless comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stiller's best movie since "Something About Mary"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, Ben Stiller has been very busy. In the few months before Dodgeball came out he has been in "Along Came Polly", "Starky &amp; Hutch" and "Envy", not counting a cameo in "Anchorman". This overexposed Stiller has some few new turkeys on his resume. Fortunately, Dodgeball is making up for them.This is the funniest movie I've seen since "Something About Mary". With a big plus: this movie doesn't rely on bathroom humor and gross jokes which has been a comedy staple since "Mary". Ben Stiller also pulled out here the best comedic performance I've seen since Jim Carrey in "The Mask".Highly recommended. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hate yourself enough for this spoiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do you start with a Vince Vaughn/Ben Stiller movie? Well the only question to ask about this one is where was the clever use of Will Ferrel or Owen Wilson? Why would that be the only question you may ask, well because really there was no other fault that could be found. Dodgeball is a hilarious movie full of laughs, sports and the ever needed bondage equipment. So how do you add to two great comedy actors like Ben Still and Vince Vaughn? Well with a good cast to go alongside them, including Christine 'Zoolander' Taylor, Rip 'Men in Black' Torn, Justin 'Jeepers Creepers' Long, Stephen 'Blade Runner' Root, Joel 'I've not a famous movie but was once in Sabrina the Teenage Witch' Moore plus many others, Seriously though where else but in a Vaughn/Stiller movie could you find a dodge ball team consisting of a gym owner, high school wimp, fat guy who's bad at sport and a pirate? Add that good looking lady who just so happens to be married to Mr. Stiller and you've got it made.Anyways on with the movie? Peter La Fleur (Vaughn) is a man with no worries, his bills maybe adding up and his electricity may be getting cut off but he's still got his gym. Average Joe's is the place to be for anyone who's not looking their best or is a little shall we say aloof, Unfortunately the bills are also adding up at the gym too and Mr. La Fleur is soon going to be losing everything he had, but to make things even worse in comes White Goodman to buy out the lot to add a multi-story parking lot for his gym next door, just part of the global wide Globo Gym where they're better than you and they know it. So how does a run of the mill gymnasium come up with the $50,000 that they need to save themselves from being leveled? Why dodge ball of course and so starts the hilarity, after all where else would you see four grown men and a woman losing to a group of girl scouts and still making it to Las Vegas for the dodge ball championships? Not in a Spielberg or Lucas movie that's for certain. That really is why these Stiller type movies do so well at the box office and more of it I say. So I have to say go ahead and watch this movie it really is a side splitting experience, go?.go now because it's only your fault if you don't hate yourself enough to go watch Dodgeball.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly hilarious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DODGEBALL: A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY is the surprising comedy about the owner of Average Joe's Gym, Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn), who finds his gym wanting to be bought out by fitness mogul White Goodman (Ben Stiller) to add to the monolith that is his GloboGym. The only way to prevent his gym from being bought out is to somehow turn up with $50,000--which, needless to say, is quite a stretch. In a moment of genius, one of the gym's attendants, Gordon (Stephen Root), suggests they go to the Dodgeball Championships in Las Vegas and try to win the grand prize of (coincidentally) $50,000. The Average Joe's team assembles and, though they are lousy at first, win the required regional match and are in. With the help of retired dodgeball champ Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn), the team improves and goes on to the Championships--where Goodman and his bunch of goons are also playing to try to stop Average Joe's from winning the prize.Why is DODGEBALL a surprising comedy? Because it's actually hilarious. From the previews, I wouldn't have thought so. But they were misleading--this was an extremely funny film. The main credit should go to Ben Stiller, who was truly hilarious as Goodman. The facial expressions he makes in this movie are classic. Vince Vaughn is given what is, in my opinion, a boring role with few jokes, but he does great with it, as does the rest of the supporting cast with their roles. One of the best comedic ensembles I've seen in a while.As for the comedy itself... the majority of the physical stuff is stupid. That's what made me think that it looked stupid from the previews--all that they showed was physical stunts. The getting-hit-in-the-balls gag is completely overdone, and used at least 10 times in this movie. The training scenes and the dodgeball games don't strike me as very funny; instead, it's the jokes and particularly Ben Stiller's character that made me crack up. My particular favorite scene involved the painting of the bull--the way it was painted made me almost fall out of my seat with laughter.The story is overworked, but charming and cute. The outcome of the final dodgeball game is entirely predictable, but still manages to pose as a happy and satisfying end to the movie. The hookup between Peter and his lawyer Kate (Christine Taylor) is completely predictable as well, but this movie adds a funny spin on it. It does well with its plot and doesn't make it boring or uninteresting.After seeing DODGEBALL, it may have just replaced MEAN GIRLS as the funniest movie I've seen recently. Surprisingly hilarious, minus the overdone and cluttering physical stunts. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Funny Bit Of Comic Stupidity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no awful memories of dodgeball and I will have no awful memories of 'Dodgeball'. I had fun playing this simplest of school games and had fun breezing through this goof-fest of a movie. As the cliche goes, it's good for a laugh. Actually, it's good for plenty of laughs and that's far more than I can say for most joke-free comedies. It's five sticks of foolish fun. I don't know how they pulled it off, though, because this ridiculous material has no right to be as enjoyable as it is, especially since you know where it's heading from the opening credits. Cliches or not, the filmmakers make it work.Slacker Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) owns a dive of a gym called Average Joe's. Muscle-twit White Goodman (Ben Stiller) owns the massive Globo Gym and intends to buy up La Fleur's business. To raise the $50,000 needed to pay the mortgage, a handful of members at Average Joe's enter a dodgeball tournament in Vegas. The jealous Goodman gathers super-jocks together to enter the same tourney. The lovely Christine Taylor (Kate Veach) is the third point of a humourous love triangle, who also proves to be a whiz playing the title game. Apart from a few twists and turns, the story follows the well-worn 'Rocky' path. It even takes some gentle jabs at the formula.This flick proves once again that pratfalls are funny. Watching La Fleur's clumsy chums get pegged with red balls during Rip Torn's brutal training sessions, writer/director Rawson Marshall Thurber treks to the well...but never goes there once too often. Stiller's insecure character hammers the same note, but he's still pretty funny in a very obnoxious role. Vaughn is about as relaxed as a piece of lunch meat, which goes against his usual high-strung style. The supporting cast members (including Stephen Root, who will always be Bill from "King Of The Hill" to me) don't leap past the stars, even though they all get to shine with lots of nerdy moments of comic stupidity.What I found surprising is that many of the laughs hit you in the face a beat or two later. I expected that a movie with such obvious intentions would play all its cards right in front of you, but many of the jokes work best as rebounders and asides. Stiller and Vaughn must have called in some favours to get all the guest stars to do a cameo---some of them are great and some are unnecessary. In any case, 'Dodgeball' is a hoot without being a manic "throw everything at the wall" type comedy. There's nothing wrong with that, unless you hated the game as a kid. Then again, considering this is a "true underdog story", maybe inept dodgeballers can enjoy it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No other word can describe this movie. I was laughing from start to finish!This is the kind of wacky sports comedy that "Baseketball" aspired to be, but failed miserably. It helps that the cast is first-rate. Ben Stiller gives what quite possibly may be his funniest performance yet! He's a genuinely versatile comedic actor, yet he seems to be stuck playing the shy, bumbling boyfriend in his most recent work. Just his look alone in this movie, with the handlebar moustache, will make you crack up. And Vince Vaughn is an underrated actor whose straight, deadpan delivery makes the jokes even funnier. There are plenty of hilarious gags that are still making me laugh just thinking about them. For example, the one where Rip Torn (who wonderfully plays a veteran of the dodge ball game) talks about drinking his own urine. You can classify a multitude of cameos as a cheap shot, but who cares? It's still entertaining. The cameos include everyone from David Hasselhoff to William Shatner to Chuck Norris. Since their names appear in the cast list, there's no use keeping their cameos a secret, but I won't give away where they appear. There's a gratuitous car wash montage involving beautiful girls in bikinis, and a dance number with bikini-clad dodge ball cheerleaders. So the movie is entertaining in all regards. If you're in the mood to laugh and laugh hard, "Dodgeball" is the movie to see.There's some pretty low-brow stuff, yet it's not so low-brow that you feel like your intelligence is insulted.

		<fullReview>As 'Dodgeball' opens we pan around the crummy living room of Vince Vaughn and find him snoozing on the couch as a TV infomercial (with the usual pitchman hyping exercise stuff) drones on in the background. He rises and in leisurely fashion begins his day, and like many of us, never seems to move any faster than at about sixty percent of his potential ? for the rest of the movie. But this is perfect counterpoint to Ben Stiller's energetic creep-role, as we soon see.Vaughn (Peter La Fluer) is owner of a less-then- state of the art ('Average Joe's') gym coveted (as a parking solution) by the owner of neighboring and rival GloboGym (Ben Stiller as White Goodman). We soon find that Average Joe's is in deep financial straits, and it follows, as in nearly all sports movies, that winning a prize is the only possible solution to this dilemma. Of course the team Vaughn assembles for the big Las Vegas Dodgeball Tournament is predictably a ragtag collection of social misfits; rival Ben Stiller in response fields a team of ringers to circumvent the success of Average Joe's. While there are no real surprises in the outcome of the movie, the gags and one-liners we see and hear along the way make this a nice ride. Surprisingly there are a few references to homosexuality (generally movies either steer directly away from or head-on into this theme), and with the other blatant sexual innuendo peppered throughout 'Dodgeball' is a little edgier than the PG-13 rating indicates. The only portion of 'Dodgeball' that is really striking is the introduction of the Las Vegas Tournament and the subsequent few minutes as we see teams (all the sides ? and we remember dodgeball as a junior high rainy-day thing where we lined up on each side of the gym and pummeled each other - have themes) eliminated in rapid fashion. This is truly funny stuff, and a definite shift up in the imagination gears occurs. The film then downshifts to the previous rather leisurely pace at which it had been moving.Vaughn is really the key actor in 'Dodgeball', although Stiller does give a fine effort as the revolting GloboGym owner. The work of the supporting cast (most notably Rip Torn, who in his career has done anything given the opportunity) does add to the overall number of laughs. Judging by the audience reaction (a nice mixed bag of kids, teens and older adults) 'Dodgeball' is about as funny as 'The Bad News Bears', which is not a bad thing.Rating: 3 Stars.</fullReview>

But then why did I give this movie a 4 out of 10? Maybe it is the type of humor I enjoy, but most of these jokes were corny or just stupid.

		<shortDescription>Don't Dodge "Dodgeball"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went and saw "Dodgeball" with a friend of mine about a week ago. We both went in with the expectation that we were just going to be able to laugh a little and have fun with each other because we both thought that the movie looked pretty silly. Or we thought it would just end up being way stupid.After watching "Dodgeball" we both ended up loving it. It takes a simple concept, and makes it HILARIOUS! You really get behind the dudes at Average Joe's Gym and you really can't wait for them to serve the dudes at GloboGym their a$$es on a platter.I for one, have always been a Vince Vaughn kind of girl myself, and watching this movie made me love him even more. He was so funny with how he just played Peter La Fleur straight. It was the best. Even Ben Stiller, who can annoy me when he plays characters like these, really made me giggle.The rest of the cast did awesome too. They were all really funny and really stood out against the two "stars" of the flick, Vaughn and Stiller. And I think I have to give a big shout out to Jason Bateman, who had me and my buddy cracking up as the co-announcer Pepper Brooks, during the dodgeball matches. I don't think I laughed harder than when he was talking.For those of you who are on the fence about seeing "Dodgeball" because you think it either looks a) too stupid to waste your money on, or b) just too juvenile for your tastes, I suggest you go in with an open mind.You'll really be surprised what it fills you with. Don't dodge "Dodgeball"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been reading the comments for this movie, and some people seem to think that this is just "another sports underdog movie." That's not the point. It's a spoof. It's making fun of every other sports movie ever made. Why do you think they deliberately call it An Underdog Story, and why else would it be about dodgeball? They took every piece of the formula (the financial dilemma, the goofy teammates, the greedy villain) and mercilessly shredded them. And it's hilarious because it works. Getting hit in the head with a wrench and numerous shots to the crotch can only take you so far. The real humor is in the subtleties, like having Lance Armstrong commiserate with someone for wanting to quit. That's just classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's low-brow fun that's self-aware; it does what it does, and at the same time makes fun of the conventions of underdog comedies, and of a lot of other things -- sports, sports TV, the fitness craze, and so on.A lot of the crude jokes are actually pretty smart: they get laughs not just by being crude, but by being unexpected. This movie didn't change my life, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. I didn't laugh helplessly, but I did laugh out loud a number of times.The actors were good enough: Rip Torn is always fun, Ben Stiller reminded me of all the EST-addled people I knew back in the '70s and '80s. I thought his final fate was a little cruder than crude, even for a movie like this. But you'll only find out what happens to him if you stay until the end of the credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious, yet Ben Stiller wasn't the funniest thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Dodgeball yesterday, and I thought it was great. All the acting was great, and there were plenty of great laughs. The thing that kind of surprised me, though, was that Ben Stiller wasn't the funniest thing; he wasn't even in the movie as much as I thought he would be. He was still great though. He also has buffed up much. The movie is about a man named Peter LeFleur (Vince Vaughn) who owns Average Joe's Gym. White Goodman (Ben Stiller) owns Globo Gym, a more popular gym right next door to Average Joe's. Stiller threatens to close Average Joe's, unless Peter can come up with $50,000 in 30 days. Peter decides to give up on trying, until one of the members of his gym suggests that they compete in the annual Dodgeball Competition, with a cash prize of, you guessed it, $50,000. A pretty laywer (Christine Taylor) decides to join their team, mainly because she hates White Goodman. Will Pete's team win, or will Globo Gym destroy them? Go see this hilarious movie and find out! 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hit-and-miss, but basically a good time (**1/2)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is this movie stupid? Yes. Are there tons of jokes and lines that fall flat? Yes. But is it painful? No. And is it pretty damn funny in places and does it have lots of fun characters? Definitely. The title pretty much says it all here. It's about dodgeball, and in the great tradition of sports comedies like "Caddyshack", it's also a class struggle, about the underdogs vs. the rich ***holes. I thought I was getting tired of Ben Stiller, but he's great here as playing a send-up of the typical villain in those types of movies. It's a lot of fun to watch him with puffed-up blondish hair, a Leather-Man-from-the-Village-People mustache, and an affected "tough" speaking tone play the kind of idiotic bad guy we all love to hate. "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story" isn't a great movie, or anything even approaching that, but it does work more than you expect it to, and it's more or less worth plunking down the change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not suitable for a PG 13 rating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is too crude to be PG 13. I feel that all of the sexual innuendos were not necessary. I took my son (13) and his friend (13) to see this and I was appalled by its content. The story line on its own could have generated a decent film. The addition of the foul language and sexual innuendos detracted from the content. The ending with the girls being bi-sexual was also unnecessary. Let's not even mention the pizza scene. The sub-line (a true underdog story) is also misleading. It leads you to believe there may be some truth in the script. The only truth is that this movie is degrading to women, men and physically disabled persons, along with anyone who is not a beautiful, perfect specimen of a human being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I scanned the movie listings the other day perusing the newest titles, my selection seemed limited. Finally, my friend and I concluded that we would see Dodgeball in the tradition of a thought-free, relaxing evening. As we entered the movie theater, my expectations for this movie were nothing short of average. I supposed I would laugh occasionally, while easily following a basic, juvenilisitc comedy-driven plot.Only half of my hypothesis was accurate. While the basic innerworkings of the movie were no more complicated than those of Tommy Boy, I found myself laughing with such rigor at times that I had to tear my eyes from the screen in an effort to slow my laughter and gulp down some oxygen. Even while serious, intentionally unfunny scenes took place, I sat staring eagerly at the screen with that oblivious, airheaded expression you sometimes catch on a dog when you're scratching him behind the ears.I can say without hesitation that the funniest aspect of this movie is Ben Stiller's character, White Goodman. His mannerisms, gestures, and greatest of all, comebacks, are a marvel in themselves. His lines, while funny simply by nature, are expanded into humor bombshells as one line after the next hits you right in the funny bone.I recommend this movie not only to anyone under the age of 18, for obvious reasons, but to adults alike for its over-the-top style and in-your-face attitude. With more cameos than you can count, I guarantee a night filled with laughter and enjoyment. Be sure to stick around for the credits. Trust me.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, if you have any feelings of political correctness aboutyou, then you will not like this movie. If you are open minded andlike screwball comedy, then this movie is for you. If you have sometwinges of PC and still like screwball comedies, then you'd be likeI am...feeling a bit ambivalent about this movie. A word to the wise: stay until after the last credits roll to seeanother scene of the movie with Ben Stiller. I covered my eyes andonly peeked through a couple of times...it was raunchy. Myhusband? Well, he laughed so hard I thought he'd have to gorunning to the bathroom.One couple in front of us [the PC types???] left after the first fiveminutes. And I guarantee you they asked for their money back. The rest of the sparse crew in the theater stayed for the full monty,and mostly laughed. Some jokes fell quite flat. This movie has a ton of jokes in them, one right after the other, andyou really don't get a chance to breathe much less laugh at themall. The basic premise of the movie is how an underdog can chooseto rule the day, if they push themselves hard enough andovercome their own personal demons. I loved that basic story line,and I think that's why I'd ultimately recommend it. Not highlyrecommend it, mind you. I'd recommend either tossing the bucksaway to see it once at the theater, or buying it when it comes out onDVD if you like screwball comedies. I gave it a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come late, leave early; only the second act is worth watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Veteran character actor Rip Torn is the only reason I was able to get through this 'dumb and dumber' Ben Stiller 'comedy.' Torn appears at the beginning of the second act as wheelchair-bound Patches O'Houlihan, former world champion Dodgeball player, enlisted to coach a rag-tag team of neophytes, intent on winning a big Las Vegas tournament. When O'Houlihan begins throwing plumber's wrenches at the out-of-shape players as a training exercise, the laughs are huge and genuine. Unfortunately, the screenplay can't sustain the hilarity, and the movie dissolves into as routine an underdog sports flick as you have ever seen. The 'bad news bears' on a Dodgeball court.Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) is the lovable but inept operator of a small neighborhood gym. He is threatened with annihilation by White Goodman (Stiller), the egomaniacal but insecure CEO of a state-of-the-art health and fitness empire, with a location just across the street. Can Peter and his quirky band of misfit members find a way to raise $50-thousand in 30 days, or will Average Joe's Gym fall to the wrecker's ball and become a parking garage for Globo Gym's members? The answer is in winning the $50-thousand prize in a Dodgeball tourney.This is the first feature from 29-year-old writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber. How he got his screenplay before Stiller and his band of co-producers is unknown to me, and how he managed to write a deal that allowed him to direct is more of a mystery. But he lived through it, and will probably become the next Tom Shadyak (whose directorial debut was 'Ace Ventura, Pet Detective'). Technically, his coverage was pitifully weak, which didn't help the comedy. But he got to work with enough veterans of this kind of low humor that he will be stronger on the inevitable 'Dodgeball 2.' From a critical standpoint, I think this is Stiller's fourth comedy turkey this year, but he must be pleasing someone; 'Along Came Polly' and 'Starsky and Hutch' both made money, as will this; only 'Envy' tanked. Sometimes I think writing drek such as 'Dodgeball' may be easier than writing about it. It certainly is more lucrative.</fullReview>

This movie keeps you busy with the slapstick comedy of hitting people with wrenches, but blows itself out of the water with social commentary and intellectual jokes. If you see only one film this summer that involves Ben Stiller hitting someone in the balls with a Dodgeball, make it this one.Spoiler: the great part about the intellectual jokes in this film, is that i know I didn't get all of them, when I see this movie again, I know I'll laugh just as hard at all the new jokes I find; for example: the first time I watched it I was laughing too hard at the German team being called Team Blitzkrieg, that I didn't even hear the announcer say, "here come to Germans, appeasement be damned!".

		<fullReview>I had low expectations for this movie and was surprised how much I laughed. It is just silly, stupid fun. Dont go expecting a strong story - it is the predictable underdog sports movie but they also have great fun lampooning all that. The great Rip Torn (Larry Sanders Show) chews up the scenery and everyone does strong work. I do feel, however, that the only reason Christine Taylor is in the movie is because she IS Stiller's wife. She did dead-on funny work as Marcia Brady in the Brady Bunch Movies, but since then I always find her kinda drab and one-note. Stiller and Vaughn play off of each other quite well and the cameos by B-Level actors are hilarious! Some really funny bits and I hate to admit it - but it IS really funny to see people absolutely whammed with a ball.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the funniest movies made in recent years. Just an excellent cast. Fine, smart comedy, taking on various subjects in a sly way. Great script withnumerous hilarious lines. Stiller is amazing. Vaugh's best performance since Swingers. As a straight man, he delivers. Gary Cole as an announce for "ESPN -8 'The Ocho" is brilliant, as is the whole concept of an obscure sports network. Great cameo's too, that actually form a key element of the story. Stiller's wife is excellent as the love interest. A very broad comedy that had me literally sliding off my seat in laughter. A very smart film, witty with great timing. Highly recommend this film - if you like Steve Martin's great comedy's, this is for you. I could see this again real soon. Wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trouble with slapstick comedy is that too often it aims too low, with loud obnoxious characters and shallow jokes. The neat thing about Dodgeball is that it aims for the middle and scores a direct hit.This is slapstick comedy that manages to be cool, modern and hip at the same time. There's a certain smoothness to the movie -- it never drags, never gets obnoxious, and has some fun little character development twists to keep it all interesting.It's hard to be critical about Dodgeball because it clearly was never meant to taken for anything except as entertainment.

		<fullReview>Sophomoric, uninspired, exclusive, demeaning and too-much-stiller: the homoerotic humor was completely lost on me. The jokes were predictable; the movie lacked any kind of complexity and was terribly written. And the moral, like the movie, was bull***t. Although the movie may indicate that it's okay to be an Average-Joe, they really think you're disgusting and worth-mocking if you are overweight. Enough with the fat jokes Hollywood. It wasn't funny in Austin Powers. At least it was redeeming in Shallow Hal. "Normal" in Dodgeball only exists outside of terrible caricatures: the nerd, black guy, the crazy disabled guy, love-smitten teen, and all the east European, Asian and xenophobic biases you can imagine.Quite a let-down after Zoolander ... but that was VH1 sponsored. This had ESPN &amp; FoxSports' backing ... I'm not surprised. Damn you Chuck Norris!</fullReview>

Humor wise, I thought that it was better than Starsky and Hutch. How ever, that story was much better. I want to see the unrated version. There were quite a few "hidden" jokes that you had to pick up during the commentating on ESPN 8, which a lot of people missed. However, the story was extremely lame and drab, so don't see it for that. It was way too predictable, and was basically a thing that would never happen. If you see it for the humor, you will leave the theater happy. Otherwise, don't bother seeing it. Also, if you like Ben Stiller, he was great as the arrogant and rich White. Also, Vince Vaughn was great as the average Joe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love hilarious and gut busting movies. Unfortunately I did not think this movie fit either of those categories. Do not get my wrong, I usually enjoy Ben Stiller's comedy but this movie did not work for me. I thought I would be laughing uproariously but in fact for the first part of the movie I might have chortled at the most! Ben Stiller does a fairly decent job as the megalomaniacal Globo-Gym owner, I especially enjoyed his over the top statements in which he would finish by saying, " I'm just kidding....no I'm not". That was pretty funny but the rest of the movie was pretty stale. Vince Vaugn is also a fairly good foil to Stiller's over the top performance. The cast of 'average joe's' are just that, average and uninteresting. The wannabe pirate guy was just annoying to say the least.The plot bothered me the most because the script writers put absolutely no effort into writing this story. I would not have minded as much if there was a tongue in cheek, sort of "wink, wink" to the audience but I did not really see that. The plot is just a narrow sort of progression to the final dodge ball tournament but nothing really interesting happens in between. I guess the funniest part of the movie was people getting hit in the crotch and head with dodge balls. I must note that while I was not laughing at several parts of the film, other people were; maybe I was missing something. Overall I would give this film an average grade of: ** out of *****</fullReview>

Though the movie has it's dull points, as -most- movies do, it's a great watch, worth however much you paid to see it.

Though people might complain or state that Vince looked half-asleep during the entire movie, he was supposed to. Ben Stiller's character was hilarious, though dull at points. At certain moments, though, I felt ashamed to watch him. (The Pizza Part, The Credits)Overall, the movie was a great watch, as long as you don't expect the best of the best.

		<fullReview>To start with, I cannot stand Ben Stiller. If I had realized he was in this I wouldn't have bothered. But we arrived late for our intended movie and Dodgeball was starting soon, so we decided to see it.Within the first 15 minutes I was pretty repulsed and I even considered walking out, because I couldn't take another hour of stupid jokes and an obvious, simple plot. But I would have missed out on a hilarious movie! The fact that you're supposed to dislike Ben Stiller's character certainly helped me stop wincing when he came on the screen. So I lightened up and gave it a chance. In a short time I went from rolling my eyes and smirking at each ridiculous joke to laughing out loud even at every *thunk* of a dodgeball into someone's head.The movie doesn't get annoying stupid and actually has some pretty intelligent wit woven in. I loved the instructional film the teenage kid dug up on How To Play Dodgeball. And the sidekick comments of the ESPN-8 sportscast were great. Oh! and Lance Armstrong's sardonic empathy for La Fleur -- my jaw dropped when Lance popped up on the screen! The movie really picked up speed as it progressed and the laughs and fun just kept coming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004) stars Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Rip Torn and Christine Taylor (Ben's real life wife). The film is about a man named Peter LeFleur (Vince Vaughn) that has, Average Joe's, a sports gym that's going downhill on the business end. However, across the street at White Goodman's (Ben Stiller) Globo Gym, a top-notch corporate gym that emphasizes, "You're not important. We are!" Pete's gym needs to raise $50,000 to pay off the mortgage. How do they suggest to get the money? Dodgeball tournament!! White Goodman, however, wants to make Pete's gym into a parking lot. So he plots to overrun Pete's team in the tournament.Not only did this film keep me entertained for a little over 1 1/2 hours (which is a big accomplishment), it had me laughing the whole time. Most of the jokes are dead-on and the acting is very good. Ben Stiller is amazing. He is so outrageously pompous and stupid that anything he says either doesn't make sense or is overly exaggerative.Be sure to see this film this summer. It is well worth the price of admission!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full of classic dodge/goofball hilarity (MINOR SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailers for this one I was excited instantly. A chance to see Ben Stiller play something a little different than the normal character he seems to be stuck in, plus I am a big fan of Vince Vaughn. Well, for some reason this enthusiasm died once the movie actually came out.Then my buddy tells me it's hilarious and so today I took his word for it. He was absolutely right.Vince Vaughn plays a laid back kind of guy against Stiller's more aggressive conceited jackass. The teams they lead are both full of wacky characters and there are many funny bits throughout the entire film. The supporting cast, comprised of a few unknowns, were perfect in the parts they played.Overall, the only negative thing I could say about "Dodgeball" would be Ben Stiller's performance. It seemed to me that he was trying to steal the spotlight from Vaughn. He just goes a little too far over the top here (although he does have a few great scenes and some classic lines, and if you stick around after the credits you will never think of the Milkshake song the same way again as long as you live).Vince Vaughn definitely owns this one. His chemistry with Ben Stiller's real-life wife would be something Ben might want to keep in check, if you know what I mean. His Existential attitude shines in this roll and i could really relate to his apathy.I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes movies like Happy Gilmore, Major League, Rudy, or Radio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball is a great sports comedy. If you can call dodgeball a sport. When you make a movie about the big spectator sports like baseball and football, there's only so far you can go because you have to stay withing the widely recognized rules of the game. When you have something like dodgeball you can go hog wild, because the event itself is already so over the top. Vince Vaughn is great as the too-nice-for-his-own-good owner of a small time gym that is, unfortunately, located directly across the street from Ben Stiller's Globe Gym wannabe. In an effort to save his business, he signs himself, and some of his regulars up in a dodgeball tournament to win enough money to get out of debt. Well Stiller's character will have none of that, and signs up his own team to stop them. There you go. That's the plot. It's as deep as a mouse's grave. The movie lives on the charm of it's two leads. Fortunately, Vaughn and Stiller are more than up to the challenge. Vaughn plays it relatively straight, but sneaking in the snide one liners with a smoothness that would make the like of Bill Murray and Chevy Chase proud. Stiller gives a severely over the top performance that perfectly fits the over the top character. If I had to say something negative about his performance, it's only that it's basically the same performance he gave as the demented, fitness crazed leader of a fat kids camp in the Dusney movie "Heavyweights". But he was so good there, I liked seeing a revisit of that character. Rip Torn is great as the old time dodgeball player whose coaching style will have you doubled over laughing. Chritine Taylor doesn't have much to do but look hot. But she's DAMN good at it. You are one lucky man Ben Stiller. Then there are the dodgeball games themselves. There are more than enough vicious hits, beanings, and low blows to have the audiences rolling in pain and laughter. Is it low brow humor? Of course. So when it comes on DVD, get your buddies together, get the chips, tap the keg, and set down with a double feature of this and BASEketball, and have a great old time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has brief gross gags, funny one liners, that would make you bust a gut laughing. Also surprise guest stars that would make your eyes bug up. Do not take this movie seriously, if you do then you'll have problems. It all starts with Peter LaFLeur(Vince Vaughn) the owner of The Average Joe's gym, who finds out he must a five thousand dollar loan, or the crazy moronic owner of Global gym who is named White Goodman(the very funny Ben Stiller) will take control of all of it. Just when Peter nearly decides to throw in the towel. One of his friends thought maybe they should enter a Dodgeball tournament. But White Goodman and his team are entering also. Former Dodgeball champion(Rip Torn) offers to train them. The funniest movie I've seen in a while, I don't think I've laughed so hard since Kung Pow. For viewers I'll say one thing, sit back laugh and have fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those rare movies that I predict will be good.How can I possibly choose a favorite part? it was really well-done... especially the "5 Rules." This movie kind of gives me, and virtually everyone in this day and age new hope! This is a welcome change from all the crap I'm used to seeing.This movie is a 9 at best... 'cause I love a good goofball comedy now and then. I encourage all who haven't seen this to take a look at it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Listen this movie will make you laugh. Its not great but its entertaining. In this movie a man must save his gym. He owes $50,0000 or he will lose everything. Well he and his staff form a "DODGEBALL" team so they can win $50,000 in a Dodgeball contest. When the only two "funny movies: out there is this movie and "Soul Plane" what a sad comment that is on AMerican Movies. However this is a fun movie. Anybody over the age of 12 will know how this will end but thats fine. Anybody under the age of 12 should see "Thunderbirds". Please note there is mild violence in this but its for comic effect. Put this way the violence is on par with "America's Funniest Home Videos"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yea, right!Well, finally, we've got Ben Stiller back in full-tilt character mode (i.e., Zoolander) where he belongs. Another Stiller-is-hapless-dork "There's Something about Mary" or "Meet the Parents" (oh wait, there will be another MTP...) and Ben needs to be put out to pasture.He is hilarious and ridiculous (as he should be) as the megalomaniacal self-obsorbed/-obsessed workout junkie and owner of cross-street non-rival "Globogym" to lackadaisacal Vince Vaughn's "Average Joe's Gym" (actually, not a bad name for a gym if you think about it). Ben is custom-fit for this role. Stiller of course keeps the nepotism machine running with his wife in a lead role. Still, she's mildly charming as the straight arrow to the over-the-top White Goodman (Stiller) and careless la Fleur (Vaughn).The story/plot is hardly worth mentioning because it's been played out so many times before. Bunch of hapless losers go up against overwhelming odds to win back the gym. In fact, the whole setup is so wildly improbable that you don't really care. I was a bit surprised to find out that "Dodgeball" the game is almost de-emphasized in the movie; it's mostly just a bunch of gratuitous shots to the head and groin. The ridiculous gross-out humor is so utterly dismissable too--why even bother with the junk when there's enough decent comedy material here to easily float the movie to solid PG-level entertainment? Oh well, I suppose advice to eliminate the 13-20 y.o. frat boy demographic will fall on deaf ears. In any case, "Dodgeball" is a funny, probably worthwhile rent when it hits the shelves and maybe even a funny enough movie to spend your money on in the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i think that this movie had a few funny parts but was mainly just the usual kind of story line. I could see what was coming before it happened because i could just tell how it would end up. I say good effort, that why it was so hard to cut it. i think that Ben Stiller took a break from his love stories and weird model movies for a light, funny story. I think that he acted his part well but the whole movie just didn't turn out the way it could have. Hopefully his next movie will be better. I here the meet the parents sequel is coming, maybe that will be as funny as the first. But anyway i was disappointed with dodgeball but you cant be pleased with them all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning: Stupid Movie Alert!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible Spoilers?? My movie enjoyment meter registered as Major Disappointment after seeing Dodgeball. This has got to be the most stupid movie I have ever seen. I had seen the trailer and shouldn't have been surprised. It is another Ben Stiller movie where his talent as an actor is overshadowed by sophomoric humor. The theatre was 1/3 full on a typical summer weekday and the only people laughing were the 11 and 12 year olds; the adults just looked embarrassed. Even the YAMs (young adult males) weren't laughing. The gags were old, yeah maybe the wrenches were a little funny (how COULDN'T they dodge the wrenches??), but the rest were just sad.Alan Tudyk as Steve the Pirate was the brightest spot in the entire movie; his realization that he wasn't a pirate was a classic, right up there with Stan Laurel. I hadn't seen him in anything since "28 Days" and was pleasantly amused at his performance in Dodgeball. The rest of the cast? Forget it. It was clear that none of the rest of the cast had to stretch their acting talents to be in this movie. When is Ben Stiller going to realize that he can leave this type of script on the reject pile? It has gotten to the point where it is a waste of money to see him in a comedy since it is the same thing over and over. Ben, listen up...look up the word "subtle" and try to apply it to your next project. And stop trying to "dumb down" your audience--you have talent, try to use it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dodgeball? Actually, Goofball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dodgeball" is going great guns at the box office as moviegoers with time on their hands in the summer and not enough first-rate flicks to see seek harmless, amusing entertainment that leaves little impression when the lights go on.Ben Stiller is an evil gym owner with a high tech operation who covets neighboring Average Joe's place, owned by a kind but incompetent businessman named...Joe. That's Vince Vaughn. Stiller's wife in real life, Christine Taylor, shows up-she's a bank attorney checking out Joe's messed up or really non-existent financial records.Average Joe's will be seized for non-payment of a mortgage and snarling, pumped up, hyper Stiller wants the place for a parking lot. $50,000 will save the day and just by coincidence that's the prize purse at the national dodgeball championship to be held in Las Vegas.You know the rest. Average Joe puts together a team of first-class nudnicks to win the prize money while the Global Gym creep confidently plans to snag the championship with his menacing crew. Of course Kate the lawyer winds up on Average Joe's team having rejected the slimy advances of his rival. It's a nice role for Taylor who has appeared mostly in B- minus films despite her highly respected and too little known breakthrough performance in 1996's "Cat Swallows Parakeet and Speaks."The best role is that of wheelchair-bound once great dodgeball champ Patches O'Houlihan, played with vulgar gusto by the aging but still fine Rip Torn.Director Rawson Marshall Tucker knew how to make a box office hit-whether he can do anything seriously engrossing is another question. Actually it isn't.Does girl (lawyer) get boy (Average Joe morphing into a hunk)? You didn't think a low brow comedy like this would skip the inevitable romance, did you? Well the ending surprised - and clearly upset (ha ha) - some of the parents in the theater.Lance Armstrong and Chuck Norris do cameos with Armstrong flatly recounting his medical history. He can ride but he can't act.Amusing, slight madcap sports film with some funny lines and some good physical comedy-that's all.6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Exactly What You Expect. Go To Be Entertained.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story" was fairly entertaining. Essentially, that's my review, however, that may lead some people to believe that this is actually a good movie. It's not. Judged in the sense of cinema, this is a horrible movie. The screenplay is absolutely atrocious, most of the jokes are unfunny and rehashed bits (Did anyone see "Baseketball"??? Same thing, but way better), bad acting, the whole nine. It's just a bad film. Plain and simple. But NOBODY went into the theater expecting to see "Citizen Kane"! The thought of that is absolutely absurd. We came for cheap and stupid humor. Ben Stiller reprises his role of the nutty camp counselor from the 1995 gem "Heavyweights" and gets his totally smokin' hot wife Christine Taylor to play the token hottie that these movies typically have. Vince "You used to be so money and you didn't even know it" Vaughn's acting is noticeably terrible in this and I'm just thinking "What happened? You were so awesome in 'Swingers." But that doesn't matter because it's still funny, even though he's playing the straight man (to Ben Stiller's cheap penis pump/pizza masturbation jokes.) But who cares! That's entertainment!The best part of this movie is, without a doubt (Much like in "Best in Show") the dodgeball tournament announcers, played by Harvey Birdman himself, Gary Cole and...well, the other guy's name is Pepper, and that is totally awesome. Their lines are the funniest, even though the whole bit is the same thing bit that was in "Pootie Tang" where one character makes a long, drawn out explanation of something and the other character says the exact same thing in two words.There is one huge problem that is haunting this movie. That problem is the COMPLETE LACK OF DODGEBALL ACTION!!! I mean, our underdog team, the Average Joes play six games of dodgeball in the entire movie. Do we see any long, dramatic games of dodgeball? NO! It's like a highlights reel and totally weak. Gah, now I'm really starting to hate this movie, and thinking about it, if I was watching this alone and not with a big group, I'd have hated it to death. It's an awful film...but if you see it with a bunch of people that think it's funny, some of that entertainment will rub off onto you. Enjoy or suffer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by Dodgeball. It's not a gut-busting laugh riot, but you'll spend a lot of time chuckling and smiling, and you'll root for these underdogs to win the big game. Great cast, too, particularly Vince and Christine Taylor in the leads. And any movie that quotes "Bring It On" is doing something right in my book.And while it's fairly low-brow, there's a surprising amount of intelligence in the screenplay. Plenty of jokes that don't bring down the house are worth chewing over later. By the time the movie reaches its big climax on ESPN 8 ("The Ocho"), you should be nicely won over.Overall, a solid sports comedy. Check it out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's predictable, it's crass, it's hilarious. First time director Rawson Marshall Thurber, the creator of one of greatest ad campaigns of all time with Terry Tate, Office Linebacker for Reebok, scores big at the box office and on the laugh charts in his feature debut. The story is extremely simple, the gags are alternately crude and clever, and Ben Stiller turns in perhaps his greatest performance of all time. There isn't a lot to say except that it is very funny from start to finish. If you like comedies in the mold of the Farrelly Brothers, you will certainly like this. If not, best to stay clear of it. But if you like this sort of thing, it's the best comedy of its type in quite some time. Let's hope that Thurber can build on this and create a real name for himself.</fullReview>

I did laugh at some gags but after watching guys get hit in the family jewels continually, the humor wasn't humorous. I'm sure that there are other sports movies that have the same message and are a lot cleaner than this one. I also didn't like Ben Stiller's character....reminds me of one of the kids that picked on me in middle school.2.75 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story StarsLet's get one thing perfectly clear before we even start. I had no intentions of seeing Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. None. Forking over a double-digit cash sum to be reminded of the welts I used to get in junior high playing the ridiculous game was of absolutely no appeal. Couple that with Ben Stiller playing yet another character that is so over the top that I won't know whether to laugh or to feel sorry for the guy, and I had a recipe for a long sit through.However, my trains all lined up perfectly and it was too nice of a day to waste it outside on a patio somewhere, so there I was, standing at an automated ticket counter, scanning my bank card to purchase a ticket for a movie that that I was surprised to see Ebert &amp; Roper give two thumbs up. (By scanning, I don't have to say the title out loud and embarrass myself in a crowd).Dodgeball has the most simplistic of stories to understand. Man needs money to save gym. Man enters team into tournament. Man wins tournament and gets the woman. In short, I guess the premises of the film could have been written on cave walls some 7000 years ago, and based on its brand of humor?..it just may have.The 'man' is Peter LeFleur played by Vince Vaughn, he of Starsky &amp; Hutch, Zoolander and any other film that a Stiller or an Owen brother is attached. Peter owns a local gym that has caught the eye of White Goodman (Stiller) the driving force behind a state of the art gym facility that is franchised across the street. Due to accounting ignorance, Peter's gym, Average Joe's, is in financial woe and Goodman buys the second mortgage leaving Pete with the only option of amassing $50,000 in 30-days to save the establishment. So determined to be the David to the Goodman's Goliath, Peter and his friends come up with the hair-brained idea of entering a Dodgeball contest in Las Vegas in hopes of brandishing the prize money to thwart the bank's foreclosure. But things are not as easy as it would seem, and dodgeball is not like the game you and I might remember from the day. The rules are pretty much the same. Six balls, five players per team. Hit the person on the other side of the court and they are out. Catch a ball and you can get one of your members back in. But that is where the similarities end. Teams now consist of rugged, fierce characters with each team having a theme (girl scouts, kamikazes etc). Dodgeball is now a spectator sport with qualifying rounds and a 32-team tournament that even has ESPN 8 interested with coverage. In short, it's come a long way, baby.So the stage was set for what was an inevitable set up pitting team Average Joe against the team fielded by Gobo Gym's, Goodman. Bring on the balls!Dodgeball made me laugh. Plain and simple. Stupid? Yes. But funny? Definitely. If it wasn't chuckling to myself when instructor Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn) is training the young group by having them dodge wrenches, I was laughing out loud at the best commentary during a sporting event (courtesy of Gary Cole and Jason Bateman) since Bob Uecker in Major League. From Stiller's ridiculous Goodman to Vaughn's straight man Peter, there is a perfect mix of characters and comedy that might just make this film a bigger hit this summer than the studio anticipated.Still not convinced? Well how about cameos by William Shatner, Chuck Norris, Lance Armstrong and even German adored David Hasselhoff. Each of these bit parts were non-gratuitous and damn down funny. To watch Lance give a speech on how he was diagnosed with four areas of cancer at the same time and yet still managed to win the Tour de France for five straight years is self-depreciating acting at its finest without degrading the actual person.To recommend Dodgeball at the office water cooler is to guarantee yourself a reputation as someone who's opinions ought to be questioned. But if you strip the movie down to just its essentials (that is, take the love story out, cause you know how that is going to end. Take the suspense of what decision Pete is going to make, cause you know how that is going to end), then the movie is a great way to spend a day during the summer with some friends. For trust me, in about 6 months time, everyone will be talking about how they rented this movie and laughed alongside their friends and loved ones at the same carnage that brought me sympathy in Junior High. Besides, what other sport could have a team motto as fun as 'Aim Low'?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always hated the game of dodgeball - I find degrading, horrifying, and of course, I was always a little girl in those coed gym classes who got smacked in the head. So I thought I would really hate this movie - but when others are getting hit in the head with a ball I could truly appreciate how funny it is as the bully. I did feel their pain though. This is no high brow humor movie - there is little brain work needed to watch, so I would say drop your maturity down a few notches and you will appreciate the art of slapstick. There are some brief celebrity appearances that are fun to watch too, and this is the first Stiller movie I laughed out loud the whole time since Zoolander. Warning: If you are not a fan of that movie, then you'll probably hate this one because it is the same crazy humor. The characters are so outrageous, the story so ridiculous, that I loved the whole thing. Watch the entire credits sequence too, because at the end there is another little bit with Stiller that is great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, we know it's Ben Stiller and we know it's Vince Vaughn. This looks like an Old School meets Heavyweights at first. However, I still recommend this movie to every comedy fan. The movie has the outright physical humor of people getting hit in the head and groin with rubber balls, but has the subtle humor as well. At first, Vaughn isn't very convincing as his character and seems like he's just there to deliver the punch-line. However, the quick one-liners by Vaughn matched up against the increasingly idiotic (but humorous) responses from Stiller combine for some memorable scenes. The actual plot is predictable, but this surprisingly does not take away from the comedy. The supporting cast may lack in acting skills, but builds a good foundation for the ongoing jokes in the movie. If you liked Old School, and the good Stiller comedies, then go see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walking into the theater to see Dodgeball, my expectations were that it would make me laugh and that is exactly what it delivered. This movie features 2 members of the Frat Pack in the form of Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn. Vaughn plays Peter LaFleur, the owner of Average Joe's Gym. It is a run-down facility and its members fit the loser bill quite nicely. Stiller plays White Goodman, the owner and operator of Globo Gym, which is a state-of-the-art health center run by snobs and chiseled goons. Basically LaFleur is in debt with the bank and he has 30 days to pay off the 50,000 dollars or else he loses the gym to Goodman. Stiller's off-screen wife Christine Taylor plays Kate Veach, who is the accountant from the bank in charge of handling the settlement. LaFleur and the guys decide to enter a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas which guarantees a 50,000 dollar payoff to the winner. Goodman enter Globo Gym in the same tournament to thwart their chances. After rejecting Goodman's advances, Kate decides to join Average Joe's team and turns out to be a secret weapon. That is all the storyline you need to know. Rip Torn plays Patches Hoolahan, an old dodgeball player who decides to "train" the Average Joe team. His methods are a bit unorthodox to say the least, as they involve dodging wrenches and oncoming cars. Once the film gets to the dodgeball action, it is filled with crotch shots and blistering body shots. Throw in a little romance between Vaughn and Taylor and you've got yourself a classic 80's style movie. Stiller is hilarious as the testosterone-charged Goodman and his facial expressions had me laughing the whole time. Gary Cole and Jason Bateman are a nice touch as the commentators at the tournament and William Shatner,David Hasselhoff, and Chuck Norris provide pleasing cameos. Hollywood doesn't make many movies like this anymore and it's a shame because this one works on most levels.P.S. Remember: Dodge,Duck,Dip,Dive,Dodge!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly hilarious...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I was worried. C'mon?a movie about a dodge ball team? But my intense love of Alan Tudyk spurred me to see this movie. I was expecting Zoolander...but crappy. I was pleasantly surprised.This movie is actually more intelligent then it lets on?there were more than a few clever references (Deus ex Machina for one?Maginot line [sp?] for another) and not a small amount of Nazi-bashing sub-text.That being said, this is not an overall intelligent movie. It's about dodge ball. People get hit in the groin. A lot. There's a guy named Steve the Pirate. It has a cameo by William Shatner. Do not, DO NOT look for cinematic genius. However, I still loved it. It was hilarious. The random sports they made up?squirrel water skiing, midget tossing...*snicker* And that they weren't afraid to go to the disturbing place...with pizza...it was really quite funny.Why am I raving? I had ultra-low expectations. It made me laugh solidly from opening to closing credits. Good times.And now, to rave about my reason for attending the movie: Alan Tudyk. Yes, he played a man who thought he was a pirate. He played a character that the writers were clearly high when they thought up, but (SPOILERS AHEAD)****** ...when he was hurt and made fun of...well I actually felt bad. I felt bad for the freaking pirate-man! I was amazed that any actor could do anything with that part. That he could create an emotional connection impressed me. I mean, the guy was a freaking pirate-wannabe! ******END SPOILERSDon't think that I'm easily impressed by movies. I'm not. Normally a movie like Dodgeball would get nothing but scorn and derision from me...but I really enjoyed it. Definitely a great bad movie. Anyone who needs a laugh, go, don't expect too much, and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, the very concept of making a movie about dodgeball, and one with a good chunk of it devoted to watching people play dodgeball, sounds like one of the most asinine ideas ever conceived for a movie, but then again movies have also been made about a duck from a parallel universe with a duck-themed version of the earth coming to the regular human-version of the earth and the ensuing culture clash, adaptations of terrible 60's cartoons about prehistoric blue-collar families or an idiotic group of teenagers, their rascally dog, and their fabulous van solving mysteries involving haunted amusement parks, as well as one about a guy and girl who have a tormented relationship and undergo a futuristic form of treatment to have each other erased from their memories, only to eventually get back together, and repeat the process over and over again. Alright, that last one was swell, as is Dodgeball, the little dodgeball movie that could. For a movie about what this movie is about, it couldn't possibly be any better. It's one of those rare comedies that maintains a strong level of laughs all the way through, many of them being of the best kind, the random, unexpected bizarro gags that always drive audiences wild! Why anyone would think the vastly inferior BASEKETBALL is better than this is beyond me. While both are spoofs of traditional sports movies, Dodgeball tells a real story with real characters we root for and in some cases, especially in the case of Steve the Pirate and Patches O'Houlihan, that we haven't seen before.BASEKETBALL, on the other hand, is just bits of pieces of other spoof movies, with no real creative pulse of its own, and a result, despite the sterling work of master actor Bob Costas, is wildly uneven, and after about ten minutes or so, pretty damn boring.Where Dodgeball flies by with its own goofy sense of itself, BASEKETBALL plods, taking us on a lame journey to nowhere particularly interesting. If you like your movies watered down and half-assed, (the game of BASEKETBALL, the basis of the movie, isn't particularly funny, and doesn't even make much sense), then BASEKETBALL is the one for you, or just watch MAJOR LEAGUE or any of its sequels, which are more or less the same movie, and are just about as uneven and not worth your time.

		<fullReview>am i the only one who did not find this movie absolutley hilarious? Yes there are funny parts but in all it was quite poorly written. Vaughns lines, though fitting, were dull. Stiller's performance not only reminded me of Zoolander, but Christine Taylor's was equally similar to hers in the 2001 movie. Great one liners throughout the movie but for me, the film lacks substance. Should it have been a great dramatic piece? by all means no! but fluff isnt wonderful either. If you like obvious humor, you'll enjoy this movie. if i were a prudish movie critic id give the movie 2 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Baseketball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baseketball was good (I re-watched it last night after watching Dodgeball yesterday afternoon) but it wasn't nearly as funny as Dodgeball. Matt Stone and Trey Parker are better left to voice-overs and using scissors then actual comedic acting, especially when it comes to sarcasm; Vince Vaughn is the king of that, and he shines in that role as normal. If you can put up with Ben Stiller being a character that just makes you cringe, like him in Zoolander, then you can deal with his obnoxiousness in this movie. A lot of people liked Zoolander. I sure didn't, I think he was funnier in more traditional comedies like Something about Mary and Meet the Parents. Also, was he wearing a body suit? I never heard of someone putting on muscle for a comedic role. Anyway, obnoxious as he was he still made me laugh. The rest of the cast were funny also, Milton Waddams from Office Space was in there, I couldn't stop thinking about Swingline staplers when I saw him. Also, I always thought Marcia Brady might have been a carpet muncher. Sexy box licker though. The rest of the cast were all nobodies, kind of like me, so they were all right.10/10 in the slapstick comedy genre</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was by far the funniest movie i have seen in a long time. From start to finish I just couldn't stop laughing. Ben Stiller plays a ridiculously hilarious character, and there are many other notable performances be Vince Vaughn and others. Words cannot describe the hilarity that is dodgeball. I recommend everyone go see it, it is just great, the characters are all great in their own odd ways, such as Steve the Pirate. The movie starts out with a just brilliant opening commercial. I recommend that everyone see this movie, no matter what genre you are into, you will find something in this movie to laugh about, be it the characters, or the genius humor you will instantly fall in love with a sure fire classic comedy in Dodgeball.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must respectfully disagree with lost4wurds...this movie and Baseketball are both about sports, but the humor is different. Dodgeball is a movie for people who liked Road Trip and Old School.Vince Vaughn wasn't as crisp and sharp as I've seen in other movies, but Ben Stiller, Rip Torn, Gary Cole and Justin Bateman are all hilarious. I would have liked more Gary Cole and Justin Bateman as the announcers, I must admit.Also, Christine Taylor wasn't given enough to do and she definitely has the ability to play funny. Hank Azaria plays the young Rip Torn and I wish we had had more of him. Hank's "informational film" about dodgeball was a priceless mimic of 1950's educational films.This isn't Ben Stiller's best effort, but overall, I enjoyed the movie. If you have an "odd" sense of humor, you will enjoy; otherwise, I suggest you wait and rent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was stupid, plain and simple. However, being a cinemaphile, it's important to differentiate good stupid and bad stupid. Good stupid is great, fresh brainless fun, such as "Old School." Bad stupid is the same joke told over and over again for the sake of making a profit, such as "American Wedding." This movie was good stupid. I happened to be in the mood for something light and funny and got exactly what I needed, and then some. I don't like nor appreciate Ben Stiller's humor, but Vince Vaughn and the supporting cast made up for it. The camera work alone (the shots of the balls nailing people better than Terry Tate in his best commercial spot) made it worthwhile, but if you need something a little extra: Gary Cole &amp; Jason Bateman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dodgeball: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing greater in comedies than people being hit in the groin. Expand that into 90 minutes and you've got the basic plot of Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. No, strike that. It's 90 minutes of groin hits, Ben Stiller being stupid (it's what he does best), and wrench throwing. But in silly, uncomplicated comedies like this, anything slapstick works, and most of the movie does. Sure, it's no slapstick classic, but from a rookie writer/director (Rawson Marshall Thurber, who also did the successful "Terry Tate: Office Linebacker" ad during the Super Bowl), it's far from bad.Peter (Vince Vaughn) owns "Average Joe's" gym, a rundown shack of a place which is unfortunate enough to be next to corporate Globo Gym, run by White Goodman (Ben Stiller). Average Joe's is in danger of closing unless it gets $50,000. The ragtag gym regulars decide to start a dodgeball team and go to Vegas for a dodgeball tournament, where the winners get (surprise, surprise) $50,000. But White makes his own team as they go head-to-head. Kate (Christine Taylor, Stiller's real life wife) is thrown into the mix and eventually joins the Average Joe's.Unlike most movies now, most of Dodgeball's jokes were not in the trailers. The funniest character has to be Patches (Rip Torn) as a paraplegic former Dodgeball champion who trains the Average Joes. Every line he says is insulting and derogatory, but he's really very funny. Second is Steve the Pirate (Alan Tudyk), a guy on the team who, well, thinks he's a pirate. That's about all I'll spoil, because most of it is new and clever. Sure, like all comedies, it drags towards the end (and becomes drawn out and dramatic), but in general, the second half had more laughs than the first. Most of them were either from Stiller (his best role since...uh...Starsky and Hutch?) or being hit by balls. Sure, it got old, and the sound effect they always used was annoying, but it was still quite funny.Thurber seems to know how to balance the characters (such as which characters are the most important so those characters get development), and it really shows. It's hard to really explain, but you'll see if you go to the movie. Yet he can't keep away from the typical romance. Kate and White/Peter have such throwaway romances that they aren't even worth talking about. In fact, this whole movie is a throwaway movie. It's very funny, but you probably won't remember that you even saw it soon after. Except for Stiller's "Joanie loves Chachi!" It's seen in the trailers and it's probably the funniest line in the movie due to the context. Overall, Dodgeball is not a memorable movie, but quite a funny one, and it's worth seeing.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for rude and sexual humor, and language.</fullReview>

Yes it followed the traditional "sports underdog" formula but it made fun of the formula as it was going along, so you knew they were in on the joke too.This is probably not a date-movie, and I would probably suggest sneaking in a beer (if you can), but I was laughing from beginning to end, and it was good light-hearted summer entertainment without computer-generated super-heroes or villains.

This movie turned all that around- it was FANTASTIC. Nearly a rip-off of Baseketball? Well, yeah, but then again, name one sports comedy that ISN'T like that. It was absolutely hilarious. Granted, Ben Stiller acts the same way in this flick that he does in Zoolander, but Vince Vaughn was phenomenal, as was Christine Taylor, and Rip Torn, and just everything fit together perfectly. Hank Azaria FINALLY has a role in an actual HIT movie, which is even better. And seeing several celebrities who everyone thought "fell off the face of the Earth" make appearances in the movie, and it's so enjoyable and refreshing to see them again, including Chuck Norris, and David Hasselhoff! Go pay the cash for a ticket to see this- you WON'T be disappointed. Yeah, if you liked Baseketball- as well as every OTHER comedy sports movie known to man...you'll LOVE Dodgeball!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball:A True Underdogs Story is easily the best comedy of 2004, I could not stop laughing. Ben Stiller delivers a great over the top performance, though he is not the funniest man in the movie. Rip Torn, Jason Bateman and Alan Tudyk all give gut busting moments of their own, even though nearly everyone gives a great performance.Each character becomes funny for their own reasons along the way. This movie is just filled with hilarious phrases, comedy when you least expect it and two of the best cameos ever,Lance Armstrong and one that I will not spoil. Dodgeball is a perfect 5/5, 10/10, Awesome/Bean Burito, how ever you put it Dodgeball rocked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, this might be a paint by the numbers, summer flick. You have the routinegood guys vs. bad guys. You have the "if only we could win this tournament, we could...." Yes, in that respect, this film is not creating anything too new. However, where this film succeeds, where so many others like it fail, is due to the great Ben Stiller. Stiller plays an outrageous, narcissistic, borderline homosexual, bad guy. When Stiller is on the screen, laughter abounds. Somewhat strangely, he is not on the screen as much as you think he would be. This movie is told around Vince Vaughn's character, who is trying to hold on to his sleepy little gym, which is being threatened for takeover by Stiller's "Globo-Gym." Vaughn reluctantly agrees to enter a dodgeball tourney to win the $50,000 Grand Prize. Of course, $50,000 is the exact amount him and his oddballs that call the gym home, need to keep it. Well, it is a summer Hollywood film, so you can guess what happens. There are some really nice cameos here and the film is entertaining. Is it as brilliant as "Zoolander"? No, but it is better than "Starskey and Hutch." I guess that is something.</fullReview>

It had all the funny moments I was looking forward to in the previews (wrench-throwing, "Joani loves Chachi") plus a lot of great lines.Vince Vaughan plays his usual smooth, quick wit self like he does in movies like Old School, even though I found it a little weird that he'd be the leader of the "underdogs" at Average Joe's gym, aside from the fact that a) he owns the gym and b) he's a unorganized slacker who's in debt to basically every bill he's ever owed.Ben Stiller is over the top as the revolting White Goodman, and wife Christine Taylor adds some laughs with her repulsion towards him. As for the rest of the cast, Stephen Root does good as usual with the skittish man role, while Justin Long's character (aptly named Justin) is a clone to his role of Warren P. Cheswick on the now defunct TV show Ed. He gave me the most laughs of the cast anyway, but one wonders if he is going to be type cast in that role of the nerdy young man who makes you cringe when he talks to the most popular, prettiest cheerleader in school. (They might as well have named Amber "Jessica," a reference any Ed fans will get)The two cast members that added a bit of silliness were Alan Tudyk as Steve the Pirate (the name says it all) and Rip Torn as the aged Patches O'Houlihan. Torn has some of the best lines of the whole movie, which makes me want to see it again just to catch them, because there were so many I can't remember them all.A key scene to catch is the Dodgeball film from Justin's PE Class, made by Uber-American Films. I don't want to give anything away, so just make sure you look at for that one.Overall I'd say go see this movie if you enjoy similar comedies like Old School. I give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is funny as hell....i got to see sneak preview of this flick last night and i can honestly say it is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. the one liners are great. "2 tons of irony" anyone? this movie is a must see. stiller is so talented- i just am unsure of how he can keep a straight face doing it. Vince vaughn is really funny as well. and as always stephen root plays the bumbling fool well- jimmy james would be proud. the added humor comes from the fact that christine taylor is stillers wife and plays a woman totally repusled by him in the movie. i cannot rave enough about this show- i have not laughed continually through a movie in a long time... highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ben Stiller classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was honestly one of the best Stiller/Vaughn films i have seen. I have to admit i'm a sucker for the ridiculous one liners and stupid jokes but i'm pretty sure that everyone will find this movie funny! Ben Stiller carries the movie along in my opinion, with his stupidity and ignorance making me laugh in every scene he appeared in. Vince Vaughn also came through well in this film as the typical lazy-but-good guy. Justin Long also makes me smirk throughout this film as his weedy character tries to help and keep average Joes so he can practice to up his social standing by being in the cheer leading team. I prefer him in this by a long shot than his performance in die hard 4 or drag me to hell. without a doubt. I laughed my way through this film so i strongly recommend, if you haven't seen it, to sit down and watch it and have a good laugh. You WILL enjoy without a doubt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a professional film critic! That partly explains my ten points to this movie. The reason I took the time to see this movie a few days ago was basically Ben Stiller. He has never let me down, so I expected this to be another "quality" comedy! And it was - at the time! Now, when I have melted the movie I'm not so sure... Was the acting good? Not really! Were there surprises? Nooo... Was it fun? Hell YEAH! This comedy relies on balls (and other objects that people can throw at each other). You can't help it! When a ball hits two other balls, it causes a physical reaction that can be seen in everyone involved! The guys know what I'm talking about: Your both hands instantly go for the nuts, you fall to the floor, your friends go "OOOOOOOOH" and reach for their own... stuff. Then everybody laughs! It's funny! And there are plenty of balls flying around in this film! Don't expect superior acting or exciting plots, just relax and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a man, Peter La Fleur, who needs to pay his debts or else his gym will be bought by a corporate health fitness chain. So, he and some of his friends decides to sign up for a dodgeball tournament in which they need to win $50,000.This is a very funny movie. It has witty dialog and probably some very crude jokes that I found gross. Most jokes are funny and clever that would entertain you or gross you out.The acting by Vince Vaughn and Christine Taylor are good while Ben Stiller and Justin Long are very funny. Ben Stiller is very different in the movie.This film is short and funny, if you want to get some time off and has great jokes. This is a very entertaining film and you should see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball is one of the greatest comedies in a last couple of years. Hilarious,bad taste comedy with such good actors and unbelievable sport theme. The group of Average Joe's represents couldn't be more idiotic and funny.Globo Gym is story for itself. Vince Vaughn should get much more roles from now on.Ben Stiller has proved himself again,and there are other new young stars rising, like Justin Long. Christine Taylor was solid too. The cream on the cake is Lance Armstrong. I would recommend everyone who love comedy in it's basic form,to watch this film.It is going to be 90 minutes that you'll not be sorry wasting. Oh, I almost forgot, Jason Bateman has cameo as well as Chuck Norris.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely LOVE this movie!! I even stepped out of my preferred genre of action/horror/sci-fi movies to add it to my collection. This hilarious movie is better seen unrated, but if you don't want children to see it, or you just don't want to see it, you aren't missing much. Which is wonderful, because you don't want to miss any of this hilarious comedy. Patches' training procedure is enough to make yourself roll on the floor laughing. How Ben Stiller, Rip Torn, and Vince Vaughn say all those hilarious things with a straight face is beyond me, but it's funny as all get out! Although...I must say that I really hope you aren't drinking any liquids or are tired from laughing already....I really do...because the ending credits are priceless!!! It's too funny! I'm still laughing!!!I also found something interesting during my visit to the Special Features. The first thing that you notice is that the layout of the section is Average Joes and the little scene off to the side is Justin's ever-hilarious attempt to catch Patches's dodge balls during training. However, look next to the balloon that says "resume film". You see a balloon that is Globo Gym's logo. Click it, and you are taken to a scene where the fat White Goodman says that every time he snaps his fingers in the movie, hit enter. It happens three times in the movie. 1. When White tries to seduce Kate in his office, 2. At the Dirty Sanchez, after White pushed the waitress onto the Average Joes's table, and lastly, 3. After Kate throws White against her door and he says "nobody makes me bleed in my own blood. Nobody!" After you press enter for the third time, you will be taken to the scene where White does his "Patented 'Peek-a-Boo'" dodge ball throw, then to the t.v in the Globo Gym building (the one where he says "There's a good energy in the gym". You, for quite some time, watch the little show on the screen before you are taken back to the scene where White gets on the Blue motor scooter driven by Me'Shell. The show is funny. I found that you have to press enter right when he snaps his fingers. It's kind of hard to get it right, but it does work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies. I love the random crude jokes and cameo appearances. Yes, its dumb, crude, and vulgar. But dumb, crude, and vulgar happens to be funny very often as well. I have friends that say this was the dumbest movie ever, and i can't completely disagree with them. The humor is VERY low-brow, but also fairly creative (Anouncer saying that the dodgeball dancers were good, clean, family fun). And low-brow happens to be very funny. It's meant to be a satire of sports movies that take themselves and it does a great job of that. If you're looking for cinematic excellence, look elsewhere. If you want to laugh for a couple hours this is one of the best movies out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, hats off to Ben Stiller. This guy is why I watch movies that look stupid. You just never know what he is going to do next. The funny thing about this movie is that after I saw this I started digging around the TV channels to find out there is a real Dodgeball Tournament. To me I found that great. In high school thats all we played was dodge-ball. So when I started watching the movie I got into it even more. My Favorite Part in this move is when Ben Stiller jumps onto the back of Jamal Duff's little scooter and flips off Christine Taylor. And a strange out of left field thing was Steve the Pirate. I can't remember ever seeing a pirate play dodge-ball. If you are looking for an action packed movie I do not suggest this movie for you. If your looking to laugh hard than buy this movie. I've seen this movie 15 times now {It's on HBO a lot} and I'll keep doing so till I get bored with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Ups to Ben Stiller.. Who put his career on the line and saved a movie by acting perfectly as a great idiot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dodgeball was one of my favorite movies. You know why it was? It was because I love my Ben Stiller in free-range mode, ready to do anything at any given time. Vince Vaughn, Christine Taylor, and Rip Torn were also very good. With backup roles like Hank Azaria, Gary Cole and Jason Bateman as co-hosts for the Dodgeball tournament, and Lance Armstrong making an appearance to inspire a character in the movie, you can't go wrong. The slapstick in this comedy is uproarious, completely showing all of the talents young actors and veterans can display with improvisational talent. The Dodgeball quarrell between Average Joe's and the Purple Cobras is a great scene because it really shows how Ben Stiller was the absolute perfect role as White Goodman. Ben has that charm that allows him to act perfectly arrogant, conceided disdainful as his character. He has that condescending look to him that gives movie viewers the note that he is the bad guy in the movie, without a doubt.Overall "Dodgeball, A True Underdog Story" is a great movie for anyone who is ready to laugh at a truly remarkable performance, alongside other brilliant but subtle performances. Dodgeball will make you laugh, cry, and pee in your pants every delirious step of the way.</fullReview>

Of course,I had seen Stiller, Vaughn and the others in every thing from "Mary" to " Zoolander", but Dodgeball is THE funniest! Every time you watch you see something new( and hilarious) that you missed previously. I bought the movie and lent it to buddies at work. Before you know it, we we're quoting sections of dialogue when we saw each other in the hall. At a meeting, when one employee was being negative, we looked at each other, and someone whispered( loudly) " If you can dodge a wrench...!" This movie needs to hit the big screen again so we can do a Rocky Horror to it. Gar... I'll dress like Steve the Pirate!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good silly movie that is everything "Anchorman" should have been.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard of "Anchorman," I thought the premise was inspired, and with its cast I was sure it would be a great stupid, silly comedy. Unfortunately it turned out to be a major disappointment and the companion piece of the year -- "Dodgeball" (another hopelessly silly comedy) -- turned out to be the better of the two and brought in some $30 million on opening weekend; quite a feat for a film featuring an actor accused of starring in too many films (Ben Stiller) and an actor whose career has been reduced to shambles recently (Vince Vaughn)."Dodgeball" is by no means a great comedy or an important piece of work but it doesn't have any pretensions to be. It follows in the path of slacker underdog movies like "Animal House" and just about any sports movie you can think of but it doesn't try to be anything more than what it is: an entertaining piece of trash. This is not out to win an Oscar, its purpose is to make us laugh and I did so quite a bit.Vaughn is perfectly cast as an average Joe who owns a gym called Average Joes (ah, irony). Stiller is the owner of the competing "Globo-Gym," a super-slick company with a $4 million price tag and an interesting company slogan: "We're better than you, and we know it!" When Peter (Vaughn) fails to pay off debts his gym faces foreclosure and he must raise fifty thousand dollars or else Stiller will buy his land and turn it into a huge parking lot for Globo-Gym.So in order to raise the cash Peter and his die-hard gym members (a pack of idiots, losers and a wannabe-pirate [?]) compete in the American Dodgeball Association of America (I didn't get the joke the first time I heard it!) against Globo-Gym's Purple Cobras team.Ben Stiller's been getting on my nerves a bit lately, wearing his put-upon-nice-guy shtick into the ground. He's reached a point -- along with Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Will Ferrell and Luke Wilson -- where they all just goof off in their movies, performing cameos or appearing in starring roles, and at first it's pretty amusing but after a while the whole Troup Stiller/Wilson routine gets old... "Anchorman" had Ferrell, Wilson, Stiller and Vaughn, and "Starsky and Hutch" had the other Wilson, Stiller, Vaughn, Ferrell etc... not to mention the fact that Duplex, Meet the Fockers and Along Came Polly all featured performances by Stiller that were eerily similar.Anyway suffice to say Stiller gives his best 2004 performance in "Dodgeball," creating an over-the-top character who's very similar to the obsessive weight loss instructor in one of his earliest comedies, "Heavy Weights," which might be a sequel of sorts to this since "Dodgeball" supposedly takes place in 1993 and that movie took place in 1994...Overall "Dodgeball" is just good silly fun. Stiller is doing another one of his usual routines but he's a great deal funnier than he has been in many other films last year, and I like him better as the angry freak rather than the put-upon shmuck, which he's simply done way too much lately.The movie delivers laughs and doesn't attempt to do anything else... I'm not making this out to be a great movie because it's not. It's the sort of popcorn flick I'd watch if it came on TV in the future -- worth a rental at least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Dodgeball, a gym is about to close down unless sit can come up with $10,000 to pay off a debt. With the help of many odd characters who frequent the gym the owner must join a Dodgeball tourney. In their way are a team from a rival gym who are out to close out the gym.There really isn't that much to talk about this film in terms of the story. The story as expected was rather thin. There really was no story to talk about.The gags and jokes I thought were unoriginal and pretty lame. I'm not really a fan of Ben Stiller as I do not really agree with him in terms of what is funny and what is not. This movie just reminded me too much of BASEkeball which I really did not enjoy. I guess one the only thing that I thought that helped this movie were the cameos played out by many stars.</fullReview>

Not for smaller children (some crude and sexual humor) but kids should be okay beginning with age 10.Rip Torn's training sequence is priceless. Ben Stiller always hams it up hilariously and this movie is no exception. Vince Vaughn who became one of my comedy fave's since his skit on SNL as the pimp, White Chocolate,...is good as the straight, irreverent guy who is apprehensive about his responsibility. Stiller's real life wife, Taylor is also good.</fullReview>

This film is light comedy that kept me chuckling like an idiot but not feeling too guilty about it. Ben Stiller steals the show as the hilarious pumped-up villain on steroids.

		<shortDescription>Average movie about average joes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You don't have very high expectations when a film is called 'Dodgeball: A true underdog story' and it stars Ben Stiller. That is a good thing for this film.Imaginatively enough titled 'Average Joe's' is a gym where the losers and underdogs hang out, apparently not working out though. It is shoddily run and trouble is brewing. Unless they can rustle up $ 50,000 in quick time 'Average Joe's' will lose their gym to the sleek corporate style efficiency of 'globo gym' (Motto: We are better than you and we know it).But AJ regulars-a weanie, a kook who thinks that he is a pirate, a bespectacled middle aged loser and a dumb brick- love the place enough to do anything to prevent this from happening. Their only hope however, is to win the a dodgeball championship in Vegas which coincidentally offers the exact amount required as a prize to the winning team. They manage to coax the good-hearted hero and owner Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) into being a part of the wild scheme. A crazy coach, Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn) with innovative methods like bunging wrenches at the team, the mandatory female-potential-love-interest for-hero and an adrenalin charged tournament in showy Vegas complete the picture. The spoofs on American fondness for obscure are funny enough. But, you can see it all coming. Like when weanie boy gets new uniforms for the team, you know that something other than the ordered uniforms is going to come out of that box. You can be equally sure that some act of providence will let the team win the mandatory 'regional qualifiers' on some technicality. In reality they have lost out to a team of girl scouts. Ben Stiller is White Goodman the smarmy fitness freak that runs Globo and is out to get the underdog. His character gives him ample potential to create some gross humour that either makes people laugh or wince. To the audience that belongs to the former category this film will work well enough. In any case, we did not start off with great expectations and we won't be too disappointed by this time pass flick.</fullReview>

And man was I surprised, it should've said "Another 'I'm Pissing My Career Down The Sever' Comedy From Ben Stiller". Seriously, I used to like and wait something from a Ben Stiller film/comedy but nowadays they're just not good. Last good film "from" Ben Stiller propably was Royal Tenenbaums from years ago. Every single crap he has done ever since has been crap in the meaning. Just for the record, the leading actor is mostly Vince Vaughn.The plot is thick, very formulaic and as easily predictable as the result of Finland versus England football match up. Acting feels like they only shot when it were Sunday. Okay it's better to jump over what's bad as I really didn't like this movie at all. So what good there can be if... the one and only thing worth the while are the cameos from David Hasselhoff and Chuck Norris, which both lasts about 5 seconds in total.Rule #2: You can have a lot more fun with your own balls.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hugely funny! And like all good comedies, this one has many layers of subtlety (well, sort of), permitting appreciation at many levels. Some Brits may not get all the North American references and jokes, probably. Such cross-cultural differences are unavoidable, and were illustrated recently in the London newspapers' reviews of the wonderful "Shrek 2," for example. But they all will nonetheless have a great time.Will Brits know that dodgeball is a common children's game, and its quasi-violent theme makes it somewhat of a rite of passage in many American's memories of primary school? Dunno... but they should be told that dodgeball, portrayed as a "sport" in this movie is a total gag, joke, folly, etc. Reminding us of the male modeling world in the under-rated "Zoolander." It makes a wonderfully sardonic backdrop for the sheer silliness and deep humor of Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, and the ever-great and immensely talented Rip Torn.This isn't a masterpiece, and may not even be "great," per se, but it is very good, and well worth making the trip out to see. Not for children, however, as it is extremely raunchy! I gave it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

The world is modern and times have changed but i think that some behaviours could be showed in other sense. There are sexual moralities that can be acceptable but they are not normals. Oh, another thing, it's disappointing to see some old stars with just too little scenes, it's almost a shame. Comedies have to be evaluated in different perspectives, cause their main purpose is make you laugh but remember that children are exposed to this type of movies and you don't want your children think that life don't worth nothing.</fullReview>

He's been in lots of films lately that don't do anything for him, let alone show him at his goofiest self. Mr. Thurber must have seen a possibility casting him, and it paid handsomely. Vince Vaughn, plays with a straight face, but he is quite good and holds his own playing opposite to Mr. Stiller.The scenes in Las Vegas, during the finals of the Dodgeball tournament are absolutely insane.

Vaughn's misfit team may seem cookie cutter from the likes of 'Slap Shot' to 'The Bad News Bears' but has its heart in the right place in spite of its wheelchair bound crusty bastard coach (Torn) prone to wielding heavy wrenches in light of spiritual boosting morale speeches.

You've rounded up the best possible ingredients, and whipped up a picture perfect meal. The homemade pasta is perfect; the chicken appears to be seasoned ideally; and the cream sauce is to die for. It all looks great on the table, except for one thing: you unintentionally used sugar instead of salt in the marinade, literally leaving the judges with an unpleasant taste in their mouths. The sauce and pasta are still good, but the dissonant taste of the chicken ruins the entire dish. That's "Dodgeball". The concept drips with comic potential: an underdog dodgeball team, led by Vince Vaughn, faces off against the Goliath of the sport, a squad captained by Ben Stiller (in his fourth and perhaps worst movie of 2004). That's a typical sports movie storyline, infused with Stiller's usually stellar humor. The cast, primarily Vaughn and Stiller, are top comedic actors who have proven their talents multiple times. But the flavoring provided by two-thirds of the script dooms the entire film to mediocrity at best. Maybe Stiller needs Owen Wilson back to write him a passable script. The title and hilarious trailer present the premise of the movie, but don't warn of the sixty minutes of filler that surround the games themselves. The basic setup of competing gyms is funny, and once finally reached thirty minutes in, the dodgeball scenes are comic gold. It's dodgeball for crying out loud. Just typing that makes me laugh. Televised on ESPN8, The Ocho, the championship tournament and its ethnically diverse teams provide the movie's best laughs. But in the meantime the movie struggles in ways that many sports movies do, as pointless, often crass, story arcs futilely attempt to inject romance and purpose into the games. I realize that the movie has to be longer than half an hour, but the quality comedy of dodgeball deserves better than bad SNL support. Stiller inadvertently explains the problem with his movie in the worst credits sequence I've ever seen. He mockingly complains that audiences are looking for mindless entertainment, ironically having just sated that very group of people. Instead of producing razor-sharp satire like "Zoolander", Stiller and his crew have degenerated into substandard crude comedy (and I use the term loosely) reminiscent of (gasp) "BASEsketball". The last ten minutes are a prime example. After the inevitable climax, not a single line or scene is necessary. It's nothing but crude and lazy fluff, stretching the running time to a palatable 90 minutes. The cast and crew have proven they can produce good to great comedy without resorting to puerile tactics and endless joke repetition. Better is expected here, especially of Stiller, who also co-produced "Dodgeball". He has churned out comedic hits like "Keeping the Faith", "Meet the Parents", and "Zoolander", all of which were often roll-on-the-floor funny without waaaay over-the-top violence and innuendo. On the minimal plus side, Stiller and Vaughn are still their usual solid selves, although most of the stale jokes seem to be recycled from their other work. Perhaps because Stiller seems to be working so hard to earn laughs, Vaughn shines as the straight man. Nothing he does is inherently humorous, in fact I don't think he even performed all that well, but within the context of such an overblown movie, his subdued everyman actions occasionally strike a comedic chord. Christine Taylor is again adequate, playing almost the same character she did in "Zoolander", a role that demands little. Rip Torn is the right man for his part as a crotchety old ex-dodgeball star, but his excessive crudeness and violence doesn't play right, although his departure from the movie does provide one of its funnier moments. As a standard assortment of misfits and musclemen, no one else does much of anything worth mentioning, except for a few strong cameo appearances that leave you wishing for more. Technically, there's not much to say. Comedies such as this, even the good ones, are rarely notable (in a good or bad manner) for editing or score, and form holds here. The only noteworthy accomplishment is the horrific use of Chris De Burgh's classic ballad "Lady in Red". The movie raised various unanswerable questions. What's the deal with the pirate? How many times am I supposed to laugh at a guy getting hit in the groin? Do the financial aspects at the end actually make sense? Why did I pay money to see this garbage? These queries are unanswerable because by the time the movie stumbles to a halt, your brain will be numb, and you won't care enough to try a logical response. With the subtitle of "A True Underdog Story", perhaps "Dodgeball" was hoping to spawn a sequel. I hope that it does. Perhaps that one will find the missing two-thirds of this movie and live up to the potential promised by the premise and talent. Bottom Line: Less than half of a great movie gets less than half of a great rating. 4 of 10, and that might be generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of, dare I say it, misfits, have to win a dodgeball competition in 30 days to make $50,000 in order to save their gym from being taken over by the (expletive deleted) rival next door. Not you average premise, but this ain't your average comedy. I got exactly what I expected from this film; a good laugh and a large slice of ham. But it was also cleverly done too. Yes, I've got a puerile sense of humour, and so does this film. But so what? The story's ludicrous, but perfectly constructed. The performances are oft times baffling, but just the right side of silly. And what can I say; I laughed! And that's what a comedy's supposed to do. Don't listen to the nay-sayers on this site. If you liked Dude, Where's My Car, and you don't take yourself too seriously, you'll like this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Films starring Ben Stiller tend to be funny, and that's what this is. You cant go into a film like Dodgeball expecting much more than a good time and a few laughs - so the fact that it's no masterpiece won't disappoint, and the fact that it delivers exactly what you want it to ensures this further. Dodgeball is at least somewhat original because it follows a sport that (to my knowledge) hasn't been done before, or at least not recently. Prior to seeing this movie, I had seen Dodgeball being played 'professionally', and it's easy to see why the filmmakers here decided to base this comedy on that sport. It isn't quite as ridiculous in real life as it's portrayed as being here, but seriously - it's not all that far off. The film follows two rival gyms - the huge Globo Gym, and the small-scale local gym - Average Joe's. Joe's is owned by Vince Vaughn, who finds himself in trouble with the bank when it turns out he hasn't been paying his bills. He owes $50,000, and after his friends' idea to wash cars fails miserably, they find that the only way to pay off the bank and keep the gym open is to enter a dodgeball competition, which has a first prize of $50,000 (mere coincidence). However, the owner of Globotech wants Average Joe's for himself...and enters the competition to make sure that happens.I'm not exactly Ben Stiller's biggest fan, but it's impossible to deny that he has a talent for comedy. He's shown in his recent films that he has a great range - from the very straight Starsky, to his average kind of role in Meet the Parents; all the way to his role here, which sees him as the maniacal fitness freak turned dodgeball player. He stars along with Vince Vaughn and wife, Christine Taylor. Vaughn has shown his comedy talent a lot recently, and even though his role here is merely as an average kind of guy; he does it well. Stiller's wife definitely is hot - I don't like blonde's as a rule, but every man who doesn't would have to make an exception here. She steals all of her scenes. Many of the jokes come as a result of Stiller's over the top character, and the general silliness of the game; dodgeball. It doesn't take a highly trained eye to notice that this is Ben Stiller's film - and it's him that you're going to remember most after seeing this film, and that is testament to his comical abilities. Some of the humour is a bit grating and doesn't really work (like the awkward romance between some ugly woman and a dorky kid), but on the whole - this is suitably silly, and is sure to sufficiently entertain most people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dude this movie was HILARIOUS!!! its about this dude, and he couldn't find his car."Dodgeball is a sport of violence, exclusion, and degradation". I can personally relate to this movie. Growing up in the midwest we were forced to play it often, as early as age six. Hopefully its involuntary school version is just a Midwestern thing (Ohio, Michigan, Illinois) because it is truly a sport of "violence, exclusion, and degradation"; which I can now look back on and laugh about (at least a little).I think Stiller got the concept from his Michigan friends who made it a great sequence in the "Freaks and Geeks" pilot episode.But it would be hard to come up with another movie that is as uneven (hit and miss) in its humor.Pretty much everything involving Patches works extremely well; and works for both the Hank Azaria and the Rip Torn versions of the character. In fact these are some of the greatest comedy and dialogue bits ever. "No, but I do it anyway because it's sterile and I like the taste".There are also a lot of funny animations and graphics, some great stuff that comes totally out-of-the-blue; like "thank you Chuck Norris" said with sincerity and the Lance Armstrong bit at the casino bar.The good stuff is almost entirely at the middle of the film. There is absolutely nothing in the first 20 minutes of interest but stay with it because it gets better. Likewise the last 20 minutes is a letdown although the tournament announcers/commentators (Jason Bateman and Gary Cole) do a pretty good parody of too slick sports broadcasting. And it was a nice touch to have David Hasselhoff as the abusive German coach.They reach for some cheap lesbian laughs which culminates with the tired draw of girls kissing.Vince Vaughn is likable and relaxed but it would be a stretch to call his stuff 'acting'.Ben Stiller is the main source of the misses. His 70's fitness freak never really works and the more you see the less funny it gets. Only the scenes with his "real-life wife" Christine Taylor are worth watching. Stiller just doesn't have the talent for exaggerated humor and the writer gave all the good lines to the other characters.The supporting cast that I have not yet mentioned are lame and unimaginative. Since it is a comedy I assume that "Steve the Pirate" is supposed to be funny but you can't tell that by how he looks or what he says. Julie Gonzalo plays her same cheerleader character from "A Cinderella Story"; since the films were produced at the same time she may have just walked back and forth between the sets without having to do a costume change.The big mystery is why the creative talent behind "Dodgeball produced so much great stuff and then did nothing worthwhile with the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** HERE BE SPOILERS **White Goodman (Stiller) is running an aggressive, elitist gym. The gym is economically successful and Goodman is looking to take over Peter LaFleur's (Vaughn) Average Joe gym across the street. Only very few odd customers visit Average Joe gym and business is extremely bad. In fact, LaFleur is short $50000 and Goodman is about to finally take over the business. The Average Joe crew has only one chance to save their gym, to enter a Dodgeball tournament with $50000 in prize money.The story is not great, but the little mishaps and adventures the crew experiences, along with odd characters and great cameos, make this a hilarious movie. Ben Stiller is great as Goodman (I have a hard time imaging anyone else that could make that role better). Vaughn and the other are also good, and especially Alan Tudyk as Steve the Pirate is really good. Otherwise, it is the little things that make this a good movie, as mentioned the story is not great, and unfortunately it is a little too predictable to merit a higher grade. But a must see nonetheless.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That must be the only explanation of why this movie is loved by so many. Vince Vaughn, while funny in Old School, gives a very unmotivated performance in this disgusting excuse for American cinema. Ben Stiller, pulling out one of his two characters in his arsenal, not only isn't funny, but makes you actually hate this man. I think I actually laughed more at watching CNN's coverage of the Democratic National Convention. I'm not sure what to think of a public who enjoys watching endless clips of a nerd getting hit with a ball. Or the idea of thinking that echoing a previous line (a la ben stiller) is funny! And the sad part is that I am not making this up. Two girls in front of me could not stop laughing at Stiller's mimicking characteristics. For the sake of our society, I hope they were high.However, there is a bright side to all of this. If movies like "Dodgeball" can succeed in making tens of millions of dollars, a man like me with no experience in the field should be able to make a solid $10 million. All I have to do is mix a well-known cast with physical 'comedy' and I should be a shoe-in for Ben Stiller's next movie. Who cares if I let some 6th grader writes the script? As long as I add enough shots of people getting kicked, hit, or punched in the genitalia, I should be OK. Oh, and throw in a lesbian kiss between two hotties and I'll have 21st Century Fox drooling for the rights to my movie. I mean, if two hot women kissing is what it has come down to, then I think we have entered a new era of Hollywood bullcrap.* out of **** (the one star thanks to that lesbian kiss.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There was an article about Joel David Moore in The Oregonian two days ago.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story" is just plain old goof-ball-ism, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. It has the Average Joes gym going up against Globo Gym in a tournament. The Average Joes gym is clearly a working class gym, while Globo Gym's slogan is "We're better than you, and we know it!" Maybe for the most part, this is a recycled triumph of the underdog story - where against all odds the ragtag team defeats the big guys with all the money - but the performances carry it to excellence. Ben Stiller, as Globo Gym owner White Goodman, makes a really funny slime-ball. Vince Vaughn, as Average Joes gym owner Peter La Fleur, creates a very commendable character. Christine Taylor, as reporter Kate Veatch, is what a reporter should be. Rip Torn, as trainer Patches O'Houlihan, is one acerbic SOB (Hank Azaria plays his younger self). And I now realize that Fran Stalinofskivich (from Ramanovia) was played by Missi Pyle, who also starred in "Bringing Down the House" and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory".Oh yeah, and about that article. Joel David Moore is here in his native Portland shooting the indie flick "Spiral" with Amber Tamblyn (of TV's "Joan of Arcadia").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow it's been a while since the last time I laughed this hard at the movies. I loved it!This movie is about a group of "weird" (I hate to see that word in a sentence next to the word "people") guys who work out at a small gym owned by Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn), which isn't getting any income b/c it's going to be taken by the bank, task handed to Kate Votch(Christine Taylor). But that isn't all, the gym wants to be owned by the annoying/gross and long time rival of Peter, owner of Globo gym, White Goodman (Ben Stiller in I think one of his best roles ever). The thing is this guys are willing to do anything to keep the gym, they learned to love that place and they made a bunch of great friends. Anyhow, the only way to keep the gym is to get $50.000 in 1 month, and that's how they get into "dodgeball.." The rest, you have to see it.A really fun movie, wonderful performances by everybody in the cast, I can't complain of anyone, they were all awesome! Especially Ben Stiller, we're used to see him in roles like "There's something about Mary" as a sweet good guy, but in this one, forget about it! He's nasty, dumb (not the Zoolander kind of dumb, this one is actually funny) and annoying! But that was the character, so I'd say Ben Stiller was perfect. Vince Vaughn was great too, funny and the classic good guy/hero of the movie, I liked him. Christine Taylor was good too :)I'd watch this movie again anytime, one of the best comedy movies I've seen in a long time :) ****1/2 out of ***** (the half point taken away by David Hasselhoof's came, I have no idea what he was doing or why he was there, but it was stupid and not fun).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't dodge this ball! This comedy is thrown and meant to hit you! (Sorry for the joke.)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dodgeball. One of the older North American games ever. From elementary, to high school, we all know of Dodgeball and its many variations or copy games. Dodgeball is now brought to you as a tournament sport, an official league. Let me explain.Dodgeball is directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber and stars the comic talents of Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn. It also has roles from Christine Taylor, Rip Torn, Jason Bateman, and Hank Azaria, some roles bigger than others. Dodgeball is filled with what I'd say is more of guy comedy than normal family comedy. Men of all ages will love this film. Watch it with your girlfriend/wife and good luck... Dodgeball contains some of the best quotes of the year such as the following: "If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball." "We're better than you, and we know it!""L for Love!"Dodgeball is about a man named Peter La Fleur (Vaughn) who owns a gym called Average Joe's, which is about to go bankrupt unless he can pay $50,000 to the bank. He is reminded this by a lawyer named Kate (Taylor) and that someone bought the 2nd mortgage to the gym. This someone is a multi-million dollar egomaniacal man who owns the most superior gym in the city that just so happens to sit across from Average Joe's. This man is White Goodman (Stiller) and his palace is called Globo Gym. He and Peter have been rivaling with their gyms from either classic, old fashioned working out to state-of-the-art, best work out machines.Peter has the state of mind as in "pay a few dollars here and there" while Whitey is a crazy, arrogant man with sayings like, "Here at Globo Gym, we're better than you, and we know it!" To save the gym from turning into White's new parking lot, Peter and his best customers must now form a Dodgeball team to fight to the top of a Las Vegas Dodgeball Tournament featured on ESPN 8 "The Ocho". And guess what, it just so happens the top prize is $50,000 (what a surprise).The team consists of actors like Alan Tudyk (who did the CGI suit work for Sonny in I, Robot) and Stephen Root (who does the voice work of Bill on King of the Hill). And the cameo by Jason Bateman is absolutely hilarious as he steals every scene he's in with quotes like: "There's some good family fun," or "Yes, Cotton, he won't be able to see very well with that blindfold," Definitely a completely different role from Arrested Development when his characters are practically the opposite. A good comedic cast for a great comedy.Overall, Dodgeball is one of the best comedies of the year... just behind White Chicks, Meet the Fockers, Shrek 2, and The Incredibles. It scores some bad points however; it's racist, it's slow at times, and sometimes the exaggeration of joking around with White's work-outs being compared to sexual sounds and feelings so much gets tiring. Still, Dodgeball alone stands strong and is a treat; great performances from Vince Vaughn (as a great leader and main character) and Ben Stiller (as a great villain). Let the balls fly at full throttle. It's Vaughn vs. Stiller.My Rating: 7.5/10 (A High 7.5)Eliason A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got home from seeing this. Let me start off by saying ANYONE who thought this movie wasn't good didn't watch hard enough. That being said:Vince Vaughn is probably the funniest person alive. Ben Stiller is probably the 13th. Not a minute went by in this movie that I didn't laugh at something new. Granted, you need a special sense of humor to get how great this movie is. I don't know why anyone has doubts about seeing this. What from the trailer...if anything...made you hesitant? People getting hurt, gay jokes, and pirates. This movie has it all. Of course, don't judge by the trailer itself. If you don't want to see it, it?s your loss. I, however, can go on the record as saying, "This was the greatest movie I have ever seen." They picked the perfect cast. Rawson Thurber directed this perfectly and used everyone to their full potential. Ben Stiller's sarcasticness mixed with Vince Vaughn's dry humor made this a great movie to watch. And there was just enough slapstick, painful action involved that it kept me, and mostly everyone else in the packed theatre, laughing and clapping until the credits. And then as an added bonus...CAMEOS! From probably the least suspected group of actors and athletes. This movie isn't for everyone, though. The nay-sayers out there are the same people that scuff and smirk at dead baby jokes and Most Extreme Elimination Challenge. So you people can go see Around the World in 80 days or Riddick (aka: XXX 2). Anyone like me who likes Dead Baby Jokes and movies like BASEketball, Super Troopers and Old School should definitely check out Dodgeball.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had thought Ben Stiller's presence was the guarantee of a good movie until I saw -- or, unsuccessfully tried to sit through -- "Tropic Thunder." This film is a confirmation of my original conviction.Stiller is over-the-top attention-getting and interesting in the main role. (Who could imagine a fitness fanatic placing electric cables on his nipples as a disincentive to eating a donut? Now that's creative characterization!)I enjoyed Vince Vaughn as an understated, principled small business owner who just happens to also be a closet Wall Street whiz. He surrounds himself with an array of touching and funny fellow players (contrast this with a similarly aspiring but far-less-well-cast ensemble flick like "Paul Blart: Mall Cop"). I particularly liked Christine Taylor (Stiller's real-life wife) in a foil role, and Rip Torn as the never-say-die, wrench-hurling coach Patches. Alan Tudyk as a would-be pirate was endearing.(It was a little disorienting to spot Lance Armstrong in a cameo role as an inspiring athlete who doesn't quit when he's down, since he has now been exposed as an inveterate cheater and fraud.)I watched this with my own little dodge ball player, my 10-year-old son, and he found it delightful throughout. This is one of those rare films that is just as good for kids as for adults. And, yes, everyone can laugh at that final, out-of-left-field kiss!</fullReview>

I love slapstick films and this one delivers with lots of painful scenes.A little disjointed in parts, more stylistically than in direction, but I must say the action and comedy are non stop. Also it doesn't hurt that there are some gorgeous women prancing about in this movie (yay car wash scene!).The film only loses points for a plethora of crass humor, between that and my inability to get over the goof where the magazine is taken out of the bag twice (Stupid I know..) and that I wanted to know more about all of the dodge ball teams, this movie is great.

		<fullReview>"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story" finds a group of lazy, likable, poor, dysfunctional bums, who don't care about money, fitness or conformity, living opposite a super-gym filled with wealthy, hard-working, beautiful, Ubermensch. Our heroes beat the Ubermensch at a dodge-ball tournament, make millions of dollars and buy out the super gym. Message: it's okay to be who you are, because deep down you know you're better than all those "conformists" who do what you don't. You can do what they do and you can do it better. You are, and want, the best of both worlds.To date, "Dodgeball" is the best film released by Ben Stiller's Red Hour Production company. Vince Vaughn plays our likable hero, Ben Stiller goes delightfully over-the-top as White Goodman (a health obsessed fitness instructor), and Christine Taylor plays the obligatory love interest. A bevy of goofy character-actors make up the rest of the film's oddball cast. Like most of Stiller's starring vehicles, "Dodgeball" is designed to covertly show off the time Stiller spends in the gym.Most of the film's best jokes come from Stiller. His obsession with male beauty and virility mirrors the film's own obsession with balls. Interestingly, the film's love interest (Christine Taylor) is revealed to be bisexual, with no need for either Vaugn or Stiller. This revelation is perhaps a remnant of a scrapped, planned ending; the film originally ended with our heroes being beaten and remaining losers.7.9/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A supremely silly film from Ben Stiller, this film features the charismatic Vince Vaughn and Stiller's real-life wife Christine Taylor as well as Stiller himself as misanthropic meathead White Goodman whose financial prospects are on the rise, while those of Vaughn's Pete LaFleur are on the descent. Goodman's mustachioed, comedically hyper-masculine gym owner wants to take over LaFleur's gym and convert it into a parking lot for his own gym which he will get the opportunity to do if Vaughn and his small band of hapless, loyal members cannot raise $50,000 within the next month. Gordon (Stephen Root) reads in his obscure sports magazine about a dodgeball tournament of which the grand prize is $50,000.So the band of ne'er-do-wells enters the tournament, not realizing how hapless they look-a man who thinks he is a pirate (Alan Tudyk), a man with no pride (Gary Cole), a man whose prime interest is in the most obscure sports around, and a young man whose cheerleading tryout left him the laughingstock of his school (Justin Long). Will they succeed in keeping the gym open? What do you think? This is cotton-candy thick entertainment. It's good for a few laughs. Justin Long, Vince Vaughn, Christine Taylor, and Stiller in particular are very good in their roles. If you like some of these actors and a light-hearted, enjoyable film, this one is for you.</fullReview>

That man knows funny, and I hear tell is a very nice person on set (cute caterer told me). Also pirates, always good. More movies should have more pirates. Not in historically accurate roles of course, but more modern day people trying to be old timey pirates. On that note there should be less fat suits. Here is a short list of people who can pull off fat suits: 1.... and that is the end of the list. Sorry Ben, you are not on the list. In conclusion I would like to see more pirates, less fats suits, and Justin Long is a very nice person who is probably not allergic to peanuts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The old idea of a guy who doesn't have much in life and doesn't care is brought in with new originality by director Rawson Marshall Thurber. Vince Vaughn plays the aforementioned character named Peter LaFleur. His motives change when he finds out he has a month to pay off the damage he owes to the bank or else his gym will be destroyed by a rival gym owner. That rival gym owner is White Goodman, played hilariously in a supporting role by Ben Stiller. Goodman wants to provide more parking for his customers.When LaFleur lets his friends know what the deal is, he lets them make suggestions. They try a car wash and fail miserably. After that, LaFleur caves in until a member suggests entering a dodgeball tournament. They go for it only to have Goodman's team be the antagonists.This movie is fun with the laughs continuously coming. Vaughn and Stiller give funny, original performances. There is also some really funny jokes in the dialogue and the situations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some time ago, I came across this movie and it instantly became one of my favorite ones and just about the funniest movie I'd seen. If you're looking for slapstick, unpredictable, joke-after-joke film...then this is for you. It's just about as hilarious as it can get the first time, but then after a while you'll just grow sick of it. Truly it was good when I first saw it, but after re-watching it many times I got bored with it (just like most other films do sometimes). The humor is mainly funny if you don't see it coming, but other than that it is just another DVD on your shelf. All in all it is a silly, unpredictable movie that you will surely give you laughs if you haven't seen it before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not usually so funny, and a little too often boring, but reasonably satisfying in the end, I guess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this sports comedy was released in 2004, I was introduced to it the following year. It was towards the end of my senior year of high school, in a class I was in all morning that semester. One day, for some reason, we didn't do any work, and instead spent the morning watching "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story". I recall not being very impressed with much of the film, but liking some of it. Three years and a few months later, having not seen it since then, I rented it yesterday. Now that I've seen it a second time, it's definitely clearer in my mind, but I don't think my second viewing was much different than the first at all.Peter La Fleur owns an unpopular, rundown gym called Average Joe's, which does have a few loyal members, all with their eccentric qualities. Across the road is Globo Gym, a glamorous fitness centre run by the arrogant White Goodman, who wants to buy Average Joe's, so he can have it demolished and have a parking structure for his gym's members built in its place! In order to stop this from happening, La Fleur must come up with $50,000 within the next thirty days! He and his gym's loyal members attempt to make enough money in various ways, but unfortunately, all their attempts fail. Finally, it is discovered that they can get enough money to save Average Joe's if they win a big dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas. So, they begin to train for this tournament, but after Goodman finds out about this by spying on them, he gets together a team of extremely powerful athletes to participate in the dodgeball tournament as well, so it doesn't look like there's much hope for the Average Joes! Like probably so many other modern comedies, some of the gags in this one are pretty lame, such as the obese cheerleader flashback, and the steroid user on the Girl Scout team. I would say the humour is pretty much mediocre for the most part, but it has its moments, such as White Goodman getting an electric shock when he touches a doughnut. One part which definitely made me laugh more than the vast majority of the movie was Goodman at the door of the house of attorney Kate Veatch, telling her about an absurd thing he just did, which was not his first pathetic attempt to win her over! The rest of that front porch sequence can be amusing as well, including Kate getting violent with White, and White's reaction. Occasionally, there are some more minor laughs. However, this is not the reason why I'm rating this movie any more than a 5/10. The reason for that is the fact that both times I've seen it, I've found the big dodgeball tournament rather suspenseful.I've seen a number of Hollywood comedies made at some point during this decade, and I've definitely seen better than "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story", but have also seen much worse. Yes, this particular comedy can be quite juvenile at times, with certain gags it could have done without, and like I said, overall, the humour is mediocre in my opinion, but at least it's not atrocious, like some modern comedies certainly can be, and the story seemed to leave me reasonably satisfied in the end. Many people clearly like this film better than I do, and while it's certainly not one of the most popular comedies ever made, it seems to have gotten more positive feedback than negative, though I'll probably never be able to fully understand it. "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story" definitely could have been a lot funnier, but compared to certain other immature modern comedies, it's certainly not exactly a disgrace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is the commentary that's on the DVD copy of this film supposed to be a joke? All it is, is the actors bad-mouthing each other, and arguing, and being childish, to the point where they all decide to leave. And it wasn't good-natured humour, it was very tense, and mean, and often there were long silences, And, at the point in which the actors leave, the tech-guys who are working with them on the commentary simply decide to put in the commentary from "There's Something About Mary", saying that "no one will notice". What was the point of including this drivel? Would it have not just been possible to not include the commentary, when it became obvious that the actors weren't going to cooperate? But no, instead they include a short while of the actors, first waiting for the Ben Stiller to show up, and then insulting each other, as well as the tech-guys, and then abandoning the commentary altogether - while using the commentary from something else completely, as filler! I was very disappointed in this, especially with listening to a commentary from *another film* during this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a big fan of Vince Vaughn's ever since he portrayed the psycho cowboy in Clay Pigeons with Joaquin Phoenix. I also loved his character in Swingers and Made playing alongside Jon Favreau. So I gave this movie a chance but was extremely disappointed. Not with Vaughn, but with the plot and with Ben Stiller. Stiller wasn't so bad in Something About Mary or in the two family movies (Meet the Parents/Meet the Fockers) but after Dodgeball I swear, I'm never watching another Stiller movie unless it's for free and I'm bored to tears.Stiller's character is so over-the-top it stops being funny after the first couple of scenes. The plot is as old as the hills. It just didn't work for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, fantastic movie, yes, however there is a major flaw in it, perhaps many of you have already picked this out, but i feel the need (because i have no life) to point it out anyway, at the beginning of the film during White Goodman's infomercial, he mentions that he is "also a client", he then shows a picture of himself "6 years and 600 lbs ago", the picture is labeled 1987, thus making the movie take place in 1993. Then how does one explalin Lance Armstrong and Peter LaFlour's conversation in which Lance details how after fighting against cancer he went on to win the Tour de France 5 years in a row, wouldn't none of this have happened yet???</fullReview>

While I applaud their efforts and devotion to each other, it sometimes brings about lame product, that otherwise wouldn't be made if the above listed players did not appear in them."Dodgeball" has some amusing moments, and charming if predictable performances from Stiller and Vaughn. But not really enough to justify a film that is barely 90 minutes long.Some nice cameos throughout, but Gary Cole and Jason Bateman are simply not funny here.4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I probably hadn't seen this flick if it wasn't for the recommendation of a friend. I'm glad I did, 'cause it's funny as hell. Stupid fun, it is. First of all, I used to really hate Ben Stiller. Basically, I still don't like his face and his way of acting. But since I enjoyed MEET THE FOCKERS to some extend, I kinda took Stiller along for the ride with this one. And he's pretty superb in DODGEBALL, giving an over-the-top performance as prestigious fitness-club owner White Goodman. In fact he's so annoying, dislike-able and full of himself that I constantly wanted to hit him in the head. Real hard. So it was fun to see him suffer some defeats from time to time. But especially Vince Vaughn was good as the very likable, easy-going Peter La Fleur, White's rival in the fitness-business. There's not much else to say about this flick, except: go see it. It's got funny dialogues and one-liners including a lot of vulgar and offensive words. And there are also enjoyable cameo-parts by Chuck Norris, William Shatner, David Hasselhof (the best!) and even Lance Armstrong. If someone throws this movie at you, don't dodge, but catch and watch it!</fullReview>

This film is one of the best feel good film that can inspire the human spirit. From Vince Vaughn's laid back approach to Ben Stiller's entertaining over-the-top performance, the jokes just keep coming. The film is full of nice touches that will appeal to all ages, it is a sure-fire hit. Each cast member brings different humour to this film and each works perfectly well. The only bad thing about this film is that i doubt there will ever be a sequel...! I advise anyone who wants a quiet night in to rent this film, get some pop-corn, sit back and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Dodgeball" - A true underdog story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story" is hardly true in the sense that its plot line is based on an actual event or time in history. "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story" is only "true" in that dodgeball is slowly rising to the top of the "almost sports" world (presumably through the underground avenue of word-of-mouth) and what's more, a movie is made about dodgeball and it's directed by first-timer Rawson Marshall Thurber.My own experiences in gymnasium dodgeball were all short-lived in the annals of elementary school, as like most others surprised by the massive success of this picture last summer, dodgeball, or Extreme Dodgeball as it's called on sports channel ESPN, is close to earning a place in the most-watched sports arena on television. Whoa.But in the movie "Dogdeball: A True Underdog Story," hapless, borderline bankrupt Average Joe's Gym owner Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) comes up with a scheme to win $50,000 in order to save his fledgling business. Actually, he doesn't come up with the plan himself; one of his equally hapless, bizarr-o but loyal gym regulars reads about dodgeball in "Obscure Sports Quarterly."The catch is, they have all heard of and know how to play dodgeball, but they don't know how to play (play is italicized) dodgeball. As with any sport, officially sanctioned or not, there are rules and any advice that Peter and his cohorts come across is therefore invaluable if they are to get anywhere in the upcoming dodgeball tournaments being held in Las Vegas. And so with much pondering, a loose team is formed out of true societal misfits including a pirate, a wannabe cheerleader, and a guy who's never been on a date.One of them borrows a documentary sports video from 1938, and it features legendary titan of the game Patches O'Houlihan (played by Hank Azaria in the video, a wheelchair-bound Rip Torn in the present). Soon enough, Patches rolls into Average Joe's and shows these 'dogs how to play some dodgeball in some very effective if not totally kosher techniques. Peter realizes that lawyer Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor), who has served him with the bank's foreclosure warnings and also gets wind of some of his lackadaisical business practices including letting his clients pay their own way, has a mutual disliking of White Goodman (a delightfully obnoxious, egomaniacal, and scene-chewing Ben Stiller), the owner of Globo Gym, and eventually asks her to join their team.Of course, she's at first reluctant but after White gets her fired from her job with the bank, she is left with little choice but to join at least in part to get revenge on White. White Goodman is another one of those deliciously manic, comic villains that Stiller specializes in, chewing up scenery nearly every second the camera's focused on him. He forms his own dodgeball team, the Purple Cobras (who all look like action movie rejects, even though one of them is from an obscure place in the former Soviet Union), and with the sports winnings, he aims to buy out Peter's gym and then demolish it (with them still in it) but they're obviously not going away without a fight.This is a movie that finally acknowledges its place as a wild, out-of-place, and self-referential sports comedy. No phony theatrics here, ladies and gentlemen, just a bunch of actors who know the material inside-out and look to make one hell of an entertaining picture. Vince Vaughn does his best to keep the plot on track with a cool game face and succeeds but Ben Stiller is a total maniac as White Goodman. Like the corporate fitness monster he played in "Heavyweights" (1995), he's totally insane but goes a step further into playing a character who if it weren't for a shred of brains in that thick melon on top of his shoulders, would be a poster child for self-absorbed fitness gurus everywhere.Most entertaining are the actual dodgeball sequences, which eat up most of the film's second half. These are fast, brutal, and unflinching in showing various team members getting annihilated on the court with zingers to the face, to the crotch or any exposed area. It almost makes you want to sign up and form your own team and compete in Vegas."Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story" is an eager film from an equally ambitious team of filmmakers. It put a smile on my face, as any other sports film of similar theme would not have been able to do that. Sure it's silly, but the laughs are such that you won't be kicking yourself afterward for doing so."Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story" - Don't dodge it. Oh, wait, catch it. Ahh, screw this, watch this movie, turn your brain off, and enjoy it.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite a good film with a bit of a silly idea, but still very funny in places. Ben Stiller plays White Goodman, he owns a big and successful multi gym. Vince Vaughn plays Peter La Fleur, his gym next door does not do good business and Whitte wants to buy it. Unless Peter can get $50,000 he cannot keep his gym. Luckily Peter and the gang notice a competition to win $50,000 in a dodge ball game. Rip Torn as Patches O'Houlihan trains them for a while and they are ready. They beat many teams, but the final game is against White and his team. A very good story with a very good end, Stiller is pretty funny. Also starring Alan Tudyk as Steve the Pirate.

		<fullReview>Dodgeball is a light comedy about Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) who owns a low budget gym in a small town and decides to enter a Dodgeball competition with his misfit gymnasts to win money to save his gym being taken over by the leader of the global corporate fitness chain run by White Goodman (Ben Stiller).Dodgeball was what I expected it to be funny but not to be taken serious and it was a little weak in parts, I have never been much of a fan of Vince Vaughn I don't think he has been strong in any of the roles he has been in and in serious roles he just doesn't show emotion, Stiller saved the movie because it wouldn't have been much to see if it wasn't for him, not bad but there are better sporting comedy movies to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some funny parts, more stupid parts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It should be noted that stupid parts are often funny, too, I still haven't figured out what it is exactly that makes one stupid scene funny and another one just stupid and vulgar. The mashed potato scene in Scary Movie 2, for example, was not funny by any stretch of the imagination. If you really liked that, you should try hanging out in a mental hospital or a physical therapy ward or something, you will be in absolute hysterics. Then again, I loved the Ace Ventura films, and stupidity is the foundation for most of the successful comedy in it, at least to me. Now, when I watch a comedy like Dodgeball, clearly I am looking at the ratio to stupid scenes that don't work and stupid scenes that work. Dodgeball had more of the former. The story is about a regular guy who owns a gym and an obscenely rich and snobby guy who owns a massive gym across the street from him and who spends not a little bit of time trying to run the average guy out of business. Thhe initial problem that I had was that Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller are very different actors, not the least reason for which is that Vaughn can play characters as different as the characters he played in Clay Pigeons and The Cell, whereas Stiller plays exactly the same character in every movie, he only seems to alter how irritating his characters are (think Meet the Parents vs. his character here). Then again, he capitalizes on his weaknesses, kind of like David Spade. But in the movie, Vaughn reminds me of a guy dealing with some drunken jerk at a party, trying to shrug off his ridiculous and embarrassing behavior but eventually giving in and knocking the guy on his ass. Stiller is so over the top that there is no way to take him any more seriously than as a comic book villain. He is tiring to watch before the first third of the movie is over. There are effective gags in the movie, it is not all bad. The plot is fun to watch, because not only is White Goodman (Stiller) annoying to watch, but he is also a complete jerk, so you really want to root for the underdogs, and the movie makes very sure that you see them as underdogs in every way imaginable. But it should be noted that the best scene in the movie involves Vince Vaughn at the airport, having given up on his team, when he runs into someone that I won't reveal. They have a normal conversation, no over-the-top antics, and it's the funniest thing in the movie.Then again, maybe I just thought so because I enjoy ridiculously long bike rides.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harmless comedy is just too predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not trying to convince anyone who saw this that they viewed a bad film because nothing is more subjective than comedy and I do believe that there are some solid laughs found here but many of the subplots in this story are just so obvious and predictable. Story is about Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) who manages a small and rundown gym called "Average Joe's" but with his pathetic group of members he doesn't make much money and now the bank needs $50,000 or they're going to take it away from him.*****SPOILER ALERT***** White Goodman (Ben Stiller) runs a very successful gym also and he won't stop at anything to get his hands on Peter's and he even agree's to give him more than $50,000 but that doesn't convince Peter to sell. Peter is convinced by his members that they should join the Dodgeball League and try and win the championship prize in Las Vegas but what finally spurns him on to the idea is the help from Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn) who is a dodgeball teacher and Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor) who works for the bank.This film is directed by newcomer Rawson Marshall Thurber who benefits from the opportunity to work with a cast that has been in several goofy comedies reminiscent of this and they together make this film work on several levels. The story is slapstick with so many jokes and humorous situations tossed in that you can make a case that it resembles the "Airplane" films but the main problem I had with this is the predictability of most of the situations and it's characters. Was is really surprising to see the one nerdy character who wanted to be a cheerleader end up with the hot chick from his school? Did anyone believe Taylor's character would be attracted to Vaughn and that she would even get involved with dodgeball? Sure, I'm nit-picking but these were such glaring aspects of the story that it's shocking to me that the makers of this film don't realize how cheesy they are and just change it. If you love Stiller and his over the top comedies than you'll no doubt enjoy this effort but for me I found too many parts of the film cartoonish to allow myself to admit this as a guilty pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vince Vaughn leads a group of assorted misfits into a dodgeball tournament to save his gym from being bought by Ben Stiller's gym franchise. Well leads is to strong a word, as Vince just seems to go with the flow throughout the film. Are we that needy for good comedies that we elevate a below-average one into the status of 'mordern day classic'?? Apparently so as many of the people I know sung it's high praises when this came out. The truth is, this is nowhere near as funny as either "Old School" OR "Bad Santa" and the only laughs to be had come from not Stiller nor Vaughn, but from Rip Torn who steals every single scene he has in the movie as wheelchair-bound Patrick O'houlihan. Without him "Dodgeball" would have been out in the preliminaries.My Grade: C- DVD Extras: Commentary with Rawson Thurber, Ben Stiller, and Vince Vaughn; 7 deleted scenes; Training for Dodgeball featurette; Anatomy of a hit featurette; Justin Long: A study in ham and chess featurette; go for the gold featurette; gag reel; 2 theatrical trailers; Trailers for season 1 of "Arrested Development" and "the Ringer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen a more unoriginal movie in my life. Every single joke, gag or pun in Dodgeball is blatantly and openly stolen from another movie. And this really, really bugs me. However I did laugh constantly and it was enjoyable.Though I must confess my hatred of Ben Stiller and his insistence to crank out 200 unfunny films a year (a schedule typically reserved for porn stars). Initially, I hated Vince Vaughn and liked Stiller. But now that's kind of flip-flopped. After Vaughn's funny performance in Old School I warmed to him but Stiller is under the impression that everything he does is funny. He certainly is not; anyone can act like a jerk.The plot is old hat. But Vaughn's ragtag group of losers and their determination to win the Dodgeball tournament is the real laugh machine. Though I was constantly thinking about how they worked much better in Baseketball or Kingpin.Asides from Vaughn and the so-not-funny anymore Stiller the cast is good. Rip Torn as Patches O'Houlihan is amusing (though he did the exact same role in Summer Rental), Stephen Root (that's Bill Dauterive for all you King of the Hill fans) was my fave and there's plenty of cameos from the likes of Hank Azaria, Jason Bateman, William Shatner, David Hasselhoff and Chuck Norris.Funny it may well be but expect practically every laugh to come with a heavy sense of Déj? vu. I wouldn't bother buying the DVD when it comes out. Just watch Baseketball and Kingpin side by side on 2 TVs and you'll end up watching this.And trust me, if ESPN 8-The Ocho, was a real channel, I'd be watching it every day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If anything, please dodge this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I played a lot of dodgeball when I was in school and at day camp and I remember how much fun it was. This movie wasn't any fun. I had high hopes for it because I think Vince Vaughn is very good at picking his material and I figured watching people getting smacked in the face with a red gym ball should be good for a few laughs. It has a few laughs, but that's about it. Most of the film is un-watchable. Ben Stiller's role as an over testosterone gym owner wears very thin after a few minutes and becomes annoying after that. His character got on my nerves in a hurry. A lot of the humor I didn't find all very funny and I thought most of it was predictable. What I did like was Rip Torn as Patches, a sort of former dodgeball legend, who is now in a wheelchair barking orders like a drill sergeant. He has a very funny bit where he is tossing wrenches at his team and then forcing them to dodge traffic on a busy highway. Most of them get hit by a car. It pretty much ends there for me as the laughs go. I wasn't expecting Shakespeare, but I was hoping for something better than this. (*1/2)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dodgeball is a fantastic movie. Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn are great actors and great comedians. Only one probelmo with this big blockbuster I thought that the language and the rudeness of the movie was too much to show my Newphew so I was a bit disappointed. I LOVE CHRISTINE TAYLOR.In Dodgeball she is so hot and my Nephew likes her too. Rip Torns a great actor as well. The movie caster was clever, I mean anyone is clever if they cast CHRISTINE TAYLOR in there movie. BUT THE MOVIES WRITERS WERE STUPID. Some of the jokes in the movie are not jokes. These people should sort themselves out. PLEASE WRITERS BRING OUT A DODGEBALL 2 WITH A LITTLE BIT LESS RUDENESS IN.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dodgeball pokes satirical fun at the tried and true sport underdog film, but ultimately comes up a bit of an underdog itself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vince Vaughn, plays a benevolent easy going gym owner (Peter La Fleur) who's nemesis, played by Ben Stiller (White Goodman) is a calculating and miscreant gym owner, who through his own brand of tough-love discipline and underhanded business practices has allowed his gym to sky rocket while Peter La Fleur's (Vaughn) easy going nice attitude has pushed his under. In order to win money to save his gym from foreclosure and eventual repurchase by Stiller, Vaughn takes a band of rag-tag misfits who call his gym home and along with Patches O'Houlihan (Played by Rip Torn) whips them into champions.On the positive side, this movie had a lot of subtle and not so subtle jabs, with many different types of humor, slap-stick, gag and other types strewn into the piece. However where this virtual cavalcade of comedy falls a bit short and only results in a bit of comedic overload, spreading a potentially good concept for a film a bit thin.First off the main conflict is one essentially where, a harder working businessman outwitted a slacker, who for some reason has a business and doesn't collect any money from his clients. For all intensive purposes this conflict is understandable and that's when I asked myself? why should I feel sorry for these guys?The characters are not very well developed, Ben Stiller's character (White), is a miscreant tyrant and Stiller brings a lot to this character. I however found him very similar in his stupidity to Zoolander, but with similar endearingness of that character. I didn't feel much of a connection with any of the other antagonists however. I found that they were not developed, even to comedy movie standard. For instance one of the main gym (rejects) is a pirate, a mild-mannered loser, while another just a simpleton. All these characters in turn are not given as much dimension as they could have, leaving out connection with them tenuous are best. Like the main conflict and the main characters much of this movie is based on comedic stereotypes which work well in certain circumstances and not so well in others. As mentioned previously one of the main comedic short comings is the inundation of copious amounts of comedic events that come up a bit short.As far as Beb Stiller movies go, this one is certainly not on part with Zoolander, which is a better buy if you haven't seen it. Although not bad it wasn't all that great. $$$/$$$$$$$$$$</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed with the DVD release</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was disappointed after watching the DVD. I saw Dodgeball in the theatre and the DVD cut out a major scene which would make the end confusing to people who will see the movie for the first time from the DVD version. In the theatrical version, Peter tells off his friends and Steve the Pirate following Patch's death. There was a scene in the theatrical version where Peter got upset with his friends that they relied on him for all the answers. Peter also yelled at Steve and told him to stop acting like a pirate because he wasn't one. In the DVD version they jump from Peter telling Kate that he is going to talk to the guys to the scene in Peter's hotel room where White is waiting to bribe Peter. (Now to explain why this would confuse first time viewers) At the end of the film Steve the pirate turns normal; he cuts his hair and dresses like an average person. He shows up at the end of the last Dodgeball match and tells Peter he was right about [Steve] not being a pirate...so I don't remember anywhere in the DVD where Peter told Steve that he wasn't a pirate! But that was in the theatrical version! What happened?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a funny movie that parodies a wide range of subject. Stiller's character is just that. He is great!! Vince Vaughn as the straight man is tremendous. Great timing. What makes this movie so fun is the all out, over the top, making fun of sports and the various personality type that inhabit sport (even an outlandish concept of "professional dodgeball"). Rip Torn is great as usual. The "commentary" during the dodgeball tourney is fall on the floor hilarious! Excellent physical comedy, if violent, but hey, if you don't like it you don't get the joke. This is a film for people who actually understand how comedy is made. And don't leave early, you will be rewarded by Stiller after the credits. This is comedy with an edge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This barely-a-movie lifts its plot from -- well, actually it goes all the way back to Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland and Little Rascals flicks, and films as recent as HEAVYWEIGHTS, THE MIGHTY DUCKS and REVENGEOF THE NERDS. A bunch of underdogs take on the bad guy champs and win the day, but not without some pratfalls and flubs along the way. Stiller is truly bizarre as the head of the bad guys, but if you've seen ZOOLANDER, you've already seen this character. Vince Vaughan is sort of charming as the feckless, always-ready-to-resign hero, although his buddy Jeremy Piven already played this role in PCU. Some great balls-to-the face scenes make this worth at least a partial look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh so very popular!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit...Ben Stiller's popularity is a head scratcher to me. Even comedians I can't stand like Parker and Stone of South Park fame I can still see something appealing in their style. Ben Stiller to me seems kinda silly yet I admit I have enjoyed a fair number of his films. Still it's usually the rest of the cast that makes the film good. To me he's just okay and yet his films seem to reach this cult status in days where everyone is talking about them. Such is the case with Dodgeball. I've been hearing about this movie everywhere I went and how funny it was and I had to see it so I finally did and I was not disappointed.Dodgeball is the story of two men. Peter Lafleur played by Vince Vaughn and White Goodman played by Ben Stiller. Stiller's character owns a popular, and well to do gym where people are insulted into building better bodies. Vaughn's character owns a small neighborhood gym where good friends hang out, have a good time and people can come without being judged or laughed at. Unfortunately Lafleur is too nice of a guy to make a profit off all his clients so he's in trouble financially and the bank is going to foreclose on his gym leaving it available for hostile takeover by Goodman unless he can come up with fifty thousand dollars in a month to save his gym from the evil Goodman. How is he going to do that? Dodgeball of course. Him and his gym full of out of shape rejects are going to win a national Dodgeball competition in which the top prize is...fifty thousand dollars. Surprised??No it's not a new concept but the Dodgeball angle is different and very funny.Vince Vaughn is one of my least favorite actors because in essence he doesn't seem like an actor at all. He's just always kinda there. He's never impressed me in his variety of roles where he seems to ride the other people's coat tails in the film. He is adequate in the lead here playing a straight faced boring character. Ben Stiller is the exact polar opposite. He's off the wall, over the top, too much to handle and not all that funny. Both of them behave as though this is an extended Saturday Night Live Skit with special guest star Vince Vaughn who is just completely amused by Stiller and his own performance. The absolute saviours of this film are the underdogs and the cameos. Truly they make this film a shining star and a funny, watchable movie. Christine Taylor as the lead actress in the film adds a necessary boost of girl power to the film. She's funny in her own way with her one liners. Stephen Roote is downright hilarious as Gordon the King of The Hill Billesque type character we know and love. Alan Tudyk as a basket case that thinks he's a pirate, and the silently hilarious Jamal Duff as Stiller's right hand man. Rip Torn who plays the Underdogs coach, former pro dodgeballer Patches O'Houllian has some hilarious lines and is just funny to watch, probably one of the best roles in the film. Cameo's by Chuck Norris, William Shatner who is funny without trying to be, and watch for Jason Bateman's hilarious little role as the more than slightly high dodgeball announcer. If the whole football in the groin premise makes you laugh aloud, you won't be able to get enough of Dodgeball because the funniest parts are watching people get nailed with those balls and of course the numerous references to "balls" in general. Although there is the occasional sexual reference, overall the film doesn't resort to the gross out comedy we have come to expect nowadays from comedies. It's by far not the best comedy I have ever seen but it's worth checking out for a mindless laugh. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap and tacky, but it made me laugh.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this one with few preconceptions, on the grounds that "Something About Mary" was so achingly funny, and Ben Stiller was in both films. Yes, it was cheap, tacky and vulgar, but in an endearing way. Stiller was great of course (possibly outdoing Carey as the funniest face in films), but so were most of the other cast members, mostly unknown to me. There were a lot of in-jokes and cameos aimed at American TV audiences, but there was still plenty of stuff to laugh at for the rest of us.A few things seemed to trail off without a punchline or resolution (e.g. the wanabee pirate going "straight"), and two of the main team characters were confusingly very similar. The ending was more or less what you'd expect, but on the whole it did the job: it made me laugh a helluva lot.I wish they'd shown more of the other competing teams in the tournament (e.g. The MILFs!), though. Maybe the DVD will have more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly a mongrel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given that critics across the serious press in this country welcomed Dodgeball as '... the best film of the summer, by far...' I was distinctly underwhelmed by this latest Stiller(/Vaughn) vehicle. (Incidentally, the other Vaughn in British cinemas - Johnny, fronting an ad campaign for his radio show - is just as funny as his A-list namesake)I laughed, for sure, although I could see all the jokes coming. And cumming, at one point. There's plenty of weak to very bad taste humour in this film which isn't my bag. Having read Peter Bradshaw in the Guardian on this film I'd been alerted to a post credit chaser from Stiller in a latex body suit. Don't bother sticking around for it, like I did, it's not funny.Two things are quite interesting here. First is the dark - fascistic - edge to the humour. Explictly we have things like Stiller's character's name - White - and a slogan of we're better than you and we know it. Implictly we have the Ali G school of multiple layered irony which actually runs closer to the truth (anti-fat, anti-quirk) than it would let on.Then there's the perversely moving sight of Lance Armstrong coming on to do a 'cameo' - but not in the same way as Shatner or Hasselhoff - which for it's teflon rock of humanity in this slurry of cinematic irony is worth the price of the ticket alone.

		<fullReview>I laughed twice, half laughed once and smiled two or three times. Sorry, but for a comedy this just isn't enough. The humour such as it is, is of the slapstick variety and is often violent. Initially Dodgeball only intermittently held my attention, though it did get better as it went on, especially when it got to the main tournament and the action sequences. A good performance from Vince Vaughn, especially considering that he was given little to work with, and a reasonable one from Christine Taylor, couldn't save this film from being a cheesy turkey that misses the mark as often as the misfit dodgeball team it portrays. If you absolutely love Ben Stiller (who isn't on screen as often as you'd think) and are in uncritical mood, you may find it more enjoyable than I did. Otherwise, see something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The extended title says it all as a group of underdogs led by Vince Vaughn enter an international dodgeball competition in Las Vegas so they can win $50,000 and keep their old run-down fitness gym open. Of course there is the evil Ben Stiller who wants to eliminate them as competitors and turn their building into extended parking space. And caught in the middle is tax attorney Christine Taylor (Stiller's real-life wife) who gets torn between helping Vaughn and his team and doing her job. Rip Torn is priceless as an old 1930s dodgeball wizard who trains and tutors Vaughn's rag-tag team. Cameos from some of the most annoying people to ever be on film (William Shatner, Chuck Norris, David Hasselhoff and dull bicycling wonder-man Lance Armstrong) and stupid commentary from annoying announcers Gary Cole and Jason Bateman during the final stages of the production coincide to complete a thoroughly mediocre comedic effort. For once I think that Stiller should have been around more often as he is the only real life blood in this stinker as "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story" finally gets decapitated by elements much more lethal than flying rubber spheres (things like bad writing, poor direction, ho-hum acting and waning attempts at cheap laughs are commonplace throughout). Still not terrible for the genre, but ultimately a very unspectacular and normal effort for all concerned. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a funny comedy once again featuring Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn...the other being Starsky and Hutch released the same year. This one though basically has their roles reversed as Vaughn plays an every man gym owner and Stiller plays a fitness and appearence obsessed gym owner. Stiller's character wants Vaughns gym and Vaughn needs money so this is where dodgeball comes in. This movie is also kind of a spoof of those old 80's comedy where in the end it comes down to a tournament or race to save the day. Lots of goofball antics ensue, with a lot of hits to the crotch, but hey it works here. Dodgeball was always a bit of a cruel game so might as well show how it is. Vaughn is great as are the rest of his team of misfits, and Stiller is kind of bizarre in his role, but it works. Lots of strange cameos in this one as well, and what was up with the pirate? Still though this movie made me laugh and was a lot better than other comedies I have seen, though I liked Starsky and Hutch a bit better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest Sports Comedy since BASEketball (and, luckily, in that comedic tradition)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things that debut filmmaker Rawson Marshall Thurber gets right at the start of Dodgeball, and runs with for the whole length of the film, is that if you're making a film out of this story (that includes the a-typical story and characters, in a comedy genre or otherwise) there's got to be a laugh a minute, literally. And, amazingly, Thurbert pulls it off, along with a great ensemble cast headed by Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn. Because there is also a constant urge to make fun of anything, that nothing is out of bounds, disbelief is completely suspended, and Thurber reaches (credible) ZAZ comedy territory.Main baseline: Stiller and Vaughn trade places from March's Starsky and Hutch, as Stiller plays the tyrannical, egocentric head of Globo-Gym, which has been the monopolizer of physical fitness in the town. Vaughn runs Average Joe's, a gym where the only people who work out are the ones who work there. When Stiller bids to take over Vaughn's place, they fight back with a Dodgeball tournament with a prize enough to save Average Joe's. The story's just an excuse, anyway, as was the story for BASEketball or Airplane. It's an excuse, so to speak, to let Stiller run wild with the persona he creates for White Goodman. It's an original performance, even if one wonders if he played a character with these kind of qualities before on his show. And Vaughn, as well as the assortment of supporting actors (Christine Taylor, Alan Tudyk, Stephen Root, Justin Long, Joel Moore, and especially Rip Torn), contribute a lot to the success of the laughs. They're relying on certain cliches, but they're the kind of cliches you can't take a bit seriously. There are also a good deal of (surprise) cameos by the likes of William Shatner, Hank Azaria, Chuck Norris, and Lance Armstrong that sneak up and bring some of the funniest parts of the film. It's a good time, unless this just isn't your kind of movie. Between A- and B+</fullReview>

If only this "Movie" were about his Character "Patches O'Houlihan" then it would deserve its seemingly large success. But this is not the case. This movies suffers from what I call 'Neuvo-crap' syndrome, i.e. all "comedies" today are clichés of clichés of crap. You know the ending before it happens, hell, you even know most of the jokes and the dialog seems to have been written as a prequel to most of the comedies recently past. I know Hollywood ran out of ideas around the mid-Nineties and had to look to its successful past to get "new" ideas for the future, and it seems lately its a free-for-all on the old original stories, repackaged for an unassuming public....but the saddest fact of all isn't that most of the viewing public is ignorant to this fraud, it's the fact that they resign themselves to that fate by not investigating older movies and truly comedic films that deserve their money and attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Save your money and rent Baseketball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm pretty sure the writers and producers of Dodgeball just got together one day and decided that the only reason Baseketball was a flop was because it wasn't based on a real sport. So they took Baseketball, every single idea and clever little touch, repackaged it and decided that the movie really needed to suck. Enter Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.Let me get to the nitty gritty: Vince Vaughn sleeps his way through the flick, the rest of the cast are completely forgettable and filled with lame gimmicks, and the only one with any energy is Stiller. He delivers another over the top, trying to hard for his own good, performance. (And I don't know about you, but I really don't think he's very funny at all. Sure, Something about Mary was good, but I don't think I've seen anything else, with him, where I was really just laughing like crazy). About the only great thing about the flick is Rip Torn. The guy is great and delivers some of the best lines that I've ever seen. He's about the only reason that I laughed throughout the film. The whole thing just seemed pretty trite and about as deep as a kiddie pool.Do yourself a favor and spend your money renting Baseketball. It's much funnier, and at least you'll save the extra twenty you'd normally spend on popcorn and soda.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A local gym is going under, largely because the owner refuses to collect fees from his clients. But when a larger rival gym threatens to take him over, it becomes personal... and unorthodox methods of raising money are used. The one decided on: dodgeball.Who is Rawson Marshall Thurber? That is the real question here. You have probably never heard of him, and other than "Dodgeball" his projects are not well known. Yet, he wrote and directed this film -- flawlessly -- and cast some of the best actors in the business. Plenty of big names here, and some great character actors. How did he do that?I have no idea. But what I do know is that this film is genuinely hilarious. The jokes are well-written, and well-delivered by the cast. Some of the best parts come from the cameos of some pop culture icons, and Jason Bateman's sports commentator role, Pepper Brooks, is his best role to date (even better than "Arrested Development"). This is a must-see film for all fans of comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as advertised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel cheated and ashamed at the same time that this country produces such crap. It was like watching SNL sketch with all the actors thrown in into the pile and told to do one liners. White Goodman is the owner of this high tech and very profitable gym while Peter La Fleur is his nemesis across the street who owns Average Joe's gym, which is, of course, on the brinks of bankruptcy. When White wants to take over Average Joe's gym, Peter and his club members need to come up with $50,000 in 30 days to keep the gym alive. What starts out as a promising film turns into an outrageous display of violence and stupidity. My issue with the movie is with the improper cast of roles. Vince Vaughn (Peter La Fleur) and Ben Stiller (White Goodman) would have made a better movie had they been in opposite roles. WHY? Because Vince is more convincing as a bad guy while Ben has always played positive characters. Vince has this evil look in his eyes even when he tries to be a nice guy. Most of the characters looked cartoonish? Nobody acts like that in real life. And what is with this sport Dogdeball? The only goal is to throw balls at each other? A couple of years ago there was a movie called Rollerball which I recall was way more entertaining that this one. At least, in that film they didn't try to make it funny. I think this is where Dodgeball suffers. Had they decided to make it a true Underdog Story without the stupid jokes and unbelievable characters, I think this film would have been much better. Think about this... can you imagine Rocky as a funny film? And what is with the throwing of wrenches. What the film tells is that it's OK to throw wrenches at each other? How insane. At the end of the film the underdogs win, of course. I didn't expect it to be any different. Anyway, to sum it all up, I don't recommend wasting your money on this movie. It is not as good as the advertisers want you to believe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dodgeball" is another Stiller formula comedy which packs wacky characters and silly stereotypes into a story about a glitzy state-of-the-art health club owner (Stiller) who wants to add a failing garage gym, owned and operated by Vaughn, to his empire. Unwilling to give up his small time but nerd-friendly operation, Vaughn challenges Stiller to settle the dispute over a champion dodgeball tournament in Vegas. Factor in a babe and the usual good vs evil elements with the underdog issue and a screenplay which is hyperkinetic and kaleidoscopic and the result is an enjoyable comedy romp worth a look by anyone who enjoyed similar Stiller fare such as "Zoolander" or "Duplex" or "Starsky &amp; Hutch" or "Envy", etc. (B)</fullReview>

Hard to comment any of the performances of the actors since they didn't have much to work with. Vaughn and Taylor(who both can be seen in Zoolander...hmm)did what could be expected.I guess this film is for those who liked Zoolander and are able to see past a really really lousy story. 3/10 and thats because I'm in a generous mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dodgeball is simply awful, like everything Stiller has been in since The Royal Tenenbaums,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie's go-to gag consists of people getting smashed in the groin or the face with a red rubber ball. This gets old after the first dozen times or so. Anyone with a sizable role in Dodgeball gets mired in the script's dissipated tone. Two of the climactic jokes involve Happy Days references. How tenuous is that? BEN Stiller's overbearing schtick officially reaches its expiration date with the desperate and puerile "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story." There are a few scattered laughs to be found amid the sports-underdog treacle and crass body-fluid gags that constitute this, the fourth Stiller comedy of the year (so far) - but the diminutive actor's cartoonish mugging is responsible for exactly none of them. This movie reeks of desperation from the start, resorting way too often to the "Funniest Home Videos"-style spectacle of people getting hit in the crotch with red rubber balls. Bad...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i'm totally shocked this ever made it into the theater.the writer, director, and actors barely seemed to be putting in an effort here. vince vaughn was really disappointing...while he can be great as a 'wacky' character (old school), this movie shows that he is a horrid 'straight man'. certain actors, like will farrell for instance, can play 'straight man' in a really funny way, but this was as flat as can be. ben stiller is funny, but the funniest jokes involved shoving his genitalia into his real-life wife's face. it's funny, don't get me wrong... but if that's your funniest joke, you've got problems. generally this movie just doesn't go far enough. none of the secondary characters are at all funny or useful. a pirate??? a fat nerdy guy??? a guy with a crush on a girl on the cheerleading team? can't they do better than this? a pirate for christ's sake.... what the hell is funny about that?i'm shocked that this movie is doing well. anchorman will be 1000% better</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dodgeball: A Truly Unfunny Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I first saw the ads for Dodgeball on TV. This movie looked hilarious! Then, the moment of truth came; I watched the movie and it was horrendous. The only funny parts of Dodgeball are what was shown in the trailers, the rest of the movie is a miserable, cliché-ridden, unfunny disaster. many of the jokes fall flat. Ben Stiller's character is annoying and unfunny. (And his "belly dance" during the end credits will haunt my nightmares for the rest of my life.) I had such high hopes for this movie, and they were all crushed. I didn't enjoy this movie. (It gets a 2/10 because of the funny parts that were used in the trailers.)I warn you as a friend; do not watch this movie, because if you're anything like me Dodgeball is not what you would expect it to be from watching the trailers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dodgeball: A Truly Nauseating Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most films, even the most worthless ones, have something about them which is meritorious. O Brother, Where Art Thou? had a decent soundtrack. Walking Tall had a good moral. Elf had some cute moments. No viewer should see any of these movies immediately before or after eating. Dodgeball, however, is one of those thankful rarities which should not be seen if the viewer is ever planning to eat again.The plot deals with an apathetic local fitness center owner (Vince Vaughn) who is trying to save his cute little neighborhood gym from a major corporate takeover masterminded by an evil fitness guru (Ben Stiller) with an inflated ego and some other inflated things as well, if you get my drift. In order to raise the money he needs to pay off his debts and save his gym, Vaughn's character Peter LaFleur puts together a ragtag dodgeball team and enters it in a Las Vegas competition. Only problem is, Stiller &amp; Co. have also entered a team. The Average Joe team includes a group of characters that I believe I was supposed to like: a sweet-faced lawyer who turns out to be an Amazon (Christine Taylor), a disillusioned male cheerleader (Justin Long), a man who thinks he is a pirate (Alan Tudyk), a pansy with bottled-up anger (Stephen Root), the Napoleon Dynamite style team manager (Joel David Moore), and another guy (Chris Williams) whom I don't remember anything about, even though I just saw the movie.Of course, no movie is devoid of the occasional shining moment. Rip Torn's former-dodgeball-champion-turned-coach was a likable fellow. I smiled a few times, and even had one or two weak chuckles. The presence of Lance Armstrong and Chuck Norris made me raise my eyebrows, but I had no issue with it. Any of this, however, was canceled out by the horror that was in store in the last ten minutes of the movie.A good ending can save an otherwise mediocre movie (a la Unbreakable or Queen of the Damned). A bad ending sticks in the viewer's memory like a butcher knife. ***SPOILER ALERT*** This was a bad ending. It began when Christine Taylor's character is revealed, for no reason whatsoever, to be a bisexual. It ended with our ten-second view of Ben Stiller's now-washed-up White Goodman, who now weighs about 925 pounds and has lost everything. I nearly threw up everything I had eaten that day when this image came on the screen. It reeked of pure antihumor - it was something one has to see to believe, and I hope for your sake that you never see it.In past movies I have been very impressed with performances by Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughan - they are talented actors. I suppose there was only so much they could do with this miserable screenplay, and frankly I'm shocked they accepted the roles. As for Armstrong and Norris, I usually expect better from them. I can only wonder what they saw in it that possessed them to agree to appear in this disgusting excuse for entertainment. Grade: F.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>its just not funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this after seeing Anchorman. Anchorman was unique, bizarre, funny and satirical.Dodgeball tries to sell itself as somewhat of a parody of those typical underdog stories, and is full of talented people like Stiller, Stephen Root, Gary Cole and Vince Vaughn, among others.Its just not funny. There are so many potential situations that I dont knwo why it didnt score. I even thinK i could have wrote it better.Rent BASEketball instead. Its much more bizarre, makes more jokes from its token announce team, makes something more out of everything involving sports. the locker rooms, the uniforms, the mascots. In Dodgeball other than a cheap S&amp;M joke and how funny Ben Stiller looks in his Cobras uniform, these sort of things arent touched upon. As well, the Dodgeball games are so short, its difficult to tell any funny stories with its characters or create any sense of drama whatsoever that might help deliver a joke or make anything out of the b-characters on opposing teams. BASEketball does all of this, and has some side stories that work as well.The only character in Dodgeball that got any laughs for me was the Pirate character, and even he was taken out to early. Dodgeball is neither straight enough nor ridiculous enough. It is painfully mediocre and with the talent involved should have been much much better. Much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Female body good - male body bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard this film was bad, but I wasn't expecting something THIS bad... This film uses homophobic slurs to get laughs again and again and again. It's embarrassing and insulting. And for those who say "Get over it. Finally a film that is not politically correct" I just ask how would you feel if instead of the homophobic slurs they would have used racial slurs for comic relief? Furthermore the female body is shown as "desirable" and "sexy" while the male body is - again - just used to get laughs and is ridiculed. A combination of the homophobia and anti-male attitude can be found in one scene where first we get to see girls in bikinis washing cars - obviously so the audience can drool over their bodies - and then we see a male redneck drooling over the body of a man who's washing his car in bathing gear - and it's supposed to be "gross" and "wrong" and "funny". The same double standard is used once more when first we get to see semi nude female cheerleaders - so very "droolworthy" - and then we get to see Vaughn's team having to play in rubber fetish gear - so very "gross" and "funny". I already got it the first time: female body good, male body bad. I turned it off after an hour and regretted not doing it sooner.</fullReview>

This was in theaters last year the same time Anchorman was and many said this was better than Anchorman. I totally disagree. Anchorman actually had laughs.As the title suggests, this is your typically Hollywood Underdog story involving a sport. In this case, it's dodgeball. Maybe the producers thought, dodgeball: now that's funny and entertaining, but they sure missed the boat. Sure, you played dodgeball in grade school and it's fun, but it is not funny just because some misfits are playing it. The only good part was Ben Stiller's over the top character. But, he got annoying because the accent was simply terrible.FINAL VERDICT: I don't recommend it because it just wasn't very funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just not funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have said before that I like Ben Stiller's comedic style. I have to qualify that statement now. I like Ben Stiller's average guy that can't get a break style, made famous by "Meet the Parents". I really hate his "Zoolander" type comedy. It's dumb. Not "Dumb and Dumber" dumb. It's dumb like that guy in your office who thinks he's really funny and always does that same little joke, accent, or quip that wasn't really funny to anybody but him the first time but he keeps doing it anyway dumb. It's not funny and it's annoying that he thinks it is funny. "Dodgeball" is that guy.There were a handful of jokes that did get me to laugh out loud, simply because they were so far out in left field. ("If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball? CLANG!") But the minutes (which seemed like hours) in between those few jokes were not just not funny, they were border-line insulting. Am I really expected to laugh at a redneck lusting after a male cheerleader wannabe while he wash's the redneck's big IL' 4x4? That's not funny. That's disturbing. And please, please, please, someone tell Hollywood that there is nothing funny about a geriatric with a bondage fetish. Ick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My streak is broken, I walked out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am 27 years of age and this is my first "walk out." This was, if not the worst, certainly one of the worst movies I have ever wasted money on (actually the theater reimbursed me). Let me begin by saying that Vince Vaughn is one of the more entertaining actors out there. While "Made" was pretty annoying, Swingers and Old School provided funny roles for him. This movie just didn't fit him for some reason. It appeared that his heart just wasn't in it. Maybe he was just there to pick up a check before he next decent role came along, I don't know. His character tried SO HARD to be a likable "Joe-everybody," he was impossible to relate to. That being said, he was the best part of this piece of trash.I admit that Ben Stiller has talent. He draws audiences and has become quite popular. However, with the exception of "Meet the Parents," he has never made me laugh. Owen Wilson had me rolling on the floor during Zoolander but Stiller just left me stone faced. So I have to admit that I had some Stiller-prejudice going in. He reached a new low. I have to apportion some blame to the writers, but I can't figure out how anyone could have found his character enjoyable. Perhaps this film was meant for children who aren't interested in pesky things like plot, character development, clever writing, etc..., but I don't think so. No, I believe that this movie was meant for 20-somethings who laughed as Old School, Zoolander and Office Space. Which brings me to the writers. I admit, I'm no Bill Shakespeare, but I'm not getting paid millions to write. This story just made no sense. BARELY SPOILERS HEREINWhy did these guys hang out at the gym all day? Why did they care about their gym so much? Why should we care whether the gym next door takes over Vince Vaughn's gym? None of this was explained. I found myself not caring about any of the characters. END OF SPOILERS (if those were really spoilers)I can get my money back, but no one can give me my time back. What a waste.AVOID THIS MOVIE. I'm rambling here but I really need to get the point across that you should spend your time, oh I don't know...counting ceiling tiles, clipping your finger nails or flicking bottle caps across the room at your cat. Anyone of those will provide much more fulfilling entertainment. RATING 1 / 10 (the worst)</fullReview>

Geez, what an original screen play.Not one funny line (unless you possess a single digit IQ), no funny visual humor (unless groin shots some how still strike you as humorous).Save yourself some time and give the clerk at Blockbuster four bucks and just leave without this piece of garbage.

		<fullReview>In the movie "dodge ball: A True Underdog Story", we see a couple of average Joes that run a low maitenace, unsuccessful, dirty, in debt work out facility. Across the street is a multi million dollar dream gymnasium. Peter (owner of the "gym") woke up when a girl appeared in his office. After peter makes sleazy remarks she says she works for the bank. Ben Stiller's character said he is going to buy Peter's gym to make a parking structure for his members. In order for Peter to keep his dump he must come up with $50,000. His only members (one of which thinks he is a pirate) try to think of a way to raise the money. So the people who are underdressed to go to Walmart, decide to pull a classic, have a car wash. After having that fail massively they are forced to play dodge ball to get the money. To see if they win or perish in a horrible cry for help in the middle of the Sahara will be left to you to watch. This film is surprisingly funny and has a great ending that I never would have suspected. With comedy that will bust your spleen and crack your back, but hopefully not give you a heart attack be sure whether you rent, buy, or go to an out of date theater, to watch "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story".</fullReview>

Nothing has ever made me feel more depressed than Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller bitching and moaning about Rawson (The Director) and the techs working at the company where it was made. Rawson, as far as I could tell was trying to make a genuine commentary about his movie, and whether his first movie or not, the behaviour of those two spoilt stars has ruined my liking of either of them.

		<shortDescription>A comedy??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only nipped on here quickly to pen a few lines on Dodgeball, but thought I would read a few other reviews quickly. I'm amazed to learn it was a comedy.I watched it on a plane which I now feel let down by, as at least having been in a cinema, I could've at least have been made aware of the scenes I was supposed to laugh at.If it was meant to be slap stick it was a poor mans Airplane or Naked Gun. How many more of these 'Groups of Misfits decide to enter a sports competition and ... wait for it ... they win - and beat a load of pros along the way' films will we get? We've had Major League, Up N Under, a million football ones. They're all exactly the same but with a different shaped ball.The dodge ball game itself seemed quite enjoyable, but would've been better if they devoted a few minutes more to the game and less time or pathetic, supposedly amusing incidents. In the first game against the Girl Guides, fair enough - have some of the players be hit in the face &amp; knocked out by a ball. But we had about a dozen matches of this in all. It was exactly the same situations recycled with different characters over &amp; over again.The Ben Stiller character was so over the top it was ridiculous. Likewise, so were all the opposition teams: Lumberjacks, the Japanese. They didn't add anything that having 6 ordinary looking blokes in shorts &amp; a T Shirt would have had, the Average Joe team (with the exception of the thin geeky bod who was an outstanding character) offered nothing remotely amusing and quite what the point of the co-commentator alongside Gary Cole was, I will never know. Vince Vaughn is a good actor &amp; always strikes me as good decent bloke, but I'm still unsure as to what his best acting role is. It wasn't this. He was actually one of the best things about Dodgeball, but (and I can't put my finger on exactly what) something didn't seem right with his role here.Humour always loses credibility for me, when reality has to be suspended so much that things that would normally kill someone ie Spanners being thrown into someones head barely even graze someone. It's no different to having someone fall 500 feet off a mountain, then when they land just get up &amp; brush themselves down and walk away unscathed.That's fine in cartoons (when the bump on the forehead is just pressed back into place) but I can't see it as comedy in supposed films for grown-ups, if that it what this was. Even in cartoons, and something as brilliant - and as funny - as the Simpsons, Homer bouncing down a cliff and being fine, is one of the few criticisms you can level at it.Thankfully the plane began it's descent 10 minutes from the end of this film so I missed that but it wouldn't take Einstein to work out that Average Joe's Gym must have either won the match or lost it but then clawed victory from the jaws of defeat thanks to another technicality.I like Ben Stiller in Meet The Parents and one or two other films but that is purely on an acting or characters basis. Unfortunately this is now, I think 6 films and he is still yet to make me laugh or even raise a snigger.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 6 out of ten is well deserved.This movie is, in a word, juvenile. That doesn't make it bad, but that's what it is. What with countless dirty jokes and gross-out humour, this is a movie aimed towards pubescent teenage boys (make-out scenes, anyone?). If you like movies like Epic Movie or Scary Movie, chances are you'll love this.But that doesn't mean "Dodgeball" doesn't have it's moments. Ben Stiller as a psychopathic gym owner obsessed with his own beauty is absolutely hilarious. His character's pathetic nature is amusing, unlike many of his co-star's, which is just sad. Vince Vaughn doesn't necessarily flop as the protagonist, but I thought he wasn't the best choice--while somewhat likable, he was still devoid of acting talent.The other supporting stars are unremarkable. They're just there. They do what they're supposed to, and that's something, I guess. But they're definitely not going above-and-beyond here--it's almost like they know that "Dodgeball" isn't going to be a career-changer for them.In summary, watch this as long as you can get it cheap. It's a relatively enjoyable way to pass 90 minutes, and if you're a Ben Stiller fan, you won't be disappointed. But if you possess an IQ over 100 and/or have graduated from high school, avoid this movie.</fullReview>

Stiller, arguably the funniest, does a character that is basically a nastier version of his Derek Zoolander character, but far, far less funny. Vince Vaughn basically mopes throughout the whole movie, and for the life of me I can't understand why I should even know his name. The supporting characters should have arguably been the highlight of the movie - funny, memorable, lovable, etc. Instead, they are all barely memorable and scarecely believable hangers on, each actor hoping to coat tails of one of the others' successful characters. Even the pirate is just not funny, and for the life of me, I don't understand how they could have missed with a character like that, but they did. Badly.</fullReview>

I respected Ben Stiller when I first saw him. I loved his role in "There's something about Mary", even in "The Royal Tenembaums", buy what he's been doing lately seems outrageous for cinema to me. After "Envy" and this unfortunate "Dodgeball" I've lost my faith in Stiller as an actor. He's not funny, as the movie itself, a more than overcooked history about the fight between two guys, old enemies, owners of two gyms, the one in front of the other. Ben Stiller plays the bad guy, trying to take control of his opponents property. They finally decide everything in a Dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas. I hadn't ever seen somebody playing Dodgeball since I was 10. Apparently, after this movie - according to Hollywood's power of influence - it will become olympic in London 2012 (lol). I'm fed up, Ben, maybe you need to change, like Jim Carrey did, to show the actor you have (maybe) inside.</fullReview>

Stiller's character has the best moments, presumably because they came from him and not the dreadful writer director who squeezes the life out of most moments for potential humour.I felt that this movie would have been much better if it decided to be a gross-out - a la the farrellys - or an clever satire on American life - a la Christopher guest, it hints at both and ends up being a watery mess.it's a shame because as an idea it clearly has legs and includes hilarious cameos from lance armstrong and David hasslehof who were good sports for doing it.a no brainer for a hangover day...</fullReview>

Somehow, I found this film beyond stupid (even after 3 beers) and often squirmingly offensive (the stereotypes of Asians and Asian-Americans - of which my date was one - were not only insulting, but committed the equal sin of not even being funny). Of course you go to a movie called "Dodgeball" with low expectations, but it managed to miss even the lowest. Have you ever been in a movie and wanted to scream, "When is somebody going to do something funny?! Please?! Anyone?!" Lots of talented actors and a goofily promising premise is wasted in an utterly, completely, totally dreadful script that could well have been written by a thirteen-year old of below-average intelligence. No offense intended to anyone who liked this film. And maybe it just caught me on the wrong night. But this is the one time that an IMDb rating (6.8) steered me completely wrong. This is the closest I've ever come to walking out of a movie, and thought you needed to be warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can tolerate "stupid" humour. I list Dude, Where's My Car? in my top 100. Why not? It's great to have a bit of pure entertainment now and again. I was somewhat expecting a repeat of this with Dodgeball - but ohhhhhhhh no. I realised something was amiss when I spent the first half hour not laughing. Though I anticipated the slurry of clichés, here they seemed more poorly executed than ever. Ben Stiller's performance was painful to endure - someone should tell him he's not untouchable. Jokes are rather sparse, but when they do appear, it is more often than not a woefully unfunny double entendre with the word 'ball(s)'. The stereotype of an East European woman is a joke that got old a long time ago, given that it was ever funny. I think the turning point (i.e. that which coerced me to turn the DVD off in place of getting my money's worth) was seeing Lance Armstrong's tastelessly misguided cameo. Whoever let him compare the fictional characters' struggle with his own real-life struggles should revise their sense of humour.I'm tired of ranting so I'm going to wrap it up. In conclusion, dreadful beyond words. Please save your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Misfits and half-wits play with their balls. Dodgeball is silly and parallels stupidity. Silly does not necessarily correlate with funny. Peter LaFluer(Vince Vaughn)runs a worn out gym called Average Joe's. Faltering and antiquated equipment and with mostly non-paying clients the gym is forced to undergo foreclosure by a sharp looking accountant, Kate(Christine Taylor). The gym's biggest competition comes from GloboGym owned by White Goodman(Ben Stiller). The need for big bucks fast...Average Joe's enters a Las Vegas dodgeball tournament, where predictably they meet opposition from the perfectly coiffed Goodman and his team. There is just something about the sound of a hard thrown dodgeball meeting flesh.I kept waiting to hear some trademark profanity from Vaughn...no go. Stiller in no matter what role annoys me...more so this time. Announcer Jason Bateman and coach Rip Torn were almost show stealers. Also in the cast: Justin Long, Jamal Duff, Missi Pyle and Hank Azaria. This dodgeball nowhere resembles the sport you played in Junior High School.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dodgeball" is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. And I watch many movies, all kinds of genres.Comedies are supposed to make you laugh. "Anchorman" was very mediocre, but I at least had a few good laughs. Dodgeball was so unfunny, it was painful to watch. It was the first movie directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, and it showed. This won't look good on his short resumeThere's a reason Hollywood is struggling. When you watch Dodgeball, you can see why when they release this crap and expect people to pay $8-plus to suffer through it. I didn't think the movie would be great, but I was shocked how lousy, cliché and unoriginal it was.Ben Stiller's character is TOO over-the-top, if that's possible, and simply embarrassing for his overrated career. Vince Vaughn can be a funny guy, but the writing is so atrocious, he's a pretty invisible character.This review is a friendly warning so you don't waste 90 minutes of your time, which could be better spent picking up dog crap in the back yard.</fullReview>

This was the worst thing I've ever been through. It wasn't even funny in the 'it's so terrible it's almost amusing!' way. It was typical at every single turn. It was a factory-packaged movie, and it was disturbingly last-rate considering the budget they must have had for those amazing cameos (Chuck Norris, William Shatner, Lance Armstrong, whoever the hell else they mashed in...). And hey, the great characters! "I know! In order to round up our strikingly 'average' group of underdogs, we can have one guy that thinks he's a pirate! Ha! Isn't that great?!?" Just, no.

		<fullReview>After I didn't laugh in the first 30 minutes the only way I could get through the rest of the movie was to keep track of each time I laughed. I counted exactly one chuckle at a Vince Vaughn line. I have laughed more at commercials. I'm not sure why it wasn't funny but I have seen quite a few comedies in my 36 years and I guess it's just too close to about 100 movies since 1980 with the same plot. "oh we have to come up with a bunch of money in an impossibly short time span to beat the big corporate meany and we can do it if we win this tournament" So many movies with similar themes, Karate Kid, Breakin' 2 and on. The writer-director doesn't deserve a writing credit. It is just cut and paste out of several other movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rips of BASEbasketball and dodges any type of humor! It's like a 10 minute SNL sketch stretched into a 90 minute frame!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this film because the trailer looked very funny. The producers must have taken all the funny bits and put them into 60 seconds. After that, there was no fun to be had.The funniest parts of this film were the ESPN graphics and jokes and Obscure Sports Quarterly, also a visual gag. The rest of the funny parts were stolen right from BASEbasketball-- the team names, the girls dancing in extreme costumes, the obscure sports idea-- but BASEbasket did it more original and more funny to watch. I highly recommend that over Dodgeball.The movie feels like it was a SNL sketch that should have lasted 10 minutes yet was stretched to fit an hour and a half. The actors look like they were given a couple lines and then told to go for it. They look blank at times like they don't have anything funny to say. Basically if you like comedies where the characters and situations are just supposed to be hilarious and they are, like The Royal Tenenbaums, devoid of any jokes or humor beyond that. Maybe this has something to do with Ben Stiller, since he was in both films. That might be the case, since I did like Bottle Rocket and Rushmore. I was brought up with the idea of comedies to either be satires or had a joke a minute thrown at you, like Airplane, the Naked Gun and South Park. A movie like Dodgeball moves slow because the characters, after they come into the scene and give you that one laugh, like the gym owner or the pirate guy, don't seem to have any more steam and the viewer is suppose to enjoy it for what it is. It seems to be the new wave of comedy film making and it isn't funny nor makes any sense. The jokes fall flat, like everything was improved and nothing was written down. Movies cannot live by improv alone. Take Timecode and movies like that....please. Then, if you get the DVD, there is an alternate ending that made me laugh, not because it was funny, because it was so bad. I don't think the director knows how to make a movie. Rawson Marshall Thurber should go back to his day job!I give this a 1, which is the lowest rating I have given any movie. If there was a 0, I would give it for my time wasted. I am glad I actually didn't see this in a theater. I would have asked for my money back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Couch-potatoed Vince Vaughn (as Peter La Fleur) and buff "Happy Days" fan Ben Stiller (as White Goodman) run rival workout clubs. Mr. Stiller, the more successful gym-runner, aims to take over the property run by Mr. Vaughn, which has somehow avoided foreclosure. To settle their disputes, club members from each play in a Las Vegas "Dodgeball" tournament, for a $50,000 cash prize. Beautiful blonde banker babe Christine Taylor (as Kate Veatch) attracts both Vaughn and Stiller.Written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, "Dodgeball" lost its singular "Razzie Award" nomination - although Stiller may get a "Lifetime Achievement" consolation prize, one of these years. This film's joke is, basically? people get hit by balls? which also happens to be how you describe something in a man's pants? Gary Cole and Jason Bateman are good announcers. Rip Torn plays a raunchy urine-drinking coach. Some familiar-faced cameos liven things up a little.

		<fullReview>This movie represents everything that is wrong with the modern day American cinema. After viewing it, i just felt compelled to create an IMDb account and write out of me this awful feeling this movie has left me with. Where do i start? Oh, how about the movie not being funny at all to someone that isn't an 'average Joe'? It really goes to the lowest of the low, like Vaughn's team motto 'Aim low'. Guys, they even made Rip Torn say things like 'Crotch stain' and made a dirty old bastard out of him.... Oh, there's also Chuck Norris, god knows why.. and Captain Kirk. God, i feel dumb after watching this insult to my idea of Ben Stiller. I can see this piece of excrement be entertaining only to those who do not care, or the brain dead. Even Stiller makes a remark about this, in the last minute of this 'movie'. To sum it up, Bad guy pathetically comical + his towering team of ethnically diverse henchmen on steroids, Good guy charming underachiever (so the target audience doesn't get offended, and can identify) + a group of oddballs that don't deserve life (but the movie makes their existence meaningful) + a token black dude (blaxploitating away) + a pirate (??) whose entire self-image is based on what Vaughn's character has to say during a self doubt now - hero redeem later scene. We also have that guy from the 'Excalibur' SF series, playing the role of the commentator, i liked Excalibur, so i can forgive. Oh, there's a girl, naturally, a tough one, naturally, that slams Stiller's character into a wall, in order to prove that women are tough. Women are really tough right? Yeah, i thought so. Oh, she's also not a lesbian, she's Bi. Is there a category on this site for the worst scene ever? The scene where the heroine kisses another woman and her comment 'I'm not lesbian. {pause} I'm bi-sexual' to quell the attention of Vaughn's character and that of the black token is sickeningly unimaginative. Whoever wrote this line really pulled a reverse Tolkien.Don't, for any reason whatsoever take an hour and a half out of your life to watch this. You'll smile twice and that's it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this were the "Eurovision Song Contest","Dodgeball" would be awarded the dreaded "Nil Points".It is a movie beyond bad.Mr Rip Torn is the best thing about it .He is merely very very bad.Apart from Mr Ben Stiller,Mr Torn is the only member of what can loosely described as "The Cast" that I have ever heard of and I am quite keen to keep it that way.Not that Mr Stiller is any good.He is so bad the word "bad" begins to lose any meaning.He contrived to screw up "The Royal Tenenbaums" but it flowed blithely around him.He managed to be less amusing than Robert de Niro in "Meet the parents",not an easy task for a comedian.In "Dodgeball",in the face of sterling opposition,he gives the worst performance in the movie. I have never heard of dodgeball as a competitive sport,I thought it had been invented purely for the movie,rather like "Rollerball",but it appears not to be the case.That being so,all I can say is "Only in America"...... The game appears to revolve around two teams throwing a ball as hard as possible at each other with the object of hitting an opponent with it. We may have to wait some time for the Joe DiMaggio of dodgeball to emerge I would imagine. Whatever its merits or otherwise as a game per se,whether it is a worthy subject for a feature film is certainly to say the least debatable. What is beyond debate is that "Dodgeball" is a movie that has been allowed to sprawl,start and stutter with no sign of a controlling hand until it peters out rather like a Monty Python sketch nobody could be bothered to think of an end for. The man who made this should be smacked gently but firmly on the legs, have his toys taken away from him and made to promise never to do it again.</fullReview>

Everything else tends to be films where everyone says "you've gotta see it... it's so funny" and then when you actually sit through it, you either can't wait for it to end or you turn it off. Dodgeball was no exception to the rule.The screenwriters must have burst a blood vessel in their brain coming up with the misfit underdog formula and once they had put the finishing touches on this trite, they handed it over to the casting agent who looked no further than the dreadful Ben Stiller to fly across the screen as the moronic and ultimately unfunny adversary. The fact that this crap made so much money is a sad indictment on the general public's taste in comedy.And I'm still waiting for a Ben Stiller film that I actually like.</fullReview>

The fact that everyone is taking dodgeball so seriously is THE joke of the movie, and it wears thin. I also don't like the blatantly socialist message of this movie. The good guys are the ones who have a crappy gym, and who don't even charge their members to use the gym. The bad guys are the ones from Ben Stiller's gym. Stiller's character says that he built his gym from the ground up - starting from nothing. He built a successful gym with nice facilities. So what is so bad about that, and why does that make him the bad guy?

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Nearly all films are about other films, sometimes literally so.An 'ordinary' mass film purports to abstract life by replaying stuff from the established vocabulary. I dare say there are thousands and thousands of sports films with this plot: apparent weaklings triumph which a key individual reaffirms some sort of purity. Last night I saw 'Barbershop 2' which though not strictly a sports movie, wears the metaphor like many blacks wear 'leisure' athletic clothes. That's the ordinary. Then you have the kind of film that does precisely the same abstraction, except instead of purportedly from life, it is from the genre. Exact same everything, except the abstraction is that much more extreme.Ted's law says that the two abstractions (from life to the ordinary film and from the ordinary film to the spoof) must be exactly the same. That's because ALL the cinematic mechanisms must be the same, else there is no joke.I believe this style started in 1950's TeeVee skits, and probably 15 or 20 minutes is about as long as you can sustain the joke. To judge from the success of Austin Powers, some folks can take it longer. Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

Men - especially male actors - seem to be aspiring to become these horribly tanned plastic muscle-mutants i just hate that look. it's absolutely ugly and of course mind-bogglingly idiotic.the sets + costumes + makeup etc. are just as horribly lacking in any sense of imagination or style or comedy as the incredibly unfunny one-liners throughout the movie.as for the disgusting stuff, obviously they had to keep it lame-disgusting to get a PG-13 rating, having said that though, there are extremely idiotic brutal scenes - e.g. a mad coach throwing edged and pointed metal tools at kids to make them a more competitive dodgeball-team and them loving him for it.Of course we don't get to see one single drop of blood. and it's exactly that kind of absurd scenarios coupled with extremely reactionary ideas,prudishness and pseudo-funny clichéd non-jokes that makes this movie truly offensive.OK, enough. you have been warned.</fullReview>

All in all, this movie is an insult to those who watch it.I know some people found this to be humorous, and I could see that it might appeal to some preteens with an obnoxious sense of humor.

I know, all of you in your corporate offices are probably shocked right now, thinking 'well, a bicycle has two wheels, doesn't that mean a bisexual has two partners?!' No, as a matter of fact, it doesn't. And as a bisexual in a loving manogamous relationship, I'm really starting to get p***ed off here.

		<fullReview>I was actually amazed by this film. Going into the theater, my expectations were on an all time low, yet somehow the intellectual challenge that is "Dodgeball the Movie" still manages to disappoint.With movies of this genre, you expect bad acting, a barrage of cliches and stereotypes, and a lot of cheap slapstick humor. And that's OK. But nothing can adequately prepare you for the headache inducing performance of Ben Stiller. Even to his own rock bottom standards, his acting (if we're going to use that word) is truly dismal. In fact, all the bad things about this type of film, the cliches, the predictability, it all seems to be just a bit worse in this 13-a-dozen Hollywood celluloid disposal.But of course the real test is this: Is it fun, does this movie entertain you? Sadly, the answer is no. The total amount of beer you would have to drink in order to make this movie enjoyable would kill all but the most experienced alcoholics. The characters just aren't funny, and most of the jokes are too simple, too predictable and too badly timed to work. Sure there's a couple of good laughs here and there, but don't hold your breath.If you are contemplating seeing this film, then here's my advise to you: don't. Use the money to buy "There's something about Mary", "American Pie" or "Hey dude, where's my car" on DVD and invite a couple of friends over. The movie will be better and the beer will be cheaper.</fullReview>
