		<shortDescription>A Very Puzzling Missed Opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of how World War Z was made is a lot more harrowing and suspenseful than the film itself. After going way over-budget and enduing a complete revision and reshoot of the final act, WWZ wasn't exactly set up for success. Ultimately the movie is completely forgettable and uneven, but not offensively bad or objectively terrible in any sense. What struck me about it was how much of a wasted opportunity it was, given how interesting and entertaining the source material is.Having read the book World War Z, I could tell from the trailers for this movie that it wouldn't exactly be a faithful adaptation. I thought that the most interesting aspects of the book were its exploration of how the Zombie plague affected social and political structures across the world. Anything like that is completely ignored in the film, but I can at least understand how the filmmakers thought that those aspects wouldn't work in a single feature length movie. What I can't understand is how the filmmakers seemingly ignored the book's most obviously cinematic content. The book features a lot of setpiece action scenes, and to be fair, many of these involve world cities falling to zombie infestation and the movie does do enough to cover this. However, the book's immense battle scenes - the meat of the titular Zombie War, such as the Battle of Yonkers, nuclear war between Pakistan and Iran, Chinese civil war and massive formation combat against zombies - are completely absent. I was very surprised that they did not cover these, especially the Yonkers scene, because they would obviously fit so well into a film and the script, even as it is now, could easily be tweaked to include or at least mention them. The action that did make it into this film is very unsatisfying and obscure thanks to the restrictions of the PG-13 rating, and the narrative around is not engaging enough to really get me invested in it.I was also surprised at how cheap this movie looked. This film cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make, but it's hard to see where it all went on the screen. Swarms of zombies look very fake and nonthreatening, and in some cases individual zombies are computer animated, which gave me bad flashbacks to I Am Legend's awful CGI overload. Aside from the opening scenes in Philadelphia and the middle act in Jerusalem, there are no big outdoor sets. A South Korean airbase is portrayed as a series of dark rooms; too much of the movie takes place in an airline seat; there is a lot of sitting around inside of the aircraft carrier, etc. The sense of scale is very inconsistent, and this is accentuated in the bizarre final act, which was obviously the focus of the infamous reshoots as it feels like a completely separate movie. I consider myself a patient viewer, but this very long and dull scene started to bring me down after a while, and my less patient viewing audience eventually fell completely out of sync with the film and began to make fun of it at every opportunity - not really a fair criticism of the film, but it's a real issue when it can't hold an audience's attention. The final act does actually have an interesting idea at its heart, albeit one that completely doesn't connect with anything in the book, but I just didn't think it was a well executed concept. The very different style and tone of these scenes makes it feel like a completely different movie.Again, while there was nothing all that terrible about WWZ, I didn't think it was anything to get excited about. In other words, a perfect 5/10 movie. I wish they were more aware of the source material's potential because without the best and most cinematic aspects of the book, WWZ (the film)and WWZ (the book) only share a title and the central premise of a zombie plague, which is not an original idea in itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light, family friendly and internationally marketable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, Hollywood. You saw the zombie apocalypse coming didn't you? Not a literal apocalypse of course, just 16 dozen different zombie books, graphic novels, games and TV shows taking over the world like the plague, and you just had to have your piece of the pie, didn't you?World War Z is based on the 2006 novel by Max Brooks. The novel garnered some quite positive reviews, praised for its international and political scope. It also caught the eye of producer and star Brad Pitt, who after a long struggle with studios, directors, producers and other Hollywood zombies, managed to put together a half decent movie with director Marc Forster.Half decent? Well, WWZ certainly isn't a bad movie. You've got the long-time Oscar-deserving Pitt playing Gerry Lane, a likable, good-looking family man who retired as a UN investigator to spend more time around his wife and daughters. This is all about to change obviously, because after the now seemingly mandatory news-footage-montage introduction, Gerry is called back by the UN in exchange for his family's safety on their big boat.It sounds good enough, but the problem is that WWZ's political/international context is nowhere to be found so we're left pretty much to 28 Days Later with blockbuster pretentiousness. Sure, Gerry travels around the world and makes a few long distance phone calls, but there's never anything remotely compelling enough to warrant his travels and whenever the plot does manage to come close to something it quickly sets it aside in the interest of keeping this summer blockbuster light, family friendly and internationally marketable.After Quantum of Solace there was much uncertainty about Forster's ability to direct action and after WWZ, guess what? There still is. Granted, it's never boring, but when the other elements that should've made the film aren't there it should be more than "never boring". Paramount's marketing certainly didn't help; if you've seen the trailers then you've seen the whole plot and LITERALLY every single action set piece, in chronological order too. You know when you see a trailer and think "they put all the good parts in"? Well, this time they put the whole movie in. The more hardcore genre fans might also want to look elsewhere if they're seeking gory zombie kills; there isn't much of that either as its PG-13 rating might suggest.Brad Pitt is really the film's only strength. Much like Tom Cruise, Brad's got enough talent to singlehandedly pull you through a not-so-great movie without you hating him for it. And at almost age 50 you can't really blame him for wanting to star in his own big blockbuster franchise for the first time in his career when he could've played any superhero he wanted years ago. "Franchise" of course, if permitted by the audience, because this is one movie that desperately wants to have sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a movie, it is a special demo with no plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The special effects were impressive, I will give you that. However, the rest wasn't. The 2 hour experience felt like watching titanic sink, in real time. Here is a list of the things that went wrong:1. PG13 rating: The director and producers wanted to make this movie family friendly, so they took away all the gore, death and decay that makes the zombie genre what it is. This made the zombies totally not scary and even on occasions towards the end, just plain laughable.2. Senseless plot: The UN sends a small team to investigate the beginning of the outbreak. They have a neurologist on the team, who incidentally cant stop using cheesy metaphors about mother nature. Why can't they send multiple teams, with more than one expert on each? After all it is clearly a high risk mission, casualties must be expected. After the neurologist dies right after his pretentious speech, it is clear that the whole thing was an excuse to put Brad Pitt in a dangerous situation so that we will feel tension. We still didn't because, see 3.3. Bad character development: None of the characters in the movie had any depth. As a result we didn't care if they lived or died. Pitt's family was just the detestable suburban family, who apparently does nothing but turn money into feces. Their marriage and children felt so plastic and ready-made that I personally would not have felt a thing if Pitt was torn apart by zombies in front of his family. Well, actually that might have improved this movie, alas it couldn't have happened because of 1.4. The ending sequence: Just as we think that the plot cannot get worse and we make peace with the idea of enjoying the special effects, the movie takes another down turn in the last 40 minutes or so. The special effects disappear and we find Pitt and his sidekick in a W.H.O. research facility playing hide and seek with zombies. There is no suspense because the ending is announced basically in the first 5 minutes of this sequence, Pitt will go into the zombie infested part of the building, get some disease samples and bring them back. They will use one of the samples to infect themselves and see if zombies will lose their appetite. They do, and we win, with another pretentious speech about how it is not the end but just the beginning. Yawn.5. Plot holes: a) Zombies can diagnose a terminal illness just by looking at someone and for some reason, they avoid that person. This doesn't make any sense at any level. First, even a doctor with years of medical training can't do that without extensive testing. How can a mindless zombie, who cant figure out how to unbuckle her seat belt, do it just after a glance by the corner of her eye? Second, why the hell would zombies avoid a sick person? There is no reason. After all, the virus, or whatever that is causing the outbreak is not harmed by any other disease. The W.H.O. scientists said so themselves.b) The W.H.O. facility is in Wales, Britain. Among the weapons they have in their arsenal is a baseball bat. Does the director even know where Wales is? Does anyone, one soul in Wales, own a baseball bat? Was that so difficult to make it a cricket bat? Come on now, I think that the director is a bit of a thickie but I can't believe that no one who looked at this movie pre-release had seen Shaun of the Dead. And to add insult to injury, the soldier girl with one hand picks the baseball bat. This scene alone is enough to prove that the director of the movie is blind from birth, because anyone who had at least one functioning eye at any point in his life and used it to glance at a baseball bat would have immediately realized that it is a two-handed weapon. How could a special forces soldier could not recognize it as such and not pick the crowbar?c) The cellphone battery: In one scene, the cellphone's battery is declared dead. In a later scene, it is working again. Really?d) When they decide to recover the disease samples, they give Pitt no briefing about which containers contain what. But apparently, at least one container is full of deadly stuff, which would kill him immediately. Why? Why? OMG, why? The security cameras show the room clearly. All they need to do is to seat Pitt and the soldier girl in front of one of the displays and show them where the goodies are before sending them in.e) Pitt has no special combat, first aid or survival training. He apparently learned all that stuff on the field, and he is not a scientist either. Finally, he doesn't have experience as a commanding officer. So, why would he, instead of literally thousands of military people who were purpose-trained for such a mission, is chosen to lead the mission? It doesn't make any sense. It would have made a lot of sense if his UN friend said something like "Look, I convinced these people that you are the best man to lead this mission though we both know that you aren't. You are just a guy who spent ten years handing out blankets to African countries. But I had to do it to save your family, alright? They would have never let you on the ship otherwise and you would have died in Philly." That would have not only sealed this plot hole, but also would have given Pitt's character a tragic and desperate quality, which would have helped us care about him. But the mindless zombies who made this movie missed this chance too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5/10. Sorry folks, It's pretty pants. And I REALLY wanted it to be good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT. SPOILER ALERT! You have been warned.The Premiere -I was at the London World Premiere last week, and Interestingly there was clearly tension between Mark (Director) and Brad Pitt. I would have thought a director of this size movie would be able to make a speech. But no. Reading from cards he fumbled over his words, got his actors names seriously wrong in front of 1000 people and was clearly very very nervous. Which is odd because any director should be excited or proud to be presenting their work to the world!Brad Pitt in interview said they chose Mark as he was really good at the little emotional moments between characters. Well they mush have cut those bits out.The movie -A zombie film with no blood? I've no idea what the zombies were doing as we never see them kill anyone! They just run around a lot, far too fast for a 'human being'. No decapitated zombies, and a incredibly poor script that could have been knocked together in an evening. Speaking to actors who worked on the film they told me a lot of the dialogue was improvised. And it shows. Good dialogue is written. It is very hard for an actor to come up with great dialogue on set with crew around, lights, explosions, gun fire and a budget and schedule pressing down on you - that is what rehearsals and, dare I say, a screenwriter are for.I just don't think Mark Forster (Quantum of Bollox) knows how to direct. No emotional connection to any of the characters. No big climax at the end and the least threatening Zombie in the history of movies. Click click click. A tedious V/O from Brad at the end, about "only just the beginning, of the war, YAWN..." We have heard this a hundred times.There was some truly awful acting, characters that appear and go in a scene, that do nothing, and flimsy science that is just insulting to anyone who can actually think.The only good bit was the Zombie as Ants scene, but it would have been hugely improved if a zombie with a giant leaf walked past in the background.The audience laughed at several moment, that I don't believe the director even realised were gags! Brad doesn't even really do any acting. He does a bit of running around and a fight or two. No great lines, and I don't really believe that he loves his kids and wife so terribly much.Best thing in it was - Daniella Kertesz, but her scenes are clearly cut to bits, unlike her hand, which just seems to be fine after a couple of gin and tonics. I'll have what she's having!And leaning suitcases against a curtain? Seriously. That was really bad.The film could have been saved in the Edit - with some clever re-positioning of the major scenes, to get the structure right, but having seen Brad and Mark together, they had clearly fallen out of love with the movie.Nothing here we haven't seen in 28 Days Later, or any other zombie film, or even The War of the World that was written 100 years ago.At the end the applause was half hearted and everyone got up and left super fast.The aftermath -Please GOD can we stop giving bad directors a second, and in this case 10th chance. This film made me angry that a studio can waste so much money on what was a mediocre idea even at the beginning, and gave it to a director who has a proved track record of not being able to fix a bad script, or direct action.The budget on this would keep an independent film maker in business for the next 400 years - or if we put that in a real time scale - all the way back to Elizabeth the 1st.Frustrating.Nothing to see here ladies and gentlemen, move on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast, scary and much better than expected!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was dubious! The rating, the early reviews, my love of gory George Romero movies had all led me to deciding not to see this. But, my wife wanted to go... Well, two breathless hours later I turned to her, big grin on my face and had to state "That was awesome!" Yes, I can see why people don't like it. It is very different to the traditional zombie movie, and very different to the book. But you know what, who cares - it's not a traditional zombie movie, or the book - it's different. So suck it it up whiners and enjoy this for what it is! (And I'm a huge fan of all Max Brooks zombie books.) The movie begins with a short intro to the main character and his family (it was enough, it told me all I needed to know) before launching into a fantastic, break neck sequence that establishes the pace for most of the rest of the movie. It's violent, visceral and shocking without any reliance in gore. The tension is racked up (especially in the escape from the apartment block sequence) with a series of spectacular set pieces (the walls of Jerusalem scene is brilliant) and things get better and bigger until the film slows the pace for the final reel with a slow burning, smaller scale sequence set in a WHO research lab in the UK. It's an unusual choice to end a movie with the smallest set piece, but it worked well for me as it was in line with Gerry's quest and the (stated in the movie) fact that the answer is often so small it gets overlooked. The gravity of the decisions Gerry has to make here are greater than any previously in the movie (where mostly he just has to run like hell!) and it's that that makes this such a powerful set piece to end the movie. I learnt several things from this movie 1) to let go of my preconceptions about what a zombie film should be, 2) that a low rating doesn't mean its for kids - I have two sons and despite the lack of gore I certainly wouldn't let then see this. Its very intense and that (not the gore) is what would scare them. 3) to go with the flow - I did here and was swept along for a rapid fire 2 hour thrill ride that was a hell of a lot of fun. I for one will be getting this on blu ray and I'll be first in line for any sequel. But I will admit, an undated version would be very welcome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the war?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by giving a summary of the book: A journalist travels the world AFTER the zombie outbreak to interview different people from different countries to see how they handled this massive infestation. It gives points of view from different characters on how they handled themselves and uses real-world scenarios to show realistically how such a thing would be combated. On to the movie: Where did ANY of this go? First of all, instead of showing how DIFFERENT people handle this situation, it shows how ONE MAN handles it. Brad Pitt. For a movie that seems to want to be taken seriously as true-to-life, it sure does fail when it introduces the premise that somehow a RETIRED UN investigator is the most important man in the world and the only one who can save it. If such were the case, why send him out with ONLY a handful of soldiers instead of a small army of Special Forces? Also, why introduce this young, brilliant doctor as the possible hope for humanity if he is only going to idiotically shoot himself in the first thirty minutes of the movie? To me it seemed like Brad Pitt said: "Woah, wait a minute. You can't let a dorky doctor save the world. I'm the hero! Kill him off!", stamped his foot, and went to pout in a corner. I had heard that Pitt (the producer) and Forster (the director) were at odds through the entire filming, so the script had to be re-written several times to accommodate Pitt's hissy fits, so I'm slow to blame Forster for this awful "adaptation".The zombies: LOL! These zombies are everything you'd expect if Disney decided to do a Pixar zombie film. Most of them are done using CGI, and the ones who are actual actors are completely non-scary and laughable. Gnashing their teeth like poorly acted Cenobytes from the Hellraiser series. In order to sell more tickets, they opted for a PG-13 rating, so there is no blood and I don't remember seeing a zombie kill a single person. How do you make a zombie movie when the antagonist which is supposed to strike fear into our hearts just seems like a football game gone horribly wrong? Super fast running and lots of flying tackles does not for a zombie apocalypse make.The plot: I know this movie was trying for something different, and failed horribly. They should have just called it "28 Months Later". The supposed plot twist at the end, which was re-written 4 or 5 times, seemed put together at the last minute, and as if the writers just said: "eh, screw it. Just do this and release the movie so we can get a paycheck." Anyone who thinks that making it a metaphor for the current state of events and painting the UN into the saviors of humanity is something new has obviously not seen the FAR superior District 9. I will not get into all the other plot holes so monstrous you could drive a bus through them.The acting: Who are these people? Why should we care about them? Their performances are wooden. They have such small roles because Brad Pitt seems to want to hog all the screen time, and even then his own performance is stilted and lackluster. He lacks any sort of emotion and I never once felt that I could connect to his character at all. The filmmakers would have done a much better job if he'd been introduced as an average joe.Summary: I see a lot of people praising the action in this movie, but I found it extremely boring. Any action presented was the same: "Brad Pitt goes to new country, Brad Pitt gets attacked, Brad Pitt saves a handful of people, Brad Pitt runs to new country". For the overbloated budget, this movie offered nothing new or refreshing. On top of that, it could not even succeed as a good zombie film. Movies like 28 Days Later, The Horde, and hell, even Cockneys vs. Zombies show that a great zombie film does not need a huge budget to make it great. This was simply Pitt's and Hollywood's attempt at taking something people love (zombies) and cashing in on it. The 7.4 rating I see this movie had must have been paid for, because 9/10ths of the user reviews I see for this film are just BAD! Same as the film itself. The good reviews I see praise it as "The Best Zombie Movie I've Seen" ? which leads me to believe they haven't seen ANY zombie movies before, and that the movie is "Intelligent and Realistic", which if you see my above points, just isn't the case. Usually I am very forgiving in terms of movies lacking realism, but this one was trying to sell itself on that very premise. Also, I am not harsh on films for not being perfect adaptations of a book, but this is different, because it has absolutely NOTHING to do with the book at all aside from the wall in Israel and the title itself.4/10 simply because some parts of it did look nice, and I'm even being in a giving mood with that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>28 Months Later For Morons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If a film is sold by a trailer it's this one . I've never read the source novel but do know it is structured as reportage where the world has been changed by a zombie infestation leading to a new geo-political shape for the world so in many ways this is more of a prequel than an adaptation . I did like Danny Boyle's genre shattering 28 DAYS LATER and loved the sequel and unfortunately it looks like that franchise has ended so in some ways this could be a surrogate 28 MONTHS LATER . Add to this the trailers where the waves of infected storm barriers against heavily armed soldiers and we've got a Zombie classic in the making don't we ?No we don't because this is a film that gives the impression that it was written and made by zombies From the outset we get something incomprehensible - the outbreak itself . WWZ keeps the origins of the virus an enigma and right away this damages the premise . At least in 28 DL the audience are afforded an opening scene of the rage virus escaping and you're very quickly able to buy in to this scenario . WWZ doesn't do this but an opening scene alludes to a virus breaking out across the world via news reports . Cut to scientist Brad Pitt driving his family in Philadelphia and finds himself in a traffic jam . Within seconds people run screaming from their cars as rabid zombies run everywhere This scene is mildly effective but there's a spanner in the works . Two spanners actually . One is that's very clear that the incubation period of this virus is a few seconds almost identical to that established in 28 DL . In reality such a violent virus would spread like wild fire but the thing is it wouldn't be able to cross continents which renders the later parts of the film as incomprehensible from a logic point of view . Secondly you will find it impossible to buy in to this scenario . I know I didn't but please feel free to ask questions As the film progresses Brad Pitt's scientist - and I won't call him by his character name because he doesn't have a character - jumps on a plane to South Korea then off to Israel where the Israelis have managed to block out the infected by building a massive big wall " Wow that was quick Theo . The Israelis must be very good bricklayers to build a wall when the infection has only existed for a couple of days " Oh no because the Mossad chief got word from India a few week earlier that the Indian army were fighting zombies . Before you ask it's never revealed why the news media never got hold of this potential headline , nor is it revealed why when the rest of the world is battling Zombies this unknown virus never got in to Israel The action scenes in Jerusalem are impressive from a spectacle point of view but again lack internal continuity . Safe behind their wall the Israelis let in refugees - while armies of Zombies swarm around outside . Narrowly escaping the carnage Brad stops to amputate the hand of a female IDF soldier whose just been bitten which defies credibility " But Theo you know these Israelis are tough nuts and women have to endure pain and blood every month "Not in the same league as amputation though is it ? Then Brad phones the UN who tell him that he must make his way to WHO research lab in Wales . Don't ask why there's no nearer research centres between Cardiff and Jerusalem . while on the aeroplane a Zombie that just happened to be hiding in the cupboard jumps out and spreads the infection leading to IDF girl to throw a grenade that causes the plane to crash in Wales . So they have a short walk to the WHO research centre " Wouldn't blood loss caused by getting your hand amputated make you too weak to go for a short walk ? And wouldn't Britain being an island make quarantine against the virus much easier ? I mean if the Israelis managed it ? " Look sit down and shut up . I know this was a major plot point that the rage virus couldn't escape from Britain in 28DL but if you think you can write a better Hollywood screenplay join the 7 billion people heading towards Hollywood right now . The last half hour involves more idiotic plotting that rely on coincidence , good fortune and after spending nearly every scene pointing out that the Zombies are attracted to noise someone just has to shoot a gun . The film ends with a solution to the problem which doesn't make the slightest bit of sense but means the human race can now concentrate on wiping out the Zombies " But Theo won't the Zombies die of thirst ? " I said shut up . If anything about this film made any sense it have been more than a loud dumb Summer blockbuster . You do notice that everything about it seems to have commercial consideration . Brad Pitt jumping all over the world meeting so many different nationalities does seem a cynical attempt at audience identification . Likewise the very obvious lack of blood and gore might supposedly attract people who fear the post apocalypse / Zombie genre ( Hello Bob The Moo ) but they'll notice the lack of intelligent plotting which severely damages the film and gore hounds who enjoy blood and guts will be disappointed by the extremely inoffensive nature of WWZ . Danny Boyle you're needed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombie blockbuster for a generic audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read the book so I'm not coming from viewing this as an adaptation but rather a stand-alone film. (From what I've heard it's pretty far from the original source anyway.) First off, a zombie film watered-down and free from blood and gore? That idea alone would lose a big slice (pun-intended) of hardcore fans in the audience. How does it hold your attention then? By stringing you along on the edge with tension and suspense from beginning to end. It does a pretty good job of maintaining this grip even without the standard horror elements of slasher flicks.Brad Pitt easily slips into the role of a family man desperate to keep his family safe. It's not difficult to root for him and share in his urgency. His charm certainly makes up for and saves the movie from its flaws (and there are many!) not the least of which are its gaping plot holes and loose direction.The audience in the theater seemed to have fun screaming along and allowing themselves to be entertained and toyed with. There are a handful of funny scenes (whether intentional or not). If you're willing to quit analyzing the movie like a critic, you'll probably start enjoying it.After all, when did a zombie movie ever have to be "BELIEVABLE"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've listed that this review contains spoilers, but I haven't included anything that the trailer hasn't already given away.And the that's my main problem with "World War Z" The Trailer. If you've seen the trailer you've seen the movie. It literally shows everything that happens in the movie completely destroying any suspense that might have been had. "World War Z" isn't a conventional movie with a flowing plot line that builds to a dramatic conclusion. It's more like a bunch of individual parts laid out in a not so very straight line, and strung together loosely by a single character. I don't have much of a problem with that, or the facts the Zombies aren't of the undead kind, slow moving kind like they were in the source novel. But rather the rabid, sprinting, quick turning kind like in "28 days later" Brad Pit is good and takes the roll seriously. The CGi is top notch, and the movie is well made. The problem I had is that I new exactly what was going to happen, before it happened, because they showed it in the stupid trailer. Literally, every single cool action shot that's in the movie they showed in the trailer. Every single plot point. Even the dialog scenes. I knew the jest of what was going to be said because they showed the important parts in the trailer! I kept waiting for the extended version but it never came. There's no suspense. (I know there's Zombies on the plane and that Brad Pitt blows a hole in the side sucking them all out, crashing the plane, because they show it in the trailer!) That's just one example of a long list of scenes that you totally know what's fixing to happen because, well... You've seen it already. This is one movie I wish I could have gone in completely blank. Not having read the book, not having seen the trailer, and I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the end of World War Z, just as the credits began rolling, a gentleman, scratch that, an idiot spoke up from the back of the theatre exclaiming, "What? That sucked! The book was nothing like that! Booo!" I'm sure he scurried away back home, logged online, and began tweeting, posting, and blogging, furthering his rant. Much like my response to him at the theatre, I hope he receives silence in return.It's true, World War Z is nothing like the book. The book is told from the point of view AFTER the war. It's a "historical," account of what happened during the war. Rather than make a mockumentary with flashbacks, which would have been the wrong decision in my opinion, the filmmakers decided to put us right in the middle of the action.When adapting a piece of literature it is impossible to bring every page, every paragraph, every nuance onto the screen. Some have come close depending on the material, but for the most part, they all have to take their own creative licenses. After all, it's called an "adaptation," for a reason, otherwise they would call it a copy or mimic.Where World War Z works (that's a mouthful) and where so many others fail is that just because the world slips into total and utter chaos, doesn't mean that governments, military, and law enforcement agencies go away. Quite the opposite. If anything, these scenarios bring out the best of all of them. We see generals, UN delegates, and scientists trying to solve complex issues that they don't know anything about. Rather than going into hiding, they act. Society doesn't crumble. Bands of cannibals and leather strapped gangs don't patrol the streets with necklaces made of teeth. People do what they can to survive, and the higher ups try their best to find a fast and effective solution.At first, I thought the movie started too fast. How could something this violent and concentrated go undetected, but after a while I got it. The opening montage of news reports said it all. How many of us listen to everything we hear on the news? Exactly. So much goes undetected while we focus on issues that effect us immediately. It's too late when the virus touches US soil. Not even social media can keep up with it.As far as zombie movies go this one is pretty great. Though I think 28 Days Later takes the cake in terms of realism, in-camera effects, and sheer terror, this one holds its own. Brad Pitt plays a former UN investigator who is traveling with his family just as the zombie attack on Philadelphia unfolds. The film goes from 0-60 before you take a sip of your Coke. This is a fast paced, edge of your seat thrill ride led by one of the finest actors of this generation (Pitt's acting ability is far too underrated and lost in the kerfuffle of tabloid news).For those of you who stare at the ticket window debating whether or not to see a film in 3D or standard, you might want to spend the extra few dollars to see this one in 3D (I know it's asking a lot, but maybe you can sneak some candy or a bottle of water to offset the concession stand price - deal with it). I tend to air on the side of "screw it, I want to see it in 3D." Now not every movie NEEDS to be seen in 3D, hell there are really only a couple that absolutely have to be seen in all three dimensions (Avatar and maybe Life of Pi), but this one really surprised me. 3D is not about things jumping out at you, but it's about layers. Luckily this film has both. Big chase scenes in Philly, particles floating about in South Korea, and tracking shots in Jerusalem make this one of the 3D events of the year. No exaggeration.Like so many other summer blockbusters before it, civilization is on the brink of extinction and only a handful of experts can save us. What World War Z does that so many have failed is give us hope. Hope that humanity won't dissolve into nothingness. In the face of sheer danger these fighters stand tall, take a deep breath, look the enemy in the eye, and say, "No."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a waste of money.... and I do not only mean for the tickets. The whole production must have been quite expensive. And I guess the taxpayer pays for all scenes where the US Navy or Airforce shows up? For what? The movie failed on all accounts and didn't even manage to create tension or scare people. The audience even started laughing in certain scenes. Uff I really don't know where to start: Satellite phones that work inside steel vessels, EMP kills electronics including satellite phones but only hours late they seem to be working again, amputations that don't cause the victim to bleed to death, kids that are totally cool after losing their families (high five!).... and i could go on and on. By the way the sponsors of the movie must have been Duct tape and Pepsi. The only creepy feeling i get is that movies like this or "The Purge" play a certain role to prepare society for future apocalyptic events. God bless America!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very Mixed Bag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pros: - Epic scope: This is without a doubt the biggest zombie movie ever made. The exact budget of the film is unknown, but due to its prolonged and troubled production some have estimated the movie cost as much as 250 million dollars to make. And the film-makers really make sure you're aware of how expensive the movie would've been to make, with a number of staggering shots featuring thousands and thousands of zombies swarming all over each other. The movie earns its title, given the fact that it is truly a zombie movie on a global scale. - Brad Pitt: He's very good in this movie, and is definitely one of the best things about the film. He makes for a compelling and likable hero who has to rely more on his intelligence than physical power. He's no superhero in this film, and his vulnerability and "everyday-man" nature keeps him relatable and likable.- Action scenes: As mentioned before, there's a ton of zombies in this movie. And yes, a lot of them are CGI, which I personally don't have a problem with because there were so many it's unlikely they could've done a lot of these scenes with actual extras portraying the zombies. The hordes of zombies allow for some truly spectacular action scenes on a large scale, all of which I'd rather not talk about in too much detail, because the zombie/action scenes are really the best part of the film, so it's definitely best not to ruin the scenes by giving you too much of an idea of what to expect- Use of the word "zombie": This didn't necessarily make the film better, but it was just interesting to see the word "zombie" used frequently by the film's characters. The word "zombie" has been treated for so long as a clichéd term in zombie films that it's now kind of refreshing to see it used so honestly and openly in a serious zombie film. Cons: - Lack of gore: Now don't get me wrong, I don't need blood and guts in every single movie I watch. But with zombie films, gory violence is a necessity. You need to see zombies getting ripped apart to emphasise how they are literally the "living dead," and you need to see humans die graphic deaths to reinforce how much of a threat the zombies can be. But this film wants to appeal to pretty much anyone aged 10 and up so Brad Pitt and friends can get more money, so of course we get very little blood, plus no on-screen guts, severed limbs, or exploding heads. - Shaky cam: This kind of ties in with the lack of gore; it's like the cameraman is shying away from the more graphic moments (it's The Hunger Games all over again). The shaky cam's only really noticeable in the film's first half hour though, while the zombie outbreak is just beginning, so it's not a huge problem. Still a little bothersome though.- Unfulfilling ending: This movie does end in an abrupt fashion, and kind of left me wanting more. It ends very suddenly, and I kind of thought to myself- "really? That's it?" The biggest action scene in the movie occurs about halfway through the film, and the final zombie confrontation was fairly quiet and low-key, which just felt a bit off to me. That being said, the jarringly sudden ending could be seen as a good thing, as it demonstrated that the movie went by fairly quickly. It's just under two hours long, but the final scene honestly felt as though the film was at about the 80-minute mark. But still, the ending was a little unsatisfying, so I ultimately see the ending as a con.- Unintentionally funny zombies: Zombies can be funny, and zombie movies can be part-comedy and still be great zombie movies. Shaun of the Dead and ZombieLand are both very funny movies that also manage to be pretty good legitimate zombie films (they don't exclusively poke fun at the zombie genre). George A. Romero worked some great satire into 1978&#x2032;s Dawn of the Dead, by comparing the zombies in the film's mall to the mindless, braindead consumers who inhabited the mall pre-zombie apocalypse. World War Z didn't feel like it was meant to have much comedy in it with its serious tone and gritty aesthetic, yet at times I found myself laughing at the way the film's zombies expressed exaggerated twitchy movements, and the manner in which more than a few of them chattered their teeth repeatedly in a cartoonish manner.- Slight lack of tension: The movie lacks some much needed suspense because it's basically Brad Pitt saving the world himself. Maybe if Pitt's character had a few allies forming like a "rag-tag squad" or something, and they went around battling zombies as a group, it would've made things more intense and involving, as a few of them would inevitably die along the way. I don't know, a few more well-developed side characters would've gone quite a long way in making me more invested in the film's events.So there's my thoughts on this film. It's a mixed bag, but ultimately I'd recommend it. It's worth seeing at the cinema just for those spectacular action scenes, and simply so you can see the sheer scale of the biggest budgeted zombie film of all time. It's flawed as hell though, so go in with moderate expectations. It could be a whole lot better, but ultimately the film's still pretty decent, and a good one to experience on the big screen. It's certainly a fine summer blockbuster, but it's unlikely that the film will ever achieve a "classic status."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quiet possibly the worst film I have seen this year!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I think everyone is aware this film has had a lot of troubles, and for those of you that weren't, you will soon see why if you waste you money, let alone your time on this excuse of a film.Like a number of people that have posted I also wanted to believe this film would offer something, but it doesn't. It is not original, the SFX are average, the acting is poor.I like Pitt in most his films, but in this one, I honestly think this is some of the worst acting of his career - look out for the scene where Pitt is in the WHO building in the last act when he finds out that all the dangerous viruses are in the B wing where.... you guessed it all the zombies are, I actually laughed out loud at his acting it was that bad.The films jumps about and you develop no emotion for any of the characters, even from the opening scenes I just didn't buy into the loving family that Pitt was supposed to be a part of.The end of the film is also one of the worst closures to a film i have seen. It was if, they hadn't filmed an ending so thought how the hell do we bring this to a close, and a bright spark said I know we'll get Pitt to explain it all via narration that will keep the fools that have sat through it to the end happy.In short zombies do exist - this film is proof of that, it should have died before it got to release but somehow it made it back from the dead. Now all I need to do is vaccinate myself against this monstrosity by watching an equally bad film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Marketable Movie Ever Made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z is a zombie outbreak movie that supposedly bases itself on the amazing book of the same name by Max Brooks. What this movie truly is, is a shamefully mediocre attempt to create a movie that appeals to the widest audience possible. Pee established fan base from the book? Check. Star power (this is Brad Pitt)? Check. Focuses on intensity rather than horror and gore to not alienate non zombie fans? Check. Safe, young PG 13 rating? Check. All the makings are here because this is what the big Hollywood studio wanted. Despite the fact this movie doesn't resemble the book at all, it appears that those attached to make this movie tried to make a decent movie such as the visually interesting director Marc Foster who wanted to make a movie with a message which would emulate the tone the book was going for. However, the big studio disliked this and demanded rewrites and re-shooting that damaged the relationship between the director and Brad and results in a quick, intense action movie that lacks the character development and messages it needed to be a truly memorable movie because almost every one of those scenes were cut so much to the point that central characters get barley any lines. While the action scenes are intense and enjoyable on their own and Marc foster adds style to the lack of substance but its just not enough to save this movie. While it is better than it had any right to be thanks to Marc, it needs more and it lacks in crucial substance. However from the reviews and box office reports it appears Hollwood has succeeded in creating a successful marketable movie that everyone will eat up and it will be too late when we all get the nasty aftertaste.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A zombie film that lacks bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems unfair to criticise the film for not being like its source material given that it obviously didn't try to be but I'm going to start by bringing that up anyway. The book had so many sequences that could have been turned into amazing set-pieces in a film and yet not one of them were used. The book also had some neat ideas about how a global outbreak and response play out. What might work? What would catastrophically fail? What would the cost be? Not one of these ideas were explored or even alluded to and there seems absolutely no reason why this was the case.It might have been okay to abandon these ideas if the film had some ideas of its own to explore or at least play out but it doesn't. Instead we follow Brad Pitt and Brad Pitt's baggage through a few set-pieces as he first escapes from and then looks into an outbreak of zombies. There's little else to say about it than that.The first major problem came down to the zombies themselves. For a zombie film to get that right is critical and World War Z stumbled pretty badly here. The physical appearance of the zombies is a clear problem. Given the film's penchant for shying away from blood and gore to keep its rating audience-friendly, the only things that separates these zombies from regular people are milky eyes, grey skin, and a tendency to bare and snap their teeth. They're not the bloodthirsty creatures at various stages of decay and ruin that feature in most zombie films. This is generally fine in close-ups but at a distance it's impossible to tell the zombies apart from regular people. And when most of your action scenes involve panicking people running away from what are allegedly zombies, having them pretty much indistinct from each other means you never get much of an inclination about the level of the threat or even what's going on.A possible solution would have been for the film to opt for the shambling moaning Romero-esque zombies of the book. Instead of running and tackling, having a slowly ever-advancing tide of danger would have turned the zombies into something to be feared rather than something to try and spot in a crowd.But even later when the film displays zombies in their 'docile' state its shown how little the film-makers understand how zombies are supposed to work. The jerking around and screeches were meant to be threatening and they are anything but. They are borderline slapstick and certainly comical judging by the outbreaks of laughter in the audience at my screening. They clicked their teeth together as if they enjoyed the sound. They repeatedly hit their heads against the wall in a way that was meant to seem deranged but just came across as silly. They spun and jerked around leading to a hilarious sequence of Pitt and two others essentially playing "Red Light/Green Light" with a snarling zombie. Nothing about these zombies seemed to work as intended.The second major problem came down to the complete lack of weight or tension. Brad Pitt isn't the type of actor anyone expects to be in danger, at least not when he's in an action film, so already there's the knowledge that he's fairly safe. But added to that, his character is a practically invulnerable bad-ass UN investigator whose field knowledge and ingenuity makes him able to adapt to any situation. His 'baggage', as I referred to them earlier, is played at first by his wife and two daughters as well as an orphan boy - far too cute to ever come into real harm in a film like this. The baggage is then played by a doctor and a team of soldiers who are so bereft of personality and character that there is no reason to care about them. He then teams up with a young Israeli soldier who is the closest person aside from Pitt to qualify to be called a character but unfortunately she doesn't seem to serve any purpose. His final baggage comes in the form of a team of WHO doctors. I won't say anything about them aside from pointing out that all four are named in the credits as "W.H.O. Doctor" despite being a key part of around a quarter of the film. Though I wouldn't recommend the film, to its credit it managed to attain a level of being entertaining and it never embarrassed itself, (despite a squeamish bit of product placement.) It was clearly let down by a few core problems and while certainly not a good film I'd feel a bit mean if I were to label it 'bad'. I'm disappointed that it painted itself as a zombie film for zombie fans while clearly being a toothless blockbuster to appeal to a broader audience, (however understandable that move may be from a film studio's perspective given the production problems and cost blow-out.) For this reason maybe the film tripped up and fell flat on its face but as it dragged itself to the finish line I'm willing to applaud it for that at least. I suppose all I can do it sit here and try to imagine what might have been...</fullReview>

Brad Pitt's arrogance and feeling of self-worth will suffocate you as you watch this steaming pile of cr*p. I don't even care that it doesn't resemble the book, it was a terrible movie no matter how you slice it. Apparently Brad's artistic addition to the movie was that when humans become ill the zombies won't attack them...yet one of the guys who help Sir. Brad super-UN inspector Pitt only has an injured knee, not an illness. Brad Pitt is the only actor in this movie that has any real screen time, it might as well be called "Brad Pitt saves the world (in the most uninteresting 2 hours ever). This movie is bad and anyone involved in writing/directing/producing it should feel bad.I hate you Brad Pitt, with every bone in my body. Since you "made this film for your kids" by giving it a PG-13 rating I hope one day they grow up, read the book, and despise what you created.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start with the good. Brad Pitt +1 star, zombies +1 star, decent special effects +1, and a reluctant +1 star for the story.My first big issue with this film is the lack of a War. I mean come on, World War Z, I expected a war of epic proportion. Instead I got total zombie domination while "living" people retreated to whatever safety could be found. The "War" scenes were nothing but regurgitated zombie attacks while people flee screaming for their lives. The next big issue is the narrow scope of people capable of countering the threat. We have a UN something something that has the authority to command helicopters and navy vessels and apparently can convince anyone in the world that Gerry (Brad Pitt) is a good guy that shouldn't be delayed in his efforts by simply stating his name into a satellite phone. This person later lacks the power to keep Gerry's family safe on the boat, and demonstrates utter humility considering his rank when offers bed service to Gerry's family.As the story develops the audience becomes aware that Gerry is some kind of super duper ex military dude that is apparently the best in the world at all things. We're all hosed if Gerry doesn't deliver. He hooks up with another Rambo type girl in Israel I think. Point being all these elite military characters fail miserably at avoiding the one thing that attracts every zombie withing 100 miles, making NOISE!! They literally bump, kick, fall, shoot, yell at every opportunity given, attracting hoards of zombies in the process. I suppose this was necessary mechanic to zombie conflict, but it certainly didn't compliment their supposed elite skills.The story is weak, and the solution and family reunion are visible long before they should be, which only strengthens the disappointment in the movie. Where's my refund?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the book. I watched this with an open mind that it may be "altered" to be more entertaining as a movie.Still thought it was way too far off from the book to even have the name "World War Z". If they were going to change this much, there was no need to use WWZ. To people who don't know the book, they won't care. To those who do, they will be insulted by the movie. Isn't the whole point of adapting a book to a movie, based on the fact that the book was a success? Thus implying that a good portion of your target audience are the book readers. So why intentionally slap the readers in the face? It makes no sense when you watch this movie, since it probably resembles 20% or less of the book's story, concept and characters.Even with the book differences, I could have lived with this movie being a solid zombie movie if the movie was actually about zombies. The "infected" may be fast and united, but the movie is pg-13 and that is just baffling. How can you possibly expect to make a movie like this and limit yourself with a pg-13 in an attempt to sell more tickets to kids? That's pretty much trading quality for quantity...or "selling out".It was hard enough to watch this and hardly see any resemblance of the source material that was amazing, but then you are also limited to pg-13 action and violence for a movie of this nature. There was almost no blood, diluted violence, bad CGI and annoying "cut-away" action scenes. Very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitt, not just a Valium for humans anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The zombie outbreak starts with Brad Pitt with his family in stopped traffic. There's a huge explosion with no explanation of why. Then, either a huge horde of humans are running from a small amount of zombies, or a huge horde of zombies are chasing a small amount of humans. You can't tell who is who, because all you see is a mob of people running in the same direction. Occasionally you see a zombie or two leap after a human, so you can tell they're not all human. But otherwise they could have been filming the bull runs in Spain (without the bulls).The zombies are part of what ruins the movie. They run faster than humans can, leap onto flying helicopters and can stack themselves 20 zombies high to climb walls. They can detect any terminal illness in any human, no matter the disease. No explanation is given how someone can go from ordinary human to super zombie in 12 seconds. Or why zombies just bite humans and then run away. If it takes 12 seconds to turn, then why don't they continue to attack for 12 seconds?Next, all the zombies are gone somehow and we see humans looting a store. The zombies are attracted to sound, but somehow they can't hear people pushing shopping carts on pavement. After some shopping, Brad takes his family to an apartment building which seems to be void of zombies. He convinces a family to let him and his family into their apartment. After a beer, Brad tells the father that him &amp; his family should go with him. However, the father decides to stay. Bad decision. When Brad Pitt tells you to do something, you do it. Within seconds of Brad leaving, all of a sudden there's a hundred zombies outside the door breaking in.Brad's on his way to the roof for a helicopter rescue while being chased by zombies. All of a sudden the little boy from the family shows up. No explanation of how he got by all the zombies, nor an explanation of why the zombies stopped coming to allow Brad to save the boy. All we know is when Brad Pitt is around, zombies either stop coming, or become very calm. Almost like they just took a Valium.Next they're off to South Korea. Nothing happens except Brad learns he needs to go to Israel, and the North Koreans are fine because they extracted the teeth of their entire country. (Can't infect without teeth) How that stops the 4 billion people already infected with teeth is never explained. Brad gets to Israel to witness they built a wall around the country and survived the zombie apocalypse. Not for long. They're letting in people from everywhere. All you see is humans entering the country through metal walkways. Who knows where the walkways lead to or why the zombies can't get into them. Or can they? There's a scene later in the movie where a zombie picks up a human in the supposedly safe walkway, and infects him. If that's all it took to infect the walkway, then why weren't they infected a long time ago?Why didn't Israel get infected? Because they built a huge wall. Why did every continent get infected at nearly the same time? Because as explained in the movie, it was the airplanes. Big cities were affected first and worst because of the international airports. Did Israel have airports? Absolutely. They had a line of planes leaving every minute. Did zombies infect the planes? They certainly infected the plane Brad Pitt left Israel on. So why didn't Israel get infected by one of the planes entering the country? Never explained.The reason why the zombies took over the country is dumb. After they let in refugees, the refugees start singing and that noise attracts the zombies. Forget the fact that they have helicopters constantly orbiting the wall, or the never ending line of planes taking off from their airports. It's the children singing that triggers the zombies to scale the wall and conquer the country. In South Korea, army soldiers gave advice to aim at the knees to slow them down, and then the heads to kill. So obviously we're not dealing with invincible zombies. So how do they manage to stack themselves 20+ zombies high, and then drop all the way to the ground uninjured? No broken bones. But if you shoot their knees they drop like flies.Then there's the amputation scene. Israel is being overrun by zombies so badly, the girl running behind Brad gets bit. They kill the biting zombie, and then conveniently, zombies stop coming so Brad can amputate the hand of the girl, and bandage her up. I told you Brad Pitt has a calming effect on zombies!!About the "terminal illness" theory. How did they not discover that the entire cancer wing of a hospital would be unaffected by the zombie virus. Or were the zombies simply avoiding Brad Pitt? I wish Brad Pitt infected himself with a virus that made him invisible to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, Exciting and Surprisingly Bloodless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"World War Z", despite involving zombies, plays more to the likes of a disaster film instead of a zombie film. It's more of like "2012" than "Resident Evil". We see shots of cities tumbling down to the rule of zombies and the world slowly turns into a zombie wasteland. The zombie attacks are large-scale, grand, and extremely exciting, save for the climax which ends up as a small-scale sequence, but is equally satisfying. The hero is Gerry Lane, a retired United Nations investigator who is recruited by what is left of the U.S. government to assist a young virologist Dr. Fassbach in investigating the virus. He reluctantly accepts this task in exchange for his family to be able to shelter in a U.S. Navy vessel. After Fassbach dies (in a hilarious way) he is determined to stop this outbreak. During their visit to Camp Humphreys in South Korea (where the word "zombie" was first used in reference to the outbreak) they learn that the zombies are attracted to sound. They also learn that Israel has established itself as a safe zone after it quarantined itself within a wall. Unaffected civilians, regardless of nationality, are allowed to enter. But due to the civilians singing loudly through a microphone, the zombies pile themselves up and manage to overcome the wall, and chaos ensues. This the largest action sequence in the entire movie. The scale is so massive and this scene is extremely exciting. Millions of uninfected humans being chased around by millions of zombies. The chaos is just indescribable. Add in the fact that the zombies are mindless and uncivilized and the chaos just multiplies itself. But this scene isn't the only one. There's another one earlier back in Philadelphia where Gerry witnesses the zombies firsthand for the very first time. All the action sequences are highly entertaining, massive, but surprisingly bloodless (which is peculiar for a film with zombies). They're massive, except the climax, where it's noticeably smaller set in a WHO facility, but the tension is equally high, and allows more shocks. Brad Pitt portrays the lead character, Gerry Lane. His character is devoid of personality here as most of the time, he's just involved in action. But Mr. Pitt delivers a performance that is quite pleasing. The rest of the cast gave good performances too and the acting shouldn't burden the whole movie experience. The script isn't that bad too. It diverges significantly from the original book and it is a bit uneven, but the lines make sense. It also works because it contains a real plot for the script to follow through. It has a sensible plot and the script acknowledges this. It's also worth noting that it has several humorous scenes too.It's far from perfect, it's heavy on action sequences, and it's uneven, but "World War Z" is an extremely fun ride for everyone to enjoy. I would also say that it's rather family-friendly as there are child characters that appear quite prominently. Another reason it's rather family-friendly is that it's bloodless. It has a real sensible plot (unlike most mindless movies containing zombies) and if you ignore the tiny faults and plot holes, "World War Z" will take you away on one of the most fun rides. Rating: 7/10Final Verdict: "World War Z" is uneven and far from perfect, but it's a fun and exhilarating ride that is more of a disaster film instead of the typical zombie film, and rather family- friendly.</fullReview>

The film definitely contains most of the elements fans have always desired in a zombie movie; it actually mixes horror, suspense, and action all in one movie. One act transpires underneath the roofs of a daunting apartment building when another act takes the audience across the world to Israel where the people left are forced to defend themselves against a monstrously colossal horde of zombies as they pile in. There are jump-scares. There are grisly and highly unfortunate deaths. Anyways, the film focuses on Brad Pitt's character (Gerry Lane) who's required to assist the UN with discovering a possible vaccine/cure to the horrifying virus that's spreading throughout the world and turning human beings into ghastly creatures. If he refuses to comply, they'll willingly kick his entire family off a tanker- one of the few safe locations left in the world. From there on, Gerry Lane is forced to transcend country after country in order to secure his family's safety and possibly save humanity. A hell of a lot is at stake, that's for sure. Now, I can definitely state that one of the best aspects of the film is its acting, especially Brad Pitt's, which, as usual, doesn't disappoint. One can clearly witness the fear and terror present in almost every character's eyes, as well as one specific character quite convincingly pulling off the feeling of sheer pain under horrendous circumstances. With that being said, the very beginning of the film starts off a little bizarrely as the pace seems to suffer. With the running time that the movie possesses, such a rich and complex story is compacted to fit its duration, which means right off the bat, we're met with the apocalypse and the zombie outbreak. We only receive a few minutes, if that, of the main family's daily lives until they're cast into the conflict almost instantly. As a result, conversations feel extremely and oddly brief and segments that could've been expanded on feel like they're set on "fast forward" in order to get to the "point." This means that there's much less space for character development and characterization in general, and zombie movies (or we can say Horror movies as a whole) definitely need to spend some time on their characters so that the audience is able to connect with them and feel for them as they progress on their journey. When they feel fear, we have to feel fear for them as well. Unfortunately, as this is largely a Hollywood blockbuster and not something like 28 Weeks Later, the film has to reach the action-packed bits as soon as possible. And this is when the film will cause a fair amount of decisiveness- the audience who read the book will approach the film differently than the ones who've seen the trailers and are just simply interested in the plot that's promised. I've read up on reviews, and most of the negative reviews originate from the individuals who expected an honest- shall I say- adaptation of the book (this is exactly the issue that faced The Great Gatsby or any other adaptation for that matter). I haven't read the book, which means I don't need to furiously rant about the film's disconnection from its novelistic counterpart. If you haven't read the book, you have no reason to worry about potential disappointment; that's practically reserved for the book's fans. If you're a book fan, on the other hand, you should be expecting the two's differentiation from one another. So, to put it most understandably, if you're entering this movie the way it was marketed, you'll experience a wild, roller-coaster ride that's fairly effective in its capability of featuring some dramatic moments of diplomatic negotiations and political discussions over the world's collapse and then placing you into intensely impossible situations only to be followed by an incredibly suspenseful, nerve-wracking sequence. It's highly entertaining?however, it's the furthest from originality a film can get. I mean, it's yet another zombie movie, dealing with the entire world under a deadly zombie virus. You've basically seen everything in this movie already as 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later highlighted the serious effects of such an event already. In that case- during its first act- World War Z feels unbelievably similar to the two films mentioned above. Especially considering the decision to exclude the more political aspect of the novel and turning the adaptation into an action flick instead, there's not much here that'll bask in uniqueness, really. This all begs the question: how much longer will these numerous entertainment industries create zombie stories after zombie stories? It's time to move on to another fascinating idea. Leave the genre alone, but then again, as long as these studios continue to rake in millions, they'll continually produce the same product. In the end, World War Z is a fun, entertaining night out, but if you can't make it to the showing, don't feel too bad because you've most likely seen everything displayed in this film already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't waste your money. Go see Romero or Snyder instead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead.This is a very bad film, not just a bad zombie film. Being a big fan of zombie flicks, I expected some good entertainment. What was delivered, instead, was an uninteresting storyline, hollow characters and lukewarm suspense.I have read the book by Max Brooks, which was full of suspense, intelligent individual stories, and above all a great depiction of many nations and their virtues and faults. The book was supposed to be an excellent start for an even better movie. Even the characters that appear in single chapters are fleshed out and very credible. Unfortunately, this can't be said even for the main role played by Brad Pitt. Is this the guy who starred in Fight Club? Yes, but give him a bad script and a bad director and this is what you'll get.The depiction of the zombie virus outbreak leaves much to be desired. If you want to see a really good one, check out Snyder's remake of Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead'. Excellent suspense, action, drama and fright during the first 10-15 minutes.What makes WWZ even worse is bad cinematography. Some scenes are there as if just to explain to the uninitiated viewer what's going on, in a kindergarten guide sort of way.What's the point of Daniella Kertesz's character? She is just following Gerry around without one hand. Mireille Enos is also there just as an excuse for a shabby plot - ah, the drama, her husband has to leave, is not heard from, and then they are reunited.In the end, the vaccine solution is completely different from what Brooks made of it in his book: a scam from big pharma that just makes things worse.Zombies jump around as if they were supposed to be frightening. If you want good fast zombies, go see '28 Days Later' or Snyder's 'Dawn of the Dead'. There isn't even any gore here, which you expect in a zombie flick. I suppose the filmmakers avoided it just to be able to have the PG-13 rating and thus make more money.I gave it 3/10 stars just because of special effects which are top notch. All in all, this is a big waste of time and unfortunately just another Hollywood blockbuster that is completely devoid of any meaning and not entertaining at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Big Budget with No Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z (2013) ** (out of 4) Brad Pitt plays a U.N. worker who must leave his family behind and go search for a cause or cure for a zombie outbreak that is pretty much destroying every form of life. On his mission he must travel across the globe trying to see what might work in the human's defense of the zombies. I'll admit upfront that I haven't read the book that this film is based on so I can't comment on if it butchered the book or if the film got it right. That aspect of the conversation just doesn't bother me but what does bother me is that we've got an insanely high budget and yet they couldn't work out some sort of interesting story. For the most part we just see Brad Pitt going from one beautiful location to the next and we see that the once beautiful place is now full of zombies. Every once in a while Mr. Pitt has to walk through dark hallways and what really hurts the film is that these sequences just aren't scary. In fact, I'm going to say it right out loud that there wasn't a single scary moment to be found in this picture and the entire "disaster" aspect of what was going on just didn't work for me. Never did I feel that the world was really coming to an end and this is a big-budget that can't pull this off yet look at what someone like Romero did in no money. Another problem is that the zombies are all rather bland whether they're real effects or the majority of them CGI. They're not scary, no creative and the lack of gore shouldn't be bashed because you don't need gore to be scary but at the same time when you have the violence off-screen it just makes the film seem rather childish. Pitt offers a nice performance but this is certainly far from his best. It was nice seeing David Morse and the rest of the supporting players are good as well. I don't know what was wrong with the final third of the movie where they had to go back and film a new one but what we got here just doesn't work as its too slow and boring. WORLD WAR Z, sadly, is delivered as a very disappointing movie no matter if you're familiar with the original source or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie last night I decided I had to write a review to help any fans of the book from being disappointed. First of all, I might have enjoyed this movie if they had changed the name from World War Z to The Disease or Biters or Brad Pitt Vs. Dead People. WWZ implies that it was based on the book by Max Brooks. I'm quite convinced that the writer didn't even bother to read the book.SPOILERS: The book was set on the basis that the WWZ had already happened and humanity was beginning to rebuild and overcome the virus worldwide. The "author" was responsible for going around the world interviewing a lot of people about how the war began and progressed, in order to create an "oral history" of the tragedy.The film went backwards, with characters having one lead and continuing back to find the origin. The book started in chronological order with a third-world doctor discussing the first outbreak in his village, then progressed based on the individual stories told from the perspectives of people who survived. Everything that made the book great was completely ignored and the production company decided on spending a high budget on major CGI scenes and generic zombie effects, as well as hiring Brad Pitt to attract an audience. And on top of all that, the lack of zombie gore, there was little to none, giving me the impression of a very low-budget zombie movie.In conclusion, if you have never read the book, enjoy looking at Brad Pitt, and are impressed with CGI action then this movie may be for you. However, if you are a fan of zombies at all then avoid this movie like you would a real zed. I almost want to compare it to WARM BODIES, but I couldn't bring myself to see that one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good large set-pieces but not so good at producing consistent tension and fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm generally not a fan of zombie movies, not because I don't like them but rather because they seem to easily have an effect on me, chilling me to the bone and staying with me for days (no walking into dark rooms for me). As a result I put off watching World War Z but I was still interested in seeing such a big budget zombie film. The plot sees some form of outbreak and, well, you know what happens. No sooner has Gerry Lane rescued his family from one city, than he is rescued by his old UN employers who want him to help lead a mission to try and find a solution by escorting a doctor to South Korea. No pressure, but the space for his family in safe haven does rely on him saying "yes".After some very brief character establishment (references to "old job", happy family image etc), we get the first of many set-pieces as an outbreak sweeps across the city and, like many of the set-pieces, it is pretty good stuff. There is plenty of money on the table, lots going on and the scale of it all is suitable for a plot about a global outbreak. The problem is that it never really feels like more than this and the bits in between are not great. The biggest criticism that I can offer is that it did nothing to be other than make me watch the noisy scenes in the way I would with any big blockbuster ? and I remind you that I am normally chilled by zombie movies. Here I felt that apart from once or twice, it didn't really do the tension or the horror well, it almost felt too slick, too expensive.To give a contrast, an outbreak in a closed car park in 28 Weeks Later was really horrific to me (in a good way) but here the one on a plane didn't bring that same feeling. It is hard for me to put my finger on it, but for sure something was missing here. The plot doesn't help ? jumping around the world without much linkage and asking the viewer to just go with it; perhaps I would if I had cared more, but everyone apart from Brad Pitt seemed so disposable ? just fodder for the attack shots, so I did get numb and also feel remote from it all. Technically it is great and it really is well shot and put together, but it is just the lack of atmosphere that hurts it the most.It is a big expensive movie though and as a blockbuster it works well enough to give it a go, but it really never works in the ways that would have made it a much superior film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z is mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z isn't a great zombie flick, nor is it a bad one. It has a lot of suspension in the beginning, and action throughout, but I was left wanting more.World War Z starts off with showing a bunch of different people in different countries doing different things while the opening credits are rolling. After all of this is finished, the title World War Z pops onto the screen in immense letters and everyone in the theatre are unsettled in their seats waiting to see some good ol' zombie action.After all of the credits are done, we see two kids running to their parents bed and then jumping onto them to wake them up, (I'm sure we all done this when we were little back then.) The Lane family (Brad Pitt, Mireille Enos, Sterling Jerins, and Abigail Hargrove,) all lay on the bed giggling and laughing and just thinking that the world couldn't be any better. Fast forward the whole breakfast scene and then were onto the busy streets of New York. This is where stuff starts to get out of hand. A police officer zooms by on his bike and hits the Lane's family's car mirror. Pitt then gets out and starts seeing how everyone on the street's unsettled and he begins to wonder what the hell's going on. A brimming explosion then happens about a kilometre down the busy road, so he then gets back into the car and another police officer comes by on his bike, but this time he stops to talk to Pitt, what a regretful choice for the officer that would've been. 2 seconds later, the office gets hit by a random dumpster truck, and then that's when sh!t starts to go down.World War Z has a promising start to it, it had suspension, good action, good direction, it just had a lot of good qualities to it. I loved the whole scene when they were in the apartment with the other family, and then they try to escape to get onto the helicopter, that whole scene had really great tension to it. Unfortunately, after they escape from New Jersey, that's when the whole movie starts to go downhill, and that's when unintentional laughter starts happening as well.It started to go downhill after they got out of New York because that's when stupid scenes started happening (piling luggage against a curtain, a girl seeming to be pretty fine a few seconds after her hand is cut off, and plenty more.) The unintentional laughs mostly came from when they were in the World Heath Organization research facility. I won't even need to explain myself on this one since you'll know what I'm talking about if you go and watch it with a big group of people.The acting in this film is average, Brad Pitt turns in a solid performance, but everyone else is average to slightly above average in it.Marc Foster starts this movie off with great direction, but like I said, after they get out of New Jersey, that's when the direction begins to get more sloppy.The 3D in this film was unneeded, and I'm sure they only did it in 3D to get more of a profit out of it. If it was my decision, I would've chosen not to see it in 3D since I usually don't like the 3D aspect in movies, but I live in a smaller city, and the only showing that was left was in 3D, so I had to see it. There are only a few scenes where things fly out at you, one of them being the air plane scene, but other then those few scenes, it was very unused.I never read the World War Z book by Max Brooks, so I wouldn't have any clue if the movie followed the book in any way, but of all the reviews I have read for this movie, most of them say it doesn't follow the book at all. If you go into this film believing that it'll follow the books origins, you'll probably be a bit disappointed.Overall, World War Z is a passable zombie flick. It starts off great, but ends disappointingly. There wasn't much heart in this film. I didn't believe that Pitt really loved his wife, but I'm sure 80% of people that go to this movie won't care about it since they just want some mindless action. There are still some good action scenes throughout the middle of the movie, but it just started to become more sloppy as the film went on. It isn't on the level of both of the Dawn of the Dead's, the 28 franchise, or Shaun of the Dead, but it's still definitely better then a lot of zombie flicks out there today.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good-looking movie that entertains, but mostly just yet another Zombie movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies about Zombies is not my favorite genre. In fact I would normally not see them because to me they are just overly silly. The whole concept of "the undead", people getting bitten and literally in 10 seconds or so changing into a Zombie. Stuff for cartoons but not for a serious dramatic movie.The one exception is "Warm Bodies" which I saw during this past summer, a story about Zombies wanting to become normal people again, I really like that one. Anyway, to this one, "World War Z". It seems some type of mysterious virus has broken out somewhere, they believe Korea, and via our connected world has spread quickly through air travel. And these Zombies that result are not the clumsy, plodding Zombie usually portrayed. No, these seem to move a bit faster than usual, act as if they were a rabid animal, and snap their jaws as if they were trying to eat someone as quickly as they could. It is not a good situation, and the whole world is threatened. Brad Pitt is Gerry Lane, retired UN specialist who only wants to be with him family, his wife and two daughters. But when their own city, Philadelphia, becomes overrun they have to escape towards New York and end up taking refuge on a military ship. But against his wishes Gerry is virtually forced to help them track down and try to eradicate the Zombie disease, otherwise they could not give his family refuge.So that's really what the story is about, Gerry traveling first to Korea, then to Israel, then to a W.H.O. installation in Wales, barely surviving a plane crash. He has to save the world, otherwise no one will.I like Brad Pitt, and he is good here in what to me, is a pretty silly movie. I found myself laughing occasionally, not because killing people is funny, but just the absurdity of the Zombies and their zeal to overrun everything. Just light entertainment and nothing more. It tries to strike a meaningful note at the end, but it just didn't work for me.SPOILERS: Gerry does save the world, at least it is moving in that direction as the movie ends. At one point he had noticed that mysteriously the pursuing Zombies simply avoided certain humans, just bypassed them. He theorized that those were sick humans, and Zombies somehow could detect that, and only wanted healthy human bodies to spread their Zombieism. So he further theorized, if he were to inject himself with a disease-causing virus, the Zombies would avoid him. It worked, and the solution for the world would be mass inoculations with disease, that could then be treated to save the person, but also allow them to gradually eradicate the Zombies. Interesting concept!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the totality of life on earth as we know it is threatened by a horrible contagion that turns people into crazed, rabid killers in under 30 seconds, Brad Pitt's character gets no more freaked out than if he were dealing with a paper jam in a photo copier.The writing, pacing and acting in this film are on the level of an 8th grade kids spinning wild fantasy. This happens! then this happens! then this! then the zombies come! then the helicopter saves them at the last second!Zombies on the planes! blow a hole in it so they all get sucked out but Brad and his girlfriend.Plane crash! everyone dies but brad and his Israeli girlfriend, who's up walking around without a scratch.Never mind the flight crew, Pitt walks a few miles though he's run through with a piece of metal.Wakes up 3 days later in his street clothes, still pretty clean, all patched up &amp; ready for more action.And on it goes. This film is an insult to the viewer.</fullReview>

No character development, no suspense, implausible action sequences, no horror, not a single drop of blood, lot of useless scenes with the best scenes already spoiled in the trailer and the worst is a complete out of sync 30min ending sequence. From minute 76 on you believe you are in a different B zombie movie that a high school kid could produce for $10,000. It's just crazy bad and the person responsible for this remake should be shoot himself because he ruined whatever was left of this movie at this time. Hope that there will be a directors cut to see what the original ending looked like.And they really talking abut a follow-up to this?</fullReview>

Somehow it takes pitstain's character countless days and three continents to figure out that the zombies don't attack the terminally ill, something that could have been figured out in an hour at any local hospital. Premise fail and the purdy graffics and lack of character dimension don't make up for the rest.Do yourself a favor and read the book. You'll be hooked in less than the two hours of this piece of trash wasted.</fullReview>

I think that says something about itAnyways on to the film, the plot so incredibly flimsy it makes houses of cards look like architectural wonders and Brad Pitt's character (Gerry, I think it was?) is one of the worst movie hero's I've ever seen. His character had such little depth to him and he does so many things perfectly that's it's just downright bizarre. And that's your problem, he's not human, he's a cardboard cutout of a humanThe film is also riddled with clichés, from the "you couldn't possibly understand" line to the typical happy family with two kids at the beginning. There's nothing new here, nothing at all. That's another reason not to see this movie.So in case you didn't figure out my opinion on this, it's terrible. Do not see. Worst movie of 2013 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Another Zombie Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure why I actually went and saw this movie since I am not really a big fan of zombie movies, with the exception of 28 Days Later of course. I guess it was because Brad Pitt played the lead role and I generally like anything that Brad Pitt is in, and though he does his usually good job as an actor in this film, in the end this film is nothing more than a zombie movie. It is based on a book (which might actually be an interesting read since in the book the zombies are more in the background, much like 28 Days Later) but we all know what people generally think about movies based on books, and that is that the book is generally always better.I could tell you a bit more about this film, but it is pretty obvious what it is about ? the zombie apocalypse. Basically a disease that kills humans and turns them into zombies breaks out and brings the world to the brink of ruin, and Brad Pitt, a ex-United Nations investigator, is called back to work to try to find out what is going on. Basically the film focuses mostly on his investigation into this pandemic and the results of his investigation. Like 28 Days Later, the movie does not end with the destruction of all of the zombies, but rather it is more like the beginning of the end of the catastrophe. In a way the world has already been destroyed, but humanity has (as usual) found a way of bringing an end to the catastrophe and pulling themselves out of the ashes.This is a common theme that we seem to see through these numerous styles of movies, and that is how we, humanity, are able to survive against ridiculous odds. Bring on the apocalypse and somehow we humans will be able to survive and actually once again thrive against this monumentous threat that we face. To me I think it, in many cases, is wishful thinking, and I'm not even a fundamentalist Christian. What ever I think of the end times or the apocalypse, I feel that the idea that humanity can survive on its own without any extra-ordinary power is not only wishful thinking, but another ploy of a small group of radical humanists who want to give us a reason to throw away our simple faith.The problem with this argument is though is because we are still here and we have managed to survive. If this idea was wrong then I would not be sitting here writing this, however have we ever face such a threat that had the potential of wiping us all out? I would potentially say no. Okay, there may have been the Black Plague, but not everybody was affected. There may have been World War II, or even the Cold War, but we managed to restrain ourselves. It is not a question of us hanging on by the skin of our teeth, but rather than we are smart enough not to push us to the brink of destruction, or beyond. As for pandemics, there are always going to be those of us who are naturally resistant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War Z is a movie that has great potential but goes absolutely nowhere. The most glaring issue, this is a zombie movie without zombie action.What do people expect to see in zombie movies? Zombies attacking and munching on people. Instead, WWZ gives the audience zombies running around at Mach speed and cut scenes at what should be interesting points.Pitt's character is wooden and unsympathetic. Even as an anti-hero, I didn't buy into the character. It's clear that Pitt and his wife/family are very close but does the audience need to be constantly remind of this? The story makes very little sense with Pitt traveling across the globe in search of answers. What makes matters worse, very little of the data gathered has an effect on the final outcome of the film.The South Korea airbase scene in particular adds no value to the story. Everyone is aware that they need to be extremely quiet to sneak onto a plane to leave. Pitt however, leave his phone on and receives a call from his wife at the worse possible moment and people become dead as a result. Pitt's character is supposed to be the best at what he does but yet fails to observe safety protocols? This makes no sense.The hoards of CGI created living dead are unconvincing and in some scenes, resemble the ones in "I am Legend." Not much in way of technological improvements over a film released in 2007 if you ask me.Camera work is terrible with shots bouncing up and down, side to side. Another film ruined with "shaky cam" filming .In a way, this movie parallels the 2011 film "Contagion." In fact, you can replace the Pitt investigative scenes with the ones from "Contagion" and have a more cohesive story.There is very little blood shown on screen. Given its PG-13 rating, violence of course needed to be toned down but not to the point of avoidance. Fans of the zombie genre may find this film a bit lacking but I think the producers of WWZ wanted to sanitize it to appeal to a wider audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's much to be impressed by in this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seemed to be on the cards that this movie was not going to attempt to recreate Max Brooks' novel, so I'm surprised by how many people still seemed to expect a faithful rendition of that book. I was more interested in seeing if the movie-makers had found anything new to do with the undead; surely by now even the most ardent of zombie fans are sick of the slow, shambling corpses who lose pounds by the moment as whole chunks of them fall rotting to the ground.The only real, significant innovation in the Zombie genre of late came, of course, from the UK, in the shape of "28 days later", with its depiction of the undead as vicious, hyperactive lunatics. World War Z's zombies have been wisely depicted in this manner, but this doesn't give the movie any points for originality.However, the concept of how these creatures are seen to run amok is arrestingly unprecedented: In this movie, the endless hoards of the dead are so numerous and so wired that they form mountains as they scramble over each other, and then said mountains suddenly seem to become tidal waves that crash down onto towns. I found these scenes to be quite mind-blowing - especially those set in Jersualem, whose security measures prove to be disastrously inadequate.Finally, I'd urge you not to pay much attention to those who are panning the performances, dialogue and plot as being feeble and lazy. They aren't. I think all of that is a case of sour grapes from those who feel betrayed by the fact that the movie wanders so far away from the philosophy of the source material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying I haven't read the book yet, so I have no idea how they compare. However, this was a pretty good movie overall. Many zombie movies are merely mindless gore and violence disguised within some fragile thing that doesn't even deserve to be called a plot. However, World War Z has a much better plot than most other zombie movies. One thing I noticed right away is that this movie actually made me jump in surprise several times. It's very suspenseful, and truly worthy of being called a "zombie horror movie," as opposed to the plethora of predictable, unsuspenseful zombie movies that have come out of Hollywood. Brad Pitt does a great job in his role, although I felt his character lacked definition in many ways. It would be nice if they had "fleshed out" the characters a bit more. Overall, this movie is definitely worth the watch if you have a couple hours to spare. Not the best movie ever made, but a pretty good one.</fullReview>

But I knew that going in.So I say disappointing because the story was just dull and rather silly. Not much happened during the whole movie, nothing much developed story-wise or character-wise, the zombies were not very zombie like, and the cleverness of the original material was completely missing in action.I'm sure they could make a good movie on a tenth the budget, instead of a not so good action blockbuster for hundreds of millions.</fullReview>

They always paint Jews/Israel in a good light, usually paint Muslims in a negative light, and never ever tell you the truth about Judaism and it's origins, nor the truth about Israel and it's origins. Ever seen a movie about how Israeli soldiers treat Palestinians? Ever seen a movie about how Israel kills women and children in Gaza, targeting schools and hospitals? And how about Israeli's targeting Palestinian kids playing soccer on a beach, blowing em up, then re-targeting again to kill the kids that scatter? (just happened a few months ago...) Ever seen a movie about how Israel has been, in essence, committing genocide against the Palestinian people for many decades now? Nope, nope, nope, and nope. And you will never see it, coming out of Hollywood anyhow... What you will see however is crap like this. Appeal to the masses PG-13 versions of whatever is the latest thing that the money men feel will fill their pockets even more. I was rolling on the floor laughing when Pitt ends up in Israel. And of course they let people in, even Muslims, when the zombies came... lol! I had tears in my eyes during that scene... from laughing my ass off. Anyhow, a bad zombie movie with a fair amount of pro-Israel propaganda. I have about 30 zombie movies on my bookcase, many of them are older classics, but a lot of newer stuff as well. This one will not be joining them as it does not have much in common with them. After one viewing it literally went into a garbage can. Oh well, I should have known...

Take Day of the Dead for example, one of the bloodiest, goriest movies I have ever seen. They show the gore in all its gory glory. In World War Z? Nah, no blood, cut away, don't shock the audience, don't show anything. In fact I don't think I saw one person die in this movie.I suppose if you want to take the kids to see a zombie movie, this would be the one to go to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just not a good zombie movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was about 30 minutes into World War Z when it became glaringly apparent that the filmmakers were going through great lengths to avoid including blood and violence. Honestly, historically speaking, gore has probably been more important to the zombie genre than story (which is incredibly weak in this movie, anyway). Pitt is terribly unconvincing as a stay-at-home dad that is secretly a badass (and apparently way smarter than the worldwide scientific community). If you genuinely like zombie movies, you will not like World War Z. If you like the book, you'll be disappointed by this movie. Apparently, Brad Pitt is going around saying he wanted this movie to be PG-13, so his kids could see it. That's absolutely untrue. This movie is PG-13, so they could make a profit. It had an incredibly high budget, and they needed it to be more accessible, as to recoup that money. Make no mistake, this is a Brad Pitt vanity project.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie after seeing the trailers, and then finding out its a sort of new twist on zombie stories. Upon finally watching it, it seemed almost lazy to me. They didn't do a good job of explaining how the characters come up with their theories and from what I could tell, they also didn't explain how this whole phenomena began. It just happened, apparently, and then ended (I guess?). I would have liked a more solid ending. In a way, the 'unknown' factor made it seem a little more real. If this zombie apocalypse were to take place that suddenly, I suppose there wouldn't be an easy fix. But I really did not like their solution nor do I understand how they came up with the idea of this solution. Overall, the action was entertaining and I liked the characters, but this isn't a movie that would stick in my mind as a thought-provoking tale at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really excited about seeing this movie, but left underwhelmed. I thought the acting was lackluster, the story very linear and predictable, with no interesting plot twists or great moments of revelation.This role didn't suit Brad Pitt - I'm too big a fan of his to say he was poor, but I found his character quite shallow and unengaging. I couldn't provide a detailed description of his character if I had to. Everything worked out for him conveniently throughout, and of course he is the one who saves the day - without too great an effort of problem solving either.Overall, the movie wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't great either. Wouldn't recommend for those who value a solid storyline over all else.Although it is a TV series, I consider AMC's The Walking Dead a far superior journey into what could come of a zombie apocalypse - with more engaging drama, character development and suspense. Yes, there is far more time for The Walking Dead to achieve this, but even in episode 1 of the series these superiorities are evident.</fullReview>

The sheer scale of it, Max Brook's globe trotting masterpiece, written in the best traditions of the genre, equal parts good old fashioned gore fest and social commentary of it's age.Then there were the set pieces, Yonkers, Hope, the great battles never before envisaged in a zombie movie, and I read with glee, this movie was going to have the budget to meet expectations.Then it was announced Brad was going to star, that was the first warning sign. Could such an A-List star take the back seat? The book had no central protagonist... OK maybe they would keep the overall theme but give Gerry Lane a role in a few of the chapters as well as the interviewer role. Then came rumours of delays, in fighting and walk outs.By the time the movie was released the press was so bad I could almost not bring myself to watch it. But I had too, I had to see it. So I went to the theater to find... NONE of it, he took nothing other than the name of the movie and a couple of the characters? Why? Why Brad? Why? Why did you buy up the rights to this, preventing others from using the source material to produce this generic focus-group scripted garbage? If you liked it so little that you changed everything about it, why buy the rights? Rumour had it that Di Caprio had been outbid on the rights.I don't know if our merry strolling friend Leo would have done a better job - but he couldn't have done worse.Also - that ending?

They build a 20m Wall and they don't watch for an attack or have security? 4. He and his new soldier friend survive a lane crash. The only one? 5. Somewhere in England there are 3 scientists without any weapon who survive all attacks. And the army cant kill some of them. 6. His family is safe on the ship because he's doing his job. His handy doesn't have 5 minutes battery and they kick his family of the ship.This film has many more such moments. How does this film get so good rankings?

There is no character development in this movie. You are literally thrown into the pit of fire without any warning. You don't even learn the main character's name until 1/2 way into the movie. You don't know how Pitt got his job, how Pitt's former supervisors know where he is at all times, you don't ever truly figure out what started it, and I never even figured out the daughter's names.Secondly, one does not simply survive a massive plane crash such as the one placed in this movie. He would be dead. End of story. I'd rather watch Season 3 of the Walking Dead 800 times over than watch this POS. I'm a Resident Evil (the game, not the movie), Silent Hill, and Walking Dead (comic and show), so I am a die-hard zombie fan. This movie did nothing for me with its poor execution.</fullReview>

Sadly we are in the beginning introduced to a very interesting character, but sadly he is killed off as the moment we start to like him. Many scenes drag on for way too long, and I found the movie more comical than scary. Me and many others in the cinema laughed of how silly and stupid the "zombies" acted. Also many of the scenes drag on way too long and you start to wonder what the director was thinking. The ending is one of the worst ending of any movie I have ever seen.

		<fullReview>Now I admit I've read the book so just from that you can probably get an idea of where I'm going with this. But I'd read enough reports beforehand to realise that aside from the name of the film and the soldiers calling zombies 'Zeke', everything else from Max Brook's work was pretty much discarded.That's frustrating to know given the source material, but as a fan of zombie movies in general I thought I'd at least give it a shot. That shot means there's two hours of my life I won't get back.It's badly paced, the zombies are more like the a poor version of the 'infected' from films like '28 Days Later' or 'I Am Legend' and rather than be an interesting story, it's comes across as an excuse to show off Brad Pitt's acting chops.Now I know Brad gets grief for his celebrity lifestyle and some really really terrible perfume ads, but generally I quite like him as an actor. This had the potential to be an ensemble story told from numerous perspectives. Failing that making the lead have any kind of personality may have helped. Instead it's Pitt going into a terrifying zombie encounter followed by a talky bit. Rinse and repeat.The fact these kinds of films (and I would very much throw it into the group of 'The Day After Tomorrow' and '2012') make money is quite tragic for the industry. They'll continue to make these films and people will continue to waste time watching them. CGI floppy zombies flying across the screen are not scary. You feel no empathy for any character, there's no real grandness to the scale of the zombie apocalypse, the score is filled with loud 'bangs' for the sake of making you jump but builds no atmosphere and no emotion. The score wouldn't have sounded out of place from a Van Damme film rather than a film budgeted at a reported $190m.To watch this as harmless entertainment it's frustrating, to watch it with any thought of World War Z the book or even audio book, is downright painful. I just can't figure out for the life of me what they spent the money on. It certainly wasn't the script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before my review, I state that Zombie-movies fans will not like this film.World War Z achieves success from the beginning at establishing the apocalyptic climate, and settling it's own plausibility (you believe the Zombie issue). Then you have a good Plot for making Gerry (Pitt's character) "the one" (he must protect a scientist at his trip looking for the origin of the virus). But soon the scientist gets out of the center of the scene and it becomes not very serious the fact that Gerry has to solve everything by himself (his body, his brain).From that moment, the movie has several nice scenes of zombie hordes attacking people (you feel like in a PS3 Zombies video game; by the way, I guess they are launching it soon). But the search for answers remains the central objective, which is a plus for the film.The PEPSI hired spot is too evident and is during the Climax sequence, which is annoying.The solution Gerry finds to contain the Zombie invasion is smart and interesting for the Plot. Extremely sharper than the silly climax resources used in "Signs", "Transformers", "Independence Day" and "War of the Worlds"). However the last 4 minutes after that are dull.To sum up: good colossal scenes; great main idea of the story; poor character development; no deep emotions involved (neither the audience nor the characters); the wife and mom is just a wife and mom, which remembers the Hollywood of the '40s; obvious expository dialogues; failed and contradictory political subtext; a fun story overall. And, last but not least, the 3D provides absolutely nothing to this movie, by the contrary, it's distracting. Hollywood should control his 3D fetish.The most interesting: The comment about the "Social Engineering" solution in North Korea; the "Tenth Man method" in Israel; most of the movie happens outside the USA; the black woman zombie at the Lab; the scene where two scientists look like zombies.</fullReview>

An intelligent story is sharp and it cuts you as cleanly as a scalpel while implanting itself into your brain leaving little evidence that it was there. At the opposite end of the spectrum World War Z employs the bludgeoning technique, utterly obliterating your skull into a bloody mush of hair and bits of bone. This is one of the only movies that I have ever considered leaving midway through. With each scene came a fresh onslaught of disregard to the human psyche and with it my uncontrollable urge to cringe in horror of how poorly written this film is. This is not a film in which you tell a fellow human to rush out and see in theater or even wait till it comes to video, unless that person is your mortal enemy.

It is an "anti-war, anti-global warming, anti-blah blah blah" movie and has been greatly changed from the original story in the book. It has become a vehicle for a few influential people to promote their political and ideological views.That aside the special effects and makeup are really cool and I enjoyed that portion of the movie. I thought the action kept moving through out the movie with out much of any "time-outs".I however was dismayed by the writing of the script which I found horrible, boring and filled with visual and plot flaws.I won't bother with detailing those flaws because it is pointless. I'm a nitpicker and there are very few movies which satisfy me.If you want mindless action with good special effects and no plot to get in your way, then this is your movie.If you dislike the Hollywood constantly make mistakes on a 180 million dollar budget movie, then stay away from this one because you will be greatly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If they had just acted out the book with sock puppets made by 5-year- olds and filmed it on a 6 year old camera phone, it would have at least had the redeeming quality of having a solid plot. Now, I have seen some terrible book to movie adaptations. In some cases it was because the scope of the book just couldn't translate to film. For most others, it was because the producers wanted to do their own thing and didn't care about honoring the story they were deriving their movie from. This is the second case, only a thousand times worse. The movie has so little to do with the book there is literally ZERO justification in using the same title or Paramount owning the rights. And then even besides that, the story they pulled out of their asses is terrible on its own! I could tell the movie was going to diverge from the book from the trailers, but I didn't expect it to be so offensively full of plot holes and unjustified character choices. All of the action, conflict, and tension was derived from idiotic mistakes on the parts of the humans rather than peril from the zombies. The resolution was not only ridiculous and silly conceptually, but also totally unnecessary. You know what is guaranteed to ruin an apocalypse movie? A RESOLUTION. Granted, even without that, there was really no saving this film. The action sequences are sudden and unjustified, the CGI looks like it's from a 2003 video game, and the "zombie" concept was trying so hard to be original that it ended up being a total joke. Seriously. They are basically dolphin/chipmunk zombies. It would have been laughable if it hadn't been so annoying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great modern-day zombie flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a regular horror movie, it has everything you want. There are some genuine, high-quality scare moments that will make you jump. The infected look creepy as hell, yet realistically believable. THIS COULD HAPPEN RIGHT NOW. THERE COULD BE A HUMAN-ZOMBIE TIDAL WAVE OF BODIES FLOWING DOWN THE STREET OUTSIDE YOUR JOB RIGHT NOW, WAITING TO ENGULF YOU AS SOON AS YOU TAKE YOUR FIRST STEP OUTSIDE. AND IT WOULD LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THIS. Visually, it is beautiful in its realism, and gives you an idea of how an outbreak like this would actually look in a huge city. Combine that with Brad Pitt bringing his A-game, and you've got yourself a good time.As a zombie movie, there are some things to notice. Typically, your zombie falls into 1 of 2 categories - slower and stupid (your Walking Dead - Resident Evil type), and fast and animal-like (Left 4 Dead, Zombieland, Dawn of the Dead). World War Z goes with type 2, clearly the worse of the two choices in terms of survival, but best in terms of an intense, action-horror movie.Now, this being a zombie movie at its core, there are a couple of clichés that even Brad Pitt can't avoid, like the mass looting of the surviving population, the fact that huge, technologically advanced cities and governments can't figure out how to keep a damn virus from wrecking everything, or the...ugh, going any further with this is a spoiler. Just know that there'll be one point where you'll say, "there's always THAT guy..." But still, these are very minor complaints in an otherwise beautifully done movie.Some people might take issue with the lack of blood or gore, but in all honesty, I was so deep into the story and suspense that I forgot this was PG-13.World War Z is a great modern day zombie flick, and a great movie all-around. The 3D is beautiful, but this movie is going to be beautiful either way, so that's really your preference. 9 out of 10 on the BDBOS. Go see it!!!

		<fullReview>A very disappointing film that I wanted to be good. It reminded me of the film Outbreak which starred Dustin Hoffman. In that film people were infected with an Ebola type virus in this one they were turned into zombies in about 12 seconds of being bitten - go figure. The film was dark and basically a glorified walking dead B Movie - yawn. Has Brad Pitt hit rock bottom? I thought that with a big Hollywood star and probably a huge budget the film would have originality and a great storyline. How wrong can you be. Worst of all the one place where they had managed to avoid the world wide plague was Jerusalem until, of course Brad arrives and then it all went pear shaped. The zombified people were more funny than frightening and I began to wonder if it was meant to be a comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War Z might not be the best movie ever made but it is certainly worth watching.I love the part in the beginning in Philadelphia. The chaos in that scene is amazing. I really like to rewatch that part.I also like the part in Korea. Where they have to be quiet to make sure they won't alert the 'zombies'. This is a very tense moment because you don't want them to alert the 'zombies'. And then when the cell-phone goes off you really feel bad for them and you hope they will make it back to the airplane in time.The part in Israel is also very good. First they think they are safe but then eventually the 'zombies' climb over the wall and everyone is in danger. I love it when they try to escape from Isreal. You feel that pressure of the 'zombies' coming closer and closer.The part where Gerry is in the lab and he is no longer visible for the 'zombies' is also very cool. He just drinks some Pepsi like everything is okay. This is a cool moment and is also very cool thanks to the performance of Brad Pitt.It is a fun movie. It is a movie you can watch twice and you would still enjoy it. The movie is not perfect but it is certainly a movie I recommend watching.Score: 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Didn't know what to expect when we got this film, had read a brief synopsis and it sounded good - plus we like Brad Pitt. What a roller-coaster of a film! Well made, full of action, pretty scary in parts (prepare to scream a couple of times at least), good cast and good acting. The story line is interesting and it does make you think how this would affect you in real life, what would you do? how would you cope? what about your family? It's also set on a global scale, with several countries being featured in the film. All of a sudden, the world is a very unsafe and unpredictable place. Good luck. If you fancy a film that is a little bit different, will play on your emotions and make you think twice about stuff, then give this a go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent adaptation of a great book; different but complimentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really tense film, exciting and visceral. It engages from minute one and keeps you tightly bound until the end. The premise is simple; zombies have spread wildly and are taking over the planet. Nowhere seems safe, and unlike "traditional" zombies, these are fast and the turn around from bite to zombie is twelve seconds so infestation of an area is exponentially fast.Brad Pitt is believable as the ex-UN worker, who gets called up to help out, he's convincing as a man who's seen action in the field and picked up a thing or two, and is fit and able to run around and take care of himself and his family. He played the action guy but also the guy who is worried about his family, and those he's in a team with sensibly. The "solution" isn't stupidly come across, by a leap or intuition, or without realistic casualties. It doesn't keep close to the book at all, but has taken the spirit of the story and made a huge film out of it. It was a massive scale film, with epic CGI vistas of zombies taking down whole cities - and the SFX of the film, the zombies themselves are brilliant. Everyone in the film acted it very real, and you hope against hope that there is a solution but you have no clue what it could possibly be.There are flaws in the logic of the film, and much is left unexplained, which is annoying, but it doesn't really detract from the film experience, which is a spectacle to be sure. I don't get the 'fast zombie' thing but in this genre-version it seemed to work. The end of the film left an opening for future films without being too obviously cliff-hangerish and I was pleased how international it was and wasn't too flag-waving American. Overall a great film, very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Worth It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombies! Can't understand the obsession with the undead, but as zombie movies go, this one was at least entertaining. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt in an appreciated understated performance) is a former United Nations operative who battles the entire state of New Jersey to get his family to safety aboard the only refuge not infested with zombies, an aircraft carrier in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Once aboard, Gerry is briefed on the news that the entire world has been contaminated. Unfortunately, as the viewer, I would have liked just a little more discovery on what the possible cause of the zombie virus was. Gerry soon finds out that his being able to harbor his family in this safe compound comes with a price. The military wants him to escort a scientist to South Korea who may hold the key to a cure. When Gerry refuses, he is given the ultimatum, become unretired and lead the mission or his family finds another refuge. His family's safety his only concern, Gerry leads the team into South Korea which has also become zombie land. Pitt basically puts on a one man show from this point on, with an occasional assist from a human or two. This easily could have turned into a Swartzenegger hero against the world blockbuster, but Pitt takes the lower road, showing something that movie super heroes rarely show, fear; fear of the unknown, fear of failure and fear he will never see his family again. I didn't expect to like this film, but it was a pleasant surprise and I would recommend this for it's entertainment and intensity value. While there isn't a lot of actual bloodshed as one would expect from a movie about walking cannibals, the film might be too intense for younger viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was walk out worthy. Anyone giving this garbage more than 3 of 10 stars either don't care about ridiculously intelligence insulting plot holes. For example: you are in a plane that crashes because a fight broke out with zombies. You happen to be flying over a country you have never been to. You promptly pull yourself together from the plane crash and walk directly to a "secret research facility" miles away to find the cure. This was supposed to be somewhat "smart" movie. But ended up being just dumb as Jurassic World which never set out to have an intriguing plot or mystery of any kind. I wish I could give this movie a 0.5 of 10. With budget and the source material they had to work with they did worse than I could have imagined. This movie is the "walk out worthy" category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Action Than Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>United Nations employee Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) traverses the world in a race against time to stop the Zombie pandemic that is toppling armies and governments, and threatening to destroy humanity itself.Classifying this as a "zombie" movie is much the same as calling "21 Days Later" a zombie movie. The categorization is not wrong, but kit changes what we typically think of when we mean zombies. These are not lumbering oafs. These are lightning-fast creatures that seem to have some sort of collective intelligence, like a colony of bees. Their abilities (most notably climbing walls) are foreign to what zombies are.Also, this should be seen as an action film first, horror film second, which seems to be the case any time Hollywood has millions of dollars to burn on a zombie film. See, for example, "I Am Legend". If you are looking to see Brad Pitt survive car accidents and plane crashes while traveling around the world (South Korea, Israel, Wales) this is a fine film. But if you want some scares or a film that embodies "survival horror", you will not get what you want.Probably the most clever thing about this was the referral of zombies as "rakshasa", a Hindu demon that feeds on human flesh. Maybe this has already been covered in Bollywood, but it seems that the concept is rather new here. The zombies (or infected) in this film are not actually rakshasa, but it does raise the question: where are Hindu demons in the horror film? If we can have Onibaba and other Asian creatures, why not something from a country with over one billion people? But this is a bit of a sidetrack...Anyway, good film if you want big budget action and Brad Pitt fighting computer-generated undead while sporting the greasiest hair since Kid Rock. Bad film if you want slow, lumbering Romero zombies. But to each his own, I guess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"World War Z", directed by Marc Forster, is a big budget blockbuster among his diverse output. It starts with a jaw dropping scene of unexplained traffic chassis in New York city, followed by mass evacuation from zombies. Brad Pitt's character then attempts to find out what stated the outbreak, but his efforts (or the portrayal of such) is rather lacking in intensity. The plot then descends into a mindless cat and mouse chase, without much depth given to Abby characters. Although thrilling and entertaining, the plot is not very memorable or emotionally engaging. Though the scene of zombies breaking through a high wall is quite spectacular, it still is just a forgettable blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitt Zombie Movie Dead on Arrival</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw a billboard advertising this movie, I nearly ran off the road. Really. Brad Pitt? Zombies? Epic Poster? How could it not succeed? But this movie tragically misses the mark.The problem is immensely bad writing and direction.Take this. The world is gripped by a Zombie epidemic. Brad Pitt is a retired UN super-inspector turned stay-at-home-dad who cooks his family awesome pancakes. Pitt's former boss sends a US military extraction team to rescue Pitt and his whiny family, bringing them to the safety of a naval task force. On his arrival his boss asks Pitt to come back to help. Pitt declines: "No, I told you I was retired." Implication: "Hey, thanks for the free ride sucker. Now me and my family will sunbathe on the deck of this awesome battleship while you and some other suckers save the world. And we want our dinner at 6 Sharp. No MREs. Kapish?" You want to slap him.You want to slap him again when he gets soldiers killed because he forgets to put his cellphone on "silent" while creeping pass Zombies. Worse, this is so his whiny wife can call him.Or leaving his camper van outside a supermarket full of looters, and agonizing it still isn't there when he comes out.Lots and lots of moments like that.And stupidities like blowing up a plane in midair because he wants to get off at this stop. Does he walk away? After pulling out a piece of metal he's impaled on, yes, he walks away.The whole idea of some sort of retired UN super-inspector being the only one who could save the world defies credibility. He drifts around the globe following the most absurd of leads. There's never the slightest sense at all that he's in danger. The cardboard cutouts who accompany him you don't care about. There's something seriously wrong with his family chemistry. Whether it's Skyler White, Betty Draper or Karin Pitt (Sorry, Lane!) here, Hollywood needs to stop giving its leading men such unlikeable spouses.Bad writing plays a big part in bringing this movie down. I don't know who is to blame, but bringing in Damon "LOST" "Prometheus" "Into Darkness" Lindelof for rewrites hardly seems an answer. The convenient escape ladders which descend out of no where (Yes, I *literally* mean this) are lazy writing.The direction too is bad. The South Korean Army Base scene is so poorly shot I didn't even know where it was until I read the IMDb comments. The suspense in this movie is non-existent. We know Likable Brad won't die, and don't give a damn about anyone else. I think giving him a close-knit team who save each others asses would have worked far better.Perhaps as other IMDb reviewers have suggested, maybe Hollywood should stop giving film makers with lemons to their names second, third and tenth chances. Director Marc Forster and Writer David Lindelof, Stand aside. Give someone else a go.The lack of gore wouldn't have bothered me as it has some, so long as the movie was suspenseful. Which it isn't.It's a massive disappointment, but I don't know where the blame lies. The movie studios must have played some role in this train wreck. They expected this to be a trilogy. I can't see how.Two good things: For all its faults, the movie is watchable. It's also popularized the book which I shall now read, though all it has in common is the name and that it's something to do with zombies.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the moment the credits stop, the action takes off. A threat to the World has come upon the human race. The clock is ticking as some of the planet's greatest minds attempt to resolve this ultimate threat. Brad Pitt, an investigator for the United Nations, is tasked with defining the problem and stopping it in its tracks. Leaving his family behind, he sets out across the World to look for answers to a problem that may have no answer or does it? He drops into numerous countries, yet by the time he arrives its too late to help. Elements of the pending catastrophe become clearer as he moves through his assigned tasks. Brad Pitt gives a fine performance. His costars flesh out the darkness looming over the World with sequences of better than average acting. This movie needs to be observed closely. There is so much action occurring simultaneously, you may need to watch it more than once to realize the total story being told on the screen. In a few interval scenes I had some trouble understanding the plot, but it becomes more clear with each passing section. I recommend this move to those who enjoy sci-fi or enjoy movies with many plot twists. Mark Davis, critic at large. americassage@gmail.com for comments or twitter.com/americassage</fullReview>

All in all I thought this was a well made, well written, well acted and intelligent film in many ways, given that it is of course a zombie movie, and of course that requires the viewer to have tolerance towards the adventure. But it caught my attention from the very beginning and I would recommend it to anyone who likes fast movies and tension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A PG-13 zombie film for the masses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WORLD WAR Z is the largest-budgeted (190 million +) summer blockbuster- style film featuring zombies to date. According to Box Office Mojo, it is also by far the highest-grossing zombie film here in the U.S.; beating its closest competition ZOMBIELAND (2007) by well over 100 million dollars. Let's face it: hype sells tickets. Throw in a known A- List star and that's even more tickets. Quality doesn't even really matter at the end of the day as long as you have the funds to promote the hell out of something. Unfortunately for WWZ, all of the money, expensive PR, CGI effects, online-generate hype and star power in the world can't save this from being an average, by-the-numbers, utterly forgettable film with an ordinary screenplay. It also can't change the fact there have already been literally hundreds of zombie films made for a tiny fraction of what this film cost (many made well under 1 million dollars) that wipe the floor with this one in every way possible.Brad Pitt (also one of the producers) stars as Gerry Lane, a retired UN operative who now enjoys staying home and making pancakes for his family. Aw, ain't he sweet? The open 25 minutes is centered around Pitt and his family's attempt to flee to safety once the zombie outbreak begins. These scenes are more-or-less rendered almost unwatchable thanks to the presence of Gerry's two irritating daughters. While pandemonium is erupting around them, these shrill little abortions take turns annoying us by 1. screaming repeatedly for their blanket, 2. taking off a seat belt during a high speed car ride and refusing to put it back on, 3. shrieking at the top of their lungs because they've dropped a stuffed animal, 4. gasping over an asthma attack and then being perfectly fine a scene later before even receiving medication, 5. wandering off in the middle of zombie attacks for no apparent reason. After a pit stop at an apartment building, Gerry uses his connections to get a copter lift to safety and thankfully wifey (Mireille Enos) and the girls are put on the back burner, having served their purpose of showing what an upstanding guy Gerry is. The film does briefly return to them a time or two to show things like one of the brat daughter's whining and complaining about the food and water they're being served. If this is the future, maybe a zombie epidemic isn't a bad thing after all.Now on an overly-crowded Navy ship with limited supplies, Gerry is pretty much forced into accompanying a young Harvard virologist and a military unit to search for the cause and then possibly a solution to the zombie pandemic that is sweeping the globe. They fly off to South Korea first, where the scientist moronically ends up slipping and shooting himself in a panic, leaving superman, uh, I mean Gerry, to come up with a solution all on his own. He's then off to Jerusalem for a spell to a walled-in compound that's eventually invaded by zombies and from there it's a plane trip back to Europe that ends up crashing due to an outbreak on board. Conveniently it dumps him and his new Israeli one- armed commando female friend (Daniella Kertesz) within walking distance of the W.H.O., where Gerry must risk all to prove a theory he's come up with by observing the zombie behavior on his trip.Fans of the novel this is supposedly based upon are likely going to be furious that this has next to nothing to do with the book. It's almost like they just wanted to use the snappy title and didn't really concern themselves with the story author Max Brooks had come up with at all. I know this had numerous production problems along the way, so maybe that played a part in the underwhelming finished product. Brooks' vision had the Romero-style slow-moving zombies that eat humans. Because this film just had to be PG-13, it changed the zombies from flesh-eaters to fast- moving 'infected' zombies who bite victims simply to spread the virus before moving on to someone else. Either way, they are not the least bit scary. In fact, often times they're unintentionally hilarious doing these exaggerated twitches, chomping their teeth, running around at about 60 MPH, leaping all over the place like overly-excited cats and creating these hilarious zombie stacks to ascend tall walls and buildings. The makeups are fine but forgettable and the CGI is fairly well-executed, but not well-executed enough to where much of this doesn't look cartoonish.Though some of the action scenes are fairly exciting and well-done in a generic big budget kind of way, the only new mythos this adds to the mix are making these 'living dead' selective about who they kill and infect. Somehow the infected have developed an amazing new way to tell whether someone has a terminal illness or not simply by looking at them (!?) They then refuse to attack or bite that person because, essentially, it would be a waste of their time. Though there's an attempt to explain why this is, it's all rather silly and the concept doesn't work at all.Because Pitt was the star and producer and wanted this to be his star vehicle, the supporting cast is comprised almost entirely of unknown actors. The few familiar faces (like David Morse) are there and gone in a matter of minutes as SuperBrad - complete with a ridiculous- looking Jesus / messiah haircut - saves the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War CRAP</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to describe this movie in one word, it would be CRAP. Let's get the worst thing in this movie out there first: Brad stinking Pitt. Wearing his new age wrist strings and ridiculous scarf, he looks like a pot smoking California yoga instructor. His effeminate hair style and Taliban stubble is not cool, it's stupid. And he's so super-special that every country on the face of the Earth will risk it's best soldiers to get him where he wants to go. Pitt is supposed to be a "U.N. Investigator." What? Who in the hell is going to put the fate of mankind in the hands of someone who worked for a corrupt organization like the United Nations? What would qualify a "U.N. Investigator" to warrant this kind of importance? It's crazy and can only be the idea of a Hollywood leftie in order to make the hero more "global." Let me say his job title one more time...a U.N. Investigator....HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!When Pitt is in the supermarket getting the required asthma medication for the mandatory "asthmatic child," his wife gets attacked by rapists in the middle of a crowded market while pushing her child in a grocery cart. Did I mention it was in a CROWDED market, with people swarming around them? Totally out of place and unbelievable. This was the first sign, besides Pitt's face, that what is about to unfold for the next two hours was going to be crap. And it was.I can't go into all the plot holes and mistakes because it would make this review 15 pages long. But here are a few...I wanted to walk out when the "Harvard educated Indian/Pakistani disease guy" made his appearance with his stupid speech in the movie. Luckily, he was so smart that he didn't know how important it was to keep his freaking finger off the trigger of his handgun and accidentally kills himself like the moron that he is. The best thing in the movie is this guy getting killed. Then the entire special team is wiped out because Pitt's wife called him at the wrong time. How lucky Pitt gets away. This is another theme that runs through the movie...Pitt cannot be killed. An entire plane crashes, and the only survivors are Pitt, the Jewish soldier chick, and a woman zombie strapped in her seat. Speaking of the plane crash, why did the passengers start to pile luggage between the zombie infected section and the zombie-free section? Did anyone actually believe LUGGAGE was going to stop the zombies? If a two year old infant pushed on the pile of luggage, no matter how high, it would fall over. STUPID! And before the crash, there was the Israel scene where they had built a wall all around the state of Israel. It worked fine, with no problems, until PITT shows up. Then there's some sort of singing by some burka girl going on, and right then PITT is the first to notice "it's too loud." How did her mike get hooked up to all the speakers in town? So, Israel has the smarts to figure out the time to put a zombie=protection wall up, but they had NO IDEA the zombies were attracted to sound? And if there are so many zombies around the walls, where are the people who are shown arriving at check points coming from? Why, in the midst of all the zombies, did a group decide to sing and dance? So anyway, after the plane crash in the hills or mountains of some foreign country, PITT and the Israeli soldier girl miraculously, without a GPS, find their way to the WHO building. They somehow walked there, with PITT impaled by a piece of metal, and the girl who had her hand cut off just hours before. By the way, when PITT chopped off the Israeli girl's hand, there was no blood. Not on Pitt, not on the girl, not on the BANDAGE covering the wound, not anywhere! In fact, there's nothing graphic in the entire film. This could have been a plus, but it was taken way to far. Besides the bloodless amputation of the hand, there's one scene where Pitt hits a zombie with his crowbar, and then is shown trying to pull it out as another zombie approaches. It just looks stupid when you can't see what the crowbar is stuck in and why Pitt can't seem to pull it out. Finally, PITT finds the room with the deadly toxins. He went there specifically to get into that sealed room, and no one gave him the code until he reaches it. Interesting. Then he injects himself in one of the "safe" diseases, by shear luck. I told you nothing can kill him. He's like Steven Seagal...you can stab, shoot, beat him but he can't be hurt or killed. The main difference is that Steven Seagal never came off like a wimp. PITT, however, does come off like a wimp who doesn't like guns and is more interested in his scarf and wrist strings than he is in shaving. Sorry but I can't go on with this review. It's another one of those movies where, if you think about it too much, you get mad. What a pathetic excuse for a horror/zombie/action movie. It fails on all fronts. I should have known better than to watch anything starring BRAD PITT. I'm just glad I didn't pay to see this thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge zombie fan and of course I had to check this out. After reading the book I knew the movie wasn't going to be like the book. Due in fact to the words "production problems" seriously why does everyone think it's code word for "Don't worry we are polishing this movie/game. There is no problems at all." I know I'm ranting at this point but seriously you people need to learn English.Anyway I sat down in a not so packed theater. A group of teens, an old couple and several couples with young children. The parents with children all left. The teens were horrified and the older couple were also enjoying themselves and you know what so was I. It's not perfect film but people are so damn hard on this film due to The Walking Dead. Let me say this after the first season WD was losing steam. I stopped watching when the second season was over.Now onto the film oh god. Our hero Brad Pitt Er Gerry is normal ex- government man. On this particular day he drives through Philly and everyone knows from Romero movies Philly is the best place for a zombie flick. Soon zombie's plow through human meat and the story lumbers for a bit. I won't lie the film is slow...at really small intervals. I never felt bored with this film just angry at some idiots within this film.Gerry's wife calls him in the middle of a big event which gets people killed. A bunch of Hebrews sing and then out of nowhere wall crawling zombies because sound draws them in. These two moments made me want to punch these people. Not the writers or producers. These everyday people who screw up. That was smart because as humans we can screw up big time. Despite this I enjoyed the zombie effects and horror elements. Sure they weren't very scary but still effective. You see people want a direct adaptation of the book weren't doing research. I looked stuff up and they didn't. OK again rant over. My problem with this movie isn't anything too terrible.First the formula was just stock. Gerry goes somewhere bad stuff happens. He goes somewhere else bad stuff happens. See formula, not a good thing. Second the inclusion of his family. Yeah he has one but nothing comes from it. They are just there unfortunately. Third unfortunately was the cgi. I know people have said it before but oh well. This movie could've used people for zombies but no, some scenes are just cg. Not saying it breaks the movie but good god hire people.Despite this I did enjoy this movie it was fun and very pleasing to this zombie fan. Overall 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Expected (Haven't Read The Book)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Marc Foster, who is a very talented director and I always enjoyed his films; Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland, Stranger Than Fiction (so underrated), The Kite Runner, and even Quantum of Solace. So I was automatically looking forward to watch this, especially the fact Brad Pitt was the lead role, however the re-writings worried me, but I'm glad I wasn't disappointed at the end.So the story is zombie apocalypse and Brad Pit as a UN agent is trying to find the source to be able to create the cure. I think the rhythm of is fast, and it shouldn't leave you bored, in fact at some points the intensity of it keeps you on the edge of your sit ? I didn't expect that. The performances are fine, Brad Pit never disappoints me, and for me it's interesting to keep seeing James Badge in movies as small roles acting with big stars (Ironman, Flight, and Shame). In my opinion, Foster has done a fine job in directing the movie, first he's made sure his visual effect team has done a proper job, then he's created very interesting events throughout the movie, and then he's made sure the tone is realistic; for example, I hate seeing in movies someone drives with one hand and looks at a different direction and nothing happens, but this doesn't apply here. I believe Foster wants to create the atmosphere of the story as believable as possible for the audience, and I can say he's succeeded. I've seen some reviews saying the ending is not proper, why the hell not? What doesn't make sense to you? I don't understand why some people want everything to be shown and told to them and not use their imagination or their brain to complete the story when every element is given to them. I know they reshoot and recreated the third act, which it hurts a scene, but it is still satisfying to me (I'm also curious about the differences since the author, Max Brooks, liked the first draft of the screenplay). Also the soundtrack is done very well, it's very effective both in the opening montage (which I love it) and in the third act ? I'm glad this year composers are doing wonderful jobs for scoring movies.Overall, I recommend this movie and try to enjoy it in theaters, if not definitely buy it; I give it 7.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review: World War Z</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story: I like the story of this movie, it was suspenseful and you can really feel the tension that they are trying to give the audience. My only problem with the story of this movie is that it was like a "rinse and repeat" at each scene or at each country the lead character goes to. It plays out like this, they went to this country, it was a dead-end then a new clue arise then they go after that next country, same sh*t happened and it goes on over and over again, it's like listening to an 8 track album on repeat.Having said my problem with the story, I however finds some positives on that negative and that is in each scene in each country, they are upping the ante and they upping the stakes. Each scene just gets better and better and each scene just gets more tense than the previous one whether it'll be in an open space or a remote closely tight space. It was engaging and fun to watch. I also love that they called the undead zombies and they are not referred to as 'walkers' or 'undead' or even 'biters'. Just plain 'ol zombies.Acting: Solid performances from the cast especially Brad Pitt, unfortunately though, the film suffers from minimum character development as it just focused more on Pitt's character. Brad Pitt's character is family man in this movie and his performance can really convince you, his family is his drive and his inspiration towards the success of his mission although if the family had died earlier on in the movie, it will not affect the movie overall, they are just a way for the character to show that he still retains an attachment to this world and someone to call to if he's doing fine or not.As I said, the cast turns in a solid performance despite short screen time and development but what really caught my eye in this movie is the performance of the zombies. It was very convincing and honestly very scary. The twitches when they are transforming and the way they make the bite sounds just makes it much more effective and clearly shows that they are hungry and targeting you. This is the performance for a zombie that I haven't seen in any other form of media.Action/Violence: This film was action-packed on the second half which gives the film a nice shift in tone. As for the violence, it wasn't brutal per se because most of the zombie bitings or eatings happened off-screen or it was shown from a distance. If it was shown though, there was almost no blood present. This is my minor complaint for the violence in this movie, it was a zombie flick, we need some zombie violence, but we didn't get it. I just hope that we'd get an "Extende/Unrated Cut" I will definitely check that out.Music: Marco Beltrami was the one responsible for the score in this movie and as I looked at his track record, it's mostly composed of action films and horror films. His score in this movie is no different except for the fact that it is a mixture of both of these and the outcome is really good. It worked really with the movie and the way it plays in the narrative of the movie was good too because it kept up on the tone of the movie.Cinematography: I loved it. It was able to show the grand spectacle of this movie and was able to show how this epidemic had happened globally. But there are three shots that really stood out for me, the first is the transformation of the zombie, it was scary and only glimpses of those shots were shown but it was effective. Second is the pile of zombies just climbing the big wall it was incredible to look at. Lastly is the hallway scene, it was full of tension and one pulse pounding moment.Direction: I'm not a fan of Marc Foster because I've only seen few of his films. I think his best work 'Stranger Than Fiction'. His direction of this movie really surprised me, I like the tone he went for the slow start and the fast-paced tone of the second half. The mixture of drama, action and horror was also good and it worked really well. I also liked how he directed the zombies because like I said before it wasn't like any other and he made them scary again.Overall: I had a good time watching this movie, it completely surpassed my expectations. It was a fun thrill ride that will make you bite on your nails 'cause of all the tension happening on screen. However the film does suffer from repetitive content but each scene gets better and better. This is a great zombie film that i both refreshing and entertaining, I give this one a 4/5.Favorite Line: Andrew Fassbach: Mother Nature is a serial killer. She wants to get caught, she leaves bread crumbs, she leaves clues... Mother nature knows how to disguise her weakness as strength. ----------------------------- Gerry Lane: If you can fight, fight. Be prepared for anything. Our war has just begun.For more check out my blog: http://ztrospective.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Complete Rip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I Am Legend ripped off 28 Days Later. Now WWZ rips off IAL. Is there a shrewd of originality outside of HBO, AMC, Netflix or Hulu. I mean seriously first zombies, transmission by blood and biting, zombies bound and screaming to get loose, weird tortured background music, a virus of unknown origin, zombies running in packs leaping at prey, returning as a zombie once chewed on, safe havens on islands near England and British Columbia, a vaccine, a dog, high powered rifles and hospitals motifs, a hero looking for his family, a resourceful girl picked up along the way, a good man accidentally infected who must be sacrificed, a high rise where death awaits and someone else's child must be rescued, sanctuary with the military that turns out not to be safe, And then and then .. It"s tine for a Twelve Monkey reunion when who should appear for a quick cameo but David Morse rejoining Brad Pitt.And I loved 28 Days later and like IAL a lot. But really - no wonder it only grossed ten bucks more than it cost to make,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just totally dumb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have expected more from a movie with Brad Pitt in it. If you have a thirst for zombie movies you might love this but it was just so tedious. It starts off with a bang with everyone trying to escape and wondering what is suddenly going wrong but it's all downhill from there with zombies constantly appearing and reappearing. Brad is wonderful as a loving husband and father but that's as wonderful as he gets. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the entire movie. So predictable and absolutely ridiculous finale with the handsome hunk saving the day and thereby saving the whole world. If I never see another zombie movie, it will be too soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie with a bright future.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay just to begin I want to tell everyone to calm down and think about this movie realistically. The hardcore fans of this book, like the ones of any book made into a movie, love to pick every detail and flaw out and claim this movie is crap. Yes it is not a 10/10 movie BUT it is definitely worth the see. I read the book and I though it was absolutely amazing. But from a realistic view point they could have never pulled off the book word for word. It just would be impossible. For those who have not read the book the story is basically a compiled series of interviews with people who experienced the zombies first hand. Now the book tells the stories of over a dozen people that have no real connection, only the single fact that they are dealing with the zombie outbreak is what makes them simular. This would have been IMPOSSIBLE to make into a successful movie. The way this movie was made was terrific. There was no boring 30 min start scene, it truly started intense right off the bat. The SFX were good, the story was good, the acting was great and is set up in a way were they can make multiple movie about different people and their experience. Overall, I would go watch it again and I liked every minute of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Non Stop Action, No relation to the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't read the book and if you like the non-stop frenetic action of modern American blockbusters with rapid cuts and lots of CGI, you will LOVE this movie. If on the other hand you were expecting to see a movie adaptation of World War Z, you won't. Really the only thing from World War Z in this movie is the title and an occasional bit of dialog. None of the plot, outcome, or circumstances of the book survive. Not sure what they paid for the rights but they wasted their money.For those of us who liked the book, this movie is very disappointing. To be fair the book is a narrative of a writer going around after the war is long over and that might have been hard to make into a movie. Even so, anyone who knows the book is going to be watching an empty blockbuster while thinking of a well-plotted, thought provoking book.See it if you must, but you might buy the book on Disk instead. That way you'll get 5 hours of riveting, thought provoking story with Hollywood actors (including Alan Alda) telling their stories instead of another 2 hours of your life you'll never get back.</fullReview>

World War Z just has a big name star trying to save the world and his family but he couldn't save the boredom of the fans of movies.I give World War Z an 1 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I detest any film about zombies because they are the plot. I just felt like Brad Pit cannot possibly be in something boring, can he ?????I like Brad Pit, he is a modern Robert Redford in my view, but this film is just the same old zombie theme, albeit with excellent special effects, oh yes!!.It starts with the usual family man stuff, but soon goes down hill fast when the zombies appear, and they do appear in a traffic jam, which Brad Pit is caught in, and the rest of the film is about him and his family trying to escape the zombies.Its a new twist on an old tale. This is my opinion of this film, and i'm sticking with it.1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Further Proof that Hollywood can Ruin Anything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a generic zombie film this would be average at best however as a film which purports to be 'Based on the book by Max Brooks' it is nothing short of sacrilegious and appalling. It's a shame really because there is some solid writing and good performances on hand and it could have been a good film with just one minor change: the speed of the zombies.In the book the zombies are slow moving and ungainly. Infection after a bite is a slow and harrowing process. Whilst the zombies are easily outwitted their power comes from overwhelming numbers, resilience and emotional reactions on behalf of the human race (not wanting to kill a loved one). The results are genuinely chilling and horrifying stories which tug at the heart strings and paint a vivid portrait of human survival.This film throws all of those points out of the window and might as well just replace the zombies with a mile high tide of flesh called 'The Blob'. Zombies that run and jump miss the point so hard it is painful to watch. They might as well just be killer aliens or swarms of rabid dogs. The scene with them climbing over the wall is just outrageously stupid. The screen writers/director clearly liked the infantry square scene from the book but couldn't be bothered with the setup for it.Worst of all however is the gaping plot hole that has come about as a result of messing with the time it takes for the infected to turn. Early on it states that air travel assisted in the spread of the infection yet it takes fully half the film for the main protagonist to conclude that in some people the infection can lay dormant for a time and isn't always instant. Logically therefore he had to assume up until that point that the cabin crew were serving tea and coffee to planes full of raging hell beasts? This story is a classic demonstration of everything that is wrong with modern films and major studios. They are so afraid of people switching off if the story moves too slow for even an instant and so they feel they have to fill every single scene with an explosion, a fight scene, a chase, a plane crash... all of which the hero inexplicably survives.28 Days Later had the infected (not zombies) running and it worked well. It managed to create some really tense moments and some fast paced action whilst offsetting them with the desolation and destruction of daytime in an abandoned city. It did so with a significantly lower budget and yet was far better than this film. This is because whilst they were fast and agile they weren't in possession of superhuman strength. That and they were played by actual people and not just dodgy CG.For the money they spent on this film they could have taken a handful of stories from the book and strung them together back to back or under a common narrative. When I heard they were making this film I imagined it would be like the book and work around the interview concept. The film would open on some scarred or tormented individual sitting in an interview room telling their story as the camera slowly focused in on them. It would then flashback to events happening in real time and the viewer would understand the physical scars and damaged psychology of the individual.The result would have been fantastic. You still could have had all the action and gore that modern audiences lust after but with a genuinely chilling story behind it.Instead they just made a generic over-the-top action film with some of the most preposterous zombies I have ever seen. Worse: by using the name World War Z they have all but assured that such a film can never see the light of day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not see this. PG-13 horror does not work. Teenager made movies do not work. Trying to make it for them to wide spread it to make more money does not work. Why? Because it is just made for that. Luckily the director will get some actual true horror fans to see it. I one true horror fan will stick with the one true horror of movies R and Unrated. The true Unrated, not know slightly added fake slop of blood to a PG-13 horror wanna be horror. People say these directors are good. If they can't the genre in the right path, then they are not that good. Simple.I will not even watch warm bodies. Just seeing the trailer was a turn off, and same with this one. Zombies step over each other to get to someone is just plain dumb. I saw that in the trailer, and it is a turn off. I will not ever support PG-13 horror ever again, just for the sake its a want a be horror movie, and does not live to be one. People say that the horror movies of today are getting worse. Well, there is a heck lot more PG-13 horror crap now, then there was at least a decade ago.Even some rated R ones like Paranormal trash are like PG-13, and claimed as rated R. Same with The Conjuring. Holy bomb squad blow those movies up terrible. The blair witch project is another bomb. The lists on the internet for the scariest movies are bombs, because they list PG-13 ones. Yes, no director is getting anything from me as in money towards these kind of movies.Yours truly the horror fan with true horror movies to watch besides this.</fullReview>

It is not that I expect movies of recent times to have a decent plot, this this makes everyone look as if the are the dummest idiots on the planet.I.E they build a wall knowing the zombies are out there, but cannot be bothered to patrol it. or Helicopters land so close that they can jump aboard!!They should issue warnings about being a zombie film so it can be avoided.

		<fullReview>When will Hollywood realize that they do NOT need to fiddle, meddle, or otherwise mutilate a story to make a movie? The book is a masterpiece of socio-political commentary, showing how politics and big business allowed the plague to become a world-wide catastrophe. Instead, we are treated to how politics and big business mutilated this story and mutated it into yet another generic action movie. Instead of following a reporter around the globe ten years AFTER the war, as he gathers stories from those who fought and survived, we end up following one man on his quest to be reunited with his family. For those who have not read the book, do so. The pity is that Brad Pitt HAD a working script, written by J. Michael Straczinski, that he used in order to get the project green-lit. Instead, he tossed that script and used his own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't read the book, that said first. So I will not complain about the story differing significantly from the original.I was only looking forward to see a real big budget zombie movie. Zombies on a global scale, big pictures, big war. A very mild zombie picture though, with PG-13. And I was hoping to get a sort of realistic approach to the matter: Infection spreading, society crumbling, fighting back, and themes like that.WWZ starts in the middle of it. The big cities all over the world are in the state of getting overrun. The whole movie focuses on one man trying to find out where the "infection" came from. And he wants to get back to his family. The only other significant character is a female Israeli soldier who manages to escapes together with him from dying Israel.Even with this pretty narrow viewpoint WWZ might have become a nice movie.But the zombies are way to fast. If you are confronted with 2 or 3 of them there is virtually no escape. These monsters are even faster then they were in "28 days later". Once bitten a victim turns into a zombie within seconds. How should a disease that infectious spread around the world? Every single infected person/zombie would be detected long before reaching any overseas destination. Just take a look at "28 days later", exactly for this reason the infection is confined to Great Britain.Well, I probably should not complain that much about the logic in a zombie picture. PG-13 and super fast zombies however destroy all horror. The zombies are most of the time just a fast flowing mass. And these flows are animated pretty poor. What did they spend the budget on? In the last third of the movie things get more claustrophobic. When our hero tries to get some biological samples in a lab complex full of zombies. There are numerous examples for this in other films and mostly done better.WWZ has some really mass scenes, but the poor animation spoils them. They just do not shock you because they look too phony. And because there is not one person that you really care about. It is by far not bloody enough for the genre. The characters are somewhat remote. One simply does not care that much when someone gets slaughtered. (A lot different from 28 days)The finale is pretty disappointing. The movie ends exactly where the war would/should start.The film is entertaining, but no real zombie horror movie. Rather watch the Romero films or the walking dead. Even resident evil is more interesting.</fullReview>

Its even more upseting when you know that many films have been made on this "zombie" theme before, and if you want to be creative (or original), one would expect a new angle on this subject. but NO. Same screaming actors playing flat zombie characters. Also, the main character development is flat and "Cliche", the plot line is predictable and the ending is poor. Special effects are OK, nothing more. I can't see any reason why a good actor like Brad Pitt A waste of two hours agreed to star in this movie (money is not a good enough reason in this case). Also, the re-production of the locations (Jerusalem for instance) is full of errors and unreliable. with such a big budget, the producers should have made a bigger effort, if they respect the viewers.

Just make a lot of people with weird make up just run here and there and then the hero keeps running away from them.... SImple idea with may be 2 brain cells involved. I am a fan of Brad though. He has done wonderful movies. I was still skepitcal to watch this movie and then i read awesome reviews on IMDb. I decided to watch this movie. 15 minutes into this movie... and I was mentally exhausted. Same zombie nonsense...... I kept my cool and was persistent, hoping something better from Brad..... 20 mins, 25mins and 30 mins was the limit I could tolerate this movie. I have no idea what happens after 30 mins, may be it turns out good but i didn't had the patience to watch this nonsense for any longer. Totally disappointing story line....even Brad's acting skills couldn't keep this movie alive..... If you are expecting a Brad to do deliver good performance in the movie then I guess this movie is going to disappoint you big time. No story, no direction.... Just random shots ........... I would not recommend watching this movie......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Derivative and boring. Those are the two words that came to my mind after watching WWZ.The only good thing in this mindless (as a zombie...) film is Mr. Brad Pitt, who does a convincing acting job. Other than that, WWZ is a reheat of countless other films that rely on the same formula.Lame special effects, plot holes the size of Gibraltar,e.g., zombies do not attack "sick" people.... This is in my opinion a Deus-ex-machina solution the writers used shamelessly...I wonder where they spend the millions and millions of dollars they use to make those films. I guess it is not in the script!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the stupidest movie that I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a perfect demonstration of why I rarely waste time watching movies. Directors have fallen in love with special effects and camera tricks and no longer bother with story lines or character development. For some reason, I guess that we were supposed to be scared or confused or something by all the jerky camera movements that did little for me besides making me motion sick. The movie contained a plot too simple to fill a CSI episode, inane dialog, and totally wooden acting. There were many plot features that were simply ridiculous. There were all these sailors on navy ships doing there jobs with absolutely no concerns about their families but for some reason it was critical to EVERYONE to keep Brad Pitts' wife and children safe. The other officials and sailors had no contact with their families, but it was deemed critical to make sure that Brad Pitt got to talk to his wife every day. Everyone on board a large jetliner EXCEPT Brad Pitt and his accomplice and the 2 pilots gets turned into a zombie and then the plane crashes, supposedly on final approach to an airport even though there is no sign of civilization anywhere around, and everyone and everything gets killed EXCEPT, of course, for Brad Pitt and his accomplice. And so on. The screenplay must have been written by a bunch of high school kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitt vs. the Zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A highly entertaining, fast-paced zombie flick. It does not waste more than five minutes before introducing the zombies and from then on it is no sleep for mr. Pitt. If you like suspense, action and zombies, WWZ is definitely a must-see. Had I seen this on DVD, and not in the theater, I would have screamed out loud several times. The title is a little misleading, I think. Definitely, a world war is happening in the movie, but it is not where the focus is - the focus is on Brad Pitt and his family. You get to see the world destroyed by zombies, don't worry, but it is more a case of Brad Pitt saving the world than the army saving the world, and this is my main criticism of this movie. Why is Brad Pitt the only one who can figure out what to do all the time? I think he is too superhero-like in the movie, and that took away some of the realism, which is much needed in zombie flicks to not make it too far out there. On the other hand, it was a nice change to see the zombie apocalypse from the point of view of someone working with the system to stop it, rather than from a "normal" person's point of view, who is hiding and trying to survive. We have seen that many times, and it is fascinating to imagine to be in that situation, but WWZ is a nice new angle. Expect Die Hard meets 28 Days Later rather than The Walking Dead.And, damn, this movie is scary! The zombies, ones you get to see them up close, are so creepy and so so fast - I was jumping in my seat hoping Brad Pitt and Co. would run faster. I had adrenaline pumping through my body leaving the theater and I almost ran to the car.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z: Zombies on the roll.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z is about an dreadful virus spread across many nations. One Spec Ops put his foot forward to find the reason and try getting an answer for it. Its powerful as an content, fun for action lovers as things keep happening which doesn't allow any Loo Breaks for audience.Zombies are on an roll this time as they are fast, senses details very fast and are hungry for living body. Brad pitt is great as usual.The movie begins with a short intro to the main character and his family (it was enough, it told me all I needed to know) before launching into a fantastic, break neck sequence that establishes the pace for most of the rest of the movie. It's violent, visceral and shocking without any reliance in gore. The tension is racked up (especially in the escape from the apartment block sequence) with a series of spectacular set pieces (the walls of Jerusalem scene is brilliant) and things get better and bigger until the film slows the pace for the final reel with a slow burning, smaller scale sequence set in a WHO research lab in the UK. It's an unusual choice to end a movie with the smallest set piece, but it worked well for me as it was in line with Gerry's quest and the (stated in the movie) fact that the answer is often so small it gets overlooked. World War Z is perfect masala entertainer. Prefer watching it in 2-D as there is no room for 3-D.Cheers !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War Z is a movie about zombies. Lots of zombies. Enough of them, in fact, to literally take over the world.It starts with an unknown patient zero somewhere in Asia. Then there are bizarre reports of Indian soldiers fighting what they call the "undead." Gradually cases of a strange disease which re-animates the dead infiltrate major metropolitan areas. Our movie picks up with a sudden outbreak in Philadelphia, and we witness a generally peaceful city transformed in minutes into a sea of chaos, fear, and terror.One of the survivors of the Philadelphia outbreak is Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt). Gerry was once a troubleshooter for the United Nations, and once it becomes obvious that zombies are literally infesting the planet with incredible speed the U.N. wants Gerry back in the field. If he can discover the origins of the disease, then perhaps a cure will follow. Reluctantly, Gerry agrees. He leaves his beloved family behind on an aircraft carrier and flies off to South Korea with a team of Navy SEALs.South Korea proves to be merely the first stop on what will be a globe-spanning odyssey for Gerry, however. As he travels from one international hotspot to another, Gerry slowly pieces together a little information about the zombie threat. But can he come up with a solution before the whole world is ravaged by the undead? To its credit, World War Z tries to be more than your average zombie film. Most films of its type aren't very good, typically being badly written and grotesquely gory. World War Z isn't especially gory, and the shocks it generates are more likely to be generated by suspense and surprise rather than splatter. Pitt is a solid lead, and he clearly delivers his best effort, so that Gerry comes across as a real person rather than a superhero impersonator.Sadly, none of this elevates World War Z above the mundane. For starters, the movie fails to deliver the scale its premise dictates. With the exception of a great scene set in Jerusalem, the movie never captures the magnitude of what is supposedly happening to the entire world. The film keeps us focused almost entirely on what Gerry is experiencing, presumably to establish viewer rapport with our protagonist. But for a movie about a World War, you don't see much of the world or the war.Perhaps more importantly, the film really isn't very scary, and only haphazardly interesting. As mentioned above, there are a few suspenseful moments and it's nice to see a horror movie where something is left to the imagination, but the movie is very slow and has lots of down time where the zombies aren't directly involved in the action. The result is a movie that just sort of rumbles along, hitting a few high points here and there but ultimately failing to reach a suitable climax. Even though World War Z isn't quite two hours long, it feels closer to three.World War Z is one of those films that isn't an outright failure, but it isn't anything special, either. If you really like zombies then go ahead and give it a go?you've most likely seen worse. Otherwise, you should probably just save your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>28 mins later i wanted to leave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was dragged to this movie by others saying it sounded good. I already suspected it was a flop from its trailers so i didn't really expect much. And just like i thought it was a very expensively produced train- wreak of a movie. Imagine watching resident evil, dawn of the dead, the walking dead or any other decent zombie movie/show.. then lets say there was no gore or cannibalism allowed,or even close up bullet shots to the brain, basically nothing remotely violent on screen even tho the story sounds violent. It has a few pop-up scare parts and a few parts where it seemed something could happen cool but a quick scene change makes sure we cant see whats going on fully. Like when they have to cut the army girls hand/arm off the camera pans up so nothing is shown spraying out of it or the guy that hears a zombie turns to run and shoots himself in the head(i must take there word for it cant see it). Any death in this movie happens so quick and is blocked so much because of the rating it hard to know who really died and who might have escaped a close call. The young boy who runs away from the apartment building with them in the heli is never seen after unless i missed something. One of the biggest flaws of the film is the locations they picked.. to most they might think well i liked the exotic scenery but from the trailer it looked like it stayed in a US city mostly(where it would be most exciting), if i had read the book before i saw it i might have understood the location changes better or at least expected it. Also the story goes on to say the US falls first because we didn't have enough guns/ammo... really?... just face palm. I think they really wanted to stay out of the US for filming since its to expensive really besides the books plot. Overall i don't think this is a worthy zombie movie given its budget and actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For originality and finesse it fails, but it's fast, furious, and Brad Pitt makes it gel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z (2013)In short: another formula disaster film. Well made, some great acting (and some not so great), and some good scary scenes, and maybe that's enough. It is, after all, a summer movie.But it could have been different. Having the zombies sprint and have superhuman resistance to getting hurt makes for exciting scenes of mass chaos and running and running. It speeds up the normal dread and fear of the classic Romero style zombies. But it also makes the whole thing kind of just a sensation, and it borders on silly, or it would if so many people weren't getting killed and zombified.The whole movie is about excess, everything speeded up and boiling down to confrontation and decision on the spot. There is almost zero expectation or suspense. In fact, one of the clearly best scenes in the movie comes near the end when Brad Pitt (who is great throughout) has a one-on-one with a zombie through a glass door. It takes time, it has the audience wondering. It isn't just about shock and reaction to shock, but about anticipating shock. And then, yes, you don't always need the shock.Pitt's wife in this is a bore and it's not really her fault. She is given the role of being a good wife and protecting their children, which she does. The only woman with substance is a little known Israeli woman (actress Daniella Kertesz) and even she becomes someone Pitt has to save. Which he does. With style and a little out there medical treatment (I mean before they get on the plane!). Ha. The movie is really quite fun and fast and zippy. If it's obvious and superficial, maybe I expect too much.But wait, aren't there other movies that go here and do better at making it work on several levels? Like "Children of Men" which has a similar futuristic chaotic vision and yet lots of novel turns and much more amazing filming. "World War Z" is not filmed badly by any means, but it depends a lot on fast cuts (and multiple cuts) which create that barrage effect rather than a more coherent following the action through the disaster, which works better for the viewer. And then there is the issue of plausibility. I know, who cares? Well, on some level it changes how you take the movie. If it is just comic book stuff, and the superhero can do anything, then whatever, sure (though even superheroes have rules of play). But for example they realize at some point a way to work around the way the zombies attack anyone living so quickly, and yet don't explain or suggest at all how the zombies would know one kind of victim from another. (I'm trying not to give anything away.) They just "know" and this becomes a chink in their armor.I don't know. I found it frustrating just as much as fun. I saw it in 3-D and that was dispensable, I think. I mean--it's a novelty, but the movie doesn't really need it. There's plenty of depth, and action, and visual complexity, without it. Save the three bucks unless you're a devotee.Thanks Brad Pitt for holding this all together. He dominates every scene, and for good reason. And look at the original book, which has a lot of differences (like no main character) and a unique construction (as a U.N. official document). This is an adaptation, and it borrows from the clichés with heavy-handed dependability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All The Potential, None Of It Realized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'World War Z' could have been one of the best Zombie movies ever. It has an almost intimidating line-up of talent before and behind the camera, it is based on a best- selling novel and the makers reached very deep into their pockets to break Zombie havoc out of its usual local confinement to go and create mayhem on a global scale. But the film-makers failed on every count. And this is not about the controversy regarding the unfaithful rendering of Max Brooks' novel. Yes, the movie 'World War Z' essentially discards the basic concept of the book 'World War Z'. But even when fully acknowledged that a film is a work in its own right, the movie is still a failure. Although the pitch sounded so promising. Zombie movies so far have been local affairs. 'Dawn of the Dead' depicted the Zombie epidemic somewhere in rural America, 'The Walking Dead' maraud in backwater Alabama., '28 Days/Weeks Later' take place in and around London. So it's fair to assume that we all have been waiting long and eagerly for a movie that deals with the Zombie epidemic on a global scale. So, what 'World War Z' could have been is a thrilling and scary genre movie with a gripping premise, compelling characters and stunning visuals of global Zombie disaster. And it could have explored a multitude of grand themes. What makes us human? How do we maintain human kindness in the face of global destruction? At what point do we allow the veneer of civilization to break and give way to chaos and barbarism? Unfortunately the movie leaves all this potential unrealized.The protagonists are two dimensional and wooden, I can't remember having ever seen Brad Pitt so stiff and awkward. His character Gerry Lane is introduced as one of the best UN investigators there are and it is this alleged aptitude that puts him as the main character. What earned him this reputation remains unclear throughout the entire movie though. He never shows particular investigative skills, nor does he shine by asking incredibly smart questions that nail it all down. He rather stumbles through the plot holes and follows even the vaguest hints as an excuse to traverse the globe. At one point this gets right out ridiculous when Gerry accidentally runs into a prisoner with some obvious mental problems, and that nutcase prisoner says something along the lines of 'There is a man in the Middle East who might know something', and Brad Pitt's "best UN investigator" goes 'Yeah right, let's go to the Middle East then'. Wow, this is really poor screen writing. Probably the most engaging aspect of a movie with the premise of 'World War Z' would be for the viewer to witness how humankind struggles to maintain humanity and how this becomes increasingly harder as civilization gradually dissolves into chaos and death. Well, this aspect really is engaging - but you won't find it explored in this movie. There are only two scenes where this theme is latently addressed, one of which has the wife and kids of Brad Pitt's character facing dismissal from a safe refuge. But neither do we see the wife fighting her and her children's deportation, nor do we get to watch the politicians vindicate their inhumane decision. We don't get a glimpse on what this decision does to her or her little children or even Brad Pitt's character. What could have been an engaging, emotional, highly dramatic and as well as frightening part of the movie is simply omitted. You might think you could live with all these flaws as long as this Zombie movie delivers on its primal promise - Zombie thrills abundantly. Think again. Aside from the fact that 'World War Z's PG-13 rating forecloses any Zombie gore the movie fails to create any characteristics you'd normally affiliate with the genre. No white knuckle moments, no jumping in your seat, no claustrophobia, not the faintest signs of decent suspense. The human-vs.-Zombie-moments create a permanent sense of déj?-vu. Be it humans running and Zombies closing in, be it a door with tons of Zombies on the outside about to run it in, be it humans slowly running out of ammo as the Zombie hordes keep surging. You know you've seen 'em all in other movies, only that they were far better in those other movies. The few redeeming qualities of the film ? and why I give it three stars - are a couple of compelling CGI shots of major cities in ruin and the nature of the Zombies which act like an unstoppable, hyper-fast, hyper-frenzied swarm of locusts.All in all the movie 'World War Z' is a weak and astonishingly uninspired affair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z , 'Z' Stands For Zanyism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, WWZ certainly isn't a bad movie. You've got the long-time Oscar- deserving Pitt playing Gerry Lane, a likable, good-looking family man who retired as a UN investigator to spend more time around his wife and daughters. This is all about to change obviously, because after the now seemingly mandatory news-footage-montage introduction, Gerry is called back by the UN in exchange for his family's safety on their big boat.It sounds good enough, but the problem is that WWZ's political/international context is nowhere to be found so we're left pretty much to 28 Days Later with blockbuster pretentiousness. Sure, Gerry travels around the world and makes a few long distance phone calls, but there's never anything remotely compelling enough to warrant his travels and whenever the plot does manage to come close to something it quickly sets it aside in the interest of keeping this summer blockbuster light, family friendly and internationally marketable.After Quantum of Solace there was much uncertainty about Forster's ability to direct action and after WWZ, guess what? There still is. Granted, it's never boring, but when the other elements that should've made the film aren't there it should be more than "never boring". Paramount's marketing certainly didn't help; if you've seen the trailers then you've seen the whole plot and LITERALLY every single action set piece, in chronological order too. You know when you see a trailer and think "they put all the good parts in"? Well, this time they put the whole movie in. The more hardcore genre fans might also want to look elsewhere if they're seeking gory zombie kills; there isn't much of that either as its PG-13 rating might suggest.Brad Pitt is really the film's only strength. Much like Tom Cruise, Brad's got enough talent to singlehandedly pull you through a not-so- great movie without you hating him for it. And at almost age 50 you can't really blame him for wanting to star in his own big blockbuster franchise for the first time in his career when he could've played any superhero he wanted years ago. "Franchise" of course, if permitted by the audience, because this is one movie that desperately wants to have sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though I haven't expected much due to casting and director I was so surprised how bad this movie was. Surprisingly not because of Pitt and others (even though none of the actors was performing above average) or director (even though atmosphere was throughout the movie boring - especially for the zombie movie and action scenes were just the average Hollywood shade) but because of the screenplay - it was unbelievable horrible (and we all have to agree that we are willing to lower bars a lot should the screenplay bring us the fun). Lets go through some of the most brain kicking outcomes of the movie. ...For the key mission was sent one doctor without team with 4 (FOUR) navy seals (that plane could transport much more including armored vehicles). Of course its necessary to give him gun and let him shoot himself.With such fast incubation time - no one within the world was expecting it - except for the Izrael of course. Izrael was really well prepared - for protecting Jeruzalem had one 2m high fence and deployed 20 soldiers with some rifles and a few choppers. Thats it - no heavy guns, no minefields, no 5-zoned restricted areas, no heavy amunition in the air, no armored vehicles (which u cant bite through i guess - when magazine could work well), etc... people walking like the world is not in threat, letting palestinians enter secured areas (with limited supplies!! they would never do that), palestinians "responsible" for the attack by singing too loud, people used to military alerts in panic, surprisingly grenades working better than rifle (imagine how would tank brigade or minefield work), etc. There is no napalm, mines, tanks, jets, bombers, artillery, cruisers, tomahawks, predators,special forces....Laboratory site - for sure skilled doctor had to accidentally infect himself (but to be honest as zombie movies fan i would accept that), when they try to sneak to lab they still hit something, leaving their only guns behind, zombies are stopped by tiny doors when earlier iron grill didn't stop them,... Could continue but going out of space and blood pressure is still high for wasting 2 hrs of my life - 7*??? ais really crazy; 5* if to be kind!!</fullReview>

That being said, in any case you do get your dessert.World War Z is as fast as the zombie horde that explode onto the screen, edge of the seat thriller, some scares (even without gore) and jumpy moments so this movie worked for me. It's tense, it's exciting and a little unnerving due to the fact that this film depicts very well how things would play out if a virus was to break out in densely populated cities.I don't know who to thank but I was pleasantly surprised that when using cities around the world for various plot points they didn't go with London in the UK but for Cardiff in Wales in the UK :o) made a nice change as I come from Wales.In essence, the pros outweighed the cons,and yes there were cons(not so fluid plot, no foreplay,plus this movie could of been at least an extra hour longer).Final statement - I'm a massive zombie movie fan and I was not insulted by the movie, to be honest it nice to have a bit of variation. I'm also a massive apocalyptic end of the world movie fan, that my friends, is what you get.Absolutely my final statement.... I'm one of those guys who kind of thought it would be cool to have a zombie apocalypse....UNTIL NOW. This film deals with fast Z's not the ankle dragging uglies you can just jog away from or to (if you're armed) so I'm cancelling the Apocalypse, sorry everyone.</fullReview>

It is then, just another zombie film.Very disappointed at the lost opportunity.This is the usual American "one man out to save the world" fantasy instead of the insightful view into what we are at our core as humans and how we 1st worlders view blights and plagues when it involves us directly versus how we seem to simply accept that the 3rd world face calamity, war, pestilence and genocide all too regularly.I'm really amazed that stars who don't need the money and who have a history of doing art house and risky movies would be interested in simply cashing in rather than creating something unique and lasting like Fight Club for example. Take an amazing book with a cult following and simply try and stay as close to the text as possible given the cinematic limitations that exist. Not a new or ground breaking concept.Instead we have man versus a multitude of monsters. Using violence and cunning to save the day and return home to the clichéd wife and kids.Such a pity.</fullReview>

Then, it flew off like a bull on crack. As you watch in the beginning, while Brad Pitt's successful acting leads his fictional family to safety as ordinary survivors, you are hooked by the time he assumes his past position with the UN. As he travels here and there you are poked with action, suspense, thrills, a slight amount of horror, sadness, and epic adventure. Oddly enough, this movie was slightly realistic, at least, as realistic as it gets that is. This movie is worth the ticket and the disc.</fullReview>

From the trailers I have expected a sloppy looking graphically created zombies flooding about in the masses. It gave a vulnerable feel to the main characters and that you can't necessarily guarantee a getaway when their faster than a marathon runner. The ending and resolve left one with hope as it was intended in the story as a whole. I will definitely purchase it when it comes out. And sometimes, it's okay to have a zombie flick and have it not be all about the gore, which I am pleased to see that this movie did not spend a whole lot of time doing. Recommended</fullReview>

The movies has some amazing shots, specially the epic scenes of zombies invasions, but that would be it. I would recommend it for a rental, for those hardcore fans who find pleasure in tinny details. As a whole the script is poor and in many occasions the lack of logic, simple stupidity or naivety irritates. Pitt is on a highest importance mission in Corea while his life and of his teammates is put in jeopardy by a phone-call of his bored and longing wife? lol? Pitt injects himself a random virus which happens to be the one that works as a ' camouflage cure' ? Israel happened to foresee the coming apocalypse and built a wall because their intelligence intercepted chatter about ' zombie' while the rest of the world just awaited their doom? etc There is a ton of it. A real waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...I have to say that "World War Z" is not a bad piece of mindless entertainment. I trust whoever reads this understands I am damning it with faint praise. Truth is it's a perfectly watchable production that will eventually sink into the great mass of otherwise undistinguished perfectly watchable productions that comprise the bulk of the film industry's output. And in this case, Sturgeon's Revelation notwithstanding, I say so what?Its major distinction is that it's the first (and will possibly be the only) high-budget tent pole zombie film ever made. If it manages to turn any sort of profit worldwide (and the early indications are positive), there will surely be a follow-up, and for all but the most rabid gore-soaked zombie fans, that's far more encouraging than the thought of the upcoming "Independence Day" sequel. I caught it at a $5 matinée and did not feel cheated; at full price, I admit I might well have thought otherwise. Viewer mileage will vary depending on one's allegiance to the source material, Max Brooks' novel.Said novel is essentially a compilation of post-apocalypse accounts, virtually un-filmable except, perhaps, as a mini-series. Brad Pitt &amp; Co. chose to retain only the basic scenario (worldwide zombie plague) and the title; hey, they paid for it, they can do with what they wish. Brooks may have whined, but he still cashed the check, didn't he?Be that as it may, "WWZ" turns out to be a competent action-thriller with a primary attraction of nicely portraying a genuinely international disaster without an overload of "Oh, c'mons!" beyond the core premise. It's essentially "28 Days Later" on a global scale. Nutshell: Watchable, dispensable product. Hardcore zombie fans will not be pleased.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm finding it very hard to believe anyone could really like this movie. I especially feel sorry for anyone who has read the book.The opening set piece with the escape from the city was quite well done, however the moment the helicopter landed on the carrier this film delved into a horrid convoluted mess. To summarize-Lets fly to Korea because of the word "Zombie" in an email. I could have been a major character, but I stupidly shot myself in the head. HI! I'm David Morse - my character has depth. That's why I'm only on screen for 4 minutes! I like riding bicycles at night to refuel a plane. " don't worry guys, I got this one" BANG.Touchdown Jerusalem. Zombies apparently like singing. On noes! CHOP of that nasty bite on your hand. GET THESE MOTHERF**KING ZOMBIES OF MY MOTHERF**KING PLANE!Yay! The plane crashed within walking distance of the research facility we need to be at. Hmmmmmmmmmm maybe if I inject myself with a lethal virus, I won't get bit. I didn't!.Quick montage of aerial drops of manufactured viruses distributed worldwide to combat the infection &amp; a reunion with family.Credits.And that is it. Fans of the book miss out on the battle of Yonkers, the lobo, the drive across the Eastern US states and the rest of the narrative that made the book great. If you have not read the book, see it to realize what a really bad Zombie movie is like. The special effects were good!, moving it from 2 too 3.</fullReview>

I literally started watching with my husband and we stopped watching after 40 minutes. It was a complete waste of time. If you're interested in something fun to do with that subject matter, watch the other TV show/movie I mentioned. It'd be worth your TIME and MONEY.

Really weak script and again, who thinks that hand-held shaky camera is engaging and exciting. Blur, blur, blur. Lead couple was terribly miscast. Definitely like my zombies slow and scary. There was such a major difference in the look and reaction time from group zombie (CGI) to small cluster zombie (Real actors). Real waste of money and talent. Based on some of the reviews, it should have been more like the book. The soaring shots of the planes and helicopters was nice to watch...even epic..as the reviews touted...., but the film was anything but.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mainstream Zombie Saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about the zombie thriller "World War Z" is its feverish pace. Only the zombies themselves move faster than this suspenseful, but immaculate, 115 minute chiller about a global zombie apocalypse. Cinematically, traditional zombies came from the Caribbean and shuffled. Indeed, zombies have been shuffling since "White Zombie" (1930) where wicked sugar cane plantation owner Bela Lugosi exploited them as a source of cheap labor. Of course, he kept them under control with the use of voodoo. The zombies in "WWZ," on the other hand, run rather than shuffle. These aggressive, hell-bent-for-flesh zombies in "World War Z" are nothing new, particularly since the Italian-produced outing "Nightmare City" (1980) where the undead tried on their track shoes for the first time. Pouring out of a jetliner, those irradiated zombies wrecked havoc with weapons such as machetes, knives, axes, and machine guns! Most will remember "28 Days Later" (2003) as their introduction to fleet-footed zombies. Essentially, zombies were running long before "World War Z." Ostensibly based on Max Brooks' landmark zombie novel, "World War Z" streamlines the story lines into one to generate greater momentum. Furthermore, this film concludes somewhat uncertainly with its catastrophe-in-progress, whereas the war in Brooks' book has ended. Brad Pit does play the equivalent of a United Nations agent, but he doesn't visit survivors and interview them. Fans of Brooks' bestseller may not appreciate the changes that "Quantum of Solace" director Marc Forster and scenarists Matthew Michael Carnahan of "The Kingdom," Drew Goddard of "Cloverfield," and "Lost" co-creator Damon Lindelof have wrought. Meantime, hardcore zombie fanatics will undoubtedly lament the lack of blood, gore, and more. This humorless Paramount release has eliminated virtually all traces of blood and gore for a family friendly PG-13 rating. You can catch more gut-munching on AMC's "Walking Dead" than in this movie.Swedish director Marc Forster plunges audiences head first into the fracas. Initially, we meet the Lane family. Gerry (Brad Pit of "Fight Club") is a former United Nations trouble shooter with a sterling reputation for getting the job done. He lives with his wife, Karin (Mireille Enos of "Gangster Squad") and their two under-age daughters, Constance (Sterling-Jerins) and Rachel (Abigail Hargrove) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Life appears happy but not too sappy for the Lanes. No sooner have they wheeled into the streets than they witness some bizarre behavior. Helicopters swarm overhead as if an emergency has occurred, and police rush past them on their motorcycles. Our heroes listen to the radio and hear an announcer mention something about rabies. Mind you, like the Lanes, we are kept in the dark for most of the time about the origin of this zombie pandemic, too. Gerry watches as a man mutates before his eyes into a zombie after several minutes. When their vehicle breaks down, Gerry commandeers another vehicle. He careens off to a nearby high-rise apartment complex to wait for the United Nations to pick him up. Gerry's former U.N. boss Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena of "Safe House") has a chopper pluck Gerry and his family from a rooftop just as zombies are about to take a munch out of them. Thierry flies Gerry to the safety of a U.S. Naval armada in the North Atlantic. Our hero learns that the President is dead; the Vice President is missing without a trace, and most of America bristling with zombies. U.N. officials want Gerry to locate patient zero. In other words, our long-haired, unshaven hero must find where the outbreak broke out. In the novel, the outbreak occurred in China, but Forster and company shift the blame to the poor Koreans. This isn't the first time that the Koreans have been substituted for the Chinese. Anybody who has seen either the "Red Dawn" remake or "Team America: World Police" should know that tidbit. Our reluctant hero balks at Thierry's proposal until he learns that they will fly him back to the zombie-infested City of Brotherly Love with his family unless he lends a hand. Afterward, Forster and company rarely let the action slacken for a moment unless the characters have to explain something to each other. The filmmakers treat us to sprawling scenes where zombies scale lofty walls like maniacal ants. Literally, they behave like suicidal Marines as many hurl themselves at walls and buildings to provide head, shoulders, and backs as platforms for others to climb. Zombies here react violently to noise and rampage after anything that makes noise. Rather than focus on the usual, tasteless, gut-munching melodramatics of most grindhouse zombie sagas, Forster drums up considerable tension and suspense with how our heroes elude the zombies. One white-knuckled scene depicts our heroes trying to sneak past zombies in a laboratory without arousing their attention. Naturally, our heroes aren't quiet enough and the zombies tear into them at the first sound.Although it makes use of the standard zombie movie conventions, "World War Z" alters the formula. Our heroes find a means to stop the zombies from munching mankind. Basically, what Forster and his scripters have done is come up with the viral equivalent of smearing zombie blood and guts on your body so the undead won't recognize you as a snack. The proof is in the pudding, but the outcome lacks credibility and the narrative runs out of steam. Discretion prevents me from disclosing how Gerry and mankind get a foothold and blunt the zombie invasion. Incidentally, the military refers to zombies as "Zekes." The scenes at the airport, in the air, and on the ground in the medical research facility will keep you glued to your seat with dread. By the final 30 minutes, predictability asserts itself because you know Brad will come out of it alive with his family intact. For the most part, "World War Z" takes itself seriously and shuns any attempt at ghoulish humor. Since the 1970s, the typical zombie movie ladled out the blood and gore like gravy and potatoes, but "World War Z" shuns such shenanigans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the reviews I anticipated watching this movie with a sense of dread. I was very pleasantly surprised. (unlike Prometheus where I very unpleasantly surprised!) It's not your usual xbox style kill everything in sight blood and guts, pass out from boredom zombie type movie. It's not really a zombie movie. The pace was good. Maybe a tad fast but the movie was 2 hours. 3 hours would have made it epic. It could easily have been 3 hours long. The problem with these movies is they try and fit a lot into a short period of time. Inevitable corners are going to be cut to get to the punchline. The storyline was plausible. Bizarely the only character that didn't make much sense was Brad Pitt's. Not sure who or what the guy was supposed to be. All they had to do was make him some sort of hot shot military scientist or Doctor and voil?, everything would have fallen into place. That said if you just except the character and pretend he's a Doctor or something the movie is a very entertaining watch. If you have seen the trailer. You definitely have not seen the movie! Some reviewers try and spot mistakes and errors in the movie or inconsistencies. All movies have this. So what? If it doesn't really affect the story what do I care. It's not an exam. If you want details maybe you should try reading a book...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually do my research on movies before seeing them as I do not like wasting my time on terrible ones. This movie did not seem to have outstanding reviews or anything, the featured review was one star. I really felt like going to the theater and I had already seen everything there pretty much. So you can say I wasn't expecting much, even though there was a lot of hype for this movie.The main complaint behind this movie is that it is PG-13, which means it has minimal blood/gore. What this movie lacks in that aspect it makes up for it in thrill. You feel like you are on the edge of your seat the entire movie. There are also many scenes that will make you jump, the movement of the zombies is also quite frightening.The movie wasn't too predictable and this is one of my complaints about most movies, typically natural disaster movies where no matter what at the end of the movie, it's "happily ever after". Up until the end you didn't know what was going to happen, although a few hints were dropped into the movie at previous points. In general most people might be turned off by a few things they see before they see the movie, but it genuinely is worth seeing, it's not your run of the mill zombie movie, it's actually quite thrilling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I've seen it today in 3D. First of all, I actually didn't mind 3D, although normally I hate it. I guess it's because the movie was obviously made in 2D, so the 3D effects that were added later on didn't really rape my eyes. And there are several of scenes in which 3D really gives you a sense of depth and scale.Oh, I also read both books and knew beforehand that the movie doesn't really follow the storyline.To sum it up: it's a really nice zombie flick.Perhaps a bit too nice, since the aimed PG13 rating hides away something that is a staple of all zombie movies: gore. If you're a gore fan, there's NONE here. I mean zero. This movie is gore-free. Gore is implied, it's part of the storyline, but you don't actually get to see it. Kinda like soft porn.The story follows Gerry Lane, an ex UN investigator who finds himself and his family engulfed in the developing world wide pandemic. The story quickly jumps from a nice family setting into running for their lives and we get a glimpse of how fast this thing is spreading, of the panic that ensues, the collapse of the modern society etc.Gerry's skills as a UN investigator are his get-out-of-jail card, since he is rescued by remaining military forces and sent off with a SEAL team to figure out the source of the infection in order to procure a vaccine.From there on, we follow Gerry around the world and learn little bits of information that help us paint the global disaster that seems to be getting worse by the minute.The action is non-stop. There's really no slow parts, it's a jump from one action packed scene to another and just as we barely catch a breath, the zeeks start pouring over walls, ever eager to take a bite at the closest human.CGI scenes are epic. There's no better way to describe it. We have never seen zombies like this, literally huge pouring masses of them, rolling through cities like an unstoppable river of hungry undead. This is a great concept and it's kind of a shame they showed some of those scenes in the trailer. Still, seeing them again is breathtaking.The ride is really full of thrills, and while some of the plot devices seem too simple, it's easy to understand how hard it is to film a global story like this and still keep it in focus. There's not much time for character development, so except our hero and his family, we don't really get to know much about others. Which is actually also kind of understandable, because, as anyone who's ever been in a war, you basically don't have time to care that much about others. You're looking out for yourself and your closest family. Brad Pitt offers a good performance, as well as the supporting cast.The bad things about WWZ... Well, there are several. First of all, I can't say the screenwriters managed to paint the global picture as much as I'd hoped for. I know it's very hard thing to do, but still. The climax is basically an anti-climax. It's a quiet ending that more then obviously states it's intention to reveal more in the possible sequel.It basically tells us that this is just the begging, it even takes a couple of clear hints from the books, which leads me to believe that if they ever make a sequel, it will follow the books more closely. And I hope they will.The lack of gore is disappointing. We live in a time when there's a split zombie head every week on The Walking Dead. I expected more. Also, I'm not too keen on the concept of super-fast, super-strong zombies. Aforementioned The Walking Dead proved that you can do very impressive stuff even with walkers.The thing that strikes me the most is the fact that in terms of revelations, everything is really, really toned down. There's no epochal findings, there's no grand discoveries, or gotcha scenes, it all sort of happens... Well, like in real life, I suppose. And this is something that is also the underline of the book. While it offers much more details and stories from around the world, it deals with the subject at hand in a basic "trying to survive" way.So, in the end, the 116 minutes went by very quickly. I was definitively entertained, scared and left wanting for more in the end. With all that said, I would recommend you do go and see the movie.</fullReview>

There is no explanation of why? There is no explanation of how to solve the problem? The ending left the viewer empty. The movie could be gearing up for part 2. Brad Pitt does another outstanding role. He seems to have left his outrageous weird roles like fight club, and True Romance. His new genre seems to be action, family and playing the hero. I give World War Z a seven out 10.</fullReview>

I personally love zombie flicks, even the direct to video lot. Movies where the viewer can't even begin to imagine the horror lend an excitement that's only available in modern zombie horror, in my humble opinion. World War Z also has it's share of predictable moments, but without giving anything away, you will still enjoy the film.

		<shortDescription>Pitt "Acting" On Very Bad Advice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking at World War Z (which ultimately this review will urge you NOT to do) you have to wonder if Brad Pitt was the recipient of a lot of really bad advice? First, and perhaps most astonishing, this is his baby. He is listed as producer. Maybe the advice went something like, "Brad sweetie, Do what Tom Cruise did. Don?t wait til Hollywood remembers you and sends you a good script. Get your own script and run the production yourself. Like Tom did with "Jack Reacher." Good advice on the surface, until you realize that Cruise not only purchased the rights to the Reacher series ("the" top selling action fiction today) but decided to cast himself in the lead -- even though the physical dimensions of Reacher, as written by the series' author, Lee Child, compared to Cruise himself, bring to mind the finale in JACK THE GIANT SLAYER.The advice-giver also forgot to mention to Brad that JACK REACHER was a box office flop. Oops.We can also imagine that the very same advice-giver might have mentioned that, late in his career, Paul Newman used to play against type ("his" type, defined in dozens of films) and did so successfully. Here in World War Z Pitt also plays against type, and does so to a fault -- many critics have lamented that, if you didn't see the Pitt name on the credits, you would have no idea you were watching a mega-star.Oops again.One good thing about film (aside from the fact that watching it is fully optional, no one is going to FORCE you to see it) is that the first 20 minutes probably set a record for non-stop action. Not sure this is a good thing? Several times I actually WANTED THE ACTION TO STOP so I could figure out what I was seeing, but that clearly was not the intention of the director.The ending is odd, and discussed elsewhere. Google it.All in all, the perfect film to see if the day ever comes when zombies are actually taking over the world, the gas stations are out, the ATMS are broken, and you only have 2 hours left to live anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweepingly epic but a little too late.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mysterious virus like infection spreads rapidly throughout the world and a man in order to guarantee his family safety is tasked to locate the origin of the outbreak and assist in finding a cure.Without drawing comparison to Max Brooks' novel, World War Z's impact has been slightly numbed but the influx and saturation of zombie/virus films churned out over recent years. Nevertheless, under Marc Forster's direction WWZ is epic in scale with its sweeping scope and impressive special effects. Forster wisely focuses on Brad Pitt who is superb as ex UN official and family man Gerry Lane. Although the film may have benefited from an unknown actor for impact to Pitts credit he adds gravitas to the role as he journeys from one continent to another encountering perils and avoiding hordes of the twitching contaminated. The supporting cast give a solid backbone although no one stands out as being particularly memorable.The reanimated are wonderfully well done, menacing and for the most part scary - especially in numbers. The limited makeup design on show is excellently crafted, although there's explosions, fire fights the gore is limited and the film is not necessarily blatantly horrific as one would expect - this works both for and against depending on your expectations. That said, there's enough action and tension to keep the causal viewer happy. For the harden zombie fans there's atmosphere, finely executed visuals, memorably the immense birds eye views of the swarming population like ants and a calibre of realism not found in the majority of films this genre.With a genuine on location feel and despite being reminiscent of 28 Days/Weeks later with fast infected Forster delivers a globe trotting disaster flick with less deliberate rough edges. The communication between the infected is interesting, including their dormant state. What also works at times is an old school horror approach, there's lots of moments where the sound design leaves it to the viewers imagination. Notably though the editing and screenplay does pander to the masses, offering paint by numbers solutions and outcomes. For example the Israel segment (filmed in Malta) takes a little too long for Gerry to hone in on the noise leaving the viewer too much time to digest and anticipate what's going to happen next which robs the scene of much of its intended impact and tension. Nevertheless, the Moscow heroic like ending was infamously re-shot for a more quieter, personal closing and Gerry wife's fidelity left intact, which in my mind works better, more true to Gerry's every man personality and the set up that came before.All in all the apocalyptic vision is a solid, realistic and heartfelt entry if somewhat too late (in a saturated genre) to achieve greatness. Let's hope for a sequel that surpasses this with Pitt on board again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Big Disappointment for Zombie Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really thought it was a bad movie. And I love zombie movies.There was no character development or meaning at all. I found myself not really caring about anyone. We didn't even know his kids' names. The introduction&#xfeff; lasted 20 seconds, and the outbreak went from 0 infected to everyone infected in about 10 seconds. It didn't set anything up, just gave you something right off the bat, and I found myself bored and confused very fast because of it.All the scenes were the same. Go in, get overrun. Get out. There were no plot holes. The whole plot was a hole by itself. Seaming without any depth at all.The plane crash scene was by far the worst. Somehow every single person dies except for the two main characters. That makes total sense. NOT. Really, how did they actually think that this seems legit. Then he get's a huge piece of shrapnell stabbed THROUGH him. In one side and out the other. Sure he goes unconscious for 3 days, but after that, no rest, just up and fighting again no problem.There was never a survival aspect in this movie. It was purely empty action with no meaning. And the ending was not only that, but very inconclusive and rushed.I've always hated super zombies on cocaine in anything, but this was just insane. Leave the hyper speed walkers to Left for Dead at least. Also,&#xfeff; why didn't the zombies eat people? They would just bite someone and then spaz over them. We never saw a zombie kill or zombie death. I understand they are trying to keep the PG-13 rating, but was it worth losing all place as a zombie movie? The CGI zombies sucked to. The points when they bit people just looked wrong. They may think t is new technology, but I still think extras in zombie makeup looks much more realistic, except for mass shots.Overall, as a zombie fan, I was really disappointed by it. And I wasn't alone. About half of the theatre was laughing as we left the cinema. Not cheering or chatting. Laughing. It was like an 80s horror movie. The directing and producing was just so off it was funny.I tried to like it, but I couldn't. It was a big let down. I'm sad it wasn't better. I gotta give it a 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good zombie film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this film.It was the perfect mix of intimate intensity, emotion and absolute, terrifying spectacle.Directed by Marc Forster (Quantum of Solace, Monster's Ball), and starring Brad Pitt, the film deals with a zombie outbreak on a global scale and the attempts to find the source and cure.Certainly, the film is barely ten minutes young when it all kicks off. We're quickly introduced to Gerry Lane (Pitt), his wife (Mireille Enos) and their children and then the outbreak begins. Certainly the difference between this film and almost any other zombie film preceding it is scale. It is a LARGE scale film, the CGI is used incredibly effectively for portraying thousands of zombies at a time.It is this that creates the intensity. The sheer numbers and volume of the zombies overwhelm and the film certainly has fun with the large scale scenes and the behaviour of these creatures. There are a few times where the sheer scale of the events on the screen is awesome in the very literal sense of the word, you are in awe. This scale is impressive on a technical level but it's even more impressive that Marc Forster, Brad Pitt and scriptwriters (initially J. Michael Straczynski, then later Matthew Michael Carnahan, Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof for re-writes) manage to find the human story and relationships amid all the mayhem. Certainly the supporting cast provide compelling roles, special mention must be made to Daniella Kertesz as an Israeli soldier.The humanity of the story helps to fuel the tension for the other kind of 'zombie' scenes, which are the quieter, scarier type of scenes which don't feature as many zombies. Is it here that the pacing (and scale) are dimmed down hugely. The film doesn't stop to a halt, but the tone of the third half of the film is certainly slower than the rest of the film. Apparently, it was here that the rewrites and re-shooting had their main impact on the film. It's a noticeable shift in the overall tone of the film which actually is quite welcome for one main reason.There is no way they could have gone bigger than scenes earlier in the film. They don't try to outdo the earlier scenes in scale or number of zombies present, instead, it shifts the tension much more to the characters and I found it works. I could imagine that people could have disappointed with the lack of 'bang' at the end of the film but for me, it worked. The film has a few really nice touches in there as well, nice actions the characters take that seem very honest and real as well as you hear about some countries reactions to the outbreak which make sense.Now, it is most certainly true to say that the film differs from the book. That is a fact. The book deals with World War Z as a series of interviews from people important to the event itself, separate narratives and so on. The film has a single narrative path, beginning, middle, end, and only really following Gerry Lane throughout the events. However, I found the film to be a superior zombie film as well as a stunning (and intense) action picture.The point was also made afterwards that whilst it has scary moments and is very intense, it is light on actual gore. Certainly the usual zombie cliché of some guy graphically getting eaten alive is not present. The film certainly isn't a 15 for explicit violence but the general tone of the film is not only intense, but pretty bleak too(I don't often mention the film's rating in my reviews btw).Anyway, really enjoyed the film. Would easily watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different take on the Zombie genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. I have also read the book by Max Brooks and from the start of production there was never going to much in the movie that was in the book.The movie starts off with a nice family morning that soon turns into a desperate escape from the city as masses of unknown people/infected/zombies are running around biting every human they come across.The lead character(Pitt) used to be a UN expert into contagious diseases and such. He contacts his old boss to find out what is going on. As seen in the trailer Gerry (Pitt) and his family get airlifted to a ship were Gerry is told, "If you cannot help us then you and your family will be taken off the ship and have to fend for yourselves."Gerry and a few others are then sent around the world to try and piece together the clues 'mother nature leaves behind' to try and find the source of the initial outbreak. This was a bit confusing as he traveled to the Sub-Continent, Middle East and Europe in very quick succession and in the movie it seemed this was done overnight.The zombies in this movie move very very fast. Not like the Romero like zombies portrayed in the book. I did not have a problem with this as I think it makes more sense having fast zombies take over the planet than slow shambling ones.Gerry survives the zombie infestation on the plane and gets to the disease control centre in Wales and once there has a whole lot of zombies to dodge. This is where you really get a close look at the twitching,gnashing zombies.I wont give anything of the ending away except the movie is looking like it may well be a trilogy if they ever want go into detail on how people survived the "Great Panic." (which would be awesome)All in all, I thought it was a good movie! There isn't much blood and gore as these things seem to happen just off screen. It is a June/July blockbuster that the family can enjoy as long as you don't have 5 year olds.I gave the movie 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WORLD WAR Z (2013) ** Brad Pitt, Mireille Enos, Daniella Kertesz, James Badge Dale, Ludi Boeken, Matthew Fox, Fana Mokoena, David Morse, Elyes Gabel, Peter Capaldi, Pierfrancesco Favino, Ruth Negga, Moritz Bleibtreu. Disappointing zombie apocalypse thriller with former UN op Pitt (one-note Johnny in this!) enlisted into the fold to stop the pandemic overtake of a viral infection unleashing hordes of the undead on the global populace. While loosely based on the novel by Max Brooks, the pedestrian screenplay by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Drew Goddard, Damon Lindelof and J. Michael Straczynski is hindered severely in the simple fact that there is practically no real violence, some truly retarded moments of incoherency (um, not shutting your phone off while surveying a zombie-heavy environ.at.night.in.the.pouring.rain!)nor up-and-close encounters until its predictable final act and by then Marc Forster's all- thumbs direction (a truly poor choice for this sort of film) proves you can screw up a genre flick real good. Rent any Romero flick or watch any season of The Walking Dead for visceral (and really well written dialogue) instead; pitiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like zombie movies, don't bother with this movie! It has nothing in common with zombie movies except that it happens that when the virus kills humans they start spreading the virus by biting.So, for an avid zombie lover, the movie is an absolute disappointment. I hate zombie movies. In fact, I didn't want to go just because I was told it was a zombie movie. But I was seriously bored and I thought "Come on, cut Brad some slack. The guy is very careful with his choices". So I went mainly or the pop corn, but I was blown away by the movie.Incredible camera work! Solid script. As usual with Hollywood for the past decade or more, scripts are not as good as used to be so I gave this one 8 out ten, missing two points as the some tiny bits in the script could have been better. But, I am definitely buying the DVD.I absolutely recommend it (unless you wanna go for some zombie action). I loved every minute of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film lacks Guts, 28 weeks later for Wimps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to bore you with another version of the plot, it's unnecessary. I'll just get right into the main problems with this film.For something that was supposed to be such an EPIC event, a lot of the film had no scale and little tension. You do not see any real fighting on the ground between the military and the zombies. Because you never see the HORROR on the ground, you have zero reaction when someone says "well, we lost that city because as you can see, it's on fire." It had no gore, no human suffering, no first person human defeat and so no feeling of DOOM or panic or hopelessness. It had no feeling at all.It's hard to have any feeling when the zombies are mostly CGI which usually attack by JUMPING on people with these Super-Leaps. It reminded me of "I am Legend" another film that was hard to get into because the cheesy CGI vampires. But, at least that film had some touching scenes in it like Will Smith having to kill his dog. Not here.Most of the enemy in this film is a guy using Photoshop and Brad Pitt looks just about as lifeless through the film.Most of the film revolves around Brad Pitt's character who literally wanders from place to place with almost no point. Well, other than the point that everywhere he turns up something bad happens. He must be bad luck.To have a film with this big of a budget which pales to just about every other recent zombie film should tell you something. This is no Dawn of the Dead, it is 28 Weeks Later but for wimps.I heard they are planning a sequel, don't bother. You've already poisoned the well with this whip-lash, gutless production. At least half the audience you experienced this time will not be showing up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so we all know this movie was very troubled in its production and needed enormous amounts of reshoots. Unfortunately they got Damon Lindelof to rewrite the movie and needless to say its a mess. The actual " resolution" (the movie isn't resolved but the solution they find is as near as they are going to get) is utterly imbecilic. It makes no sense in any way shape or form.Not that the film doesn't have problems from the start. Mark Foster's super fast cuts and shaky cam make what could have been interesting action sequences unwatchable. Pitt is totally unconvincing as an intellectual type and he looks bored at times.No cliché is left unused, there is no blood. Its a Disney zombie movie.I'm not a gorehound but you'd expect some.The characters take turns in behaving stupidly. Its not involving 75% of the time and there are "what the heck" moments of idiocy so regularly that they took me out of the movie.</fullReview>

They must have simply liked the title and gone from there. How they ever got Max Brooks to sign off on this project is beyond me. I won't detail any scenes from the movie since I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but Pitt's character was shallow and unbelievable, and the only good filmography were the zombies. How this possibly came from the director of Monster's Ball, I have no idea - unless he abdicated directing to M. Night Shyamalan.

		<shortDescription>The EOW genre is constantly evolving ? there is no reason why this film should be limited in terms of narrative scope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>tl;dr - Set aside expectations related to the zombie genre and enjoy World War Z as a disaster popcorn flick.**********Max Brook's muscular, world weary "oral history of the zombie war", a thinly veiled geo-political mouthpiece on the world at large seen through the eyes of an agent working for the UN, has taken shape and form through a movie of the same name ? World War Z. But make no mistake about both being made from the same mold.Rather than pander to the novel's ambitious fictional output of global perspectives (survivors from virtually every continent on Earth were interviewed by the novel's narrator) ? this summer flick directed by Marc Forster (Quantum of Solace, Finding Neverland, Stranger than Fiction) is sensibly scaled down on politicking and military machismo. With a tried and tested sci-fi disaster formula, the result works fairly well on its own terms. Vastly different from Brook's scathing, testosterone driven bestseller and the archetypal zombie gore fest; this latest End-of-World extravaganza is less tired and less verbose. By virtue of that, translates to a much more engaging experience.********** Brief Synopsis: After decades of living in risky, high-stakes existence as a UN investigator; Gerry Lane (Pitt) is now comfortably retired to a cozy, domestic life in Philadelphia with loving wife, Karen (Mireille Enos) and two young daughters. Problem is that a mysterious virus has spiraled out of control and gone global, resulting in a win-win proposition from former colleague Thierry -- the state guarantees refuge and protection for Gerry's family in exchange for his unrivaled field expertise. Thus we are immediately whisked to the main exposition -- Gerry, accompanied by the Navy SEAL and a virologist (developing the vaccine) traverses international borders in search of patient zero -- the journey spans South Korea and Israel, to the WHO in Wales and eventually Canada. Trivia: The novel places origin of the zombie outbreak in Dachang, Hebei. Incidentally, the film hypothesizes with narratives about the spread of SARS as a deadly epidemic. It can therefore be understood, that the virus in WWZ is implied to have begun in Northern China.**********It is no controversy that World War Z is plagued with production troubles and the screenplay has undergone a few re-writes, but manifestations of this in film authorship isn't grave or jarring. To the contrary; Forster's version has softened Brook's high-minded hyperbole in exchange for a modest, grounded and back-to-basics approach ? this makes for undeniable commercial appeal.Visually, after a cumbersome and erratically edited zombie rampage sequence in the first act, DP Ben Seresin (Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen) and special effects rebound with impressive large scale photography. The outbreak of zombie hordes in Jerusalem's disaster sequence deserve mention ? it is here that the narrative's kinesthetic urgency receives a healthy dose of adrenaline. Action aficionados will be pleased. Seresin's chaotic apocalypse overrun by waves of running undeads is also given counterweight by a quiet, noble dimension found in Gerry's measured and cool-in-crisis stoicity. Brad Pitt's iconic persona as a humanitarian in real life, may very well have influenced his portrayal of Gerry, infusing the kind of personality and screen image that transforms naturally in a Hollywood film.But the cleverest stroke in characterization, is that of Israeli soldier Segen (Daniella Kertesz). A sound approach in keeping characters fresh and creative is that material be produced with caveats in mind. Flat, boilerplate stereotypes of women being one example of many. For this reason, I was surprised to discover that much of the film's feistier, more relevant survivalist moments originate from her flair for timing and intuition.All being said, preconceived notions about what zombie films should and ought to be have divided zombie lovers into two main groups. Fans of Romero's classics may prefer depictions of slow-moving zombies (Night of the Living Dead, The Walking Dead), while others embrace the idea of super sprinters (28 Days Later, 2004 Dawn of the Dead). The good news is that this debate, when filtered through the lens of a global disaster flick, becomes irrelevant (or less so). I guess my point is the EOW genre is constantly evolving, there is no reason why this film should be limited in terms of narrative scope. The only real complaint is an excessively dramatized, prolonged exchange between an infected doctor and Gerry in the film's final act. You get less awkward, more authentic moments between Rick Grimes and the bicycle zombie girl back in Atlanta. But that's another apocalypse.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plausbile Modern Entertaining Zombie Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film but after reading the book I think they could have done more. Man meddling with genetics etc leads to a new virus that turns those infected into 'zombies'. . Once infected the change takes as little as 12 seconds before victim becomes manic ravenous zombie trying to infect others. What I liked was how plausible it was, OK if you accept the premise of 'zombies' could exist. But the rate and speed of infection was very plausible and those infected don't stagger about they sprint. So a city could be infected within an hour.Brad Pitt as former UN investigator, is coerced to go off in search of the initial strain/host of the virus. If he refused, his family will be removed from safety of an aircraft carrier to land based refugee centre.So Pitt sets off with small SEAL team to find origin, goes to Korea then on to Israel where Israelis had finished a wall surrounding country just a week before outbreak. Finally ends up in Wales in a partially infected Laboratory complex. He realises from what he has seen on his travels, that the weakness of the Virus is the zombies won't touch the seriously/terminally ill. Hey presto they manufacture a serum that makes healthy humans appear sick to zombies who then ignore them. Mankind has a breathing space. A very entertaining film but after reading the book I think they could have shown much more. In the book : The pitched battles where modern technology weapons are little use against millions of zombies. How man hid behind natural defences mountain chains etc to attempt to regroup and develop new weapons/tactics . During winter the zombies freeze so get chance to regroup before the thawWhere small groups held castles (or places with big defensive walls) and were supplied by air. The book has little similarity to the film but many interesting aspects from the book could have been incorporated rather than concentrating on Pitt going off in what is obviously a pointless search for the 'host' amongst the mayhem and collapse of civilisation. Good film 8/10 but I think it missed an opportunity to use more from the book to show mankinds 'fight' and adapting to this foe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was watching this, I wouldn't deny, I had felt the suspense. But it was a bit repetitive. Every time they would sneak, someone makes a noise. Literally Every time. So when they are sneaking, I am thinking in my head, there it goes. Someone will be dumb enough to make a noise now. From the Airplane (the bag) to WHO (the sudden noise by crowbar). Zombies didn't really care for the helicopter's noise the whole time? What about the buses which came in? But just when someone started singing, suddenly zombies would be like. OH LOOK! SOUND! I might be wrong about this, but the female from Army, had a different accent earlier on, and suddenly it changed? Plane's curtains stopped all the sound of hundreds of zombies chomping together until our hero arrived. The little dude who saved our hero's life. His parents died however neither did he feel anything for them nor did he face any zombies while coming towards the terrace. If certain viruses caused this. There should have been numerous patients from tons of hospitals who should have been just fine. And until our hero ( who seems to be terrible with combat) figured it out. No one ever found out the same? The movie was decent. But, when it tires to show all that LAST MINUTE SAVE such as crowbar incident where our hero took out the crowbar from the zombie's head JUST when another one reached him. Makes it look too unrealistic. There wasn't much of a character growth either. Lastly, as much as I liked the final part, the opening of cola can and drinking like a boss scene made the movie look more of a Parody than a serious movie. But all in all it is a decent watch. And it did make me want to follow The walking dead again.. SO yeah..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! What a terrible movie! It had a poor script, poor direction and poor "horror". And no sense of humor! That makes it worse. First of all, the plot. It is atrocious in plotting, at the beginning of the movie we see a happy family, everything seems to be fine and it is a normal day then suddenly a truck literally appears out of nowhere and runs over a cop! What just happened to all the cars that was behind the family? From there it gets worse and they are running away and it took no time at all before zombies were appearing out of nowhere. Suddenly there are car crashes and people dying within less than a minute. The shallow characters are of no help, the kids shift between being indifferent to being suddenly hysterical all the time, the father has the same logic as a retard and the mother is solely there to scream. For example when the father was in the lab he was constantly looking at the camera, as if he would get any sort of reaction from it. "If I look into the camera and point at stuff, I will magically find out what to do". That is f*** logic at its best. Or maybe at its worst? Speaking of f*** logic, how about it takes a couple of minutes to refuel a big cargo plane? Then fly longer than what is possible for a plane of that type on one tank? If traveling was that easy it would have been wonderful.How about when the zombies crawled over the wall? It is like they hear some women singing, then suddenly they have the urge to crawl over the wall whilst at the same time defy gravity? How about the fact they can run too? Science dictates dead bodies can not run because their meat is rotting and their bones are brittle. Yes, yes this is not supposed to be real but at least it could have had some sense of humor. But it didn't. It was dead serious. Oh, the guy pulling out his teeth? That one is just pure stupid... Now how can this terrible movie maintain a 7.0 rating? Well, it needs an audience more brain dead than zombies...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The worst sin in movie making is to not understand your audience; and OMG, this movie has that in spades. We watch action movies for two reasons --- thrills and to see heroism, competence, and the best of humanity. But this movie offers few thrills, and nothing of the best of humanity. The supposed hero cares more about his family than about the rest of humanity, and such successes as he achieves are purely the result of luck, because it's not like he's actually especially good at anything, whether it's fighting, small-scale tactics, or large-scale planning. On the other hand, his wife is every bit as short-sighted and selfish as him, so perhaps that's his concern, that with her gone he'd never find a replacement willing to put up with him and his colossal selfishness and short- sightedness?I don't ask for every one of my action heroes to be supermen, possessors of a "very special set of skills", or suchlike. But I do expect them to have enough common sense to understand concepts like "if the entire human race is destroyed, that INCLUDES my family, so maybe I should forget about them for a few days and actually SOLVE the damn problem we're facing?"Think of the lousiest action movie you've ever seen (I'd suggest the Transformers franchise as an example). Awful as these movies are, from the utter lack of logic throughout them, to the wanton destruction, at least they have the redeeming feature of considering something (humanity or the nation) as more important than one single human being. But then every so often some lunatic at Hollywood decides it would be a good idea to create a "family-friendly" action movie of the form "everyman and his lame-ass family get caught in some huge event; everyman shows what a stellar human being he is by being willing to kill or abandon every other human on earth to save his three family members; and we're suppose to cheer for him".This is what counts as a family-friendly message --- no-one on earth matters except you and your immediate family! If you have the slightest hint of ethics in your body, you'll avoid these sorts of movies and prevent anyone you know from seeing them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitt races to find a way of saving humanity from zombie hordes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When an infection sweeps the world turning ever increasing numbers into mindless zombies, former UN investigator Gerry Lane's first priority is to get his wife and daughters to safety. When his former boss calls he realises that the only way to guarantee their immediate safety is to return to his old job as is promised that his family will be kept safe on a ship far from danger. After a struggle against the zombies they get to a helicopter and fly to the ship. Once there Gerry learns that the disease came to the United States from a base in South Korea. He flies there with a disease expert hoping to find the first case. Once there things don't go well; the doctor is killed and it becomes apparent that there is no way of finding the first case. He does however hear that Israel has managed to stay disease free as they built a massive wall shortly before the zombie pandemic swept the world. Gerry gets back in the plane and continues to Jerusalem? only to find its defences are breached shortly after he arrives. He does however notice that the zombies ignore a handful of people; this leads him to come up with a plan to save humanity; it won't be easy though and if he isn't careful his cure could be just as fatal.People expecting a full on horror movie may be disappointed as it lacks the gore most zombie movies feature; it does however manage to keep tension high from the opening scenes to the films conclusion. The fast moving hordes of zombies are pretty scary as they flood through the streets like a pyroclastic flow. The story is a bit episodic as Gerry moves from Philadelphia to New Jersey to the ship to South Korea to Israel and finally to Wales but that isn't a problem; each location presents different problems for him to overcome. There are some moments that are a little bit too unlikely, even in the context of a zombie apocalypse, most notably when Gerry and a young soldier he saved in Israel are the sole survivors of a plane crash! The cast does a solid enough job; Brad Pitt in particular in the role of Gerry Lane. The film's end is merely the 'beginning of the end' and a sequel is inevitably in production. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody wanting an intense but not particularly gory time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may very well be my favourite zombie movie.The story starts pretty much straight away, doesn't waste too much time trying to explain how and why and by the end of the movie, isn't entirely wrapped up in a pretty bow.Brad Pitt is obviously the main lead in this film and a major Hollywood actor but I didn't feel like that was thrown in our face with close-ups and flashy scenes.Aside from Brad Pitt, James Badge Dale (Iron Man 3), Peter Capaldi (Doctor Who), Ruth Negga (Raina from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D) and Mireille Enos (The Killing) round out a good cast.The two kids annoyed the crap out of me, always yelling and running away and thankfully they weren't in the movie a lot.I really liked that the zombies looked more like human than decayed brain dead meat sacks. These zombies could also run and get in things (cars and doors) instead of being slow and useless.I watched this movie with my Mum and when it got to the part of the movie where they discover that people with life-threatening illnesses are of no interest to the zombies, who only want healthy hosts, Mum turned to me and said"I wonder if MS (Multiple Sclerosis) is enough to save me. You're dead but I could survive."My Mother, ladies and gentlemen! Feelin' the love!An awesome movie that's worth repeat viewing and even owning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must watch on the big screen but strictly a one time watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Delivers exactly what the trailer promises, nothing less and sadly nothing more. At a time when there are a cluster of zombie movies with varying sub-genres, what makes this one unique is its treatment of the zombies as fast, aggressive and restless beings which are in your face whenever they are on screen. Boasting top notch special effects and massive action set pieces that sprawls the length and breadth of the globe, it is one heck of a thrill ride from start to finish. Having said that, it does have its share of misgivings - apart from Brad Pitt playing the central character with required intensity and vulnerability, rest of the characters as well as the depth of the plot leaves a lot to be desired.Gerry (Brad Pitt), an ex-United Nations staffer known for his thorough investigations is caught in the middle of a plague that breaks out worldwide which turns most of the humans into beasts. In an obligation to save his family comprising his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and 2 daughters, he joins the UN for a mission to identify the source of the plague. The clues and leads takes him on a journey across the world including Isreal, Europe etc, brushing past multiple close encounters. Can he find the cause, the cure and save his family in the process is what comprises the rest of the story.Though the movie leaves you gasping with terror and thrill through its superlative special effects, the emotional connect and the human element of the story hardly scrapes its potential. The point that the Zombies they are fighting were actually human beings like them before is hardly realized. For e.g., consider the Spanish couple who turn zombies before their son and tries to attack him. Mireille Enos neither brings enough depth required for the situation her character has been put in nor serves as the eye candy for a shallow viewing. The writers and the director didn't seem to have made up their mind on where to take this incredible journey they have started so competently and sadly left it with their brilliant special effects and action choreography team to fill in for their shortcomings. The background score is apt and does not waver too far from the glimpse shown in the trailer. The zombie make up is on par but doesn't break any new ground especially when TV shows like 'The Walking Dead' is doing such a brilliant job. The climax was not satisfactory enough for me though I generally don't mind the meta finishes.A must watch on the big screen but strictly a one time watch.</fullReview>

I have to tell you this, this is one of the worst movies that Brad Pitt has ever been dragged in.Thank the Lord I didn't watch the whole movie because I would be bored out of tears and seriously be going crazy. It would do your head in! Yknow nowadays with CGI, it doesn't always work out in some movies especially ones that involve with Zombies! I would rather watch Michael Jackson's music video of "Thriller" then looking at this!I don't understand why it has a IMDb rating of 7.1 and a 63 metascore. It really didn't deserve it, it needs to be rethought again because realistically, I would be expecting bad reviews or a bad metascore from critics.....p</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was good, not quite what I was expecting though in terms of a horror movie and pretty much ignoring the (documentary-style) book its based on. Its a big budget action thriller and on that note the action/zombie apocalypse happens almost immediately (5 minutes into film) so that you don't get a chance to know the characters before the sh!t hits the fan.Who is this dad Brad Pitt? Why are he (and his wife for that matter) so calm and excepting of the mayhem taking place around them? They just take it in stride, gather some supplies, a weapon and carry on.Eventually this does (sort of) get explained, Pitt is a former UN worker who must come back for that dreaded "one last job" in order to keep his family safe aboard an aircraft carrier while he races against time to save humanity from a pandemic that has triggered a global war between mankind and the undead.I'm not a fan of the fast moving zombie but it works here as this is more of a pandemic movie than a zombie movie. I really liked the section in Israel, exciting, unique and well done with the zombies all piling on top of each other to climb a huge wall, swarming like the ants shown in the random opening images. I also enjoyed the plane crash and the section at the WHO lab in Cardiff with Mr.snappy teeth zombie.This is definitely more a pandemic movie than a true zombie movie and there's very little gore shown, mostly just CGI special effects. I also wouldn't call this a horror movie, its not so scary. I think I might like this more in a rewatch when I'm not expecting Walking Dead-esque events. 3/13/16</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Genre Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure what baggage I was supposed to bring to my viewing of World War Z, but I guess it got left behind, because I couldn't see much wrong with the film. It's an above-average entry in the zombie genre, and sufficiently well made to amuse casual viewers as well.World War Z reminded me of several other films I've greatly enjoyed. It has the fast zombies and epidemiological viewpoint of 28 Days Later. It has the exciting round-the-world quest of Roland Emmerich's 2012. And it even borrows a bit from the cult favorite Plane Dead. The action sequences are spectacular, the acting is solid, and the whole package is very satisfying.It's true, there are a few obvious lapses in logic, but nothing that shouldn't be forgivable in a genre film like this. An early example: if the plague takes 12 seconds to convert a living human into a zombie (a novel idea, in itself), how could it be spread by air travellers? Everyone on board a plane ought to be dead before the doors are sealed. But the general sense of the film is good. All you need to know is it's a contagion, and we need to fight it using medical science, as opposed to, say, wooden stakes and garlic.World War Z won't be mistaken for a work of genius, but it is a lot of fun. Break out the popcorn, and don't let nit-picking reviews put you off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I don't want to be the person who's "of all flavors you chose to be salty" but I have to. To start off, I'm watching this movie 2 years later to kinda dodge a lot of opinions and discussions around me, but I got some positive influence back in 2013 so I was hoping to see something 'different' in a good way. As usual with zombie apocalypse theme, you have the unknown virus which spreads in minutes or maybe more like seconds, I guess you can't avoid as it is a cause. After that you have the main protagonist who goes out there to fight for his family and humanity. OK, you have stereotypical zombie movie just based on book (which I haven't read, sorry), it's not that bad, but to make things bad mr. action and special effects crash the party, thanks guys you really liven things up. Even if you don't want to see it literally that none of this fiction of zombies running fast and climbing a huge wall is possible, maybe it's just me but my cynical mind just turns on and see this movie as another good way to get big money by buying the audience with cheap tricks... Even cock magic is better than this (good job Randy Marsh you pulled that off). I stopped watching movies a few years ago, because I realized that the whole film industry became a competition about money and surprising viewers with some bullshit (sorry for such a rogue word) I don't see real acting anymore, I mean genuine where actor/actress is making a huge effort to convince the audience. If someone read this through, thanks for your attention and that you spared a minute to listen to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that the team will be able to feel and recognize the essence of this great work and offer us a different, but yet equally exciting and frightening story. In this segment, the story of the movie is very predictable. We know already exactly in advance that wherever Pitt lands there will be in a few seconds' a thousand billion zombies and explosions. What I found unbelievable in the film is that Forster decided to take out a few key moments. I recommend "World War Z" to all those who have not read the novel, and to the book lovers I suggest that they should skip the movie. Even Though, this is an exciting and dynamic movie and actually has several moments that raise a lot of adrenaline in the blood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pandemic film features the latest in zombie evolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombies have shown remarkable evolution since the 1940's, when they had to be dead, buried and then summoned by a voodoo priest. In the 1970's they evolved the bite, a faster way to spread whatever it is that makes the victims turn to zombies as well. By 2000's zombies were getting faster than they used to be. And in World War Z, dead zombies easily outrun most people who are alive, underlining the inherent absurdity of the living dead concept. Many reviewers here were disappointed, because they expected to see "real zombies" and what they saw was the wrong kind. I really don't know what to say to that kind of logic or lack of one. But what I saw was a pandemic film with humans acting as zombie-like delivery systems for the unknown pathogen. The concept is familiar from 28 Days. In Z, the creatures do not bother to actually die, turning from healthy humans to zombies instantly. World War Z turns out to be a pandemic action film seen from the viewpoint of one individual who never hesitates and never gives up. Brad Pitt just keeps on going, just like his adversaries the zombies do. As an actor he pulls it off well. I really felt for his character, going from one losing situation to the next, although many obviously did not. The single hero viewpoint chosen means that the film has little to do with the novel of the same name. If you want the book, go ahead and read it. One has to accept some plot holes in a fantasy film of this kind to keep the action and suspense going. For me, the combination in this respect was just right. The solution in the end is believable in the framework of the film, based on the supposition that it is the pathogen that controls the zombie and uses it's senses. It took me by surprise however. This is an industrial film and as such uses a lot of safe and proved solutions but there are enough new twists to warrant seven stars. Lack of gore was for me a definitely positive factor, since in terms of the plot there was no need for any.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bit shaky but all together a satisfactory movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brad Pitt fights zombies and tries to find a cure to the widespread pandemic of the un-dead that are tearing the world apart. The movie is very fast and lots of things happen, Pitt seems to go every place there is on earth and just brings trouble wherever he steps foot, and he doesn't even kick that much ass. Now OK the movie is well OK and it goes along well, bit of a shaky start but it gets into an fairly nice flow, sometimes I didn't feel much of a connection with the characters but all in all they are fun kind of and the actors playing them do an alright job. The film suffers from an abundance of special effects and they seem weirdly outdated seeing as this is a high budget high octane thriller, you expect it to look good with the CGI.The movie is set in a whole lot of places, it feels like your typical disaster movie but of course add in the zombies and you have "The Day After Tomorrow" but instead of snow falling, it's zombies. It's as mentioned before very fast, the cameras go a little crazy with the shaky cam and some scenes with a lot going on get lost in all the movement, it feels like some kind of relief when the camera finally sits still. The movie mixes action but also a kind of emotion to not make this OTT but also not overly emotional either, it feels like action but with brains behind it.Brad Pitt produces and stars in this movie and is very acceptable in the role, sometimes the pace doesn't really work and I'm not going to sit here and say Pitt was great, but he is satisfactory in the lead role as Gerry Lane a former United Nations employee. The cast is not really an all star cast other than Pitt which is nice because you don't feel that blockbuster kind of feeling when the characters are simply talking to one another. The films pace yet again makes some actors roles very insignificant, it can feel that the people behind it don't want you to feel anything for anyone other than Pitt and some people he meets along the way. I liked Marc Forster as director but I can't say he knocked this out the park, his handle on the movie can overuse some things like effects and of course the cinematography, well I don't know if it was him or Ben Serisin who was the cinematographer for this. As the writing goes it can be good and bad in equal measures, it is exciting work in the writing for sure but it never truly lets the plot mature and I wasn't so keen on the ending, even Forster can't make the end any better. The locations are truly great and hats off to the people who found the places or built the studio sets because it at least feels real, it never looks like its fake or anything and it makes you feel like this is more real than many other zombie movies out there.I can't say I really liked the movie but I certainly didn't dislike it, for me it was alright and from what I have seen of others they mostly like it but many do not, not quite a love it or hate it kind of film but still one where moments can annoy people. A thing to add is don't watch this if you have read the book this is adapted from and expect it to be the same, try as hard as you can to watch it as a movie piece rather than comparing the two because this is completely different storytelling and to judge it on how it compares or according to some "pales" in comparison, it would be harsh on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely have we seen zombie films work in the process of the film. And rarely do PG-13 zombie films work. The audience are rarely given a chance to focus on what has just happened, or to absorb key plot points. Instead we jump from one scene to another. Coherence is lost. Impact is lost. Someone must have left scenes on the cutting room floor.In one scene, a character with key information is quickly dismissed from the film in a manner that was underwhelming and farcical. At this point I did a double take, looked around the cinema to see if anyone else was as bemused, and carried on watching. The confused frown never fully left my face. Of the few strengths in the film, one must highlight Marco Beltrami's score that bounds behind the opening credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>saving the world again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes you see a film which has great premises and it disappoints. Some other times however a film which according to the subject and taking into account previous experiences in the genre is doomed for failure succeeds to surprise in a good way. This is exactly the case with World War Z directed by Marc Forster starring The Brad Pitt.The human race is in danger and the enemy is inside. It is actually us and our neglect to the environment that causes a destructive virus to take over and spread by means of the global airlines network. In a few days or weeks, the danger cannot be hidden, as the virus turns almost on the spot human beings into zombies with enhanced powers and infinite hunger to bite and infect other human beings, and cities and countries fall one after the other into Z dementia. Only tiny Israel (one of a few movies my country comes with some kind of a positive face) succeeds to delay the fate by isolating itself and building a wall separating healthy people from the world-wide infection, but no wall is high enough to stop such an invasion (hear! hear!).The resulting film is pretty entertaining, although the story is not much different that the one told at least ten if not one hundred times. Director Marc Forster seems to try something else with each of the films he makes, and here his rehabilitation of a genre compromised by too may bad B-series movies succeeds, as he can tell a story and creates a few memorable images like the one of the hysterical zombies pyramids, beings that may have lost humanity but gained social grouping instincts, which had a 'Lord of the Rings' quality. Brad Pitt may seem to be a little bit regressing in his acting career, but as he approaches the mid-age roles time he must have felt happy to act again as the sexy savior of mankind, blessed with both muscles and brains.The word is saved again. The only bad news may be that WWZ 2 is in preparation :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember when horror movies, and zombie flicks in particular, formed an exclusive niche looked down upon ? and literally nearly spit upon ? by Hollywood? Yeah, I miss those days too? Ever since the modest British hits "28 Days Later?" and "Shaun of the Dead", zombie cinema turned into a big and profitable business. In less than a decade, we were literally overloaded with far too many uninspired zombie splatter flicks and incredibly lame zombie comedies. These days it's getting even worse, as the living dead have now also become mainstream material and we have A-list directors unleashing big-budgeted splatter flicks and former poster boy actors like Brad Pitt fanatically smashing zombies' brains! "World War Z" fundamentally isn't a bad film, of course? It benefices from its elite production values and its professional cast &amp; crew. And since zombie movies used to be intended for restricted target audiences, I can imagine that the screenplay still has quite a lot of suspense and surprises to offer to the bigger movie-going public. However, if you have been watching zombie flicks your entire life already, the script of "World War Z" has absolutely nothing original to offer and every next sequence or supposedly shocking revelation is very predictable. Horror fans will have seen it all before and numerous times, albeit realized with much smaller budgets and thus cheesier special effects? In fact, not even that, because "World War Z" evidently is a PG-13 movie and thus there isn't much carnage or bloodshed on display, and whenever Mr. Pitt crushes a zombie's face with a crowbar or something, it occurs off-screen. Every tiniest story detail about "World War Z" is either preposterous or derivative. The virus outbreak and the subsequent mayhem in the busy streets of Philadelphia, the families torn apart, the quest for the virus' origin and the so-called patient zero and even Brad Pitt's groundbreaking solution to hold off the zombies? it's all very predictable. And whenever the script isn't predictable, it's downright absurd, like for example Brad Pitt and his Jewish lady sidekick surviving a plane crash that cannot be survived. The quote in this user comment's subject line is spoken by an acclaimed virologist in the film, Dr. Fassbach, who's allegedly the savior of mankind and heads out to South Korea with a full team. He's clearly full of himself and thinks he's very intelligent, but then he trips and shoots himself through the head? That actually was the best part of the film. That, and the Israeli zombie wall?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you were to feed every post-2000 Hollywood action film into a computer and have the compiler spit out randomized script, that script would look very much like World War Z. In fact, not a single scene in WWZ gets by without borrowing from some all-too-recent-past "A-list" blow-em-up apocalyptic blockbuster. Upon its conclusion, I found myself longing to watch Ed Wood (the anti-WWZ)--a film that was blatantly constructed around one of the worst B-movies of all time, yet redeemed itself with ready doses of freshness, fun and yes-- originality. Alas movielovers, those days are long gone and the pre-fab vampiric zombie hobbits have taken control. To be fair, WWZ masks its weaknesses (read: tired constructs) well and even *transforms* them into strengths at times. It also held my attention for one hour, forty-eight minutes and thirty-nine seconds (though not a second longer). Thus, I must overlook the film's raging typhus and perhaps even call it a success (As one man said, "Filmmaking is illusionist work."). Yet the better parts of me seem to have flown around this one like a river which soon forgets anything that doesn't move along with it. 5.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My brother dragged me to see this in theaters two years ago, and I went in with pretty low expectations. I figured it would consist mostly of mindless action, which there is a fair amount of. However, there was surprisingly interesting story behind it and a less surprising horror feel to it. I've heard that it deviates from the book a lot; both the book and movie started at the same place, but then ran off in different directions. Our protagonist Gerry Lane is mostly a passive character, who is pulled by the events surrounding him more than he pulls the events. It makes him a slightly disappointing protagonist, but the essence of the film doesn't call for that kind of hero. He has a lot of presence of mind, presumably from his former military job, and we see those skills displayed in the beginning when he escapes from the first couple of zombie attacks through his resourcefulness. He has an internal goal of getting back to his family safely, but it's not terribly prominent. Pretty much every other character is minor, like Gerry's old boss, the Israeli soldier, the WHO doctors, and the people Gerry encounters in South Korea and Isreal. As a result of their small importance, none of the minor characters are developed at all, and Gerry really isn't either. But since the movie isn't about characters or arcs, this isn't much of an issue. Just be aware of that so that you aren't disappointed by false expectations.The story, as I said before was slightly impressive, and made the movie a somewhat positive experience for me. It mostly consists of Gerry learning the nature of the zombies that humanity has become. At first, he and his family don't care about what they're facing so long as they can get away. As Gerry travels to investigate the epidemic, he learns how to defend against the zombies. The information comes little by little, and by the climax at the WHO facility, he has finally found the weakness in the virus. The presentation of each little important fact was done well and did a great job showing instead of telling. The climax also capped off the story nicely, though it might disappoint action fans who are hoping for a huge climatic zombie massacre. I was disappointed that they didn't discover the origin of the virus, because it would have been interesting to see whether humanity created it like in I am Legend or if it had been an unstoppable force of nature.There's a pretty good amount of action. It's enough that people who don't want to pay attention to the story will be entertained, but the fight scenes are infrequent enough that people like me who don't like this particular genre of action aren't overly annoyed. It's more of a horror style of action that hinges more on blood and zombie makeup and stuff. The action is a little mindless, which you would expect since the antagonistic force is also mindless and each individual looks basically the same. The acting for the zombies was relatively impressive, but some might find it laughable. As for the sentient characters, the acting and scripting is better than it needed to be in this kind of setting, but naturally there aren't going to be any great performances.For zombie movie fans, I can't say whether this is one of the brighter spots of the genre. But for people who aren't zombie fans, I would recommend that you keep a somewhat open mind. I was pleasantly surprised by the overall product, and I would hope the same for anyone who ends up watching this against their will. Overall Rating: 7.3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither Scares Nor Thrills! World War Zzzzzzzzz!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lacking the chilling sense of dread, escalating tension &amp; disturbing gore that usually comes associated with this subgenre of horror, World War Z inclines more towards the action genre than horror, packs in almost all the elements of a generic summer blockbuster, and as far as the subject of zombie apocalypse goes, this is one of the lamest movies out there.Based on the novel of the same name, World War Z tells the story of retired UN investigator Gerry Lane who, along with his family, narrowly manages to escape the zombie outbreak in his city but soon finds himself on a new mission that requires him to travel around the globe in order to find a possible cure to the pandemic that is quickly annihilating the human race.Directed by Marc Forster (Finding Neverland &amp; Quantum of Solace), World War Z takes the living dead of 28 Days Later..., injects them with plenty of steroids, gives them the benefit of CGI and allows them to go completely lunatic on the screen which, instead of working as a chaotic nightmare, looks too artificial to have any effect and eliminates the seriousness the movie was aiming for.The screenplay fails to provide any character depth, the ones that matter are carved out of cardboards, the story lacks any sense of direction, and the ending is pretty weak. Sure it's fast paced &amp; action-packed but it's just empty visuals with nothing at stake. Performances are dull, Brad Pitt's star presence helps a bit but his input looks like he was asked to utter his lines without rehearsing any of his scenes.On an overall scale, World War Z is a highly disjointed mess that keeps piling one segment over another without any idea of where it's headed, neither scares nor thrills, and is simply as forgettable as any typical summer blockbuster. The concept is promising on a certain level but the execution is so disappointing that the movie as a whole is a waste of time &amp; money. Watch it only if you can't resist a Brad Pitt film. Highly mediocre!</fullReview>

His plans are quickly interrupted when a deadly pandemic scatters through their town in Philidelphia and causes a massive zombie invasion. Before too long, zombies begin taking over the universe as the virus spreads on a global scale. In an effort to save the future of mankind, Gerry must travel across the world in search for a cure to the virus while surviving the massive zombie onslaught. This film is directed by Marc Foster who made Kite Runner (2007) and Quantum Solace (2008).This film is an adaption to Max Brook's novel World War Z, but it does however manage to take many liberties from the novel and create a complete original story. Nonetheless, this film does not fail to entertain and bring on the thrills. Many fans however were sparked with disappointment when they learned of the PG-13 rating. While it does take away from the blood and gory fun that many zombie fans root for, the film manages to be fun and action-packed without heavy use of blood and gore. The action sequences were spectacular and the same can be said for the special effects. The zombies look good while maintain their gross, sickish appearance. The zombie attack scene on the airplane was probably the best scene throughout the film. It really showed the best of the special effects this film carries. Unlike most zombie films, the zombies in this one are super fast and when someone gets bitten and infected, they turn within a matter of "like" ten seconds. The plot also worked well here, even though the pacing does slip towards the final stretch. As the story progresses, it comes clear that it is not exactly about zombies attacking the world, but focuses on the downfall of humanity. On the other hand, it is still action-packed and compelling as it needs to be.World War Z is one of the best summer flicks of 2013. Even if its not too faithful to Max Brook's source material, it is still enjoyable and succeeds with an entertaining story, dazzling special effects, and action scenes that will hold your attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first reaction was... Zombies and Brad Pitt...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...hmm I wonder if that will work ...but I actually think it did and it did good, there are some parts of the movie that I didn't like (see below, spoiler alert), but there are many really good things and they kept me interested and entertained.Likes, the chaos and selfishness in the beginning, the doubt and despair through out it all, the fights and survival tactics, the explosions, the viciousness of the zombies, the fast moving scenery and the locations (especially Istanbul).Dislikes (one big spoiler), Istanbul was the greatest disappointment or the "only" weakness in the film, why do you build a giant ass wall and doesn't post any guards on top, the zombies would still have gotten in with their tactic, but it would have made it much more realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Unrated Cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the New Unrated Cut version of this movie and it was really good. I was shocked at how many negative reviews it got, which was simply because most people watched the regular version. The Unrated version had a better explanation in the end and it wasn't futile like the one that came out in theaters.&nbsp;On the other hand, Brad Pitt did a good job, as usual, in this film. Although I was kind of lost to how you could get infected by a bite (normal), but if it gets into your mouth, you're fine. I mean, I know it was rabies, but still. Right? Also, I didn't understand how there was already a lot of noise being made in the inner city: Buses coming in and out, helicopters flying around, police cars etc... But it was the singing that made the zombies go even crazier an build a ladder like wall to cross over?&nbsp;It was a good movie, don't get me wrong, I just think that it could've been thought about more carefully and re-edited. If you watch this movie, I'd recommend watching the Unrated Cut version. The story will probably make more sense, unlike the theatrical one which will probably leave you wanting your money back.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WWZ may be a zombie movie, but it's not your average slow moving limping around type creatures that someone could walk up to and kill with a knife to the head before they reacted. These zombies seem to make use of their muscle structure, form and function which allow them to run, jump and climb to complete their objective of spreading the virus inside them. The problem is their objective isn't to eat as much as it is to spread their plague with a predator like aggression so there is very little to no gore save a few teeth marks and a crushed zombie head or 2.You'll know the moment that the first attack starts if you've made a good decision to see this movie or not. If you're unimpressed by the concept, then it's safe to quit watching the rest of the movie and find a spoiler alert if you can't already guess what will happen. For those who are impressed, hold on to those thoughts through the rest of the show because the 2 hour long movie doesn't get that much more interesting even though you can feel the potential is there! Gerry Lane played by Brad Pitt is a former investigator for the UN and tasked with finding patient 0 where the virus originated to help make a cure for this pandemic. He travels to a few countries to investigate what they know which all seem to lead to dead ends so he's forced to rely less on protocol for finding the answers and more on observation to find a more creative solution. This movie offers a new twist to an old concept but really isn't much more than movie "filling food".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better the second time around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this on Netflix the other day and liked it a lot better than I did the first time, when I say it in theaters. I think I was expecting a stronger plot and more story which the film lacks, but then again Marc Forest directed the film and he was the director who dropped the ball on Quantum OF Solace. As I watched WWZ for a second time I realized I had to let go and just go for the ride this film is 2 hours of zombie porn. I watched the unrated cut which has a lot more blood and guts than the theatrical version I saw. That's all this film is, set piece after set piece of zombie mayhem and destruction. If you think of it as a 2 hour version of the introduction of a zombie video game and turn your brain off to logic, story and character development - buckle up and have some bloody fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Zombie Adventure, Decent Action Flick, Mediocre Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The zombie genre is dangerously overexposed at the moment. For the last ten years filmmakers have churned them out, in what is mostly motivated by the basest of financial considerations. Luckily World War Z takes the zombie concept in a slightly different direction than traditional films. In the same vein as 28 Days Later, only on a global scale, WWZ is arguably the culmination and most fitting depiction of the concept of the "Zombie Apocalypse," and one hopes its final reiteration. While it is too deeply flawed to really recommend to anyone outside zombie and action fans, the zombie genre couldn't hope for a better send off. The film is reminiscent of Steven Soderbergh's Contagion only much less dull. Though Contagion had the advantage of having an interesting antagonist, it also got bogged down telling one too many personal stories. In the end, Brad Pitt's central character, as unrealistic and epically significant he is in WWZ, is compelling enough to hold our attention. This movie doesn't really necessitate a bad guy, though a little more characterization might have helped. There are some good cameos I must say, but Pitt is what holds together this shambolic travelogue of a story. And considering the situation, his blunt exposition never seems forced. His character's simple mantra and guiding survival tactic (always keep moving) defines the attitude of the film. No one could accuse this reworked script of being too talky, that's for certain. As action sequences goes, it is quite striking. But the film's problems are evident in its generic clichés and predictability. Brad Pitt's character is essentially a superhero, which in any other movie wouldn't be a problem however in a movie that stresses gritty realism and a foundation in hard science it just seems awkward. One scene in particular will test your suspension of disbelief, and maybe even ruin the film for you. As I mentioned before, the film was adapted from the book of the same title, and its ending reworked at the last moment. Whether the new ending played better than the original we may never know, but the tonal shift from bombastic to more subdued climax makes sense. The film would have been well served to provide us the opportunity to absorb and process what we seeing more often.My only real complaint is that it never differentiates itself from the rest of the genre in any meaningful way, content to rely upon established zombie mythos and imagery found in any video game or B-horror. Though initially shocking in their animalistic disregard for their own bodies much like some swarming insect, the film none the less makes use of countless stock grayish, growling zombies, last-second escapes, and flickering fluorescent lights. In the decade since the masterpiece that was 28 Days Later, nothing in the zombie formula has really changed; good enough proof that the zombie phenomenon should probably cut its losses while it's still ahead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitt saves the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a terrible movie, fairly average. Some of the computer-generated effects were somewhat impressive, like the armies of zombies climbing over one another like ants. Brad Pitt has his certain charisma and "star power" but they seemed to be minimizing that throughout. They gave almost nothing for Mireille Enos to do. (She's from my home town!) Daniella Kertesz seemed to play the most interesting character, the Israeli soldier who travels with Pitt's character. All of the big-budget stuff is here, the cinematography, the effects, the re-written ending after being shown to test audiences. I am fairly glad that I didn't waste theater-type money to see it. But it's okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War D-Minus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, for being the most hyped and expensive ($190 million) zombie movie ever made, WWZ really wimped out, big-time.I mean, c'mon - For the sheer magnitude of this particular zombie invasion (which was literally worldwide), WWZ should've been made as an x-rated horror movie where all of the gore and horror would completely overwhelm the viewer and leave one absolutely gasping to catch their breath.An epidemic of this virus's magnitude was rendered way too tame with this film's PG-13 rating.With the exception of a few very impressive swarming zombie attacks (where the utter panic in the crowd was perfectly executed), WWZ contained far too many scenes that reduced its story to the point of being nearly anaemic.Below are 4 of my biggest beefs which lost WWZ some significant points - (1) I thought that it really sucked that Brad Pitt's character got sprayed directly in the mouth with zombie-blood and yet he didn't "turn".(2) As well, I thought that the ridiculous focus on the Lanes, as the ultimately ideal and cute, happy-go-lucky, all-American family-unit was just too sickening for words.(3) The wall that was built around the entire city of Jerusalem was a stroke of sheer stupidity which went way beyond anything even marginally plausible. Like, do you actually realize what sort of an undertaking this would be to construct such a wall as this? (And after it was built it didn't even turn out to be zombie-proof anyways) (4) I thought that the Gerry Lane character, played by that over-rated actor, Brad Pitt, made for an absolutely terrible hero. This guy was completely clueless as to what was going one, yet it seemed like everyone was relying on this dunce to save the day. (Spare me, please!)And speaking about Brad Pitt, I thought that this no-talent twit was really showing his age in this picture. To me, Pitt looked totally haggard, tired and, yes, bored throughout the entire duration of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad to the rescue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brad Pitt has become more than just a pretty boy. He can involve you so you care what happens to him. That's what saved this movie from being just another Zombie Walking flick. The writing was pretty mediocre from so many standpoints. The opening scenes are good except it certainly takes Brad and family long to run. If everyone is running away from something, is that not a good time to start running also as opposed to dawdling around waiting to interview someone? But it was scary. The scene in Jerusalem was very well done, even if obviously CGIed. Who knew Zombies could swarm and plan like bees? The plane scene is good also. The bicycles to the military plane seem stupid. And the chase down the WHO hallways seems, ludicrous. They sent Murielle to Nova Scotia... Oh No. Not Nova Scotia. That seemed lame. It's worth the watch, but no classic. But the film has its moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant story but follows the luckiest man alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film World war Z has its beautiful scenes, with fast paced, heart stopping moments. In the Narrative, we follow Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) and his fight to save the world and by doing this saving his family. The basic story is there, Man forced to work in his ex-job to help protect his family. As Gerry's previous job was staying alive in dangerous places, we suspect he will be smarter and more accurate in making his decisions. However as the film goes on past the 60 min mark, we notice that his decisions are just too good to be true/real. In contrast there are some disappointing and quite stupid scenes. Overall the film draws you in to believe that Gerry will stay alive not matter what he does and that the only outcome is saving the world. For a 'normal' man he sure does have luck on his side.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if it had a little better story and was rated R. This is a zombie flick, people want to see zombies bite and this movie cuts that all out. The Walking Dead on cable shows more gore than this movie.Brad Pitt is an ex war reporter. One day the city turns to you know what and he's asked to come back into the game. Of course, he doesn't want to, but in order to get his family to safety, he agrees to. First they must survive the night when things turn to chaos, and this was the best part of the film. Then they get rescued and taken to a big ship. Pit is sent on a mission to find the origin of the virus and of course when zombies are involved, this doesn't go as planned. He goes to Korea but the best special effects are in Isreal when the zombies form a ladder and all that ensues there.Then Pitt survives a plane crash, are you kidding me. But get beyond that and he happens to be within walking distance of WHO center and no zombies in sight. Then there is a pretty crazy solution to the problem, but there is an open ending. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel.FINAL VERDICT: I like zombie movies so I did like this. Basically if they had made it R rated and shown zombie kills, etc... it would have been a lot better. But it's good enough to watch if you need an apocalypse fix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z. Not-big on brains.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) used to work for the United Nations. He now lives quietly in Philadelphia with his wife Karin (Mirielle Enos) and their daughters. Gerry hears about an infection and moves the family to NY from Philadelphia. In New York, the rioting begins, the infection is causing people to turn into zombies. Gerry escapes New York, one step ahead of a conflagration, and gets on a ship, with the help of his U.N. friend, Thierry. (Fana Makoena) To stay on the ship, Gerry has to go to South Korea to work with immunologist, Andrew Fassbach (Elyes Gabel) but Fassbach shoots himself dead during a zombie attack. Gerry finds out that Israel has stayed relatively safe during the zombie attacks by building a wall, so he flies out of South Korea, and into Israel, but hey, zombies can climb walls, so Gerry has to hot-foot it out of Israel, with a female soldier named Segan (Daniella Kertesz), and a planeload of other survivors. Gerry thinks he's figured out a chink in the virus, but he has to figure out how to get the plane to a World Health Organization center in Cardiff, England with a zombie on the plane. Does he make it to England? Does his idea work?World War Z is a ludicrous movie. This movie consists of Brad Pitt jet-setting around the world, staying one step ahead of the law, as it were. But as soon as the immunologist shot himself, I knew this was a Brad Pitt vanity project, he wasn't going to share the screen with anyone. How he makes it to the end of this movie strains credulity, more than once. It suffers from what every monster flick suffers from, thousands or millions may die, but the hero will never die. Any veteran horror movie watcher knows that going in, so I'm hardly giving anything away. Oddly enough, if the viewer suspends reality until the end, the denouement is actually pretty inventive. Pitt does a good job playing sensitive action-hero, (he calls his wife regularly) and the sensitive action hero is about the limit of Brad's acting ability. There really is no other acting to speak of other than Daniella Kertesz, who dies a credible job as action hero sidekick. The length is nearly two hours and drags at certain points, despite trying to be a non-stop action movie.For more dead-on movie reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com</fullReview>

It it really interesting but 'zombies' are exactly the same in the already mentioned movie. I would recommend people to watch it but only if they don't have anything else to do in their boring lives. World war z is a great name I can say that, someone did make his imagination go. Brad Pitt acting wasn't bad, I'm not saying that, but it is not too hard to act in a movie like this, it is too amateurish. There was no plot at all, everything starts too early and the end is already seen by the viewers even before the 30th minute of the movie. All in all, nothing special, if you want to watch a movie where a person needs to think to get the puzzles together, skip this one, this is too obvious.</fullReview>

Slow mindless zombies, well, I say zombies, but what was with the click clicking, chattering teeth doctor ? Looked a bit daft to say the least. I've read the book, but apart from the title in common........I did learn something from this film, as well as the vastly poorer zombies movies being released en masse it seems. Zombies in films have had their day. Too much competition from vampires, werewolves, ghosts and scarier stuff now. Mind you, fast, at least human fast zombies, that can think, plan, communicate with each other and use weaponry, might take it up a level, with the usual hunger for human flesh and needing a head injury to re-kill them, might work. Think Terminator, but zombies not cyborgs, hard to destroy and can shoot back ! Just a thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a bit baffled I must admit, because as I watched this film I found myself wondering if Will Smith's character from Legend was going to pop up in the distance when they showed a New York scene.And that's the thing, it's basically the same film really, just with more people and locations.I watched it though, it was kind of fine, kind of okay. But all the way through I was struggling to really care, either about the rather predictable premise that human stupidity created the zombies through some form of virus or sickness even though the zombies seemed to suddenly have impossible strength and speed which would require significant bone, muscle and organ replacement surely...or indeed about the people trying to survive. Perfect film to watch if you are going to sort of pay attention, but might make a cuppa now and again or check the sports scores on your tablet and don't mind missing 30 seconds here and there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A run-of-the-mill but effective zombie/pandemic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heading into "World War Z," all expectations need to be tossed and burned. Once you read the book and watch any trailer, it's clear that the Paramount wanted to make a large-scale zombie film and felt more comfortable basing it on established source material than an original story. Hard to blame them, for as well as Max Brooks creates a portrait of war through documentary- like post-war accounts, very little of his novel could be characterized as cinematic. For a total reinterpretation, however, "World War Z" manages to be a welcome addition to the worldwide pandemic/zombie genre. The script speaks to the power of many minds being better than one, with Matthew Michael Carnahan ("State of Play"), "Lost" writers Drew Goddard ("The Cabin in the Woods") and Damon Lindelof ("Prometheus") and a story by J. Michael Straczynski ("Thor"). Director Marc Forster, as well, shows he's a more capable action director than "Quantum of Solace" gave him credit for. "World War Z" manages to create suspense and intrigue despite being far from the first film about society breaking down at the hands of rabid flesh-eating zombies.Zombies all too often go hand-in-hand with the horror genre, but "World War Z" plays out as more of a thriller and a survival film. Brad Pitt's Gerry Lane must work with the government to uncover clues toward a possible cure, and he also must run for his life when things take a quick turn and his or his family's safety is compromised. His quest takes him to South Korea, Jerusalem and Wales.There's little to "World War Z" that doesn't meet the eye. It works primarily as an exercise in tension and thrives on its ability to lend a certain freshness to the genre. Although nothing about the film is unfamiliar to any fan of zombie flicks, Forster gives us the sense that we're experiencing it all for the first time, playing off any prior knowledge of zombies we might feel we have, in a sense, in order to keep us on our toes.Although mostly just a gore-less version of "28 Weeks Later," "World War Z" manages not to do anything too stupid to insult the genre or draw negative attention to itself. Considering how far it veers from the popular source material, "World War Z" was ripe for derision from fans and critics, but its ability to work as a suspenseful thriller manages to save its value as a blockbuster.~Steven CThanks for reading!

This begins in Philadelphia with former United Nations investigator, Gerry Lane (Pitt) driving with his wife, Karin (Enos) and their 2 daughters. Soon, they get into an accident and discover that a lethal virus is infecting people into hungry zombies. Among the panic, Gerry gets his family to a secure location and is asked to help find the source of the epidemic spreading across the world. Kertesz plays Israeli soldier, Segan, Fox (Party of Friends) plays a parajumper and Morse (Contact) plays an ex-CIA agent. This isn't bad, but could've been better and Pitt is good in it.</fullReview>

My boyfriend disliked it and I can understand why (if that makes sense). It had a good plot and in my eyes could be pretty realistic (as far as zombie movies go and movie land)Brad wasn't over ally skilled which made me think a bit more real life there. It just lacked in execution. Possibly would of worked more on that story and would of recast some of the people. I felt some of the scenes were empty and didn't need to be there but all in all I thought it was decent. I think people should see it for themselves because as far as I can tell people either liked or hated this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyone loves to hate Zombies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombies, everyone loves to hate them and Brad Pitt and director Marc Foster have moved them front and centre, from niche market into the Multiplex.Instead of shuffling, small groups of the undead, this story imagines a Zombie pandemic with zombies running at breakneck speeds and swarming like ants around a jar of honey.Commencing with arguably the most effective sequence, we meet every man Gerry (Pitt), playing eye spy with his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and two young kids, in his safe suburban Volvo on the traffic blocked streets of Philadelphia.After losing a car wing mirror, it quickly becomes evident that Gerry and family have a lot more to lose if they do not move quickly. Once bitten the victim becomes part of the horde within twelve seconds, not long for those you previously loved to get far enough away, as they become your next prey.The early sequence where Gerry attempts to protect his and another family within an apartment block is very effective and ramps up the tension as they all struggle to survive. The depiction of the inevitable break down in law and order, rapidly moving into "every man for himself", is both highly believable and highlights the thin veneer of civility we all accept and rely upon in our daily life.Of course Pitt is not just a normal Joe, in a previous life he moved through the hot spots of the world as a UN investigator and remains a key resource, worthy of saving to help the greater good, assuming of course he agrees to join the forces fighting back.The film is not so much about killing zombies, although the largely bloodless body count is high, the story instead focusing upon finding a cure to prevent a further spread of the disease. This is made clear as Gerry is tasked with assisting a young top virologist Dr Fassbach (Gabel) as he is sent to what is estimated to be "ground zero" to investigate.The film moves around the world, with a notable second act set in Jerusalem before reaching a climax in, rather bizarrely Cardiff, Wales UK. Rather than a welcome in the hill sides, just zombies, lots of zombies in white coats.The film is loosely based upon the book from Max Brooks and the film production was beset by rumours of cost overruns, re-shoots and "creative differences". In the Internet age, these terms are liberally attached to most big productions and despite initial reservations, the film has been successful with an ending leaving room for more, if audiences desire a re-match.The film deliberately shy's away from any outright gore, hard core horror fans should look elsewhere but this allows a much broader audience to enjoy a highly enjoyable thriller, that just happens to have Zombies as the main protagonist. There are "jump" scares a plenty but nothing your average 13 year old will not have seen before.Pitt plays the family man called to action with ease, equally at home with an axe in his had for making kindling or neutralising zombies as the situation demands. Enos (from the "The Killing" fame) makes a sympathetic "stay at home mom, whilst husband is killing zombie hordes" but arguably does not get enough to do. However, a note to self to always be careful when calling your partner during a zombie pandemic, as timing can be crucial.The effects and make up are state of the art, as you would expect on a production of this size. The final chapter works well but does appear to be spliced onto the action earlier, as if from a different film all together. This represents a much quieter and intimate man versus zombie, which could be due to the mentioned re-shoot, it does not harm the film but is a noticeable change of pace and setting.Summary Zombies lite, suitable for most family viewings with a good story, action sequences and effects.Highly enjoyable thriller with mild horror sequences that confounded pre-release critics, who clearly forgot the power of Zombie films to get up and keep going, even after being left for dead by their early reviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seems like a preview of the Director's Cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much off-screen violence, so many plot holes, so many places in this film where something starts and then ends without any sense of a middle to it that it feels almost like the version I saw (the PG-13, single-disc DVD version, in case later re-releases muddle the issue) was the edited-for-TV version or the cut they put together just so they could later release a Director's Cut with all the sense put back in.Giving the hero of an action film a family to worry about is a choice filmmakers rarely go for, but it is effective here in establishing his motive for survival. Unfortunately, all the teasing about "what I used to do" from Brad Pitt never pays off. We never learn that he used to be a sniper assassin or an accountant or anything back when he did whatever it did that was so disturbing in his past. That's just one disappointment the film features. Revealing more would venture into spoiler territory.6 out of 10: Worth seeing, not worth recommending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z. Long story short.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw the film World War Z. Long story short, this film at the beginning is a bit boring, detailing for several minutes events of how it was and as it happened the pandemic. When action happens, everything is total expectation to keep seeing and to understand why these zombies are different from others seen in other films.This film has amazing actors that really make the film interesting. First, Bratt Pitt, gives rise to a father and husband, strong willed when it comes to defending what belongs to him, his performance makes you not lose the vision in detail what you want to display. The casting of this movie is really good, and the actors didn't disappoint.The story focuses around which goes through the world in a race against time to stop a pandemic that is tearing down armies and the government, and threatening to decimate humanity. The problems faced in the fight to find a cure. It does at times, fall into boredom for wanting to see some action. In addition, you will be on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen at the end.A peculiar detail about this film is that it is very easy to identify with the main character (Brad Pitt). We all have moments of fear for our lives that make us cringe.Finally, the way this film is and just when everything seems clarified eventually fall into the sad situation of wanting to see more and especially leaves the viewer with factions in the face of "It's over" And suddenly jump in the words "BUT" "WHY" Overall, this film covers little to how much they have to cover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombies = B movie. Can't avoid it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rather enjoyed the first couple of acts of this (surely unfinished) blockbuster. Marc Foster gets right on with it. All the stuff you've seen in the trailers seems to happen in the same span as the pre-titles of a Christopher Nolan flick. It's quite exciting and I was even a little spooked myself.The film starts to get a little labored as Brad Pitt's indeterminate UN- type begins to guess a possible solution. This dawning idea seems to coincide with a truly extraordinary handbrake turn in the film; a flight out of apocalyptic Israel points Pitt towards Wales because it's cheap to film there - oh, sorry, no, because that's the nearest WHO research facility and suddenly the whole circus scales right down into a TV version of 24 Days Later. The film ends in much the same way as I Am Legend but without anything like the satisfactory arc prior to it. And credit where it's due - to the (apparently) uncredited Zombie in the WHO facility, the first to prove Gerry's theory right. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your usual Zombie film done on a grander scale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be perfectly honest, the only reason I saw this film was because of Ruth Negga. But, for the rest of you, I assume Brad Pitt could be the reason for seeing this movie. Though many could be drawn by the source material or just because you got an itch to see some zombies? Either way, let's get to it!The amount of developed characters in this film are nil, but you at the very least are given a name and title to identify them by. Naturally, Brad Pitt has the lead role and he plays Gerry who seemingly is a former Special Forces soldier trying to more so protect his family than save the world. However, in order to do so, he has to aide Thierry (played by Fana Mokoena), the UN deputy secretary general, in his quest to find patient zero or a cure. Outside of those two, the only other character worth noting is Daniella Kertesz's Segen for she helps Gerry on his quest. I mean there is also Gerry's wife Karin (played by Mireille Enos) and the lovely Ruth Negga who plays a WHO (World Health Organization) Doctor, but she is not given a name.Story wise, at the end of the movie I got a sort of I Am Legend vibe from it. I don't know why though, for it resembles 28 Days Later much more. So, with that said, as you can imagine Brad plays this former soldier who is in the process of trying to live a normal, low-key life, but then something happens which forces him to show why people high up in government know who he is. In most cases the reason for the call would be a terrorist, but in this case it is a Resident Evil style outbreak which seemingly has no exact origin. So, after Brad makes sure his family is safe, he goes off to S. Korea, Israel and, ultimately, Wales to find something to save the world. All the while, he manages to get by hundreds of thousands of zombies and only ends up swallowing a little of their blood. So, basically it has the same workings of 90% of all action movies.Now, one thing I did like was the role of Segen played in this movie. The reason I point her out is because often in action movies, the women are either the hot chick the guy has to end up saving by the end, or the woman who seemingly is modeled to void any sense of femininity type of femininity as if the character can't be strong and still have feminine qualities. In this film though, I felt with Kertesz's Sergen, we were given a female character in an action movie who didn't necessarily need to be saved, doesn't play someone who is a liability, but truly plays someone who gives you the complete human experience. I say this because, unlike Brad, she doesn't come off invincible. She makes mistakes, pays for it, but still keeps fighting. For me, she was more interesting hero than Brad Pitt was throughout the movie.Which is kind of the main issue. Brad Pitt, like many other stars, doesn't have the type of acting ability where you forget it is them on screen. Add onto that, I will never understand Brad Pitt's appeal as a leading man. He acts so stiffly to me, and I find myself not being able to really get into his character at all. Yeah, we are given background, see his family and all that, but he doesn't really have the acting skills to really make you care. In comparison, Will Smith can be damn near alone a whole movie, barely talk about himself, and only have a dog for a co-star and put on a better performance.Overall: TV ViewingTo be quite honest, every single monster out there from zombies to vampires has been done to the point where seeing them in a movie sets the bar really low for none of them really try to take you to new places or liven up a monster that has been around for, perhaps, centuries. World War Z is really no different. To me, the only difference between World War Z and other films like it is that this has a bigger budget and the benefits that come from that are seen through the look of the zombies and the locals. As for the story and acting, outside of the character of Segen, no one really stands out. Everyone really feels interchangeable and even Brad. I mean, Bruce Willis could play his role and I wouldn't see a major difference. Hell, damn near anyone with a decent amount of talent, and looks, could have played Brad's role and it wouldn't make a major difference. Overall though, there is really no need to rush to see this movie. I would probably best recommend it for background noise for when you want to take a nap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only 1 little problem with this movie: Zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to put on my special cap marked 'Suspension of disbelief' to watch the movie. Indeed, I'm one of those movie fans who doesn't care about zombies, never have, and except for this one, never will (at least I don't expect to). That being said, once you think of zombies as infected humans, as opposed to undead, you can watch the movie as an action thriller/adventure, and then it works.Given director Marc Foster was responsible for 'Quantum of Solace' and for Monster's Ball', and given the star of this flick was Brad Pitt, it was a pretty sure bet I was going to see it. Both have pumped out some good work in the past and have done so again here. The IMDb full story line gives us enough of the plot to decide if we're going to be interested. Though I wasn't, I have to admit I did get caught up in the action and the thrilling pursuit for a solution, early on. The character Gerry Lane, played by Pitt, is an interesting one; he has a keen sense of observation and power of deduction, one that would make Sherlock Holmes proud.The writers and the narration by Pitt, tries very hard to make you believe the vulnerability of man and the hazardous or inherent danger with science and chemicals (pharma or others) development for peaceful or not so peaceful ends. It would be a resounding success if we weren't talking zombies of course. There's no doubt that if you have gotten past the zombies thing, you will love this movie. I tried my best, your turn now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deviation Aside, Enjoyable Thrills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Your enjoyment of World War Z doesn't hinge solely on your enjoyment of the book which it claims to be based on, but owes it to anyone who has read the book to disclaim "loosely based". That being said, if you've read the book beforehand, the trailers alone should let you know that the film is going in wholly different direction that Max Brooks laid out in his novel.I am a huge fan of the zombie franchise, which George Romero essentially put a patent on and dozens of films have branched off from over the years. What "World War Z" does is attempt to mesh the behavioral patterns of the "28 Days Later" infected undead (I refuse to call them zombies, zombies are the slow, shuffling Romero staple) with the essential ideas behind Brooks' book. It does this admirably, but it's a direction that ultimately didn't need to be taken in order to make the film successful. In my mind, it felt like a lazy way of telling a story that builds itself up, cutting time off of the reel in favor of a more fast-paced, energized film experience.Being a huge fan of the book, I refused to shell out the $10 to see it in the theaters; as I said, the trailers told me clearly that the film was going to diverge far enough from the book for me to lower my expectations. As a rental, and for what it is, it's nowhere near terrible. Remove all comparisons to the book it takes minor inspirations from, and Brad Pitt does a solid job of weaving his way through a decently scripted and constructed horror film.This ended up being Pitt's highest grossing film to date, and a combination of factors play into that, not least of which being a rather stale list of opposing options in theaters at the time of its release. Still, it's an enjoyable film, however far it deviates from the source material, and however ridiculous some of us may think calling something that runs a zombie. Could have been better...and could have been a whole lot worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is not a single thing I like about this zombie flick at all cause its not entirely based on the book and the book had more then just one story unlike this film. This is a film that I would not recommend to anyone. I mean the ending to this film is terrible. All it did was show Brad Pitt's character and his family in a boat somewhere on the west coast or the east coast and it had no meaning at all. Also the zombies in this movie reminded me of all those zombies in the video game Left 4 Dead for the Xbox 360. I mean if you're gonna make a film based on a novel, at least make it mostly based on the plot of the novel. This is definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life.

The airplane played such a prominent role in the movie, this simply should have never happened. The movie was virtually unwatchable for me because of this jarring discrepancy. Even people generally oblivious to aircraft types can tell they are not the same model of plane.I hope that Brad Pitt had not seen this gross error before the movie was released.

		<fullReview>Why was this movie made? Here we have yet another zombie action remix of half a dozen movies that everyone has seen, only this time it's got Brad Pitt and an odd emphasis on Israel and the Middle East. I'm not kidding when I say that it's even more boring and predictable than the most stereotypical of zombie movies. The action scenes feel like something from a textbook, and the plot is, yes, textbook. It was hard for me to sit through this because I really did feel like I was watching a movie made from a checklist.It was oddly surprising to watch a large budget movie that isn't even as good as it's cheaper counterparts. If you compare this to such movies as Cloverfield, I Am Legend, Walking Dead, War of the Worlds and Thirty Days of Night, this movie doesn't even come close to any of them, yet borrows scenes from all of them. So again I ask, why would you waste time and money on such a snooze fest?</fullReview>

When he was in Jerusalem, why did the girl standing in line have a microphone that was hooked up to all of the loudspeakers?

Also, they have an ability to 'sense' when humans are terminally ill, and, leave them alone...very creative writers and ideas!I haven't seen zombies this crazy since "I Am Legend" (2007)!These have to be the most agile zombies to ever be in a movie; and, since they're as such and can breach a high wall, they 'must' be able to somehow communicate to negotiate and organize such formations!?!? And...they must have some brain activity that goes beyond feeding if they can detect 'sick' humans and avoid them, much like certain animals won't eat rotten, tainted, and/or, rancid carrion!?!?I really like zombie movies and TV series - 'horror' movies of all kinds (vampires; etc.); and, I find this to be a very good movie with good effects and creative ideas, as well as talented writers and CGI technicians, and, a highly-technical script.Like myself, I believe that what most viewers wish to see in a horror movie nowadays is a technically-believable script that outdoes that of the last movie they saw. "World War Z" did that for me - freshly-new and believably-scary 'zombie' ideas!I like this movie and give it eight stars. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is NOT a Zombie movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, when I started watching this World War Z, I imagined a movie similar to 'I am Legend'. Now, I am a fan of zombie movies. But the reason I disliked this movie is not because it isn't a perfect zombie movie(which it definitely isn't), but because this movie is all about how a guy, Brad Pitt in this case, ALWAYS survives zombies. The story lacks thrill of a zombie apocalypse, the plot is wafer thin, even for a zombie movie, the characters are tasteless, dialog almost inaudible at times and and the only person actually wanting to take this movie seriously is Pitt himself.Now, if you wonder why I think that the movie is all about Brad Pitt, just imagine the following scenario- - Brad Pitt is on a street with his family of 4 and is suddenly faced with a Zombie attack. Yet , along with saving his whole family(no limbs lost), Brad Pitt survives! - He gets medicines from a mall(to hell with the Zombie apocalypse, Brad Pitt just LOVES going to the mall). His family again survives(No Limbs Lost) and Brad Pitt survives! - He and his family get to the top of an apartment(so that they can have the luxury of getting airlifted by a helicopter) while Pitt also swallows some zombie blood along the way. Still, his family survives(No Limbs Lost). Brad Pitt survives! - He goes to South Korea. As soon as they land for a mission. The doctor who is supposedly the most important person on the mission dies even before a single step on the Korean land but Brad Pitt survives! - The film makers feel Brad Pitt is a bit 'under-traveled' at this point, so they send him to Jerusalem. The whole city gets infiltrated by zombies, even if it had been surrounded by tall walls, but again, hold your breath, Brad Pitt survives! - In the last act, he reaches Cardiff(Wales) and in an attempt to infect himself by diseases, he goes into a medical ward overcrowded with zombies, but yet again, Brad Pitt survives!!So basically this movie about how Brad Pitt saves his family, goes on a solo round trip through South Korea, Israel and UK and in the end, gets to save the world. And all that without losing a single limb himself or his family. Because BRAD PITT always survives!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I humbly opine that this movie gets just a little too much bad press.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visit any Internet message boards about it, and you might get the impression that its more commonly accepted title is "The Brad Pitt Zombie Movie That Sucked." I myself am a die-hard fan of Max Brooks' original book, but I still loved the movie.It wasn't a George A. Romero film, and it wasn't "The Walking Dead." (And it certainly wasn't the book.) But ? that's just fine, in my opinion. It was different. It was a bangin', epic, global monster war movie with some amazing action set pieces. I think the siege of the walled Jerusalem (a subplot that actually WAS from the book), was alone well worth the price of a ticket. Not every zombie movie has to have the same tone and narrative as Romero's work or Robert Kirkman's work. Arnold Schwarzenegger's recent "Maggie" film showed us, for example, that very different zombie movies can still be incredibly good.My only real criticism of the movie was that its plot resolution seemed ? pretty damned risky. Isn't there a pretty obvious danger connected with the defense employed by Pitt's character? Maybe I missed something.</fullReview>

Well, by not bringing anything really innovative into the plot doesn't mean that it deserves a bad review.Again, the concept its not new, you might find something fresh in the aggressiveness of the infected, demonstrating a new kind of horror to the zombie genre, but then again, its always the same.The main effort in this movie are not in the characters (except for Brad Pitt), neither the plot, the horror, soundtrack etc... what really comes out shinning in this movie are the zombies, here you get the real feeling of the threat, the contamination is fast as the madness and blood lust on the infected, that makes you realize that you wouldn't survive with a samurai sword in the same event.Anyway, if you are in for a zombie apocalypse worldwide movie, then this is it, nevertheless you shouldn't go in with big expectations.Enjoy :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long story short the rabies virus as gotten out of control and now they'er bascilly zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not even going to rate this movie because of my own personal pet peeves.So the movie starts out with the Pitt family (no that is not they're actual name in the movie but I don't care.)having a nice breakfast, it's an ordinary day in the heart of New York City and they have school and work plus wherever else there everyday city life's may take them. So they are in heavy traffic because they are in New York and all the sudden these ordinary people doing everyday things turn in to zombies because of the virus that apparently got out of control in Japan. So Brad gets out of the vehicle that the rest of the family is in and inspects his car because one of the side mirrors got taken off by a speeding car. All the sudden a cop on a motorcycle yells at him to get back in his car but before he can finish his sentence he gets run over by a big truck, narrowly missing Brad. He quickly gets back in his car and now that the truck made a section of open road follows be hide the truck. Now he has two daughters in the back seat the oldest one ,we'll call her Stupid, decides that she is going to take her seat belt off and curl up be hide the passenger seat. And that causes the parents to be all like "Put your seat belt on!" as they look back at her and that causes Brad to get in crash...They're all OK, of course they are. So they all get out of the car and all the sudden there's a camper in New York City!...Nobody goes camping in New York! So they all pile in there and they attempt to get out of the city. But oh no Stupid is having a panic attack! And they are all out of drugs to give her! Guess what that means? That have to go to the store, and of course that's where everyone who is not a zombie is going to be! They get out of the camper and run into the store, Brad takes Stupid over to the Pharmacy and grabs like 3 boxes of the pill witch he then puts in his jacket. Some how they manage to get out of the store alive after some obstacles, but it's not that easy because the campers gone! Someone didn't take the keys out. By now Stupid is fine, because panic attacks are temporary. And they don't even show her taking the pills, so they basically braved the store for nothing! And of course there are more stupid decisions in this movie but I'm not going to waste my time on them.</fullReview>

To me, that was a bit disappointing.The people get infected.... 99% of the world population dies... hero finds the cure... They rebuild the planet... I found my self 45 minutes into the film, wondering when it would start. And telling myself: This can not be it... the big plot twist is still a-coming... the big creative spin has yet to come... But it never did.In a "normal" zombie movie... you at least know what the goal of a zombie is. Brains... Right? A zombie wants brains... Well, in this movie, they creatively changed that to "nothing"... The zombies are just.. I don't know... aggressive. They just bite you and then you are one of them... that's it.The movie explains little about the zombies. It is just good ole Brad Pitt fighting for the cure... And i'm not a big fan of zombie movies, but I gave this one a chance... Seeing that they sunk a lot of money into it and I didn't expect Brad Pitt to tie his name to an uninspired movie... but there we go.Watching the movie was not a complete waste of time. But if they make a World War Z 2.... I'm not going to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the source material, this movie is very generic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A think that it's important to approach this movie with an open mind. Forget the source material and watch the film as its own experience, that way you can more accurately judge it. With that open mind you will see that World War Z is very generic and forgettable, a lazy attempt in a very crowded genre. Much of the criticism surrounding this movie has revolved around how far it strays from the source material, that by doing so World War Z just becomes another zombie movie. I never agreed with the visceral reaction to straying from the source material, the book isn't high literature, it's not some unassailable classic, so it never upset me that they took great liberties with it. However, it really does seem unfathomable that they could make a less interesting movie than the one they did. In my opinion this movie is caught between worlds; it doesn't know if it wants to be an action movie that takes you from set piece to set piece, or if it wants to be a more thoughtful addition to the genre. Instead, it never commits to either and thus never does anything particularly well. The development hell that this movie went through are well known, and you can see it play out on screen as there's no core to it. The best I can figure is that through countless re-writes (including the final, famous rewrite and re-shoot) elements from many different ideas got lumped together, but an internal logic was lost along the way.Parts of the movie seem to want to play up a feeling of tension, other parts want to go full action movie, and yet others want to go for good old disaster porn. Is this movie 28 Days Later? Is it Aliens? Or is it The Day After Tomorrow? With such a clutter of competing ideas, no single one ever takes hold, and the audience is left drifting in the wind. The tension has no teeth, the action is boring, and the ramifications of a world ending zombie war aren't really explored in great detail. One final point; for a movie that puts a lot of emphasis on action set pieces, you will be hard pressed to see find one that makes them less compelling. There's very little weight to the action because the zombies are just so over powering, one turns into 10 in mere seconds, entire cities are fully infested within a matter of minutes, and they're so fast and strong that humans can't compete. This may be compelling on paper, but all it means is that the action is like watching a ridiculous video game. And speaking of video games, who did the special effects for this movie, and how did they pass quality control? World War Z has absolutely terrible CG, it was awful in 2013 and only looks worse with each passing day. Even the makeup of the zombies looks laughable. The poor special effects really hammered home to me that this was not a labor of love, and instead was something closer to a burden on all those involved.It's not a terrible movie, but there's better ones to see. Nothing is done well enough to make up for the things that it does poorly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This hilarity was based on a book? Perhaps a comic-book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the 21st century. Hollywood has devolved, regressed, dumbed-down: serial-killers have become superhuman in strength, knowledge, and cunning (a trend started with "Copycat" and other such moronic 90s flicks); skinny effeminate nerds (Di Crapio, Gyllenhaal, Brody) impersonate tough guys; women with no breasts, ugly faces, 8 feet tall, and with wiry arms and legs are proclaimed as beauties in the corrupt media and cast as "beauties"; zombies are no longer slow and dim-witted but fast, intelligent and occasionally even behave like outer-space termites who spontaneously build sky-high flesh-ladders that cover entire Israeli walls. (But only if some Arab girl grabs a mike and starts singing into it badly.) Yes, once upon a time Tinseltown serial-killers were mere humans. Not anymore; as mentally ill Hollywood executives pushed for new dumb shticks to attract the increasingly dumbed-down movie-goers with, they hired writers whom they started giving explicit instructions to exaggerate, ignore all logic, exaggerate, ignore all logic, and then some. Ditto zombie films; once slow and pathetic ? even comical pushovers ? zombies are now faster than Usain Bolt on his best Jamaican juice concoction. Their energy levels never dissipate thereby breaking the unbreakable Laws of Thermodynamics. They eat and drink nothing (unlike traditional zombies who are simply hungry) but attack only so they can infect humans. (Huh?) It's a sad state of affairs, this need to make everything more extreme, more exaggerated ? hence unavoidably more stupid.I am sure some former East German dope-doctors are watching this movie from their jail-cells and secret labs, going all "wow" and "ooh" and "aah" as they watch Brad Pitt get smothered by zombies so fast that they could easily outrun a cheetah or an antelope in their prime. They probably wish they had some of that juice right now for Usain Bolt, who is wondering what new drugs these modern sports-performance mengheles are working on for him, now that he is approaching his 30s hence not quite able to run the doped-up 9-second 100 meter sprint anymore.WWZ is beyond dumb. Let me explain why. It sets itself up not as a run-of-the-mill cheesy zombie flick that is hence beyond (much) criticism. No. It sets itself up as if it were based in some kind of a reality similar to ours, hence the movie is fair game when it comes to nit-picking for logic flaws. And nonsense there is aplenty. We have a "virus" that COMPLETELY ? physically and mentally ? transforms its victim into what is essentially an alien being within mere seconds. Dumber still, this new creature is MUCH faster than the body's previous host (how? Why?); it's impervious to pain; it's in a perpetual state of frenzy (yet somehow strategically aware and with a cunning nature); even the good old-fashioned shot in the head isn't enough anymore to immediately kill it. I was half-expecting the bloody things to grow wings and fly at super-sonic speeds, or to grow fangs a meter long from whose tips poisonous snake venom would drip.But that's probably planned for the sequel. Coming to a cinema near you, soon: "World War Z II: Zombies Grow Wings &amp; Fly Like Military Jets While Spewing Fire Out Of Their Mouths Very Godzilla-Like". Don't be so sure that I'm exaggerating. What was once considered too absurd to be even in a horror movie is nowadays part-and-parcel of nearly every action or thriller flick.Basically, the set-up is a rather straight-forward zero-chance-for-humanity affair, i.e. the ENTIRE world is royally screwed and nearly everyone should be infected within a few days. And yet, we have all these inexplicable survivors, people who managed to escape from ant-like hordes of super-power zombies. How is that possible? The simple answer: any nonsense is possible in a 21st-century Tinseltown big-budget turkey. Literally anything. Imagine facing an enemy consisting of thousands of invincible raving lunatics charging at you all at once, never tiring, and never resting. Chances? Nil. And yet, somehow, Brad Pitt not only escapes them over and over, he even survives a plane crash.Yes, that plane-crash outcome was beyond cretinous. How are the writers of this unintentional comedy able to look themselves in their gold-plated Beverly Hills mirrors? "Yes, I wrote a scene in which the only two survivors of a plane crash are the two main characters ? the only relevant characters in that entire airplane. Are movie-goers dumb enough for such a plot-twist? Sure they are." And they are right. 90% of today's movie-goers are brainwashed, awe-struck morons; sheep ready to watch and enjoy any movie, no matter how dumb. Hollywood suits wouldn't finance these kinds of silly turds if there weren't millions of zombies waiting in line to watch these zombie films, ready to digest the plots without throwing up laughing. When you have no more brain-cells to lose, you become a willing zombie slave to the powerful media-hype giant that is Hollywood.I did snicker a bit when I found out that Pitt plays some kind of a UN hotshot. Ironically, his anorexic wife and fellow kid-collector Angelina Jolie is associated with that fine, useless organization in real life. Angelina working for the UN is admittedly a lot more preposterous than Pitt working for them, which goes to show that sometimes truth is dumber than fiction ? even Hollywood fiction.The highlight is Pitt's "solution": infect people with major diseases so that the zombies will avoid tearing them into bits. Wow. Monty Python could not have thought up a dumber punchline.More poor writing reared its stupid head when Pitt finds himself in the Welsh medical research center, creating forced "cinematic tension" by being illogical and not telling the personnel straight away who he is. That's 5 minutes of the movie they could saved themselves ? and the viewers.That whole shtick with zombies reacting only to noise was pretty daft, as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Another Zombie Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When reading this review, remember to keep an open mind. Mostly because I know a lot of people like this movie, but unfortunately I have to disagree. And this doesn't mean anyone who likes this movie is dumb or anything like that, absolutely not. I just personally didn't like this film. Okay, on to the review.One thing to note about this movie is that it had a whole lot of production problems going in. It had rewrites, they had to shoot in different locations, etc. And this made this made all the bad parts of the movie pretty obvious as well. But for me, the reason this movie doesn't work is that the characters are about as interesting as looking at your mailbox for 2 hours. There was nobody that was interesting in this entire thing. Which is a pretty big problem considering its a zombie movie, and the thing that carries most good zombie movies for me is good characters.Another thing that just destroyed this movie is that its so cliché. I feel like almost every single modern movie cliché in existence is used here. The shaky cam, the running amount of conveniences, the main character having a pointless family so he can be more identifiable, fast zombies (okay I actually like that one), the main character surviving injuries that pretty much most human beings couldn't survive. If I listed off all the clichés we would be here all day.Another reason why I hate this movie is that? its just another generic zombie movie?. BUT WITH BRAD PITT! there isn't anything different about its story structure, its use of zombies, its characters or anything. Which is a shame, because I heard the book this is based on (saying that loosely here) actually had a lot of originality and great ideas to it. It probably was that they wanted to have this be more accessible for mainstream audiences or maybe the production problems had something to do with it, but I don't know. Anyways, I generally didn't like this film for numerous reasons. I just wished it could have been more like the book.Final Score: 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What kind of zombie movie is this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh boy. About time Hollywood made a big-budget zombie blockbuster. It's a genre that has been succumbed by the crappiness of low-budget horror. Unfortunately for the former, Hollywood failed bring uplift the Zombie genre. Instead, Plan B Entertainment has given us a cliché-ridden, CGI heavy zombie blockbuster that had nothing to do with the source material except for the title and the fact that the protagonist is a UN employee.It took a while for World War Z to get finished. Re-writes, re- shoots. I thought all those delays was just the work of a masterpiece in the making. I thought wrong. Over 200 million dollars have been wasted on this. The movie is just like any other summer CGI blockbuster. Except that there's CGI zombies this time. Not only that, the zombies act like a swarm of bugs when they are bunched up on each other. The protagonist Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) isn't interesting and all the bloody zombie violence you would expect is dumbed-down for a PG-13 rating to cater to younger audiences. There is one good thing though that World War Z brought that is worth noting. It is one of the few movies to watch a zombie epidemic happen on a global scale. It's a globe-trotting movie like any other but it is quite interesting. World War Z has the potential to be one of the greatest zombbie movies of all time. The source material was perfect for a movie, or a TV show at the most. But Hollywood screwed it up and we got a generic blockbuster instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Book is Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much wrong with this adaptation of the Max Brooks penned book, but that's an entirely different review. I just want to address what I dislike about this particular film and all its shortcomings. What bothers me most about this film is that without the association of the bestselling book, this film wouldn't be paid any mind. It's sloppy, especially when it comes to the CGI wall of zombies, which is over-simplistic and an obvious McGuffin, as are many contrived plot devices that spur forth the plot. The only similarity to the source material is the use of multiple countries, which is so obviously forced to accommodate the change in script. Brad Pitt (who is just playing himself) is given Christ-like status as he is the only one who can travel around the world, not get infected, save the life of an Israeli soldier, and find a solution to the virus. Instead of detailing the worldwide economic, political, and military interventions of a zombie war, this film just follows one inept guy as he lucks out again and again against the zombie foe. The ending is the most infuriating aspect, as it leaves everything on an ambiguous note, even though the entire film follows the one person who can supposedly save the world, and he does. Turning a book about the real world impact of a zombie apocalypse into a point and click adventure starring Brad Pitt means you cannot finagle an up in the air ending to seem deep. Either they should have streamlined it further in order for it to be another zombie film, or the book should never have been adapted, which would have made everyone happy in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can Max Brooks resell the film rights given the book went unused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine Max Brooks, who wrote the book by the same name and which was the supposed source material for this big budget popcorn film, sitting down at the premiere and wondering if he wandered into the wrong screening. Some film adaptations stray from the book, this one used nothing more than the title. However, out of sheer financial power, the resulting film comes across as a fast-paced, slickly produced action-adventure movie. The badly-coiffed (was he growing out his hair for a future role while filming) plays generic good-guy: smart, paternal, intrepid and, as always, good-looking. His globe-trotting would have exhausted James Bond as he searches for a way to quell a zombie (and is there a more stupid concept?) outbreak. Violating George Romero's prime directive, director Marc Forster's zombies in this particular outbreak run and are pretty scary when provoked. However, when not in attack mode the actors forced to play them look distractedly unsure what they are supposed to be doing - some stand still while others bang their heads against parts of the set and others nash their teeth in what is supposed to be intimidating but is mostly just dopey. Maybe give them some clearer direction Marc? Speaking of zombie rules, apparently helicopters don't count as noise as we see in Fort Israel but singing (and everything else) does (if a zombie crashes into something does that send all the others running?) Of course, you can complain ad nauseam about the plot and logic but you have to give it up for the expensive looking and engaging set pieces most of them involving plans or helicopters. Although the movie decidedly decelerates and loses its big bucks sheen in the final act, the non-stop, edge-to-edge excitement entertains up to that point. In short, the cliché' is to impress people by saying the book was better, if anyone tells you that here you know they didn't read it given the film bears not even a passing resemblance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(45%) A big budget, globe trotting zombie horror/action movie that feels very much like cut scenes from a video game glued together. The biggest issue here though is the characterisation, as the movie unfolds we learn next to nothing about every single person in the entire movie. Mr Brad Pitt is a married man with kids and a job with the UN and that is pretty much all we ever learn about his character, apart from him being more than able to smash open zombies heads with a heavy metal bar, and he is in almost 100% of the movie. Overall though it is a decent fast zombie movie if that's all you want, but it's nothing more besides.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and faster acting too! No really, I fell asleep 3 times, 3 nights in a row trying to get through it and finally gave up on the last 10 minutes.After watching the trailer I noticed "no zombies" so not knowing what to expect what the creatures would be like, I had high hopes. I thought okay, looks like a decent horror flick with plenty of action and with Brad Pitt? Actually, thought the wife would enjoy it more than I. There just wasn't enough of the usual zombie stuff here, lots of computer generated special Fx action scenes though. I guess I'm more into the blood and gore "Zombieland" "Shaun Of The Dead" genre. Both by the way are quite entertaining with plenty of laughable moments.Sorry, nothing special here except Brad which can be absolutely perfect with the right part, particularly ones where he's not talking with an accent.This might have been a better experience for those watching in theaters. But even on Blu-ray with a Dolby surround speaker system, just not enough excitement here. As of today they've managed to gross over $500m so good news for those who enjoyed it. We'll more than likely expect a sequel "World War Z 2"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if i'm honest was not expecting much from this film but how wrong i was! I'm a great fan of zombie films and was not disappointed with this one, the action scenes were intense and plenty, the zombies themselves were also different to any i have seen before they were fast, strong, aggressive and slightly intelligent. it makes a change to see a zombie flick thats does not entirely center on one area or a group of survivors, in this film u saw the world dealing with it and how one man risked his life to find answers. my advice watch this film because in my opinion it could be the start of a new zombie film wave (hopefully) don't compare this movie to others like dawn and land or even diaries of the dead! it is a whole new outlook on living dead films and i hope to see more like it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Z Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a Zombie apocalypse movie on a worldwide scale, an idea based on a book by Max Brooks. I enjoy the pivotal movies of the genre, in particular the likes of the Omega Man and Romero's Zombies series. A summer blockbuster budget offering it does not lack in spectacle, ambition and special effects. As such it works pretty well. However as a contribution to the Zombie body of work it is poor.Director Marc Forsters' credentials are illuminating. He handled the big budget of Quantum of Solace satisfactorily, but added little to the tradition of Bond in a fairly soul less movie. The Kite Runner, a much smaller budget with a far better script, was a great success though. Here his ambition of a worldwide epic never gets started. The opening United States sequence is strong enough, but the characterisation of Brad Pitt's persona, Gerry Lane, is shallow, his family are simply irritating. On more than one occasion I hoped that his children were devoured in a single zombie bite. So as the family backstory bites, so irritation levels rise. When the action moves to the Middle East the sequences are impressive and exciting, but the final forty minutes are devoted to a cat and mouse denouement which should have lasted four minutes.If you are looking for a big budget spectacular, you will not be too disappointed. If you are looking for a strong plot, a great screenplay and a compelling zombie story you will be very disappointed.</fullReview>

It just seemed like any other zombie thriller out there and in no way compares to '28 days later'(in my opinion best zombie classic) which if your looking for a good zombie movie i strongly recommend over world war z. To me it was just another zombie flick and didn't really have anything special to remember.Some of the acting is okay and some is excellent,however, i think it lacked originality.i would overall recommend you watch 28 days later before and then watch this movie. its not anywhere comparable to the zombie movie classics such as Night Of The Living Dead,Zombieland,Zombi 2 and Dead Alive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Production values alone are the only thing keeping this in the 5-10 range of ratings. Great effects keep this worth watching.However, coming from a zombie book, this was an extremely disappointing effort. The infected hardly act like zombies until the final act when they are "dormant". They honestly reminded me of the dark stalkers in I Am Legend, which was a huge disappointment considering I (and I'm sure many other book fans) were expecting either Romero zombies or at least Dawn of the Dead remake zombies.Funny thing is, the theatrical ending we got was thrown in at the last minute while the original ending was cut. I almost wish they would have included this extra footage just to make the DVD/Blu Ray worth owning, even if the theatrical ending is the only part with true zombie-like behaviors displayed.Worth owning for genre completionists, but it won't be something you find yourself wanting to watch very often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great thriller, filled with impressive visual effects and intense suspense. The set design of this film felt grandeur and spectacular, which I felt was great but it inhibited some much needed emotional human moments. Something this film had plenty of were jump scares, which can only be seen as effective in a zombie movie. I did like the realistic tone that was present throughout, making me believe that a zombie outbreak could really happen. Unlike I Am Legend, I thought the way World War Z solved this global catastrophe was believable and eye- opening. Of course the star of World War Z is Brad Pitt, and he does a great job in my opinion portraying the character. My real problem is with the actual character itself. It seems as if this guy is invincible and can overcome any obstacle that comes in his way. I didn't read the book so I'm not sure if that's how the character is written, but it did draw me out of the movie at times. The ending felt very rushed which did affect my grade of the movie; however this is a solid film with more style than substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Exciting Zombie Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays, zombies are the craze in the entertainment industry. Earlier in 2013, we had Warm Bodies and there have also been television shows focusing on the undead, such as the fantastic TV series, the Walking Dead. I dreaded this movie because like any other Internet user, I paid attention to the production problems this film encountered. It is much better than I thought and is action-packed and even though it's relatively bloodless, we have ourselves a giant action spectacle. While we associate zombies with being slow, this film had them moving at high speeds and I think that was a neat twist in the tiring zombie genre.Marc Forster's film is about a U.N specialist named Gerry Lane who survives the original zombie pandemic along with his family. Now that he is safe, he must go on a race against time to find a cure and keep his family safe.The acting in the film is actually really good. But that's not surprising with Brad Pitt in the lead who constantly proves that he is a diverse actor. While a tad short on character development, Brad Pitt certainly leads the way as he finds himself in the midst of all the action.Overall, World War Z is a rather different take on zombies and the film feels fresher that way. It's a bit uneven at times, but there is just way too many things to like about this film. The special effects are really good and though some people question them, I think it takes some time to get used to, especially with me being a Walking Dead fanatic. Despite the troubled production, this film is highly entertaining and I hope there is a sequel down the line. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

This film plays it safe in all the wrong ways in order to get its PG-13 rating and thus totally removes the thrill and the reasonable/logical action that should be there. The film could also be dubbed World War Hype since the entire popularity of this film is based on people hyping it up as the "big budget zombie movie you've been waiting for" but ultimately playing to the larger non-zombie loving kid audience. The film's plot is totally fractured, making no sense at time and producing characters which haphazardly run across the screen and are destroyed (bloodlessly as a Disney movie) with no good reason or point. Nothing moves the plot along... because there is no point here but to blindly make money. Terrible, heartless picture which in my book is the worst zombie film ever made... because even as other films are very very bad... none had the audacity to put this much money behind it and be quite so cold and calculated in its execution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly non gory yet exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While most movies having zombies as the primary antagonist are basically hack and slash flicks, with copious amounts of blood and gore, World War Z takes a different path. The director, Marc Forster, although known for directing mainly drama films, does a really good job. He gives us a very straight lined, fast paced and relentless film. It takes you around the world tracking the source of the pandemic, while zombie hordes bring chaos everywhere. That twinge we feel in our gut isn't nausea but tension, which is rare. The most expensive zombie flick ever made, it follows Brad Pitt as former UN investigator Gerry Lance who travels to North Korea, Israel , Newark and anywhere else where ever the source of this mysterious carnage seems to have its origin. Initially reluctant to leave his family and go on this mission, and having witness this outbreak first hand as the virus hit Philadelphia, he relents and accepts the proposal from the government for his family's safety. His travel to zombie hot-spots for the same gives us a vivid image of the undead, how they turn and mutate, and even co-operate in attacking humans. We have fast paced, thrilling chases from the hero's point of view and also broad glimpses of destruction from a security camera or a helicopter. Brad Pitt, as expected, delivers a superb performance, doing justice to the role of Gerry Lance. Overall, World War Z presents an abundance of relatively plausible action, smart solutions and useful lessons for the apocalypse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I made the mistake of reading a few reviews here before watching this film. Or actually I don't know if it was a mistake, because I was positively surprised. There were lot's of bad reviews, from different aspects, and therefore I postponed watching this for quite long.Glad I watched it tho. It's a very well made movie. Pretty much everything is good here, from acting to soundtrack to visuals. The script is maybe the weakest link. I haven't read the book, so I can't say how this compares, but there are few things that bothered me a bit. First, it's a bit of a mess, a lot of things happen, places change, people change. It does manage to stay quite consistent, but it at times feels like it's multiple episodes of a series edited together. Kind of James Bondy in a way, they don't stay in one place for too long.The beginning is tense, it goes full throttle quite quickly, but then changes pace back to normal quite soon. Korea and Israel are parts of the story that feel a bit rushed, and there's a scene in Korea that goes a bit "Pulp Fiction" and doesn't exactly fit the atmosphere, a weird decision from the film makers if you ask me. The Israel episode is a bit ho-hum also, not bad, but .. I don't know.The finale in Wales is very different again, that episode goes much deeper into characters and stealth action, very well made and enjoyable.People have said it's not a proper zombie movie without blood and gore. It's true that there's very little of it. I don't mind, since I'm not into gore. Actually this was really good choice, since you don't need to look away from the screen all the time and wait what disgusting stuff they thought of this time. Only downside of this is that there are a few scenes, which actually look censored, you'll snap out of the movie and you get conscious of the camera. There is a scene which is quite long where Brad Pitt "takes care" of a zombie, but it's kind of like softcore porn where the camera man is bit too careful for the camera not to "below the waste" so to say. It's a bit obvious, which is not good, even tho idea and intention is good.Anyway, I really enjoyed it, it's very well made in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Usual feeble plot basis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie itself was fairly entertaining - but I really don't know who writes these things - they need to be taken out and shot. Quite frankly the tired old "suspend disbelief" routine just doesn't wash - it's an idea to have at least a LITTLE logic behind it. In this case it's the incubation period of 10 seconds. Really? And it spread around the world like wildfire - and as one "expert" mentioned "aircraft are the perfect vector" - allowing of course that zombies make good plane pilots. With such a fast incubation period I fail to see how such a disease could spread much beyond the distance they could walk/run - and certainly not to other countries. This is pretty much "how to use more than one brain cell 101" (which the writer patently failed to do). I wish they'd treating people like complete idiots. Would it really cost them much to pull in a few people that have knowledge of the area they're making a film about?Otherwise entertaining - but typical of many USA movies - you've just got to try and forget they've shot themselves in the foot before they've even started.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Movie Must Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War is a fictional movie. I love action thriller but I am not a big fan of movies based on Zombies and Aliens. But as Brad Pitt is the lead in this so I decided to watch.It's a long 2 hours 15 minutes movie with some surprises, shocks and has some great graphics. Pitt is amazing as always. This movie show another side of the Pitt as he is a family guy now and unlike Fight Club and Troy he is more of a family guy and is motivated by family.The movie has a logical conclusion which you will hardly find in any fictional movie. The supporting actors have also performed very well.The movie also highlight the important aspect of our lives that we are very much prepared to fight each other but we are not at all prepared to fight the other forces and disasters. And no one really know what to do during these time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to another interesting movie from Brad Pitt. After a few creative roles, this one was a shock. I was aware that the rating of this movie was low, but didn't read any reviews or spoilers. After coming on Prime, I decided to watch it. In the first 10 minutes I started to worry about the acting. Another 10 minutes and I started to worry about the plot. Than I thought maybe the movie was a parody. The first funny scene was when Brad Pitt decided to pull the RV he is driving to the side of the road after seeing incredible devastation. The scene just didn't make sense during a crisis situation. Then he parks the RV at a grocery store, assuming no one will steal it and starts loading up on supplies, along with hundreds of other panicking, desperate people. The situation is so bad he has to shoot someone. He walks outside and is surprised his RV has been stolen. After that, I couldn't expect much from the movie. After making it to safety, the viewer finds out Brad Pitt is important enough to be briefed on the situation. Eventually the word zombie comes up. Wow, that it what the Z was for in the movie title. I couldn't take the movie that seriously after that surprise. Another weakness is the cardboard characters. No depth, no emotion, and no ambiance. If you view the movie as a lesson in how not to make a movie than it becomes more interesting. Watching the phone scenes was really a torture. Hopefully Brad Pitt seeks more interesting role choices since his capability as an actor was limiting on this film.</fullReview>

I've seen both the rated and unrated cuts of this film, both are very good. This movie is riveting from start to finish. No filler, just action. Much like movies such as Cloverfield and 28 Weeks Later/28 Days Later you'll feel like you're in the movie experiencing it as one of the characters. It moves so well it feels like it flies by but in a good way. I recommend it. The acting is good too. Cinematography is epic and special effects are above average.

		<shortDescription>Smart plot about fast zombies that convert humans quickly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Parents Gerry and Mireille have a nice life, and the day starts normally. While taking their two daughters Constance and Abigail to school, the normal seeming traffic jam mutates into a full-blown disaster. They encounter full-fledged zombies who are very fast and very strong. The time interval between a zombie's bite and the victim turning seems to be about 12 seconds.Gerry is a former UN investigator/facilitator who got people or information out of hot spots around the world, often with help from US Special Forces of one sort or another. So the US/UN extracts him and his family after he makes his way to New Jersey. The escape from the zombies is close, and young Tomas helps them in the final steps. Tomas gets extracted with Gerry's family.Gerry is sent to North Korea with an epidemiologist. This does not go well, but Gerry does meet a CIA agent who gives him the next clue: the Israelis seem to be succeeding in repelling the zombies. So Gerry and the elite military go to Israel. On the way, they see a nuclear explosion in the far distance, and Gerry's contact with Karin is broken by the EMP.Israel's wall worked, more or less, but they did not understand that zombies are attracted by noise. Celebratory songs amplified by a PA system incite the zombies to scale the 45 foot walls, one undead body over another. Gerry does learn that zombies were detected in India well before the incidents in Korea. He heads to India, even though he has been told in no uncertain terms that India is a 'black hole' in terms of information flux. Gerry gets on the literal last plane out of Israel. He loses his UN escort, but gains Segen, an Israeli soldier whose hand he cut off...to save her from becoming a zombie.Gerry takes the Belarus flight that he is on to the last remaining airport open, which is in Cardiff, Wales, UK. Unfortunately, a zombie hid himself on the plane's lavatory, and soon starts infecting people. Gerry gets a new set of difficulties, including a plane crash and a metal spike through his gut. He and Segen trudge forward.Will Gerry make it to the WHO research facility? Will the information, which he has expressed to no one, come to light, and be put to good use? Will his family be safe? -----Scores-----Cinematography: 7/10 Mostly excellent, though some of the dark fight scenes wereSound: 8/10 No problems; though it might have been more effective for creepiness and suspense.Acting: 10/10 Excellent.Screenplay: 9/10 I liked it: action, suspense, quick thinking in difficult circumstances, and a plot that moved right along. The final segments, concerning the workaround to the apocalypse, were quite fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast paced and entertaining zombie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a big budget zombie movie that covers the immediate aftermath of a zombie outbreak. As the rating would suggest it is not your typical gory zombie romp but it makes up for this with fast paced action and a fair bit of tension. There are always going to be critics of this film, as the lack of brutal horror and gore will put some people off. I understand this but there is room in the market for a different take on the usual themes and this provides it. In keeping with modern Zombie films the zombies themselves are fast, very fast and seem to have more intelligence than normal. This leads to a number of tense and impressive long range visual scenes. The acting is solid and the story fast paced if a little far fetched. However if you are going to pick holes in Zombie film then you really are watching the wrong genre. Brad Pitt is a good actor and he does a good job of injecting some charisma into his role. I must admit I do prefer more brutal zombie films like Dawn of the Dead and 28 weeks later but I found this an entertaining film with plenty to recommend it. Worth watching especially if you find yourself in the older age bracket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contagion of the Zombie genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Decent zombie flick. I would have to say it would be third on my list of zombie films to see with The Walking Dead on top and 28 days later in second. I'm a little bit of a science nerd and didn't feel that the ending was very plausible but hey it's science fiction and there are no zombies yet so I guess anything is possible in a movie of this type. The reason I compare it to Contagion is because of the world wide factor. Not many zombie films try to focus on the world wide epidemic and instead only focus on a select group or team and there endeavors to further the plot. I like the fact that this film wraps everything up in the end. It doesn't leave much to the imagination but I like not having to over think things, sometimes. Overall it was worth seeing at least once. I don't feel that I would get much pleasure in watching it again but it was a nice change up in the common Zombie movie plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action with strong performance but not much story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know what, I think the name might be the problem. What do you expect from "World War Z"? What the hell are you supposed to expect? I asked my partner, "Do you want to watch World War Z with me?" She went, "Nooo," because she was convinced this was a war movie. The truth is that this is a much better movie than its title. The plot is not particularly original. Brad Pitt + worldwide zombie epidemic. That's the plot. Oh yes, stuff happens alright, but very little of it is noteworthy. What this movie is really about is the spectacle. The action is well spread throughout the movie, and when it kicks in, it is intense. The camera work is nice and varied, from chaotic close-ups of wrestling zombies to those expensive overhead flying shots. There are a lot of different locations and faces and guns and chaos and zombies, oh my, are there a lot of zombies. You get a feeling this movie tries to be epic and it mostly succeeds.There are quite a few actors that make an appearance and all contribute a good performance. It's a shame the contributions are short. It is mostly Brad Pit carrying the film on his shoulders, and I suppose if you are paying a guy like him then of course you want to give him a lot of screen time, but it is a shame that none of the other people stick around for long enough to make us remember them. They show up out of nowhere and disappear into the background. There is a somewhat memorable Israili woman that serves as main character's partner while Brad's wife character is not around, but that is about it.The main problem is still the plot. I suppose it is hard to make a disaster or horror movie that does not have plot problems. It is not just that the outline is simplistic. The narrative in World War Z is a bumpy ride with convenient events and nonsensical science. It feels like the world, the laws of physics and the entire space?time continuum revolve around the superman Brad Pit as it suits his cause. On the bright side, the plot is not predictable. Quite a few things happen that I did not see coming.Despite the problems with the plot, it is still a great action spectacle though and definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Zombie apocalypse film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is billed as a zombie apocalypse film and it succeeds in being exactly that which is the reason I like it so much. Brad Pitt is hit with this Zombie Apocalypse that has taken over the whole world and he has to attempt to find a vaccine to stop this apocalypse. His performance is great and he is the main guy that you have to care about because the film doesn't really focus on anybody else. His family and partners in the film are okay but you don't really care what happens to them throughout the film. The best part of this film is of course the zombies these flesh eating creatures move faster then traditional zombies. Some of the crazy shots with the zombies are breath-taking and the film never really gets better after these encounters. This film's climax is tense without really any violence and that is the key for this film and is so tense to watch. This isn't going to win any Oscars but it is a fun zombie film that I enjoyed a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..So i was a fan of the original Max Brooks novel, but had heard enough about this movie going in to know not to expect it to be anything like that...So I went into this movie with no expectations, and honestly was pretty impressed for the first half. This was a real smart, intense, gritty portrayal of how the world and its governments could react to an outbreak such as this. I find it very telling to learn that pretty much everything in this movie after Israel was a re-write and re-shoot, because i found the tone and intelligence of the film took a dramatic shift with the plane sequence. Still, this is a fairly entertaining action picture that involves zombies. I would not call it horror, as it is shot to be very PG-13, but still the film is effective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie more than I expected to. It suffers from a poor third act, but it's watchable enough up to that point. I suppose there's only so far you can take a plot based on something as clichéd as a zombie apocalypse before it runs out of steam.Much of the first two-thirds of the film works so well because it repeats the exact same sub-plot in different locations around the world, which are notable for their scenic value as much as anything else. Speaking of locations, I also got a kick out of seeing what to me was obviously Glasgow (the nearest big city to where I live) filling in for the streets of Philadelphia. It was so clearly Glasgow that I almost expected one of the John Smeaton -esque natives to begin "setting about" the zombies, thus ending the impending catastrophe before it got a chance to take hold. But no such luck for Brad and co.In summary, this is a watchable enough flick that doesn't require too much effort on the viewer's part to find it enjoyable. It's not particularly intelligent or thought-provoking, but it is watchable. That's pretty much all I want out of a piece of entertainment. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombies. Another film about zombies. They are dead men walking who are out to get us. And eat us. You can't reason with them, you can't cure them, apparently you have to shoot them multiple times in the head in some movies in order to kill them, cause being dead, but not really dead has its advantages sometimes. They are slow and drool all over the place in some films, fast as cheetahs in others, rather smart in some films, stupid as rocks in others. Bla bla bla, we all know about them. They came, they were interesting for some people for a while, many films were made about them...NOW CAN'T WE JUST MOVE ON? I really don't see what's the fascination about this idea of the "zombie". They're even more boring than vampires, which are quite ridiculous too. I mean, can you make a romantic movie about zombies? Now, cause they can't feel squat. Can you make a psychological thriller about a zombie? Now, cause they can't feel squat. Can you make a comedy about them? Well, actually you can, if you're pretending you're making a serious movie. So it's a limited subject which pretty much goes about the same way every time: they are out to get us, but they are dumb, we are smart. We manage to figure out something and they get squashed in the end. Every time it goes down like this. How many freaking movies must be still made about them then? We got the picture, Hollywood.

		<shortDescription>Exciting thrill ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I feel zombies are overdone, I really enjoyed this movie, perhaps because it's more an action film than a horror movie. This is not a Romero-style horror movie, and those looking for that will be disappointed (as can be seen in some of the reviews here). Zombies do not shamble, but rather run pell-mell at anything that moves. They are terrifying in their heedless determination, stampeding down a street or flinging themselves off a roof in an attempt to reach a helicopter.The story is minimal, and is essentially just a delivery system for a series of elaborate set pieces, but the scenes of chaotic violence are utterly compelling, and what story there is is effective, as is a good, low key performance from Brad Pitt.If you're looking for a horror movie full of gore and dark passageways, this may not be the zombie movie for you, but if you want something truly thrilling (far more so than the overrated 28 Days Later) then this is an excellent choice.Also, if you're looking for an adaptation of the World War Z book, this isn't it; a real adaptation would be more like a Ken Burns documentary. While both the book and movie are incredibly entertaining, they are so radically different that comparing them doesn't even make sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'm Legend" on a higher level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quote : Most people don't believe something can happen until it already has. That's not stupidity or weakness, that's just human nature.The movie looks like "I am Legend", but on a higher level. I thought it was an exciting and wonderful action disaster movie to sit back and watch it from your couch, with a bowl of salted peanuts, on a Friday night. The zombie concept plays a major role but ultimately it's not a real zombie movie. Where a zombie movie emphasis on bringing the pictures as gross as possible (dismembering human individuals f.e.), WWZ emphasis on the visualization of the mass hysteria that was caused by a rapidly spreading deadly virus. In my view, these shots were magnificent visualized at certain times. The mass moving like running water and how a group of brainless zombies are jumping at everything while chattering with their teeth. For me, the term zombie was shown in a very different way. And it was a very successful way eventually. The difference between WWZ and "I am legend" is not that mankind is the cause of the whole disaster, but Mother Nature made sure of this. The ultimate weapon against the calamity in the form of a terminal illness causing the creatures to leave you alone, was a new and refreshing idea. Also, it was made &#x200b;&#x200b;credible by saying that this was also applied in the animal kingdom to avoid sick targets. I compare WWZ rather with a movie like "Outbreak", but on a larger scale. Pitt played a more than creditable role. I found him masterly in "Se7en" and "Inglourious Basterds" but this interpretation may be added to his list of the better performances. He continues to keep that boyish look and always plays with such nonchalance. In WWZ the coolness in which he approached certain situations was overwhelming. The family situation wasn't a reason to go all corny and mellow and a female Israeli soldier ultimately became the ultimate co-protagonist. There were some weak points for me : 1. The totally unnecessary part with the young scientist who shot himself through the head after a slip in a rather dorky way. 2. The role that Israel supposedly played. First I thought it was a critical look at the state Israel. It looked as if they premeditated completed the protective wall. Sounds a bit the same as the rumors that apparently they warned their employers in the Twin Towers before the disaster happened. I must admit that the images of the accumulating zombies provided hallucinatory images. 3. The seemingly impossible quest for Patient Zero by Brad Pitt goes quite smoothly.Despite these minor reservations, most images were tremendously exciting and nerve wracking. The final scenes in the WHO building reminded me several times of the game "Half-life". Beautifully imaged with those destroyed labs and deserted corridors.Clealy I found it a very nice movie. And if it would ever come to a global pandemonium, but not with zombies but a kind of Ebola version that rapidly spreads around , I already have a bit of a visual view of how things will turn out then !More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was pretty terrible. There was a few minutes of this movie that were actually enjoyable which is why it gets a 4 instead of a 1 or two. The part where Brad Pitt has to escort his family out of an apartment building by duct taping magazines to himself as body armor. That was the only good part of the movie. I wouldn't watch this whole movie again for 20, or even 30 Dollars. /Maybe/ 40. So the Jews just suddenly start letting in Muslims into their secret zombie proof walled city for some reason? Why? "It's less of them we have to fight..." Yeah, no. There are so many zombies out there, they had to make CGI waves of them, lapping at the walls (a la first episode of Spongebob Squarepants). So now they are worried about a few bus full of people? "I mean...we had to seem like the good guys in this movie, so uh, that's why we did that. Our government is a Theocracy that literally openly hates Muslims, but suddenly when they are getting eaten alive, we grew a heart 10 times too large like the goddamn Grinch." And why does Brad Pitt HAVE to travel to all of these places at the drop of a hat? "I'M LOOKING FOR PATIENT ZERO!" Yeah man, you should fly out to this prison, I heard something about it...or something. "I'M GONNA NEED SEAL TEAM 6 TO BACK ME UP ON THIS!" Then when Brad Pitt gets there, they just tell him everything was destroyed in a fire...OK? Why didn't they just tell them that on the radio? This is a military installation. Why are they not in radio contact with each other? Do zombies halt radio waves now? Oh, but by the way, we have this prisoner here you didn't know about. You can question him- I guess, but he's crazy so don't bother. "WHATS THAT CRAZY MAN?! TRAVEL SOMEWHERE ELSE?!?! OK! This movie is almost as corny as Signs. Only kids should legitimately enjoy this movie as they are not smart enough to see how corny it really is. Like Independence Day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z has a rushed ending and is choppy as a whole, but thanks to pulse-pounding and wonderfully visceral set pieces succeeds as one hell of a thrill ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z has an abrupt ending, and it isn't much of a cohesive film, but rather a string of extremely intense, pulse pounding, and wonderfully visceral set pieces. Definitely see it for some summer bait to chomp on and one hell of a thrill ride. The story: The plot, generally, is supposed to be set on Max Brook's (interestingly son of comic genius Mel Brooks) bestselling mock-non fiction book World War Z. The novel essentially is a retelling of the history of the world after a global outbreak of the zombie infection. It aims at portraying a satirical while realistic display of the brain chomping carnage, and provides all of the juicy political and social commentary any zombie fan could ask for. Now for the movie, they use the term "based on" fairly loosely. Cut most of the statistics and commentary, this movie is about action and white knuckle suspense. Newly retired UN worker Gerry (Brad Pitt) has chosen to settle down with his family, who reside in Philly, but his plans of relaxation are far from fruition as his life and world are hit stuck with a disaster. Zombie infections begin to breakout all over the world and here's the worst part; not only do these zombies run, they topple and climb over/up each other like ants. Also, without giving to much away, they can multiply faster than you can tie your shoe. Soon, cities crumble, and millions of the population have been "lost" as Gerry and his family are escorted to battleships in the Atlantic for protection. But Gerry is far from safe as he is called upon to help aid research and fight against the plague across the world, and let's just say that things get tasty. The good: The film's action set pieces are genuinely spectacular and create some of the most nail-biting and intense moments of celluloid that I have experienced since Zero Dark Thirty. They are big, bad-ass, and also very in range. While some have big-scale moments of terrifying moments of awe, think back to the ant-like antagonists, others are quieter and build up to an explosive boil of terror and excitement. The great pacing also truly helps create the fluid nerve- racking energy that is so present during these scenes. Pitt is also good as the lead and is subtlety charismatic and like-able as our reluctant survivor. The rest of the cast is strong and do a perfectly serviceable job. The special effects are solid and create many frightening and spooky visuals of carnage throughout the film. The bad: The film has been notable for being a partial disaster in it's production and writing and it does slightly show. The film reminded me more of The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), or a Mission Impossible; it skipped around from enjoyable scene to scene, but you don't always have a clear reason why. The ending also cuts the film of a little to easily and leaves more of an implied resolution instead of a more finite and tactile one. Also the action is far to often shot in some scenes with shaky-cam, and it becomes at times distracting and or confusing. I also wish we had some more close ups of our blood thirsty protagonists. There is one entertaining use of social commentary in the movie, but I wish that it would take the time to make a few more clever insights into the potential-filled lore. My take: World War Z isn't as much of a scary movie, but rather one that is immensely thrilling and suspenseful. It isn't prefect, but it sure is a nice slice of summer entertainment that will get your heart going, even if you leave the theater wishing for a little more food for thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been Much More Violent,but the Movie is Filled with Great Action and Drama,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z is a fantastic movie with a very well written storyline and an outstanding cast.The movie was a very interesting turn for Brad Pitt,he hasn't done a movie like this in the past and while the story did sound really cliché,getting a great cast like this is what makes it much more enjoyable and the point that the zombie apocalypse story has been used several times before isn't a huge issue when actors as talented as Brad Pitt are in the main role.My only real problem with the movie is that it really avoids being violent,whenever you see a character get attacked by a zombie,you see very little or no blood,and the zombies design aren't very gruesome, which I thought lost the effect of the movie being scary,they probably had very little violence to keep the 15A rating.World War Z is a very enjoyable and action packed movie that I would recommend to all fans of action and adventure films. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt),a United Nations employee is enlisted with a group to protect people from a zombie pandemic that is spreading quick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an amazing film but can be quite jumpy at some parts. I watched it with my mum and she loved it as well. I don't think this film is suitable for anyone under the age of 15 as there is allot of blood in the film and the film can get quite in depth. There is also allot of violence such as explosions and guns. There is allot of amazing special effects in this film such and the explosions look so realistic and the scene is really good as the film is needed a big set. I think Brad Pitt was a great character as the main character in this film as he makes the film like realistic. This is a perfect film to watch if you like action and horror. I also as love how they create the plain effects as it looks so realistic and the weather change make it set the scene really well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen the trailer for this film, and I was quite excited when it came in the mail. I watched it, and I did enjoy it. I, being 18, understood what was going on... mostly.I did like the action areas, and the storyline was both logical and entertaining. Also, the acting was to the standards of your average Hollywood blockbuster.However, this is a zombie movie, and the idea has been done many times before in films and the storyline was just an adaptation of some of the original zombie movies.Still though, this film is definitely worth watching and I would recommend it to anyone who is into action-packed, shoot 'em up films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"World War Z" was a really good surprise for me as a moviegoer. As everyone else, I had heard about all the in-fighting, re- shoots and other problems that plagued the production.All I have to say is that I am glad the movie was made. True, it has little semblance to Max Brook's novel other than the premise and some characters, but that might have been for the best. Also, finding out what the original "third act" and ending of the movie was going to be, I'm sure glad they changed it, it would have been horrible had they kept it! After being bombarded with prequels and sequels all summer long, it was refreshing to see an original story being brought to the screen. Honestly I went in not knowing what to expect. The trailers had been pretty effective and I had some anticipation wanting to see the movie, but they were tempered by all the bad publicity this movie got before its release. I left after the screening having been pleasantly surprised. I liked it more than I thought I would, and in a year populated with so many mediocre and outright disappointing movies, "World War Z" was a most welcome change to that annoying pattern.Now they have a good director to continue this budding franchise. If done properly, this should be a solid series of movies. Juan Antonio Bayona is a good director. I have seen "The Orphanage" and it is a good little movie, done for next to nothing in terms of budget, but very a very effective supernatural thriller. I have not seen "The Impossible", but the movie garnered positive reviews by enlarge and was fairly successful at the box office.I am looking forward to the next instalment of "World War Z".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Entertaining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z is a movie based on Max Brooks book by the same name and the similarities ends there. Having read halfway through the book, the movie is nothing like its book counterpart. For long World War Z was said to be in production hell having issues with directors and budget and naturally I was skeptical about it. Brad Pitt was announced to be the lead but it never came off as a consolation. Marc Forster as a director made it worse for me to accept it. No offence but Quantum Of Solace wasn't a gem of a James Bond movie. I was genuinely concerned as I was a zombie genre fan first and foremost, and wanted it to work out well.I was surprised when I read on IGN that World War Z was not a complete let down. Believe me I had not kept my hopes high for this one so a news like this did revive my hopes for the same.World War Z starts off with Brad Pitt's character Gerry Lane, a former UN personnel stuck in traffic with his family. And without a moment to spare, all hell breaks loose from there. Gerry and his family is put in the midst of the zombie outbreak and along with it, so are you. The first hour or so Gerry is hellbent on taking his family to safety and with his contacts at the UN he does accomplish it but in return he is sent to investigate the source of this zombie outbreak and he goes off on his mission moving from location to another in search of a possible cure.We, as an audience, are just dropped into midst of the ruckus in like 10 minutes. There wasn't much time for character development. Of course horror movies never demand character development but this is not your usual horror flick where characters are used as cannon fodder. In, World War Z, the only character you end up caring about is Gerry and thats about it. Although he has his heart with his family tucked away far from the zombie outbreak, you just don't feel the same. World War Z works out very much like a disaster movie. Think 2012, think The Day After Tomorrow. WWZ plays out exactly so, where instead of natural calamities you have a zombie apocalypse to deal with. It wasn't the zombies thats of interest here, it was the setting which was direly grim. It reminded me a lot of Contagion. That being said this is not the movie for hardcore horror fans and for those who go in expecting to see brain- eating zombies or gore would be disappointed sorely. Its more drama than horror. Then again this ain't a rehashed 28 Days Later. Where 28 Days Later had a solid storyline WWZ falters there a bit?the story of the movie could be encompassed in one paragraph but that owes to the fast pace that it'd got too. Tense moments were aplenty and yes the first as well as the second half of movie does put you at the edge of the your seats. I was never given a moment to breathe. I was either taking deep breaths or keeping my breath in at times of those tense moments. The 12 second zombie-bite-turnover time was what made it tense most of the times. There was this scene where Brad runs to the edge of a building, away from his family, having had zombie brain matter in his mouth and counting to 12 to see if he'd turn?it striked to me as ingenious writing. My problem was that it was all too fast. If you watch it individually and as snippets its quite gripping but the team globetrotting their way to find the source of the outbreak felt way too quick?WAAAY TOO QUICK! I know my statements could contradict here but this is exactly how I felt.Brad Pitt was awesome as Gerry. The film was solely on Brad Pitt's shoulders and he's put in his best here. A bit of credit could be given to Mireille Enos, she didn't have a lot to do here but she was convincing as Karin Lane. Apart from these two, the only cast members worth mentioning are Daniella Kertesz and Pierfrancesco Favino/Peter Capaldi duo each having the shortest of screentimes ever.Qualms regarding the ending was inevitable. The finale felt very unsatisfactory. The right word would be 'precipitous'. Everything that had it going for the movie was put to an abrupt end. PG 13 hampers the experience a bit. But not completely; all the slashing/hitting and the gore that followed, they were all implied and it makes for some effective scenes as well. the The second half didn't come up to its first counterpart and had serious issues with the pacing, where the first half screamed urgency the second half was more akin to playing a stealth game, taking its sweet time to keeping you in strain.World War Z is good movie but far from perfection. But of course you have to give in to the makers for coming up with something as entertaining as this despite going through the worst of production. It also has an intense score composed by Marco Beltrami. PS: Watch this movie in 2D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoided at 1st after loving the novel but it's excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being an avid fan of the novel, I was skeptical and avoided going to the cinema to watch it. The novel is incredible, one of my all time favourites&amp;I feared they couldn't translate it to film. I'd heard &amp;read lots of negative reviews, situ many saying it was unrealistic one man could save the world and it was not true to the heart of the novel. I was especially disappointed to hear they were fast zombies! However, a friend convinced me to watch it and I loved it. It was intense and made me jump on more than one occasion. The fast zombies actually worked for it, when they're streaming over the wall in Israel it's terrifying. What would you do? What could you do? The Dr/expert who dies so suddenly came under a lot of criticism too but just because there is a zombie apocalypse it doesn't mean humans stop having accidents! You knew he would not last but was shocked at how fast it happened. I found Gerry to be convincing and he wasn'tjust a 1 dimensional character/hero. He was trying to save his family. My advice is to watch with an open mind. I found it thrilling&amp;a great zombie flick. Even though I love the novel.</fullReview>

After a short blackout, behold.. Brad Pitt is alive in the wreckage strapped to said seat, and some girl he saved..injured Brad and the girl he saved now find themselves in Wales (yes.. Wales. it's the apocalypse and they have to go to bloody Wales) and are able to navigate from the plane crash site in the middle of the countryside to a medical research facility no problem without encountering any zombies. they just rock up at the gates to the facility then they find a solution, terminal disease, a camouflage allowing humans to burn and nuke zombies at will. and now we can wait for Brad Pitt's World War Z 2 ..</fullReview>

The pundits may argue, "they wanted to make it palatable" HELLO, zombies? If you want to make it palatable, put a slide rule in their hands and make their blood-lust be vegetarian. Sorry, Mr. Pitt has done far far better work. Even the cinematography was essentially your basic soap opera cut away from speaker to speaker. Did they run out of money? Or just ideas. Thank God for Shaun of The Dead. Nothing short of brilliant. You cant fool an intelligent audience with the use of colors and contrasts. In the cold light of day they are simply makeup on a pig. Perhaps they should consider doing a different hybrid such as The Curious Zombie of Benjamin Button. A Zombie that grows backward to a point where its back to its human form. Then you have an interesting premise. Or at least adopt a few.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a zombie movie showing the outbreak, not just the aftermath</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For many years I've been waiting for a zombie movie showing the outbreak on a global scale. This is what "World War Z" does, and it deserves more appreciation for that. Instead, critics moan that it was like "28 Days Later" with more budget, missing the obvious difference between those movies even though the titles say it all. For once, here is a zombie movie which gives an idea of the world wide consequences of the disease and which does not play in a post-apocalyptic setting but shows the outbreak right from the beginning. I also could not care less whether the movie was true to the novel. Nor did I miss gore. There is plenty of gory schlock out there, watch that if you need gore so much. What I didn't like though was the science. This movie had the potential to give you the feeling that this could actually happen, but the science was just too awkward for that. Still, I found the movie very entertaining, and it has a couple of very memorable scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i wanted zombies, i got zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i get that not a lot of people will enjoy this movie, in fact, if you said you hated it i wouldn't be able to argue much because i completely understand why someone would hate it. but as a huge zombie fan, seeing zombies redesigned, refurbished and given an interesting lore, i couldn't help but really enjoy this one.Brad Pitt was decent enough, it's not exactly his greatest role ever, but he's in no way bad or even just mildly average. he's good for this kind of character and pulls it off pretty well. a lot of the other actors did a good job also, their delivery was great and they all looked the part, the only problem i have is the two daughters, they're not exactly bad actors, they just come off as kind of annoying and only good for bait when needed, it is a good thing they aren't in it much but with that being said, some of their dialogue is pretty terrible, which brings me to another problem, the fluctuating script.this movie was written by a group of people and it's pretty obvious, whenever someone is giving exposition about the zombies, it is brilliant, hearing details about how these zombies hunt and behave never gets old to me, i've always found the idea of studying the flesh hungry dead fascinating and this film delivers on teaching you awesome zombie facts. however, some of the characterisation is a little text book, especially with Pitt's family, but like i said, they aren't in it for very long and the few cheesy lines are easy to forget.in a zombie movie, all i want is to be fed facts about the particular kind of zombie we have this time and then seeing the zombies act out what we've been told, this movie gave me all of that, their are a few script problems but it succeeded with the zombies running and biting aspect so that's good enough. this is all just me however, so whether or not you will like it is probably hit or miss from where i'm standing.still worth a shot though, everyone needs to at least try it.quick history - when Quantum of Solace came out, i didn't like it very much, i felt that Marc Forster's intentionally confusing editing style just didn't work for a bond movie, part of a franchise that has already established it's own style and specifics. after hearing that he would direct World War Z, i thought that maybe, just maybe, his editing and directing could be just what the zombie genre needs for a return to the big screen, after seeing the result, yes, it definitely worked, his style matched the the idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"World War Z" Tech Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z transforms Max Brooks' novel into a successful big screen film through excellent filming, acting, and score. One of the most unique and intriguing parts about the making of World War Z was how they created this new generation of zombie. To produce this fast moving and extremely intense monster, the production team relied on the use of "CGI". The team recorded many different types of movements and simulated these mobs in order to create the perfect mass zombie attacks. In addition to creating zombies, many different parts of the film were computer generated. For example, during the thrilling attack in Israel featured in the trailer, when the helicopter is crashed by the hoard of zombies, which was created through CGI. Whenever a certain scene proved too difficult to shoot traditionally, CGI was used. In addition the successful integration of CGI, the traditional camera work, acting, and music played an equally important role in the film. The fast and sometimes shaky camera-work along with the cuts created a thrilling feel to important scenes. Both the camera-work and music worked alongside each other to generate the right emotions in every scene. Obviously, the acting was important to the film as well, without the acting of every character the film would not have been as successful as it was. With the combination of all of these elements, World War Z will go down in the books as a unique and successful adaptation of a novel into a major motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Z for Zombie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"World War Z" is a magnificent piece of art where all my stereotypical notions of hatred toward "Zombie Movies" need to be put aside and all that humanistic principles having been heeded by the heroes must be taken into a tremendous amount of consideration. This is said to those - including I myself - who have always considered such movies to be repulsive and crummy. I have constantly associated Zombie Movies with the top-notch work of art by Francis Lawrence, "I Am Legend" and that's it. The rest of them were just cookie cutter unimaginative repetition of the first few decent pioneers with teeny tiny alterations to the main theme. Back to "World War Z", there is a lot to be said about this awesome movie. First and foremost, the special effects were simply legendary. The Special Effects Technician needs only a few minutes to keep the viewers on the edge of their seats. In my humble opinion, the first twenty minutes is absolutely fantastic where the audience realizes the gravity of the situation and starts identifying with the humans in the movie. That would not have happened if the Special Effects Crew hadn't been so creative and professional and if millions of dollars hadn't been spent making all this possible. This consequential quality is circulated throughout the movie. In the middle of all this rage and struggle for survival, the movie uses a couple of symbols to make a few points. "Blanket" which the little girl asks for at the beginning of the movie symbolizes the warmth of home which seems to be far-off even after ten minutes. Wrapping your son or daughter in a blanket helps them feel loved and cared for even when you are gone. The main gist of Warmbrunn's story in Jerusalem is that governments attempt to solve problems rather than prevent them from becoming problems in the first place. This governmental habit costs many people their lives in the zombie wars (and probably doesn't help us much out in the real world, either). There's no doubt that Israel is viewed in the film as the promised land (until it's not). The wall that Israel has built around the country ? explained and justified by a Mossad agent as a natural reaction to Arab aggression since 1948 (although Palestinians are not named specifically) ? suggests that the film-maker and writers wanted to portray the Jewish state as a (temporary) shelter from zombies (read Arabs). The stupendous amount of stress laid on this part of the movie makes it perhaps the biggest cinematic propaganda for Israel which I honestly didn't dig at all. This is what this part of the movie is trying to depict here: Okay, so Israel falls to the zombie plague, too. But? at least it lasted longer than everybody else. Plus, when Pitt is trying to escape to the next location, he takes Daniella Kertesz as the brave, beautiful Jewish soldier along with him. The cinematography is stunning. The techniques used in this movie are the ones I've mostly seen in documentaries where the bird's eye view describes everything thoroughly and the viewer seems to grasp the magnitude of the problem. The acting is totally defendable. The whole ensemble is professional even the small-time actors. Brad Pitt being the lead actor has shown to be a totally versatile one whose fabulous acting stuns me whenever I see him on the silver screen. All in all, "World War Z" provides the professional viewer with a second chance to reconsider their former thoughts about such movies and simultaneously endeavors to convey some political as well as religious messages in some particular parts of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big budget Hollywood meets cool zombie flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised at how good this movie was, and how much it exceeded my expectations. Pretty boy Brad Pitt was in it, but other than that, I thought it was one of the best movies of the year. Definitely the best graphics for a zombie movie ever.The movie is 2 hours, which I think more movies should be now a days. The scope of how big budget the movie was, mixed with the fact that it has just as good a story as the best zombie movies ever, was what makes this worth seeing. Seeing entire cities being burned and overrun by hordes of zombies, has never actually looked convincing. All other attempts at this scenery pale in comparison.I really like Zombie movies, and vampire movies, and sci fi and such. As long as they are really good (examples off the top of my head: Bram Stoker's Dracula, Elysium, Minority Report, Alien series, Dusk Til Dawn). This is right up there with those movies.I honestly believe this movie will creep up in acceptance over a few years, unfortunately. People will have trouble opening up to it, but over time, they will give it a chance and see how great it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as bad as most Zombie fans say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know a lot of people who watched this movie because they were fans of previous Zombie shows and games (The Walking Dead, Dead Rising, and more) and hated it. However, they all said pretty much the same things: "The Zombies weren't scary enough." or "It wasn't violent enough." They didn't say anything about acting, writing, music, direction, or anything else. I'd guess that most people you know who have watched this movie have said something like this as well.First off, I have to praise the writing and story of this movie. I don't know how well it adapted from the novel, but it was amazing nonetheless. It was more about people working together to survive, as well as traveling across the globe to find a treatment, if one even exists. It is fairly predictable at times, but that doesn't really matter because the characters are so awesome and lovable. Gerry may have seemed like this fearless guy, but you could tell by his performance by Brad Pitt that the whole time, he was as scared as everyone else was.In terms of violence, I'm glad that somebody finally decided that blood doesn't have to drown the screen to have a good story. Not only that, but it still have a good amount of violence in it, so stop complaining, Walking Dead fans. As for the scariness of the Zombies, I can't say that they were up to par with their most stereotypical image. That aside, they were still just as scary by their actions. The way they run and attack at high velocity when they are near prey is just as frightening as a "dead" corpse slowly walking toward you, giving one plenty of time to kill it off before it reaches them. The score was good and fit the tone of a war-apocalypse setting. The CGI was top-notch (though I don't really like the part where the Zombies pile up onto one another in particularly crucial scene)and overall, was an amazing movie worth your time, whether or not you're a Zombie fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting so much from this. Its had the Hollywood treatment.Firstly why are "Zombies" making bird noises? In the mass scenes they just look so fake ... good CGI should not be this obvious.Why does the hero of the story escape every single situation that has the rest of the world deadlocked? Even a plane crash can't stop him. Idiotic.Apparently you can just waltz up into a plane's undercarriage and simply appear in the main cabin. Really the Zombies in this film were not real enough to be effective, and the plot is so dumbed-down from the original source so as to be unrecognisable.Even in the 'tense' scene where Pitt's character sneaks around a Zombie infested lab complex to find a cure wasn't scary. By then I was so bored by it all to even care if he succeeded or not.It doesn't add anything at all the the genre in fact it makes the whole Zombie thing seem a little tired.It is totally outdone by a television show (The Walking Dead), which is such a great shame considering the potential of the source material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'World War Z' is a thrilling zombie epic that provides plenty of adventure despite suffering from a simplistic episodic structure and zero character development.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombies have become the 'it' monster of our generation. Forget the vampire and werewolf antics of the 'Twilight' films and its imitators; they don't have squat on a cultural phenomenon that echoes societies contemporary concerns regarding social unrest, anarchy and the complete loss of social order. Sound like I am thinking too much into it? Think again. Since George Romero single handedly invented the whole genre with the release of 'The Night of the Living Dead' in 1968, this is a genre, like a sharp sci-fi film, that can provide a fabulous basis for social commentary. 'Night of the Living Dead' was concerning race relations in the 60's, 'Dawn of the Dead'; a scathing remark on consumerism and 'Land of the Dead'; an examination of Bush era politics and class divide. You would be surprised how the mindless consumption of human remains by the undead is such an effective method of philosophical observation.George Romero knew this with those aforementioned films and so does Max Brooks. This is a name that has become synonymous with zombie enthusiasts, having written the well-received zombie novels 'Zombie Survival Guide' and 'World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War'. This is where the movie review starts to come in. The makers of this film adaptation did not seem to agree with what Romero and Brooks knew. They have removed the political and social elements present in the book and made it more of a straightforward action thriller.'Quantum of Solace' director Marc Forster gets the job of managing the chaos. Not just on screen, but behind the cameras as well. Or so the rumour goes. Even so, rumours or not, 'World War Z' never feels like a film which had a turbulent production; despite an episodic structure that lacked a certain sophistication in the writing department. If you had your cynical hat on, you could very easily see it as Brad Pitt rather unimaginatively going from A to B to C while evading the hungry dead. Forster directs 'World War Z' in a much more comprehensible style than the dire 'Quantum of Solace' and he never allows the film to slow down for a second. Within 10 minutes, zombies are swarming cities and Brad Pitt has no choice but to travel the globe in search for the origin of the virus; with the hopes of finding a cure. We go on an exotic world tour to many exciting locations such as Philadelphia, New York, Jerusalem and?Cardiff? Yep, unusually but quite entertainingly un-climatic, the finale of the film does in fact take place in no other than Wales; where Peter Capaldi, in a piece of poetic coincidence, plays a character credited as W.H.O Doctor.Horror enthusiasts and B-movie genre geeks were the only people who ever saw zombie movies and anyone who appreciates the films of Romero will understand how far the genre has come. It's taken as long as one of the undead for the genre to be picked up by the mainstream; but here we are. It has become so popular and mainstream that Brad Pitt stars in one! ? one of the biggest stars in the world.This induction into the mainstream ethos has not rendered the genre unchanged. The most significant modification has been the introduction of what can be only known as "running zombies". There are Romero zombies and the sprinting 'Dawn of the Dead' remake zombies. 'World War Z' takes the running zombie craze onto a whole new level. It would be a mistake to think these things were dead. They move faster than anything that has a heartbeat and have a prolific predisposition to rugby tackle anything in sight. Including walls. They're unlike any zombies seen on your screen before and may actually have you soiling yourself in their sheer ruthlessness.With the film trying to appeal to a wide audience, there is a deplorably limited use of blood. This does not work in the context of a zombie film. Gore goes with the territory. 'World War Z' is essentially zombies for dummies and anyone who knows the genre will feel that. Nevertheless, this is not for us sad fans, it is for the younger generation and the people who are going the cinema to watch 'Avengers Assemble'.Therefore, inevitably, with modern technological developments and current cinemagoer tastes, we get CGI zombie hordes. The CGI is perceptible more than it should be but the effect of seeing an ant like colony of zombies invade a walled city makes you appreciate the tools in which it was made possible. There is some genuine shock factor and unique surprises in store. The invasion of Jerusalem being at the forefront of my mind. Us zombie fanboys have always dreamed of seeing a sequence like this.The film is a missed opportunity for something with real bite, instead of a project that has a bit of chomp and limited flesh. At it's core, this is the American hero saving the world story again, but if you can get past that cliché sentiment; 'World War Z' can provide you with the perfect mix of thrills and excitement.

		<shortDescription>Wake me when the war is over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"World War Z" is a roller coaster ride ? an exhilarating one as long as the ride continues. It's when the movie starts to take itself seriously that the ride comes to a halt and we are left swinging in the air.A plague breaks out that turns humans into zombies with the sole purpose of infecting other humans with the same condition. After experiencing a sudden zombie attack in Philadelphia, Gerry Lane, played by Brad Pitt, an ex-United Nations investigator, is coerced into returning to investigate the zombie pandemic.If you want something done, ask a busy man. After saving his family from the zombies, Gerry has a number of hair-raising escapes from the many afflicted areas around the world, at one point lopping off the zombie-infected hand of an Israeli girl-soldier. After blowing up a plane he is travelling on, and surviving, he has a eureka moment and comes up with the solution to the zombie plague.Although not totally new to cinema, zombie takeover has never looked as spectacular as it does in this film. However, if behaviour on our streets outside nightclubs at 2 a.m. is any guide, it appears that the zombies took over some time ago.Although the aerial shots and mass scenes of the zombies in "World War Z" are breathtaking, the action slows when it gets to ground level in some rather ordinary looking sets. A lot of the action takes place in back alleys and derelict buildings, with much repetitious zapping of zombies seemingly inspired by video games.I must admit that my eyes started to glaze over between the first zombie attack and Gerry's arrival in Jerusalem where the action picks up again. The movie slows in the middle, and again at the end when the story gets bound up in some complicated science, and then becomes mired inside a laboratory in Wales.The Jerusalem wall scene is amazing as the zombies climb all over each other to get to the top. Of course, Israel really does have a similar wall along the West Bank, obviously to protect people on the inside from people on the outside. Is there sub-text here? Surely the filmmakers didn't try to bury a less than subtle political message in what is essentially a mindless horror/action flick.The movie also feels a bit déj? vu. It is similar to Spielberg's "War of the Worlds". It was aliens in that case but much of the action plays out the same, especially the way the zombies suddenly appear, and in Brad's attempts to protect his family. Mind you, I enjoy revisiting Spielberg's movie every now and then, but I can't say that I'll need another helping of "World War Z" any time soon.Although the film delivers some amazingly spectacular scenes, when it starts to take its pseudo-science seriously, it's time to reach for the No-Doz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To close to I Am Legend! 5/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I'm in two minds about this movie. In one way, the film is quite intense and you do stick with it to see the outcome, but in another way, it was just too close to I Am Legend which was a much better movie. The director done a good job with making the whole zombie situation seem real, and the effects were brilliant, but the pace of the film made it seem much longer than it was. All the way through the film it is pretty intense, unlike I Am Legend which makes you care about Will Smiths character, and of course, his dog. I think that was what was missing in this movie. Don't get me wrong, it is made very well and all of the characters put in good performances, but no one mentioned the people that they have lost which would have brought emotion to the film. In all, it's full of entertainment and intensity, but it wasn't amazing. Watchable!Round-Up: After not seeing Brad Pitt on screen for some time, due to all of the kids that he is being a daddy to, he is quite moody in this film and, in some ways, his performance didn't really stand out. It wasn't that surprising that he was playing the man who saves the world, but he could have brought some sort of emotion or wit to his role. I know that the emergency of the situation was why he was so intense, which was why Will Smith was an excellent choice for I Am Legend because he was able to mix it up. All of the other characters don't really get a chance to shine in the film because the focus is manually around Brad Pitt, even though the whole world is being swarmed by zombies. It's obvious that everyone surrounding this movie had faith in the project because of the high budget, and judging by the money that it made, you can tell that Brad Pitt can still pull in audiences, but this won't go down as a classic.Budget: $190million Worldwide Gross: $540millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there zombies movies were one man has to save the world. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flat Zombie Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This should have been a good movie. The casting is great with Brad Pitt and Mirielle Enos with solid interesting choices for bit parts and extras. I liked that it was multi-cultural cast and not all white. There is a plot with a beginning middle and end but the direction lacked intensity and pacing. The beginning is a boring montage to setup the apocalyptic world run amock with Zombies. They wasted an opportunity to create some chills and surprises. This is no 28 days later. I can't understand how so many set pieces could be filmed in the most boring ho hum way possible. It's clear that the script provided a solid blueprint but the director went for poor shot selection. Furthermore, you have Brad Pitt in a movie and I saw more of his stupid haircut and chin then his eyes. Last, after seeing the film last night, I woke up and couldn't even remember the ending. I had to ask my friend how the movie ended. I was reminded that it ended with another boring montage. If you want to watch a good Zombi flick put in 28 days later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost relentlessly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They use to stumble around aimlessly, flailing rotting limbs at you pathetically as you casually jogged by, or swung a baseball bat at their heads. But no more. Yes, it seems that in the 45 years of existence that zombies have had on the big screen, they've evolved from shuffling corpses to monsters who pose a real threat. Danny Boyle taught them how to run, and made them more of a virus that we can recognise than cadavers craving brains. So now, zombies have gone global. Not just in popularity, although in that regard they certainly have with the help of AMC's The Walking Dead (amongst others), but they have swept across the globe. And only Brad Pitt can save us.After about three years in development hell, where there were more script re-writes and cast and crew shuffling about than you could keep up with, World War Z is finally here. Based on Max Brooks' multi-layered and heavily satirical novel that is told from the points of view of many different characters that reside throughout the globe, World War Z was always going to be a hard sell. Zombies are all the rage so naturally Hollywood wants to get their fat fingers on their piece of the pie, meaning World War Z was going to be a blockbuster. So, is it the giant pile of rotting brains that most fans were expecting, proving incoherent due to the many changes made throughout production? Surprisingly, no, and in fact it proves to be almost relentlessly entertaining.After an array of obligatory news-reel footage foreshadowing the upcoming apocalypse, Gerry Lane (Pitt), a former UN employee, with his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and two daughters are stuck in Philadelphia traffic when the zombie attacks explode on the streets. They are saved when a helicopter ordered by an old friend of Gerry's, Deputy Secretary- General Umutoni (Fana Mokoena), flies them to a U.S. Navy vessel in the Atlantic. Gerry is then persuaded to search for the source of the cure when it is made clear that he and his family will be booted off the vessel if he refuses. His journey will span the globe from South Korea to Jerusalem to, most oddly, Wales.It's a flimsy plot to say the least. Most zombie computer games have more depth in the story, so we simply follow Gerry as he trots the globe. But where the film fails in story and character development, it makes up for in some outstanding action scenes. We are no longer in one man versus a horde of zombies mode, this is on a global scale, and when they attack, they attack in a ferocious swarm, piling on top of each other to reach massive heights and when they engage, they fling everything they can at their victim. Director Marc Forster, who proved himself inept at action in the Bond dud Quantum of Solace (2008), redeems himself somewhat with some fine set-pieces. The attack in Israel shows off some stunning CGI, but makes sure Gerry doesn't get lost in the mayhem.Another overwhelming positive is the performance of Brad Pitt, who proves that he can carry a franchise-seeking blockbuster with ease. Even at 50, well past the age you would expect of an action star, he injects his criminally unrecognised acting talents into what is ultimately a thinly-written role, and again shows that there is more to him that simply being really really ridiculously good-looking (to quote Derek Zoolander). The supporting cast either don't get a look in or don't last long enough to make an impact, so Enos, James Badge Dale, Elyes Gabel and Matthew Fox barely register. Fox especially, after having his entire sub-plot cut down to the point that I didn't realise he was in it until the credits rolled.The ending, which was re-wrote by Drew Goddard, reeks of indecision. The original ending, that saw a huge zombie battle in Moscow's Red Square, was canned, probably due to the political undertones of the setting, and the new, more low-key ending, was introduced to give the movie a more satisfying and coherent climax. While by no means a bad ending, for the film to start out global only to shrink to a sneaky one-on-one final note, it's somewhat of an anti-climax. It adds actors Peter Capaldi and Moritz Bleibtreu and offers some hope with a potential cure, but it just feels like everyone on board had no hope for the film. Given World War Z's commercial success, a sequel has now been greenlit (Pitt saw this as a first of a trilogy), so ultimately, the film did what it came to do. The many relatively minor quibbles aside, this is a success. But a film can surely only survive one troubled production shoot, so the people involved with the sequel will need to clear their heads and step up their game.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie yesterday, and let me tell you, I couldn't leave my seat. Not once! Having never read the book, I can't really provide any negative criticism, but i can guarantee that I am going to read that book. I haven't really seen any GOOD zombie movies, so this is an all time high on my list. They couldn't have chosen better actors for the movie, the plot was easy to follow, the zombies looked pretty realistic, if zombies can look realistic, and it certainly captured my attention. Not to mention that there was actually a purpose to the movie. The only thing I didn't like about WWZ was that a certain death in the movie was so cheesy I laughed at it. But anyway, I'm really glad I saw this movie. An overall 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

Personally, I think zombies are the coolest types of monsters ever created, but it seems hard find any good zombie movies.With his movie I found that I was on the edge of my seat and found myself jumping and knocking the headphones right out of my ears and this never happens. Also I love how creepy the "zeke's" (zombies)move. Over all a very entertaining movie. The only thing is that the movie cuts short at just under 90 minutes long and could have been longer. I would recommend this movie to anyone that love zombie movies and likes to entertained. Not a professional review writer by the way so like it or not. Z O M B I E S R U L E!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of new concept in Zombie world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know Zombie comes from virus. No cure, no medicine to reduce, people who turns to a Zombie can only be killed by destroy the head (It seems Zombies respect the theory that only brain death is really died). In this new Zombie movie, the turning process is still so quick which only needs 10 seconds, even faster than this in Resident Evil. Now here not exactly same as Alice, Gerry is a normal person but with Seal training, retiring at home enjoying his family happiness. He was reluctantly convinced to take part in the action looking for the cure of the virus. He is kind of stupid, so does his wife, they tried to not go, but any guy who can brainstorm will see why they are rescued and allowed to stay in the ship. So I have to say the director waste nearly 3 minutes to explain a plot which supposed to be an obvious thing. However, from the three minutes if we consider it from the direction of Peter, maybe it makes sense. Maybe it is what the real Peter wants to say. He wants to company with his family but he could hardly let his career go. Finally he has to get back again.It is possible that this movie will have several continuations, because of Darwin's Evolution Theory. But if so, it probably will be as same as Resident Evil. So my suggestion, making some differences or let it go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There isn't much you can do when a Movie is made as a PG-13 when it is a Genre crying out for an R. But here it is. Take it or leave it. If You take it, there is a lot of Sprawl and Globe Hopping, neither seen before in Zombie Movie Land. Gone is the Flesh Tearing and Muscle Munching, in its place there are Zillions of Zombies speeding and jumping around like Track Stars and numerous Aerial Shots that make them look more like Insects than the Living Dead.That's what you get and a lot of it. But there are problems Infecting this, that are quite Troublesome. Like building a Wall around Israel. You could read that as an Isolationist Political Statement separating the Israelis from the rest of the Middle East. Then there's the Biological Weapons thing. When Brad Pitt determines that some sort of Germ Inoculation is needed at the WHO, the Scientist there respond like a Clerk at Baskins Robbins, 31 Flavors to go, We got your Sars, Ebola, Smallpox, and many more, take your pick. It is handled like these Caretakers and Makers of Biological Weapons are the Worlds Friend and Saviour. That is up for Debate.The Movie is Entertaining somewhat and the PG-13 Kids will most likely Eat it up. The Humongous Budget and Superstar Brad set this apart from others of its Ilk and that alone makes it a sorta Silly diversion from the usual Crunch and Munch Movies. Zombie Film Fans will most likely be Furious at the Gore-Down but others may find it Action Packed enough and give it a Pass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The initial traffic jam scenes will be remembered every day when I am going to work. Reality nightmare. The helicopter viewed scenes where mass frenzied zombie attacks climb up walls. Really grand. The face of the victim shut up in the glass observatory. Masterpiece. The dental close-ups are as close as one can get to rotten breath. However.Parents with 2 girls on board run away not chase after trouble. Brad's face is the outdoes Cher and Lady Gaga's poker faces. Asthma is when someone has difficulty to breathe out, not in. It does not go away with a pat reassurance. How does a zombie get locked in a plane restroom and sit quietly till a poodle smells him out ? How does one survive a piece of metal as big as my arm piercing one's colon and spleen ? How does a plane with a missing back half level out ? Having one disease or infection makes one more susceptible to further diseases, not less. When you immune defenses are down you become easy meat.We should suspend belief when watching a movie.

		<shortDescription>Everything "World War Z" does well can't make up for a vapid, undeveloped script and fundamental mishandling of the zombie-horror formula...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Just a note, this review is based on the unrated cut of the film, and I have never read the original novels that inspired this release)Within 10 minutes of the Brad Pitt starring vehicle "World War Z", I recognized the problem. This is one of those movies that is made by a creative team that fundamentally understands the sort of film they are trying to make, and aims at their target carefully... Before turning 90 degrees away from the target and firing at random due to an awful script and the mishandling of its material. It's a film that does so much well, but tragically fails at what it sets out to do by missing that target.How does it miss that target? Well, let me explain.The film stars Brad Pitt as Gerry Lane, a former UN employee. One morning, while driving with his family (I'm not going to list their names of the actresses, because, well... they don't matter in the story), a full-on "zombie" attack breaks out, forcing them to flee and seek shelter.After meeting with a former colleague, Deputy Secretary-General Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena) aboard a navy vessel, Gerry agrees to accompany a team on an increasingly dangerous series of missions all over the world, searching for the cause of this "zombie" outbreak and a way to try and stop it.The acting is good. Pitt plays a convincing man who is struggling between his duty to try and remedy the situation, while also not wanting to lose his family. Mokoena plays a good (albeit generic) military figure. Daniella Kertesz is very good as "Segen", an Isrealli soldier whom Gerry saves. And just to be fair, though she's essentially useless in the film, Mireille Enos is decent as Gerry's wife Karin. I will not comment on the two actresses portraying their daughters, because they just weren't very good, and I don't want to say something nasty about a child actor.And to be honest, much of the production is very good. The direction by Marc Forster is very competent, and he's grown tremendously as an action-director since his mess-of-a-Bond-film "Quantum of Solace." The music by Marco Beltrami was a blast, and had a very cool, simplistic, almost retro sound. And the photography, set and production design was great. (Although the "Zombies" looked bad, I'm sorry.)However, a film with such decent acting and such a strong visual production is what makes the glaring problems stand out even more.The script is the first issue, and arguably the biggest issue. One of the fundamental necessities for a film is to have characters we identify with, and either go through development or don't go through development as a result of the events they face in the film. This film makes no effort to establish characters beyond the most rudimentary, painfully clichéd set-ups and robotic dialog. Nor is there any effort made to develop characters. These didn't feel like people, they felt like people-shaped wind-up toys. And the pacing of the script doesn't help. It's so break-neck that you can never actually get a feel for anyone, nor do you get the chance for the gravity of the situation to set in. Which is a shame because there are so many potentially amazing scenes. But unfortunately, within 30 seconds of any scene starting, "zombies" show up and we're onto the next scene after a prolonged chase sequence.The other huge problem is how the film mishandles the idea of "zombie"- horror. You've probably noticed that I've made an effort to put the word "zombie" in quotes. And that's for a reason- the "zombies" in this film... aren't really "zombies." They're just sort of a crowd of sprinting people who bite you once then keep moving. They're not scary. In fact, up until about the halfway mark on the film, they weren't even portrayed as undead, they were portrayed as sick, rabid people- which made it really rather jarring when you suddenly see a corpse's fingers moving and realize that they technically are supposed to be "undead."But the film seems to want to portray zombie's as a feverishly paced marathon team that just sort of rams their way through things. And it doesn't work for the horror or suspense, because every encounter with a zombie turns into the same sort-of chase scene over and over. The film gets boring really quick when you realize that every 10 minutes, we're going to see the heroes sprinting away from a huge group of people. With the exception of one scene set in Jerusalem, the film's horror and action scenes just came off as a bore to sit through.I'm quite sad at how this film turned out. I'm a huge zombie-horror fan, and I thought the trailers for this film made it look like it was going to do something new and exciting. However, the reality is that a poor script and mishandled material are not new and exciting. They're about as old as film itself, and they're still a chore to sit through, even with good performances and pretty visual effects."World War Z" gets a 4 out of 10 from me. It's only for hardcore fans of the actors or "zombie" films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good zombie movie, just not World War Z</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this on DVD. As soon as I heard that Brad Armpit was cast I knew I wouldn't waste money to see it in the theater.I'll save every fan of the source book the time and let you know up front that this movie had nothing to do with the book at all. They should have named it "Random Zombie Movie Made For The Purpose Of Casting Brad Pitt In Something".It's a decent, if reheated, representation of the zombie genre. The acting, writing, and production values were far better than the average zombie flick. Let's face it, even in the sneered-at horror genre, zombie movies are given low regard. I guess they got around that by casting an A-list actor who could command more money.Other user reviews have said it all, so I'm not going to rehash. I just have to say that if this is a prequel, it's a decent one. They need to go on and make a follow-up that follows the book. If they don't, this will remain a cinematic abortion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great take on a tired genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z must have one of the shortest first acts in film history. The first act, usually the first half hour is generally where the conflict is introduced. This film opens with Gerry Lee, Brad Pitt, a former UN investigator having breakfast with his family. Five minutes later, BAM, zombies. No time is wasted getting straight to the conflict. Begin second act.The story is not complicated: zombies take over the world and Brad Pitt is obliged to save the day. The assault of zombie movies over the past few years has been such an onslaught that by default the genre itself now gives me an automatic feeling of "I don't care." World War Z is very much another zombie film, but a damn exciting one. Even the script's name for becoming a zombie, turning Zeke, is subtlety refreshingly"It's not what you say but how you say it." With cinematic excellence, Director Marc Forster breaths new live into this tired cliché. It's all in the delivery, and WWZ is all delivery.As Gerry Lee (Pitt) travels the world trying to solve the mystery behind the infection causing people to turn "Zeke," the scenes that unfold during his expedition are so exciting that story arc is incidental in comparison. A memorable scene is when a military commander becomes infected. He's got about ten seconds: "I'm a goddamn Zeke?I got this one boys." He puts a bullet in this own headThe exotic set designs of the adventurous locales are the highlights of the film. First an adrenaline pumped escape from an infested Philadelphian housing project, then to a US navy ship at sea, then over to a US military base in Korea where a massive fire fight breaks out. Next Lee arrives in Israel where the citizens have protected themselves against the Zekes in a totally ingenious, but vulnerable walled up construction. The set design here is just incredible and when the situation goes awry, and things start blowing up, the visual effects are some of the best around, bar none.For more film reviews visit getthebonesaw.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitt helps keep the Zombie Apocalypse Genre fresh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally had low expectations for this movie (even as a huge fan of the Walking Dead, I'm feeling "zombie-fatigued"). But the idea that zombies are both fast and "swarm" (like ants crawling on top of each other) to climb a huge wall is a unique twist that could make this movie fun to watch (written May 2013).And it ended up being a blast. It introduced an original story-line to the zombie-apocalypse genre. First, an origin to why the zombie plague started. Second, the potential for a cure? And lastly, Brad Pitt as the best dad/survivalist ever. If I had to pick my team to battle the zombie apocalypse, I'd want Brad on my team, no matter that he is 20 times more handsome than me. (written July 2013)Afternote: If you saw the movie, don't read the book. In this rare case, the book falls short of the movie. The book is told in "documentary-style" based on memos etc. that recall the events "after" World War Z. The movie tells it in real-time which is how it should be experienced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just another zombie movie? Not quite..World War Z was a bit of a refresher for me in this overdone movie genre. As I have seen my fair share of zombie movies, WWZ puts a new twist on the 'Zombie Virus'.I couldn't help but notice key similarities between WWZ and the latest zombie console game, The Last of Us. Normally we expect nothing but long drawn out chase scenes involving a plethora of bullets, but WWZ and TLOU actually contain some strategy. Obviously if you are in an abandoned building and you make a lot of noise, zombies will come. However, the way WWZ executed these scenes, was much more favorable to me then all the typical crap out there.Instead of 30 zombies running down the hall quickly just because a door shut, they become more agitated as they hear more sound. Not just one thump.I did not read the book so I cannot make comparisons to the original content, but this was definitely entertaining and intense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So much has been said to be "wrong" with this movie. There's so much nitpicking that happens when people go in wanting a full-scale war movie because the word appears in the title. When the zombie aficionados have their qualifications for what makes a film worthy of their genre. And when fans of the book make the tragic, all too common mistake of wanting their book turned into a movie page by page, as if movies were not a medium of their own.When all this is put aside, it's a good movie. It's thrilling and scary in the moments which feel either creepily realistic or completely unbelievable. The entire crux of finding a solution is on one man who, granted, could have used better character development. But you root for him if only for the fact that he's smart, quick thinking and compassionate. While it's not some artistic masterpiece, it's entertaining. Which is obviously the endgame- an entertaining world-wide zombie attack movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure this movie wasn't perfect, I understand other people commenting about that, but the fast paced action and overall plot kept me engaged and wondering what would happen next. I'm not one to go into detail about every single facet of the movie, I prefer to simply mention the things that stood out to me that I liked, and the things that I disliked. I enjoyed the special effects, they were realistic enough to shock me and gave the zombies a surreal edge that made them scarier whilst still keeping the essential human traits. At times when the 'waves' of zombies chased the main characters it looked awesome!I think it really added that sense of suspense that in my opinion is a key ingredient in a good zombie flick. I must add that I am quite partial to zombie movies, and they have to be pretty terrible for me to dislike them. lol I think this movie is watchable, maybe not one you would watch again, but definitely worth a look for any avid horror movie/zombie flick fans. Those who watch it simply to perve on Brad Pitt may be disappointed that he has really tried to go for the 'average joe' look in this film, so I wouldn't watch it for this reason.The love story angle isn't over done here either, which is a refreshing change. Also I like the fact that it shows all different cultures throughout the globe and different countries, because I get SO sick of movies that only show America, and are lucky to even MENTION any other countries let alone religions associated with other cultures. This diversity made this movie more interesting and unique to me. Anyways, this is just my opinion, it won't be enjoyable for everyone, but I hope this information helps give an honest, clear image of the type of film this is, and might help readers decide whether it sounds like something they would enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Typical Zombie Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw posters of this movie, the first thing that came to my mind was the "Zombie Attack". Keeping in view my history with the "Zombies (in the fiction off course)", I thought of this movie as a typical horror with some Brad Pitt "Extra".But When I actually saw the movie, I came to know, I was quite wrong in my perception. As opposed to many other movies on the Zombies subject, this particular movie is a actually a good combination of horror, thriller, disaster &amp; some good humor lines. One thing that I particularity noticed was the bloodless action making it perfect for family and audience of all ages.Brad Pitts performance was excellent as usual and I think his presence in the movie would have attracted a lot of Pitt's fan base (even those who do not like the Zombie genre). Other actors performed well too.All in all it was a good movie and I give it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying no, I didn't read the book, and probably won't.My Favourite zombie movies(in no particular order)are: 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead(2004), Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland, and now World War Z.I hope that helps some of you decide if you should watch this.Now as for why I thought this movie was well done, it basically took all of the elements I love from zombie movies, and did away with the ones I hate(for the most part). One good example is that they didn't have stupid/ignorant characters doing idiotic things to get others killed(apart from the singing...), which seems to be a staple in most zombie movies.. They made a great roller coaster ride, with some nice plot points that set up great sequel possibilities.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An "A" to "Z"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love zombies movies. Always had. Sometimes this can work in two ways: Either you can be very critical and demanding when a new "undead" movie comes up, or you can love it. This on, i love it. Fast, crazy, killing machines zombies. Not the traditional clumsy, slow, stupid ones. These undead "Zekes" works like ants, or like bees, or wasps. They work in groups, like a swarm. Probably if the word "Swarm" was used on the title, it would give it too much away. OK, not perfect, sure. The final part, kinda like an anti-climax. Anything else after the Israel wall-climbing, attacking scene, almost everything would feel like an anti-climax. The acting, is Brad Pitt, and that's all. The rest, is just for show... oh, i forget the zombies. The "virus spreading zombie turning thing..." awesome! I could say that the best actors were the extras. Not because the main characters were bad constructed, but because this new "zombie behavior" (fast, swarm like) is so well plotted that... in one word. In a couple of years i'll still remember how the persons acts when they "die" and "get undead" like zombies...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even though you've seen many zombie movies, you should give it a chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the start of the movie, I thought: Oh yeah, here it goes again, happy beginning, stupid dialog, poor scenario and always the same virus. But, I was wrong. The tempo of this movie was very fast. There is a lot of going on. I thought it was predictable, that it was going to be stuck on one scene till the end. But, that was not the case. The scenes,the places, the characters kept on changing, except the main lead of course. It's not a very scary movie (said from a person that is easily scared), but there are some scenes in which the biggest cities in the world are shown, filled with zombies at every corner and it makes you wonder how you will react in a similar situation; when there is nothing but panic and chaos. It's not some memorable movie, but it's very entertaining and definitely worth seeing (at the cinema also).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me tell you what's Hollywood right now:Get back in time, give 1.000.000 dollars to Ed Wood and let him ad some popular stars and striking special effects to his movies. You get bad movies that lots of people are willing to see.1. Techno-dance music for a zombie movie. Terrible. 2. Mediocre acting and poker faces almost all the time, you should be really scared in that kind of situations, not only worried about. 3. Lazy scriptwriters, maybe 2 lines of short sentences per minute on average. You really don't need it because of point 4. 4. Lots of 'Playstation' effects, bodies and objets breaking the law of gravity and physics everywhere, explosions and more explosions. 5. After 5-6 days, the main character has the same neatly trimmed beard length. Under zombie attack, the rest of characters devote part of their time to shave daily and trimming their mustaches. 6. If your name is Brad Pitt, then a hole in a flying plane can not suck you outside. 7. if you have a 15 inch piece of metal pierced through the body and you fall to the ground from 5 meters high, you say 'ouch'. 8. if a zombie grabs the end of a rifle, you can catapult him into the air, even if you're an skinny woman. 9. There's no fat zombies, they are all athletes that can jump long distances, climb walls and run very fast.It's hard to differentiate a modern zombie movie from watching somebody play a video game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just finished watching this movie. Being a big fan of zombie movies having faithfully watched "The Walking Dead" since release I have to say this is a really well made zombie movie. The idea behind the cure was actually really well thought out. It was simple yet very convincing and possible. I also liked the speed of the zombies in this movie. The zombies in the Walking Dead T.V show movie slow and in this movie they can run which is a refreshing change for zombies. I also loved the fact that there was no one single person in charge.I rated this movie a 7 out of a possible 10! Worth the watch! Don't believe the posters that rate this a 1 or a 2 because the CGI effects alone make this movie a 5 as a starting point...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really excited for this movie and was honestly disappointed even though I still gave it an 8 out of 10. I was expecting to have a new favorite movie and didn't get that far haha. but still liked the movie. If the movie was to possibly be nominated for a Oscar it would be for best visual effects.Brad Pitt I think sunk to much money to make this movie to have it not be as good as it was made out to be. But the movie had a good story for a zombie movie and had a fairly substantial amount of intense action, when it comes out on DVD I wont hesitate to make this movie part of my collection. But this movie is not one of those movies that makes you really anxious to come out on DVD out of theaters.I was really glad I went to go see it and recommend this movie to almost anyone. This movie could be anyones movie. So spend 10 bucks to go see it in theaters or spend 20 bucks to do as much home viewing as you want but if you are a movie goer you should most definitely see this movie. Thank you for reading my review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Former United Nations employee Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) must keep him and his family alive from the zombie apocalypse. Gerry Lane has to travel around the world with a race against time in order to find an antidote and stop the zombie outbreak. I was very excited to watch World War Z, the trailers looks superb and not many zombie apocalypse films are released now a days. Before the film was released I found it had a huge build up in order to become the summer blockbuster. However is World War Z the action packed thriller for this summer? No, no it isn't. The story of World War Z was very vague as the summary of the story is simply "Kill Zombies. Find Cure". Many scenes in the films were very predictable for example there is a scene where Gerry Lane is in a near death experience however because your only twenty minutes into the film and his the main character, you know he will survive. World War Z was an 'enjoyable' zombie film however it was nowhere as good as Dawn of the Dead or Zombieland. Brad Pitt is the only well known actor in the film who does a brilliant job of playing the character Gerry Lane. I thought that Gerry's wife and children had the most pointless roles in the film, I would of preferred it if Gerry Lane was by alone and had to survive the zombie apocalypse instead of hiding in a helicopter or plane for most of the film. The only part of the film I particularly enjoyed was when Gerry was in Jerusalem and there was millions of zombies behind a wall forcing them to jump and collide on each other forming a tower of zombies. The CGI in the film was impressive however I felt like there was too many zombies in World War Z if that is possible and the actual zombies in the film can only be described in two words fast and furious. The filming locations are interesting in this film are you don't know where Gerry is going next from the streets of Philadelphia to slums of Jerusalem. This film was directed by Marc Foster who directed Quantum of Solace which in my opinion was the least best Daniel Craig Bond film. As this is an action movie there are no complaints about the action in this film, they were brilliant many action scenes of the films made me on the edge of my seat wanting to know who Gerry is going to escape this disaster. When the film ends it finishes with this quote "If you can fight, fight. Be prepared for anything. Our war has just began". This quote left me thinking please don't say they are making a sequel for this film they have found the antidote to stop the zombie horde for gods sake. All in all World War Z was an enjoyable zombie apocalypse film, the action scenes lead you at the edge of your seat. However the story could've been more thrilling or at least more entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Bad As I Thought It Would Be (SPOILER ALERT)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The action begins when Brad Pitt and his family are trying to drive through Center City Philadelphia. No family in their right mind would ever do this. Suddenly a massive zombie outbreak occurs and Brad Pitt is able to flee Philly within a few minutes. This was probably the most unrealistic part of the movie as it would take about an hour to get out of that part of the city during a normal day without zombies.Brad Pitt then takes his family to Newark, NJ, presumably because it was an unaffected city. Although there are no signs that Newark has changed, Pitt decides to rescue another third world orphan, who he renames "Tommy" and then gets choppered out to sea to study the outbreak.Pitt flies to South Korea next, where the zombies have caused constant darkness and torrential rain. Pitt talks to David Morse, who has pulled out all of his teeth but still talks fine, and then Brad decides to go to Israel to pacify Arab-Israeli relations. Unfortunately, a large group of Palestinians storm Jerusalem and Pitt flees in a Russian airliner.He crashlands somewhere near England and goes to a research lab. While trying to make vaccines, he encounters a strange guy who keeps grinding his teeth and it is a little unclear if this guy is a zombie or just British, and I think this scene confused a lot of other movie-goers.Then some other stuff happens, there is some more product placement and the movie ends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombie Feature That's 'Out Of Left-Field'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Relentlessly unforgiving in its heart pounding action, unnerving our senses by delving into the unknown, keeping us fearful in suspense. World War Z is a climatic testament to the thriller genre and considering its contextual layout should be highly praised.The Lane family conduct their day as being status quo. Suddenly this breaks down when mass panic erupts around them. Having to follow instinct, Gerry (Brad Pitt) protects his family by fanatically manoeuvring through the streets of a now-plagued Philadelphia. Clearly in cinematic terms one can imagine the frantic technical style. A soundtrack to make your heart race, hectic cinematography and flashing edits. World War Z as a thriller lives to the genre's requirements. Marc Forster's direction lets World War Z suspense audiences in the dark before leaping out to unnerve. Every scene contained itself to the standards expected. The enigmatic score of Marco Beltrami captivated every tingling of my senses when Gerry was against deadly odds. The Zombies, in close quarters, were greatly effective. Kudos to Alex Reynolds (Choreographer) and Katalin Baranyi ('Zombie Coordinator', according to IMDb) for concocting genuinely frightening nemeses. Although these micro elements bring out the fear, World War Z never shifts aside the human factor. The action never overcomes the instincts Gerry, his Wife and Daughters experience. I could acknowledge all their emotions as they found themselves in a catastrophic situation. Here lies my contextual admiration for World War Z. It applies Zombie generics without indulging into blood and guts visuals. Rather we see the human condition in a raw form. Mireille Enos as Gerry's Wife simply wanting her Husband's safety makes for numerous moments of heartfelt anguish, the same can be said for his Daughters. Particularly Constance (Sterling Jerins) whose innocence emphasised the frailty of humanity, the transcendent fear shared by all. World War Z blends horrifying thrills with heartfelt concern for the Lanes in their plight. These are qualities I normally don't find in multi-million blockbusters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good attempt at a high budget zombie film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this movie I had very low expectations, I love zombie movies, but I follow the Romero school of thought rather than the Danny Boyle zombies, the slow moving masses to the fast moving superhuman. Hence I felt from the trailers that World War Z was going to be a letdown, however they manage to do something very clever in this film in that they combine the slow moving and fast moving zombies to create a truly terrifying yet wonderful experience. Though there are similarities that can be found between the infected of World War Z and the infected of the Naughty Dog game The Last of Us vis-á-vis the sounds the infected make and the way in which they move, in any case they do create a thrilling antagonist to the story.It has been a long time since I have found myself jumping of fright in a zombie film, largely because many zombie films focus more on the gory and the b-movie clichés which litter its heritage. The action sequences are fast moving and feel gritty to add to the realistic flavor of the movie but some better and more engrossing character development. I found the story could have used a stronger female character to counter balance the macho men saving the world.Overall a good film, the special effects were a little too reliant on CGI but it doesn't take away from the film. Also a more spectacular climax and being an extra 20 minutes longer wouldn't have gone a miss, but even with these flaws it still fares us to be well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edge-of-Your-Seat, Terrifying Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a messy production period, various re-shoots, and a 190 million dollar budget- exceeding the original 125 million price tag- World War Z had been expected to flop both critically and financially. Much to the surprise of most, World War Z did moderately well with critics and performed well at box office. As for me personally, I found it pretty difficult to even sit still during the film as it was a truly nerve-wracking experience. It was not only suspenseful, it was stressful (and certainly a little terrifying at times).Needless to say, I had a great time.World War Z imagines what would happen if a zombie outbreak occurred on the earth, and believe me, it ain't pretty. Humans are infected as soon as they are bitten by one of the undead, and then they become zombies too. Gerry Lane is forced to assist the UN and find a way to stop the zombies in order to secure his family's safety. From this point on, it's one exciting zombie scene after another.Suspenseful doesn't even begin to describe the tension and fear within this film. It's frightening at times, and certainly startling (I can admit to jumping at a number of occasions), and I was most certainly at the edge of my seat for most of the run-time. Indeed, I haven't seen a film this suspenseful at the cinema since last year's The Hunger Games. In fact, this is even more so.In a film as suspenseful as this one, you tend to really appreciate those small victories that occur throughout the movie, just as the characters do themselves. They give you a chance to relax before the next thrilling action scene.And the action scenes never really feel predictable or tired. Quite the opposite. Each nail-biting zombie scene is often eclipsed by the next one, causing each new action bit to be bigger and better than the last. One might expect World War Z to eventually falter as a result (and I suppose one could argue that it does at the end, though I'll get to that), but honestly, I don't recall ever thinking to myself "Gee, this scene's pretty weak compared to the last one." I was in far, far too much suspense to even give that sort of opinion a second though. There was not a single action scene in this film where I felt I could relax, and in a film like this, that can only be counted as a strength.The zombies are handled well. Some are bound to be put off by the fact that these zombies are fast (as opposed to the slower-moving beasts we're used to seeing), but they're grotesque and terrifying, making them seem immensely formidable. And the family aspect adds depth (though I couldn't help but feel a little less compassion for Gerry's wife Karin after she does something absurdly stupid in one of the earlier action scenes).The one thing in World War Z, though, that just doesn't reach the standard the film has set for itself, is at the end. I will not spoil the events that occur at the end, but let's just say that somebody gets incredibly, eye-rollingly lucky.The acting is good all round, but as one might expect, Brad Pitt is the stand-out here. Pitt perfectly displays his care for his family, and we see the stress in his face throughout the film. One could argue that his character is a wee bit bland (indeed, many characters are decidedly undeveloped), but it's hard to give things like that any kind of thought when you're so engaged with the events on screen.The score is composed by Marco Beltrami. Supposedly, World War Z received an R rating from the MPAA entirely because of Beltrami's brutal score, so the music had to be toned down to make the cut to PG-13. Still, one needn't be deceived into thinking that the score is tame as a result of this. It still provides the suspense, the emotion, and occasionally the triumph, displayed in the film. The main theme (often performed with a piano and various synthesizers) is not a theme I would've expected to work in a film like this, but work it does, and though it isn't especially memorable, it's at least different.Truly gripping, and deliciously terrifying, World War Z never loses your attention. I could hardly take my eyes of the screen once the film started. In many respects, World War Z reminds me distinctly of I Am Legend. Both had strong male leads, both were portraying family men, and both involved fighting infected humans at some point in the near future. So while World War Z isn't quite as original or daring as I Am Legend, the result is still the same: A highly suspenseful, and completely absorbing little film. World War Z is not a film I would necessarily return to (I don't think I could ever subject myself to so much suspense in the same film twice), but World War Z does exactly what a film should do, and that is entertain. And believe me; there is never a dull moment in World War Z.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something new in an overloaded genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, since they hit the mainstream zombie movies have died an (un)death many times over, and I can't help but hark back to the old days where only horror fans knew of the genius of George Romero and Lucio Fulci. Nowadays zombie movies are ten-a-penny and zombies are in the public consciousness alongside vampires and werewolves.But WORLD WAR Z offers something new: the first, straight, big-budget zombie blockbuster. Sure, PLANET TERROR skirted with the premise but with a sci-fi twist, while this is straightforward zombie stuff. It's based on the terrible Max Brooks book of the same title, but don't let that put you off; unlike the book, it actually has a structured narrative, and characters.And I loved it. I'm not normally a fan of CGI unless it's done right, but it's done right here. Scenes of the zombies attacking en masse are brilliantly conceived, and the set-piece that takes place in Israel in the middle of the movie is simply phenomenal. It's a film that also manages to be vicious and frightening without being gory, which is a fine achievement. If you thought the infected in 28 DAYS LATER moved fast then you haven't seen anything yet! Sure, the characters are thinly-sketched, but that matters little as WORLD WAR Z follows an action-thriller template. Brad Pitt's lead is both the luckiest and unluckiest guy on the planet at the same time, and the film never deviates from getting up close and personal with its undead menace. The worst thing about it is Marc Forster's fuddled direction, something that also spoiled QUANTUM OF SOLACE, but it's not a big enough to detraction to stop this from being anything other than a solid film.</fullReview>

What you get is an overblown, big budget disaster flick that doesn't look anything like a zombie movie. There doesn't appear to be anyone involved in this that knows what a monster movie should look like.Don't wait for the Hollywood rendition of your favorite parts of the book, because they're not there. By the time they gutted this, all that was left was the title.After a few years when this title is not such a hot property anymore, someone might revisit this.

		<shortDescription>This movie is fun and intense, but forgettable all at the same time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z has gotten some pretty mixed reviews since it's been out. People really like it or really like. I for one, thought it was a very fun, intense movie to watch. Was it great? Not quite, but it was still good. Let's start out with the story. A lot of people hate this movie because it has little to nothing to do with the book it came from, World War Z by Max Brooks. I haven't read the book, so I can't take it from that. I'll have to take the story for what it is, which is fine. It's all right. Not great, not horrible, just alright. I do like the fact that the main characters are also a loving and caring family, so that you have someone to root for. I also like how the ending gives a little twist, something that you probably wouldn't expect coming. The problem is that the movie intentionally leaves out a lot of needed information. Where did the zombies come from? (SPOILER WARNING!) How will we able to stop them without getting ourselves sick? (SPOILER OVER!) Those aren't answered because either A, it's an open-ending, where you can decide for yourselves, or B, it's a cliff hanger for a sequel (it's most likely that one). I don't dislike it, it just leaves obvious plot holes. This movie shines in action and intensity. There's lots of faced paced action, cool stunts, guns, explosions, eating of the flesh, and hands being cut off to avoid zombie infection. It's awesome! Those zombies are threatening. They look freakish, they're fast, and they do this teeth clacking thing that is just freaky. It makes the movie all the more enjoyable. The acting is good. Not amazing by any standards, but it's still good. Why is it not amazing, you ask? Remember; this is an action movie. Another problem I have with the movie is some of the secondary characters. They're only there to die and get killed in stupid situations. You don't feel bad or even remotely care when they die. (SPOILER WARNING!) During one scene, somebody is running away from zombies, trips, falls on his face, and instantly dies. It's sad, but not from pity, but sheer stupidity. (SPOILER OVER!) Plus, there were some hilariously dorky lines of dialogue from time to time. There are just times when they say something that just makes you want to groan. For the most part, the script is pretty consistent, but there are a few blotches here and there of dorkiness. Overall, I enjoyed this movie. It didn't leave me disappointed (unlike Iron Man 3). If you like zombie movies with likable main characters, intense action, and good acting, this movie is for you. And for those who are concerned, no, there's no gore. There's a little blood, but no gore. And I like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly okay two hours of entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with most zombie movies the plot is rather contrived and unbelievable (even if you accept the existence of zombies) but if you want to watch zombie movies in the first place that is something that you are supposed to be immune to.This is another variant of zombies being created by some virus and rapidly taking over most of the planet. As I said, the entire story is somewhat unbelievable. When I first read about zombies as a kid there was always some supernatural/magic stuff involved. I think I liked that "explanation" much better than the virus nonsense which just have too many holes in it. For example there is no way a virus could make human bodies roam around aimlessly inside a sterile laboratory for days without nutrition. Well, as I said, it is a zombie movie so one just have to get over these little issues.As an action movie with zombies as the main adversary it is a fairly good movie. The action is solid, the special effects okay and the entire movie continues at a reasonably brisk pace. Pitt is also doing a decent job of his role. There are few of the other actors that are very memorable though. The scenes where the zombies pile onto each other to scale walls and even reach choppers are rather cool. The movie is not very gory for being a zombie movie. Whether that is a good thing or not depends on the viewer I guess. Personally I do not mind some gory stuff in zombie movies.There are a few annoying parts which Hollywood always seem to have to throw in. For example, the world is on the brink of the apocalypse and Lane and his wife just doesn't want to get involved. What the f?? Also why do people always let their kids wander away in situations where they really should keep track of them? Not to mention how clumsy people always get when they have to sneak around and be silent. These things are just annoying.Anyway, this movie fulfils its purpose as two hours of action-filled but not too intelligent entertainment quite well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full of Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can see everything through this movie. Full of action and the movie really draws you in. I would definitely recommend. As I was watching the movie, I felt like I was in the scene. Every time a zombie was chasing after someone, every time the zombie was biting someone. It was very intense and the animations and acting is spot on. There was action throughout the movie from the beginning to the end. There were certain parts of the movie that I did not enjoy however, particularly the ending. Nevertheless, this movie kept on in suspense and it made me want to watch more movies of it's kind. I enjoyed this movie more than "I am Legend" which was surprising because that was a good movie as well. I really enjoyed the fact that the movie was in the view of a main character that was actually going into the chaos of zombies instead of sitting back and waiting for something to happen. In conclusion, watch it. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been better, but still decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This zombie movie features Brad Pitt as the main protagonist, Gerry Lane. This worried me at the beginning. However, the movie was surprisingly good but could have been better. This film is nothing like the book and I feel like they should have named this movie something else that way someone else could make a real World War Z. This movie doesn't do anything new or groundbreaking, but parents will appreciate the minimal gore in this movie. However, this could also be viewed as a negative and might disappoint some of the more mature viewers. It tries to be smart and suspenseful and almost succeeds, but falls short. There is some nice acting and it does divert from a few clichés but there are still many throughout the film. Overall I would say that this movie is not a waste of your money, but you shouldn't expect anything too spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although it borrows an awful lot from 28 Days Later, it's still a decent enough watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a zombie outbreak in his home town of Philadelphia, former united nations employee Gerry Lane and his family are forced to flee the area as the zombies are killing everyone in sight. After being chased by zombies round Philadelphia, Gerry and his family are rescued by UN Defence Secretary General Thierry Umutoni (Mokoena). Once they have been flown to safety, Umutoni tells Gerry that a virologist Dr Fassbach (Gabel) believes that the virus originated in South Korea and asks Gerry to accompany Fassbach to South Korea (this is due to Gerry's expertise in 'the field' when he worked for the United Nations). Gerry initially refuses, but decides to accept when Umutoni blackmails him by telling him that if he doesn't do it that him and his family will be flown back to Philadelphia as only 'essential people' are allowed to stay. Fearing that his family won't survive, Gerry reluctantly agrees to help and heads off to South Korea with Dr Fassbach and some army personnel as back up; I feel that the best way to review this film is to simple divide it into good and bad;We'll start with the good; The pacing of World War Z is good - it never drags or becomes dull.Gerry Lane is a likable guy and that helped in caring for him as a character. The very fact that he didn't want to leave his family behind and only did so to prevent them from being thrown back into the 'lions den' so to speak showed that he was a caring person and a real 'family man'. Any film which sets the protagonist up as a 'nice guy' automatically deserves some praise as far as I'm concerned.I quite liked the fact that some originality had gone into the script (specifically with the way that Lane manages to stop the zombies from attacking him - it's arguable as to the plausibility of this approach, but at least they tried to do something different).The bad; Horrendous camera work (particularly at the start) and for nearly every scene which involved mass numbers of zombies attacking. This became quite nauseating at times and left my head spinning.Rushed ending - is it me or did that ending just come out of nowhere? It almost felt incomplete to me. Could there be a sequel in the not to distant future?Little to no character development - I felt this film was a bit rushed and therefore didn't allow for much character development.Stupidity - when Gerry and the female solider (sorry can't remember her name) board the plane for Cardiff, the air hostess opens up the door to the toilet and a zombie bursts out from behind the door. Firstly, how did he get on the plane without anybody noticing or freaking out? Secondly, even if the Zombie somehow managed to get on the plane without anyone spotting him, would he really hide in the toilet and then only start attacking when someone kindly opens the door for him? Not from what I've seen.Another absurdity was Gerry's method of killing all the passengers when they become zombies whilst he was on board the plane during that same flight. He decides to throw a hand grenade, it explodes and manages to blow a perfectly circular hole in the side of the plane, surely if it could blow a hole in the side of a plane, you would have thought that it would have ruptured the fuel tank thus causing the plane to explode? I didn't buy it and thought that scene was totally implausible.Overall then, World War Z is not a brilliant film. It's littered with absurdities and is weak in terms of character development. Although it borrows heavily from 28 Days Later, it is still a decent enough film. It's the sort of film that is worth watching once, but I don't think I'd watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not just a Zombie movie, it's really this generations "The Day After Tomorrow" The Zombies can seem a little overwhelming at times but it's no worse an effect than the feeling watching Téa Leoni's character, and her father waiting for the Giant wave to roll in in Deep Impact really. It has good tension building moments, and the over all story is told very well. You will be more thrilled, than you will be scared by this movie. Not a bloody movie it all feels more like when animals attack than any other Zombie movie. If you like this one you should find and watch "Dead Set" The Zombie thing happens (in Briton at least) and you get to watch it all through the Big Brother UK edition sets, and some real past cast. They don't know , and they are stuck inside, it's terrible fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but had more potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'World War Z' was a film that I enjoyed but feel it had potential to be something great. It does involve a lot of zombies but I would class this as more of a disaster movie. The zombie were mainly seen in hordes going up buildings and over walls, rather than up close and personal. There wasn't much blood either.The film was shot incredibly well and looked very realistic, the scene on the plane was probably the most impressive and the scene I enjoyed the most. The atmosphere is dark and the tension builds up nicely. The action scenes are very fast paced when we get them as well. Some of the scenes are actually breathtaking and just crazy.The acting is solid all round and we do feel for Brad Pitt's character because we found out a bit about him at the start of the film, and we know he is doing it for his family first and foremost.The way it ended was a bit unsatisfying and I feel the plot was a bit rushed in places. It is a solid action flick but some parts may drag a little.I would recommend it though, it was enjoyable, well filmed, acted well, had tension and atmosphere, good action. But there was just that little something missing, I can't quite grasp what but it definitely had potential to be more than it was.7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"To tolerate life remains, after all, the first duty of all living things. Illusion has no value if it makes this harder for us. We recall the old saying: if you want to preserve peace, prepare for war. It would be in keeping with the times to alter this: if you want to endure life, prepare yourself for death." - Freud Marc Forster's "World War Z" stars Brad Pitt as a UN specialist on the hunt for Patient Zero, the first human to have been infected with a deadly virus. This virus turns its victims into flesh eating zombies. Pitt hopes an autopsy of Patient Zero will lead to an antidote. The clock's ticking; the virus spreads fast.Based on a novel by Max Brooks, "Z's" first half hour mostly consists of tense sequences in which Pitt runs from zombies. It's a strong opening ? America is entirely overrun within hours ? which climaxes with the West's few survivors sequestering themselves on a flotilla of warships.The film's second act then sees Pitt bouncing from one country to the next, the poor guy desperate to find The Cause. When Pitt journeys to Korea and then the Middle East, you think Forster's flirting with racist clichés (Zombies as evil villains of the United Nations!), but these angles quickly evaporate. Pitt then touches down in Israel, which has erected a huge wall around its perimeter. Whilst the rest of the world has fallen to the zombie plague, Israel survives, hordes of barbaric zombies lapping against her defencive bulwarks. Again, this reeks of racist clichés, until Forster throws in scenes of Israeli Defence Force agents saving Palestinians, Arabs, Hardeim, secular Jews, Persians ("Each person we save is one less we have to fight!") and then being overrun and turned into zombies themselves. Even a little multi-ethnic solidarity can't hold back the zombie horde."Z's" second act climaxes with a tense sequence in which a commercial airline is infiltrated by zombies. Later Pitt and a Mossad agent trek to a World Health Organization building in Cardiff. Here they battle more zombies and eventually find a cure; the zombies aren't attracted to diseased humans and so humanity must "become sick" to avoid "zombie infection". In other words, mankind must infect itself in order to avoid infection.Since George Romero's zombie franchise, it's been impossible to watch a zombie movie without being pre-emptively primed to search for a socio-political allegory. Romero's six zombie films, of course, mapped a broad movement away from 1960s political consciousness, to conformity, apathy and finally a proletariat zombie revolution against corporate/feudal lords. This revolution fails, and ends with humanity myopically sequestering itself in either digital bubbles ("Diary of the Dead") or reactionary, post-capitalist fantasies ("Survival of the Dead"). For Romero, zombies weren't necessarily "bad guys", so much as they represented a new social order which continuously replaced an outmoded old.It's thus almost impossible to watch "World War Z" without ourselves searching for a Cause; what exactly do Forster's zombie's represent? The demands of a mass-market, global blockbuster, however, makes such a task strangely pointless. Calculated to appeal to everyone, and afraid of offending, "Z" reads like a checklist of typical (and often contradictory) zombie themes. In this regard, Forster's zombies seem to represent every phobia and affliction plaguing contemporary society: poverty, xenophobia, communication breakdowns, national, global and racial anxieties etc etc. Some of these angles stick better than others. For example, the film suggests that endemic third world poverty (North Korea, Africa, India, China etc) provides a breeding ground for pathogens. Elsewhere our hero is unemployed and job hunting, an attack in a plane reads like steerage attacking first class passengers, the film suggests that globalisation accelerates inequality, and scenes on-board military ships and air-planes suggest that the first world can no longer hide from the injustices forced upon everyone else; globalisation shrinks the globe.But other scenes contradict these readings. It is prayers to God and boisterous Palestinians which lead to zombies overrunning Israel, ethnic minorities are some of the first to be mauled, and early scenes have a more broad, existential slant. "Mother Nature's a serial killer," one scientist say, "no one's better or more creative!" To confuse things further, you have Max Brooks likening zombies to AIDS ("The notion of a walking plague comes from growing up in the 1980s, when AIDS went from an obscure curiosity to a global pandemic. If that's not zombies, I don't know what is.") and far right critics reading the film as a tale about militant Islam. Meanwhile, regular Joe's read the film as a metaphor for HOW I WANT TO SHOOT PEOPLE AND NOT GET JAILED, whilst Freudian types view the entire zombie genre as mankind being infatuated with the spectacle of the apocalypse, audiences desiring the very deaths/purges they habitually disavow.Regardless of how one interpret's "Z's" zombies, the film's "antidote" is a stroke of genius. "It's not a cure, just a way to hide," characters say, the film suggesting that for humanity to survive the zombie horde, man must "pretend to be a zombie", "share the enemy's weaknesses" and eventually "become one with them". What does this say about most human conflicts?Aesthetically, Forster's film is all over the place. His CGI zombies feel plastic and don't convince, and the film's attempts at realism/authenticity are constantly undermined by Hollywood glitter. Elsewhere Forster's violence lacks gore and eschews close ups, and though his zombies are of the running variety (with 12 second incubation periods), they rarely seem threatening. Unlike Romero's films, Forster also naively keeps "man" and "nature" separated, never sympathises with his zombies and his protagonists are all righteous types. At its best, the film portrays a humanity desperate and under siege, afraid to touch land and so hiding on clouds and water. At its worst, the film recalls "I Am Legend", another plastic, post-apocalyptic film, tailored for those who hate the genre.7.9/10 - Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

Excellent action, story, locations, &amp; filming make this picture a winner. Smart acting kept this twister fast-paced, &amp; the audience riveted to the screen. From beginning to end, this movie had every bit of my attention, a total thrill ride. I would describe it as: "Contagion" meets "Walking Dead". Fast-paced &amp; intelligent, I highly recommend "World War Z" for every action movie fan.

		<shortDescription>Better than I expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should preface this review by stating that I have not read the novel that this movie is based loosely off of. Therefore, my entire review is ignorant to any source material and is judging the movie as a stand alone film. As far as that goes, I thought this was one of the best zombie films ever made. Yes, it is plagued by the same exaggerations all zombie films suffer from. However, World War Z is actually a genuinely good movie, zombie nonsense aside. The acting, led by Brad Pitt, is fantastic and the plot develops well. The intensity in the movie starts up right away so there's no lag time to deal with while they develop the setting. The setting is already familiar... it's America today. The discovery of the zombie outbreak is part of the joy in watching the film and the initial sequence where you're first introduced to the situation is one of the most intense segments in recent memory. The action itself feels very realistic, aside from the aforementioned exaggerations that is. Pitt isn't made out to be some superhero or anything so he feel real too. The only real flaws for me were the exaggerations and that the ending felt like it was rushed. The entire two hours builds to this culmination that just ends right away and doesn't give you much closure. I suppose they were going for that with how they set the scene in the closing moments but from a viewer's perspective, I would've liked it a bit differently. Overall though, this is a great movie that most people will almost certainly enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If are a fan of the zombie genre, please ignore all the negative reviews for this film. World War Z had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish and I thought it was quite a different take on the genre. Although the film does steer away from the book of the same title, I found myself thoroughly entertained. Contrary to other opinion, I thought Brad Pitt played a terrific role and being a big fan of "The Killing" series, I enjoyed watching Mireille Enos as Brad's wife. She is a brilliant actress and I'm sure we'll be seeing more of her in future film and TV roles.Simply put, if you want heart-thumping, fast-paced zombie action then give this a go and I'm certain you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pitt plays some former UN employee who on a regular morning leaves with his family. But as they're driving through the city, something is wrong. People start running, cars start crashing and Pitt distinguished some people attacking others who then start contorting violently only to end up attacking others.Pitt I guess is still so revered at the UN that they send a helicopter the next day to rescue him and his family. But first he has to survive the night. They are taken to some aircraft carrier where the military is running things, while the President has been attacked. The UN wants something from him. It's still not clear what he did at the UN but he's the only one who can take on this mission. The mission is to guide a scientist to discover the origin of the zombie disease. He and the scientist and a special ops team fly to Korea because that's where the first mention of "zombie" came from.In Korea, the scientist suffers a surprising and neat fate, not before giving an interesting speech on how mother nature works. They learn from a US base military team that a prisoner was ill and attacked his doctor and then military guys. Pitt finds out that the israelis apparently had advanced notice of the outbreak because they finished building a wall surrounding their country just in time and thus are not affected.So off Pitt goes to Israel where he meets an agent who gives him a fascinating insight into Israeli strategic thinking and tells him that they heard for the first time of the undead from a communication coming from India. But by then some sporadic dancing and singing attracts the zombies who climb over the giant wall and attack almost everyone. While Pitt tries to make it to the airport to travel to India, he adopts some little soldier girl who got bitten and he realizes that his pilot flew away so to they stop a plane on the runway and climb in.A zombie hiding in the restroom is freed and soon enough we have zombies on a plane, so Pitt does the next logical thing- explode a grenade midflight. The plane crashes conveniently close to Pitts new destination near a WHO research facility. Of course only Pitt, the girl and a zombie survive. At the facility Pitt experiments with the solution he has come up with.Not sure what the title World War Z refers to as there is no war. While we don't get a story of the origin of the disease,we get a very interesting solution to the problem. The movie starts out pretty good, but soon enough goes on mute as no one has anything interesting anymore to say. The zombies are the usual--for these days-- quick running zombies. In fact they act like little Hulks ambushing people sideways and toppling them like bowling pins. The effects are fairly cartoonish, too. There is a single scare, but it's a good one that had the entire theater crowd jumping. The movie is 30 minutes too long wasting too much time on Pitt's family- something no one cares about. The ideas here are smart, but the script at times is very dumb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The idea here seems to be pretty original, though . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . the execution of that idea occasionally comes up short, mainly through action sequences that are totally implausible. However, with American movies since 1960, there is a clause in the fine print regulating movie goers practice of suspending their disbelief. This clause states that for every ten million dollars in a flick's budget that exceeds the $50 million threshold, the movie's producers are allowed to include one ludicrous scene that could be dismissed as jarringly illogical by any viewer older than six. Since the budget for WORLD WAR Z has been estimated by industry experts at around $170 mill, this flick is entitled make you shout "they did NOT just do that" a dozen times. By staying within that framework (unlike, say, a FAST &amp; FURIOUS film), WORLD WAR Z deserves kudos for artistic restraint, as well as meriting the right to be taken seriously. It is better than THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL remake, and more original than CLOVERFIELD. Though fast zombies, angry zombies, or super-smart zombies always seem illogical, the infected folks here are as much body-snatcher victims as zombies, and if a sequel is made (what's the next letter after "Z"?), perhaps the origin story will be better explained (oh yeah, a prequel could be called WORLD WAR Y).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having seen the trailer i expected at least some blood and gore. Super fast malicious zombies chasing down people and eating them and so on etc. You know-- real zombie stuff. Unfortunately they decided to go down a different path--not a bad one but a different one. I wont reveal too much of the movies content for what regards the story but I will say that it's focused on the aspect of finding the cure and then save the world so to speak rather than focusing on the survivors perspective that we are so used to. Instead of seen Simon Pegg killing zombies in a pub with his friend we see the story from the G.I's perspective that saved them all in the end. Everything leading up to finding a way to fight back etc. Its good and different though It could in my opinion have included a bit more blood and gore. The trademark stuff that makes a zombie film a zombie film...BRAINS!! Aside from the story we have some pretty decent special effects here. Small time explosions from cars to a nuclear bomb being detonated. There are a couple of ...say jump scare moments in this but those type of events aren't taken into account all that much. They are showing us the face of zombies BEFORE they have had their way with their victims so don't expect much more than a dead rotting looking guy. No real Day of the dead stuff here. If you're a zombie fan this wont rock your world but it could work as a nice change of perspective and story. If you're a SUPER zombie fan like myself you probably wont enjoy this all that much aside from the cool moments where zombies here charge and stock up each other creating impossible and crazily awesome ways of finding a way to reach the living! 6 out of 10 guys. A pretty good movie but not all that much typical zombie stuff included that the most of us would prefer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War Z was in production hell for quite a bit, changing writers and choosing directors for several times, leaving a fear that this project could have had a tragic ending. However, World War Z ends up being a really satisfactory movie. The directing has glimpses of quality and Brad Pitt is very well as the United Nations employee that travels the world looking for a possible cure. The movie is very tense from the beginning until the end delivering with quality what it promises: pure suspenseful entertainment. What I feared the most about this flick was the use of CGI for the infected zombies. However is does not go any farther than what the (very bad and totally misleading) trailer shows. World War Z does not use any gore either, choosing closed settings to build up the tension, and exploring the world's reaction to this plague in very different countries, which is interesting. Character development is a weak point tough, compared to the likes of 28 Days Later or even Dawn of the Dead. Even so, you will have a really great time with this one, and that's the only thing that matters in World War Z. Visit The Fading Cam blog for more!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While a prefer more gore in this type of thing, I didn't really miss it this time. The film, which seems 20 minutes too long, has some clever ideas but quite a few unrealized ones. The strongest sell for this film is that, despite some uncomfortably boring moments and some unconvincing acting, it comes back with big, juicy scenes that keep you excited. Many films fail at that and the audience walks away feeling half-disappointed even with the pluses. The early scenes with the family and the mismatched reactions they have to "the end of the world," somehow makes one feel like the family dynamic was unnecessary. No one reacted correctly to the sudden annihilation of mankind. I mean, not one person even said "What the hell is happening?" They all seemed like they had been through something like this once before. It's not like zombies take over the planet every day. The children are poorly written as characters. If I saw my parents half eaten by zombies, I'd be in a screaming fetal position for weeks. But Tomas is as unshaken as if he merely lost reception on his iPhone. And the outcome to the crashing airplane is stupidly unbelievable even for a film that's supposed to be unbelievable. The scenes in Israel are stunning and luckily, when you think the film is falling under it's own weight, they bring back visually powerful scenes to make up for it. You'll have to forgive them some for the flaccid ending which seems written 5 times. The points made at the end are even repeated. But, even with the trouble it has, it surprisingly keeps you entertained and convinced, which, especially with the overblown groaners they've spit out this summer, is hopeful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't even know how to review this movie.First I was mad about how they are taking a book about the psychological effects of such a zombie war (and there was some smarts point in the book, believe me) and transformed it into the next "28 Days Later".Then I saw the movie. Started well enough, good acting, clichés but well executed ones, a few predictable plot twists (actually, with the exception of one plot point, this may be the most predictable scenario ever written), good special effects and some variety.This was in the first 30 minutes. Then it started. * Unstable pacing. In some moments you just want to get it over it and it goes on and on and on. In others it ends way too fast. * The action scenes are predictable at least. Ranging from the Navy Seals to regular soldiers, from "28 days later" like scenes to 2012, they are predictable. Nothing WOW here, only well executed. * The movie is too long as it's stretched to be too long. For such a thin plot, it takes about 20 - 30 minutes longer than it should take. BUT wait ... when it finally picks up the pace after a painful 30 minutes (which should have been suspenseful) it ends.Yes, it ends. And then if from 0 to 1:39 was A to B, the ending is B - C - D - E - F ... you get the point. There were so many cool things that could have been included in the plot directly like the bombing of a football field, the battle of Moscow but no, you will only find them there.So this movie is a huge disappointment at least from my side. Why? Not because it's another zombie flick. I don't care. I've enjoyed almost all of them. There is nothing better than to see a dark, action oriented movie like Resident Evil. It's a disappointment because it builds tension and it builds it and it builds it and the release sucks.OK, so they find some kind of vaccine. Guess what? We knew that from the beginning since this was his mission. I wasn't expecting it with everyone dying.Brad Pitt's acting is good, actually very good. The characters are interesting - his wife, the Mossad girl, the Navy Seal, the smaller boss (general secretary of the UN), etc.However, it's not as exciting, not even close as in the trailers, it captures little to none of the book (simply detailing the battle for NY would have made for a better script), it's not really dark (I don't know what tone they wanted to strike - because it's neutral, nor dark or optimistic. While the characters are decent, it's hard to get attached to any of them and I'll stop here.I rarely write long reviews. I rarely write reviews for movies I don't like. But I can't understand how this got a 7.3 plus how it's so different from the trailers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could happen ...one day...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains no spoilersIn a time when some movies coming out of Hollywood are about vampires and zombies, this latest summer blockbuster offers something uniquely different as well as the same amongst a long list of "it could happen" type of cinema (i.e. Contagion, I Am Legend, et al. World War Z isn't your typical run of the mill, "let's scare the moviegoers with gruesome" zombie flick not with the occasional news feed about some type of disease (like N1H1 or H7N9) potentially having the ability to cause a world wide pandemic. No, this movie offers what this reviewer perceives a likely and yet plausible scenario of what could happen today ...tomorrow or near future if a disease - viral or bacterial, that was so powerful it could create widespread of living dead after being bitten. Based on the book by Max Brooks, World War Z stars Brad Pitt as the "hero" Gerry Lane who must race against time and odds to find the answers in solving on how to stop this fast acting, world wide pandemic before the human race is no more. His character nearly throughout this movie faces one dangerous obstacle after another without trying to be some zombie's next victim in the process while traveling the world in search of clues and a possible solution to end it. The solution in the end may not be perfect or solid however it does give the surviving non-dead humans a chance to live and fight another day against the living dead. It's almost the absolute reality we have to face especially within a like World War Z ...that not every solution to a problem like this will be perfect.The zombies in this movie aren't your usual slow moving "brain hungry" kind in this movie. They are fast acting and can easily sniff out a healthy human in seconds. This reviewer while watching this movie was in total awe on how fast zombies could attack a city (for example Jerusalem, Israel) in minutes. This should give you some idea the urgency in why Brad Pitt's character needed to find a solution to counterattack whatever was causing the world wide spread of zombie attacks even though it was never truly establish if this was "zombie" or simply people being infected by a viral or bacterial disease. One thing is for certain the reality of something like World War Z ever happening is horrifyingly scary.On a special note, this reviewer can see where the English alternative band, Muse, got their inspiration for the latest release 2nd Law with songs like 2nd Law: Isolated System and Follow Me to be included in the movie. She could have seen others such as Panic Station (at the beginning of the movie when New York is overrun by "zombies"), Survival (towards the end of the movie) or 2nd Law:Unsustainable added to the movie soundtrack along with Marco Beltrami's original scores to further heighten how devastating a World War Z scenario could be.Your best bet for curbing a potential "zombie" pandemic attack is hoping it doesn't actually happen...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Much Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With zombies on everyone's mind, I supposed it was inevitable that Brad Pitt would find himself running away from a mass of the snarling living dead. The trailers promised unparalleled visuals, and it delivered, let's say, about twenty seconds more than we saw in the trailers. The rest of the movie is pretty standard fare. Plenty of scenes in dark rooms with zombies chomping at a door that won't quite lock. There's an original scene on an airplane. As far as zombie movies go, World War Z will probably not be remembered well (like I Am Legend is not remembered well in the vampire genre). But, it's certainly not a boring film. One wishes that it had done more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey! Another Zombie Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before booking seats to the Cinema to see this movie I tried to balance out the possible negatives and the possible positives of this movie, first of all "Another Zombie movie" was all I was hearing about this movie, however deep down I (thought I) knew this was going to have a major twist with an original ending.Why to watch this movie? Firstly, the trailer is/was promising. Secondly, the rather quite forgotten Brad Pitt makes an appearance. And finally, if you are secretly an I Am Legend fan hunting for the sequel, this is good enough, I digress.The movie was well done in terms of keeping viewers on the edge of their seats, along with a few slightly humorous zombie sound effects. Brad Pitt seemed slighting passive for the role, however I take nothing away from him and his respected reputation. Personally I was going for a solid 8/10 until the movie started coming to a close, had me walking out scratching my head.This movie is "not" worth missing, although a lack of an effective story in my eyes, it had me sliding off of my seat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Summary: World War Z is thrilling, scary and fast-paced. 82/100 (B+)Who hadn't fun watching this? Seriously, the first minutes of the film are so damn good, everything happens so fast. I saw it at 2am and believe me, it was an experience. World War Z is an exciting movie filled with intense sequences of violence, horror and fun. I'm not a huge fan of the zombie sub-genre and I haven't read the book. However this one was very surprising to me, I felt engaged with the main character and I cared about his family.Yeah it has a few flaws but it delivers lots of astonishing moments, memorable action sequences and great performances. Brad Pitt performs Gerry Lane's character and he does a pretty good job during the whole film. His character is believable and well... he's actually the smartest character in the movie. In addition, shout out here to Daniella Kertesz, she performed "Segen" a very important character in the film. She and Brad Pitt are awesome here.WWZ relies on human perspective and how we would react if something like this happens. Moving on, its final act is scary and makes you feel claustrophobic. Even though the ending does not explain some important issues about the plot, the whole film was pretty solid and never dull. I recommend you to see it on a huge screen with a loud sound system. So, overall, it is a good flick. World War Z is a tense thriller, decently directed and terrifying at times. (B+)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mainstream 'gore-free' zombie epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z is based on a book from back in the dark ages where every horror film wasn't about zombies. Since roughly the millennium, we've seen every type of zombie movie - romantic ones, humorous ones, ones from the zombies' perspective. Once upon a time a movie would be a sure-fire success just for having zombies in it. Now the public are getting a little sick of the undead. So... is WWZ too late to be of any importance? No, it's actually pretty good.The closest film to liken it to would be 28 Days/Weeks Later in style and content. Only here we have a much bigger budget, played out not just in England, but all over the world. The zombies (and yes, they ARE zombies - there's no going to great lengths to NOT call them that here) can run, ala 'the infected' and you won't find a 'shuffler' in sight (oh, apart from when they're not chasing people - then they seem to happily go on 'shuffler-mode').I was struck by how little gore there was here. A staple of zombie movies is blood and 'head shots,' yet, despite numerous battles between soldiers and zombies, you barely catch a glimpse of the red stuff. Plus, any close-range zombie kills are skilfully edited to avoid seeing any physical damage to the corpse. I can only assume this was to assure the 15 certificate rating which would put more bums on seats in the cinema. There's also barely any bad language (I didn't count a single profanity). So... what is there? WWZ wins out on sheer scale. Its scenes specialise in terror and mass destruction, presenting 'what if' scenarios of what the population would do amidst such an unexpected ordeal. The film follows (former UN health inspector) Brad Pitt as he travels the globe in search of a cure to the zombie virus. Brad Pitt can act (Kalifornia and Snatch being proof of that) yet there's little for him to do here. He's not a ninja, or Superman, so he spends his time running away from zombies most of the time. If I was being harsh I could say that any actor could have played his role, but the film-makers needed a big name to carry the film.If you like zombie movies then definitely give this one a go. If nothing else it's the biggest and most epic zombie movie to date. If you want straight horror, you may come away feeling a little short-changed. I would almost call this a 'thriller' over a horror, due to the lack of gore being replaced by tension and terror.Slight gripe: I watched this in the cinema and there was a fair few people who found the zombies quite funny when they were up close. For some reason zombies 'chatter/clack' their teeth together when they're sniffing the air. It is rather odd and probably more funny than scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie based upon the apocalyptic horror novel by Max Brooks, tells the story of Gerry Lane a former UN Special investigator. Gerry Lane is in a race against the clock to stop a viral pandemic that turns people into ferocious, very mobile, zombies.I absolutely love this movie forthe fast pace action, a straight forward plot that twists and keeps you at the edge of your seat to find out how this story unfolds. Brad Pitt is brilliant and believable, as is the rest of the cast. However I do wish we could have seen how the virus strain came to be, but that doesn't take away from the luster of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely LOVED this movie!! This is now one of my very favorite zombie movies of all time. I saw this at an early screening prior to its release and now I've seen this and the director's cut/rated R version several times. I can not get enough. This movie is like a fast-paced, teetering on the edge, racing freight train that could topple over and destroy everything with your next heartbeat. It's scary. It's mind- boggling. It's action-packed from the moment the first zombie appears. The suspense doesn't stop for a moment. You can barely catch your breath before the next body-wriggling, plague-infested being attacks! Brad Pitt was fabulous and smart and still looked incredibly hot! The Israeli soldier was terrific. Even little Tommy was bad *ss (but only in the Rate R version). I tried reading the Max Brooks book years before the movie and it was difficult and not at all like this movie version. The movie is 200 percent better. The script was really well-done. The make up and cinematography was all superb and the action sequences stellar. And the solution to the zombie epidemic was genius! I can not wait for WWZ2!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right out of the gate I'm going to admit that I really am sick of the new zombie genre. Maybe it's my age but I much prefer the old school zombie, you know, the poor unfortunate soul who is denied his eternal rest by some nefarious voodoo priest, a priest who raises him from the dead in order to execute some horribly fiendish plan. That's the zombies that I like. These new George Romero "flesh-eaters-without-a-cause" zombies bore me to tears. The whole premise is so silly. Something stupid reanimates corpses who crave human flesh because........... There's never a good reason for it. Never.In World War Z we are told that the zombies are the result of some kind of bacterial infection. Once you're bitten you die in 10 seconds and are then completely reanimated as a corpse with only one thing on your mind; to infect the living! Huh??? They're completely stone cold dead! How can they have purpose and intention when they no longer have a mind?? A scientist explains at one point during the flick that they can't use counter-infections against the zombie hordes because there is no pulse. And yet the zombies in this movie can run a mile in less than a minute! They can leap 20 feet in the air! If they have no metabolism at all where on earth does all that energy come from?? How can they possibly still have vision when there is no brain activity whatsoever?? These are hands-down the stupidest of the Romero-inspired zombies I have ever had to sit thru. They're Super Zombies and, if you're like me you'll be praying for Brad Pitt to just get to the Kryptonite already 20 minutes into this snoozefest of a flick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very enjoyable movie. I don't know why some of the reviews are so harsh, but if you want to see a movie with deep meaning, or that doesn't have any flaws, don't pick a zombie movie! Brad Pitt was fine, and he is not a bad actor as some have suggested. Very good, as matter of fact. The zombies were a lot of fun in the way they moved and in how they were menacing. Some scenes were even very tense. And that's in a zombie movie! Never thought I'd say that. It's hard to make a believable zombie. This was a B movie made with an A movie amount of money. The special effects were fine. It did what a movie should do. It took my mind off everything else and just entertained. Maybe it was supposed to have some deeper meaning, but that's not why most people see movies, in my opinion. They want what this movie was. Lots of fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Years ago Max Brooks wrote this imaginative, terrifying and apocalyptic book which later was brought to the silver screen by Marc Forster under the title " World War Z. " Now in movie theaters around the world audiences marvel at the possibilities that such a future awaits us. In the story, we find a United Nations investigator named Gerry Lane (Brad Pitts) selected by the U.N. Sectary General to travel around the world to discover what is affecting the world populations like a virus and mutating them into flesh eating Zombies. Nations are hard pressed to fight the plague and Lane finds little help. However, he gets a few clues while traveling to Norther Korea where he interviews a C.I. A. agent (David Moorse) who is now in prison. In Isreal he learns that high walls and modern weapons are no match against the hordes of infested creatures. However, while traveling, he learns that Natures most powerful weapons are also her greatest weakness. With that in mind, Lane sets himself to work in a Science lab where a depleted staff agrees to help him kill himself. The movie is teeming with Zombies and the terror levels reach apocalyptic stages of fear and helplessness. Anyone who likes a good scare, has to see this film, I did! I recommend this exciting and memorable portrait of a possible future for mankind. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If trailers ruled the world?I would never have seen this movie.I love zombie movies, TV shows, satires, etc. But, I do not like zombies that can run faster than both Superman and The Flash combined. And there you have it, World War Z: Supersonic Zombies.Call me old fashioned, but it's scarier and more suspenseful when they zombies were mindless corpses who barely could walk and, yet, could still sneak up on you. The one exception I will make is 2004's remake: Dawn of the Dead. Sure, they were fast and vicious, but the cast and the story clearly made up for the fast-forwarded zombies.Here, in the adaptation of the book it's based on, IN NAME ALONE, Hero Gerry Lane travels the world in search for answers to this zombie outbreak and continuously bypasses a single bite or multiples of unrealistic tragedies. In fact, he survives so many times, this might as well been the more realistic version of Roland Emmerich's 2012 film.Now, I'll be honest: I did have a somewhat good time here, despite the endless clichés, the lack of Rated-R Zombie gore and the 300 mph running, ant-like zombies. It just missed the mark so many times, that I can't wait to read the book that this is, again, IN NAME ONLY, based on.Truthfully, I have NOT read the book, but from all the fans I've heard from, this movie adaptation has extremely little, or 2%, of what the book was all about. And that's too bad. This only makes me want to read that novel and forget any of this ever happened. Maybe, they'll do what they did to the HULK, quickly remake it in a few years to what it was supposed to be in the first place.Specifically targeting the movie, it was "okay." Some hokey scenes, such as the jail lose-yer-teeth chapter or ANY presentation of a zombie going the speed of light, brought this movie down. So much so, I think there almost could've been an award-winning film here. But, no. This is just above B-Movie average and left a lot to be desired by the zombie-loving crowds.Side Note: When I saw the trailer for this movie, and I had never heard there was a book this was based on, I was excited. Until?I saw the zombie were both running faster than a tornado's force and then building an "ant pile" against a wall. I literally could not stop laughing, and I doubt that was the reaction they had in mind when they made the preview.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Brad Pitt showcase has many good points.1. The action starts right away within 10min. There's no need to misunderstand what this movie is. It's simply a popcorn movie. Although unlike other post-apocalyptic movie, there isn't the standard eerie empty city scenes.2. The zombie mystery is investigated in a Bond movie fashion. Brad Pitt travel all around the world following leads. It's actually compelling enough to follow.3. It has a good tension filled horror aspect. It's not all big action. You also get good scary parts with dark hallways.The main complaint I have is the PG13 rating which imposed the cartoon zombie action rather than a gore bloody fare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War Z famously suffered from a lot of production problems and delays but what kind of a film did we eventually get? I'm happy to say that I was actually pleasantly surprised at how good the film was. The pacing of the movie is very good, I certainly wasn't bored at any time during the movie. The movie never lets up as director Marc Forster keeps things moving on quickly. The movie basically consists of three different acts. The start of the movie in Philadelphia was really chaotic and you could really feel it. The film did a great job of portraying the panic of a sudden zombie outbreak and it was a very strong start to the movie. Then Brad Pitt travels around the world searching for a cure to the zombie outbreak and finally ends up in a medical research facility in Wales. The middle portion of the movie was perhaps the weakest (still good though!) as I especially enjoyed the ending where they have to sneak around the medical facility. The movie manages to build a lot of suspense there. Brad Pitt does a good job in this film as a retired UN investigator and newly focused family man. It's not a too memorable role but he does a good job with what he was given. Daniella Kertesz is quite memorable as the Israeli soldier. Other performances were okay, nothing too special or bad. The zombies were quite well done when there were real actors there with makeup. The CGI use was of course quite understandable in the larger scenes where there's hundreds of zombies on the screen simultaneously. There's not that much gore here which actually made the movie feel more serious. Maybe it's just that I've seen enough zombies beheaded and smashed in the Walking Dead that made me appreciate World War Z's approach. There were many places where people were acting stupidly when you really start thinking about it but that didn't really mess with my suspension of disbelief because I was really enjoying the movie. If you don't get engrossed in the movie, you could easily nitpick a lot of scenes of course. There was also some political satire in the movie with the bit about North Korea and the wall in Jerusalem. I just wish there would've been more of that.All in all, the movie could have been a bit better though. I bet there was a bit edgier film under there that was lost with all the re-shoots and production problems. Still, a very enjoyable and entertaining movie nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read WWZ by Max Brooks and wasn't really all that impressed. Still while reading it I visualized a much different film than what appeared in the first trailers for this film. But in it's long journey to the screen there were rumblings of troubled set reports and than a huge release date shift, never a good sign. So it is indeed surprising that the finished product is as solid as it is, not to say it's flawless by any means. The cinematic adaptation works more as an inspiration than a story base. The girth of the novel is still there. It is a world taken over by the undead. But the creatures in this film are of a different sort. Similar to the fast zombies of 28 days later and the Dawn of the Dead remake these are even more aggressive if you can imagine that. Not only do they run but they dive and jump. The movie like it's zombies possesses an urgency that makes the proceedings work fairly well. Moving from one expertly choreographed action set piece to another as it spans the globe. That being said there is some goofiness here an airplane attack although shocking is a bit silly and some of the zombie moments come across a little unintentionally funny. Still the idea of the zombies moving like a virus swarm through the human body and the defense strategy are impressive and do breathe a bit of life into the concept. As for the human characters they are decent if a little generic Brad Pitt does surprisingly well in the lead giving a depth to his character that is much needed. I only wish they would have slowed down more throughout the film to develop a depth to the material a bit more and amped up the soft ending. But after the massive opening weekend there are now talks of a sequel as it was originally planned as a trilogy. which leaves me a hopeful that they will iron out the few kinks. Still what stands is a solid summer film. Very entertaining and breathtakingly intense. 3.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War Z (2013) (7/10) When I first saw the trailer my first thoughts were.. Not again.. Reason for that being, is that for the past years all companies whether it's a Movie(pictures) or a Game development company, have been trying to make a zombie hit film/game, and in my opinion almost every single one of them has failed. Of course the hit series "The walking dead" Is without a doubt not a failure, more like a huge success. But the fact that there were so many failed games and movies about zombies, roughly made to fit in with the Apocalypse trend in 2012. Made my expectations very very low. Now somehow Marc Forster, managed to have a twist of originality in the common zombie themed movie. Which made me actually like it, I really did. Brad Pitt was of course as expected outstanding, but that wasn't the only thing, the plot actually was good. Now I won't spoil what the original point is in the movie obviously, But I will guarantee you, that you will enjoy watching this. You won't be able to relax throughout the entire film, it's a classic. Every minute will be exciting and entertaining at the same time.So people, want a more realistic view of "zombies" ? or you just want to be entertained? Go and see it, I'll promise, it'll be worth the money and time. (obviously it has to be your cup of tea ;P)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War Z takes you into a world that is crashing down into chaos because of a zombie outbreak. Although this idea has been used several times before, I still left the theatre feeling quite impressed.I loved the novel. I went into the theatre today knowing full well that this movie was going to be nothing like the novel, which is probably part of why I ended up enjoying it so much.The acting was good. I could believe their terror and pain at the right moments. And the "solution" that they came up with not only made perfect sense, but was original when it comes to infection-epidemic films.I'm a little conflicted when it comes to the zombies themselves. The sounds they made were perfectly chilling. These undead fellows were a helluva lot faster and stronger than your typical zombie. They almost gave off a sort of "I Am Legend" vibe with the way they moved and attacked, even using the same techniques like using their head to smash through windshields and other car windows. I could see the idea behind them; they were supposed to be more vicious and intimidating than normal. But the scenes with thousands of them working together to climb the fortress walls and of them pouncing on victims in the beginning seemed too unbelievable because of the obvious CGI. It took me most of the movie to finally decide I liked these zombies; with their speed, strength, and fierce determination, they're absolutely terrifying. And they also seemed more like typical zombies when they turned dormant after running out of people to infect.I think what I liked most about this movie was the lack of bloody violence and vile language. That sounds really strange, but that's what is normally expected with a movie like this. I was impressed by how good this film was for being a zombie movie with almost no blood or gore. I also liked the pacing of the movie. It's very difficult to enjoy a movie when it is too fast-paced, and unbearable when too slow. This film had just the right mixture of both.World War Z is a good film about an everyday man fighting to ensure the safety of his family and eliminate the ultimate threat against humanity. It's suspenseful in some places and action-packed in others, and also pleasantly surprising. A good mixture for a good movie.</fullReview>

The main point of the movie is about finding a cure for the virus. This is a great movie to watch. A lot is explained in the movie but the things that have holes in it are explained why there is no answer. It is pretty a real movie down to there core with a great plot. Every scene has a captivating meaning. I feel that the movie deserves an 8/10 from a subjective and objective point of view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is there hope amidst the chaos of an apocalyptic world?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z has the look and feel of just another zombie movie, but with a gloomier and more realistic background than the average suspense flick. Who scratches the Hollywood coating off the surface, finds a seriousness underneath that can't be ignored. Sure, the movie has A- lister Pitt in a heroic role and of course this movie is made for your entertainment. Still, it addresses a valid point; the human race is more vulnerable than ever in our global village, but it never preaches. Whether it was the screenwriter's intention or not, World War Z is not about zombies. The undead are brutal ? fast, vicious and deadly within seconds ? but the biggest fright does not come from these creatures; it is knowing that there is nowhere to turn from a virus that is making victims so quickly that there is no escaping from it. Although marketed as a zombie movie, the movie feels more like a horrific detective. Although the hero is looking for an answer amidst the chaos of a changing world, it is knowing that due to our global network the virus cannot be controlled what makes you feel uncomfortable, if not claustrophobic. The pace of the movie is good and the storyline gives you enough background to understand the helplessness of the human race. Even though the movie is filled with characters who you don't feel for, the ever present dread and suspense are enough to keep you tot the edge of your seat. One of the movies strengths is that it shows you just about enough to feel the anxiousness and the agony of the human race, but also leaves many questions unanswered, which makes it gritty and ominous. The acting is decent, but at times lacks inspiration. Scenes are shot decently and Forster knows how to push the story forward when necessary, while at other crucial times he slows down to stress a point. The ending is predictable, but that should not stop you from watching this movie. While it is still way out of the league of 28 Days Later, World War Z is a welcome addition to the zombie-suspense genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was left hanging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, the movie is not horrible, but its not good either, not by Brad Pitt standards....... I went to the movie house expecting to be blown away and I was very disappointed. Its like going to your dealer expecting some hard core drugs and he gives you some aspirin...... Sure there is action, and I love the fact that they used a South African actor,,,, I even had a couple of laughs, but all in all, very disappointed, especially with how it ends,,,,,, I was left hanging and not in a good way, not that type of hanging where you want more, because I think that the writers wrote themselves into a corner and instead of getting themselves out of that corner they just said "Let's burn them all" THE ENDHaving seen other Brad Pitt movies, I can honestly say that this has got to be one of his worst movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacked originality, needs more perspective!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was originally adapted from Max Brooks's World War Z book, of which the film takes the similar title. Brooks had written WWZ with extreme clarity and precision and a strong, serious tone. It was appealing to read the book, it was much more interesting than the title suggests. The story-line was based on a typical heroic archetype structure, very linear and, in a way, unoriginal. I find myself strongly siding with Henry Barnes, because it's been a long-standing problem in the Zombie genre to take the performance so seriously. Brad Pitt seems largely invisible and untouchable?despite the apocalypse, nothing happens to him that we see. http://www.indiejudge.com/reviews/world-war-2013-movie-review/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Melbourne has not always been the dynamic and thriving multi-cultural metropolis it is today.Prior to an influx of peoples from Mediterranean countries, it was, by all accounts, something of a staid and dull Anglo-Celtic enclave, closed at weekends. When Stanley Kramer filmed the apocalyptic Melbourne-based film On the Beach in the late 1950s, its co-star, Ava Gardner, was quoted as stating that 'Melbourne was the perfect place to make a film about the end of the world.' It's now widely accepted that the story is erroneous and the delightful Ava made no such disparaging remark ? not publicly anyway. However, the sentiment stuck as at the time it had a semblance of truth about it.It seems just as appropriate therefore, that in making a film about zombies, Marc Forster, should deem it fit to base the action in Wales. Sadly, it appears that this was the best and only good idea anyone behind the film ever had.A vehicle for Brad Pitt, who co-produced, the film barely contains any new idea or stroke of inspiration. This is film-making by numbers, giving the impression it was made to order by a committee of middle managers.The opening, all too familiar scenario, of Brad Pitt as Gerry Lane, a retired UN 'investigator', now a happily domesticated full-time father, being reluctantly dragged out of retirement for one last job in exchange for his family's safety really set the hackneyed tone for the rest of the film.As zombies worldwide infect the population through biting, desperate UN officials assign Lane as protector to British doctor Andrew Fassbach who it seems is the only person who might be able to detect the cause of the outbreak and thus discover a cure. After the early demise of Dr Fassbach, it falls to Brad Pitt, apparently with no medical training, to take over his work and save the world. It's a zombie film, I wasn't looking for realism, but, please, there are still limits. Besides, the North Koreans already seemed to have the perfect answer. Over a 24 hour period, they simply set up a program whereby their 23 million citizens had all their teeth extracted ? no teeth, no biting, no infection. Simple.The scenes of mass panic with the zombie undead attacking panicking humans and piling themselves up against fortified walls in order to breach them gave the impression that this was a film based on a graphic computer game.The film appeared to be without subtext or purpose and it was difficult to retain interest or care about the participants.There were some humorous moments, though whether these were intentional or not was hard to gauge. But at least it provided the audience I saw the film with several laughs.The acting, the direction, the cinematography are all ordinary ? I saw the film in 2D. The script is below par. The end clearly set the film up for a sequel and I'm since given to understand that two are planned. Whether they materialise remains to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film of two halves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i haven't read the book so i am in no position to compare it with the source material. i did however read the odd paragraph about the production woes and.. the involvement of Satan's own, damon lindelof. it is also clear that the film was a vanity project for Brad ( bottomless) Pitt. To my surprise i found myself enjoying it very much.. until just over the halfway mark,, then it crashed, figuratively and literally ( in my beloved Wales ).. The last half hour of this film is appalling, they should have stuck the end credits on straight after the plane crash. As it stands there are so many pot holes in the plot it makes Prometheus look positively deep. all you had to do was blast any area where the zombies are, with , oh.. megadeath? and then you could nuke them once they were crawling all over the bass bins... the scenes in Isreal and the sequence on the plane are exceptionally well made set pieces, but a few of these does not a good movie make. Ultimately, like almost every other blockbuster this summer, a tedious letdown. wait for the DVD.... ( it was criminal to see Peter Capaldi being totally wasted to :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not A Zombie Film, But What 28 Months Later Could Have Looked Like...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was not a Zombie movie, plan and simple. If Danny Boyle and the Fox Atomic folks ever got their act together, then we'd have perhaps what was illustrated here, but far more superior than this weak presentation.There were some things about the film that I liked, but there were a lot of missing elements that would have made it much better. For starters I think they could have used a much better director for this project than Marc Forster (who's only noticeable film was a very forgettable yarn called "Monsters Ball").Forster has never even seen, much less know what a zombie/pandemic film should look like. This showed in how the zombies became more and more less threatening, and more comical looking as film went on. Max Brooks wrote a masterful piece in the original novel, but this film was less- than faithful to the source material.The characters were very transparent to almost lifeless in the film. Yes, things got off to a relatively quick start, but there was no character development to speak of. As far as this being a WAR, that lacked considerable punch as well. More attack scenes, and just a "little" gore would not have hurt. Most of the action seen in this film was in the trailer.Now we know, that whenever we see a so-called zombie film with a PG-13 rating, movie-goer beware. Nonetheless, I did find the film somewhat entertaining, but I still left the theater with a feeling that something was indeed missing.We never found out where the pandemic originated, or what it really was. The pandemic spread to quickly almost to the point that the film immediately fell into a chaotic frenzy. If something was to spread that fast, we could have at least got the benefit of knowing where it started like in 28 days later. This made the film look even more unrealistic.To wrap this up in a nutshell, what I saw was a film that suffered from a lack-luster director who had no vision or concept of what a zombie/apocalyptic film should look, or feel like. Max Brooks should give his money back, remove his name from this film, and reboot the project keeping the cast, but getting another director, perhaps Danny Boyle. This film will have a very brief stint in the theaters, so wait-for-it on video or cable.Blu-Ray "unrated" edition is much more intense with 7 additional minutes of footage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brad Pitt is a fantastic actor, which is the only good thing this movie had going for it. However great an actor is, you still need a great script to make a great movie. Makes me wonder if Brad made this movie as a "filler" to fill his time in until a better movie comes along. The low budget movie Warm Bodies was better. We went and saw WWZ on July 3rd early evening, so we really thought the theater would be packed. Sadly there were less than 10 people in the theater and what was sad, is 4 teenagers got up half way through the movie and walked out. Regardless of how great an actor is, the movie is only as good as the script, the script had no real beginning, just a middle and almost an end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Typical Storyline, But Delivers Suspense Well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really much of a reviewer, but I'll give you my short and honest opinion. The film isn't bad at all. I have seen various comments and reviews where people suggest it was a load of garbage and not worth watching... I would disagree. Yes, the story is fairly predictable and I guessed what the ending would be about 15 minutes before it happened, but the film delivers a very effective atmosphere which leaves you constantly with that 'suspenseful' feeling. During all the scenes where the zombies are attacking I constantly felt agitated and almost wanted to shout at the screen to tell the characters to run. The animation and movement of the infected is very well polished, and the way in which they sprint after you is really what creates the fear when watching this film. I don't think this movie is much about creating an interesting story, but more about showing off thrilling scenes of violence and scaring the viewers. This works well to an extent, and personally I loved it, but I can see why some people do have their negative views to this film. Overall the acting was great, there were no tedious parts and generally the film was alright. The one and only downside (as I've already said) is simply the story. Zombie films have been done too many times before, and I think the scope of new story ideas is very much minimal in this genre.I'd give this film a 7.8/10, although IMDb only lets me choose 8 as the closest figure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War Z*** (out of 4)116 mins/ 15Cast: Brad Pitt, Mireille Enos, Daniella Kertesz, James Badge Dale, Matthew Fox, Fana Mokoena, David Morse, Ludi Boeken, Elyes Gabel, Peter Capaldi, Ruth Negga, Pierfrancesco Favino, Director: Marc ForsterPlot: An outbreak of an unknown virus causes the world to fall into a zombie apocalypse JJ's Verdict: After all the budget problems, rewrites and re-shoots of the last act, you would think World War Z would be a major flop, both critically and commercially. However, Marc Forster has created a scary edge-of-your-seat thriller, which, of all the entries in Hollywood's new craze, gives us a surprisingly realistic depiction of how the world probably would cope in a zombie apocalypse. The film centres on Brad Pitt's character, a former United Nations employee Gerry Lane, who, after escaping to a government base from an outbreak of an unknown zombie virus, is forced to travel the world to find the source of the outbreak and eventually find out how to prevent it. Lane first travels to Korea where the Zombie pandemic was thought to have first broken out and is caught up in a they can see you but you can't see them type scenario. From here he moves to Jerusalem, the only city to have created a defence against the zombies, where he observes the city's giant wall blocking the zombies, only for the zombies to get over the wall and destroy the city. After a massive sequence on a zombie- infested aeroplane, Gerry lands in Cardiff where he faces off a group of zombies almost single- handedly, to reach the vaccination that will make people invisible to zombies. However ridiculous the idea of zombies taking over the world may seem, the film presents the story in a somewhat realistic way. In George Romero's zombie flicks of the 70's, the undead were slow and hard to take seriously as threats to people. In World War Z, the zombies can run, jump and attack like swarms of bees ? a real and genuine threat to the human race. The zombie effects and creation are very good, and considering around 6 billion people become infected each zombie is given a completely new look that helps for the realism feel. The zombies themselves are incredibly freaky and genuinely scary for a PG-13 film in America (however in Britain it is a 15.)The epic destruction of the cities, although they have a 2012 feel to them, don't look too CGI and focus more on the emotional distress of people and their livelihood than 2012's special effects.Due to there being just one big-name star in this film, Brad Pitt has to hold up this film on his own. Do not fear however, as the Mr and Mrs Smith star excels in his biggest film yet (not best, but biggest box-office wise.) His presence on screen is both commanding and calming ? even when in the middle of a zombie attack! There are bit parts for well-known actors David Morse and Peter Capaldi and a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo from Lost's Matthew Fox but the real star of the show is Daniella Kertesz who plays an Israeli soldier who escapes from Jerusalem with Lane and goes on to help him in Cardiff. She manages to look beautiful despite having most of her hair shaved off for the film, and gives fine support to Brad Pitt. A star of the future perhaps! The only real moan I have with this film is that it is terribly slow when not involving zombies and is full of your everyday Hollywood clichés like how one man discovers how to stop the zombies despite none of the world governments having a clue. The film was originally meant to end with a massive battle in Moscow but by the sounds of it, it would have made Pitt's character almost Superhuman and would have been out of tone with the rest of the film. So I am pleased that they went for a smaller-scaled Dawn of the Dead like chase in a Cardiff laboratory. World War Z is a refreshing entry in the zombie-filled world of pop culture and is well worth watching in 3-D for the zombie running effects.</fullReview>

I am not going to go into to much detail so to not totally spoil the film.I had been waiting for this movie to come out since before it was even in production. The first major blow was that Brad Pitt was in it, then I thought of 12 Monkeys and said, "Well, he might be good...he might..."The movie had me excited and happy for most of the story, even though Brad Pitt adopted yet ANOTHER child, and I kind of thought all the sentiment was kind of Sandra Bullock worthy. I sat afterward thinking, "Really?!" The ending was so corny. Maybe my expectations were way to high, does anyone else agree? I should not leave a monumental zombie film suggesting that my folks go see it and that they would really like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining action movie but for those who've read the book, don't expect much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in to watch this movie with pretty high hopes but they were't completely met because the trailer of the movie that was released revealed too many significant scenes a and I already knew what was going to happen for the bulk of the film, eliminating any suspense or uncertainty that any good movie creates in the audience. However, anyone who has not read the book yet will find this movie a wild and sufficiently entertaining movie, with good action and surprise scenes. But for everyone else who've read the source novel it's a completely different story. The novel is about a journalist in post war earth (AFTER the zombie war), interviewing the most notable individuals, from different countries around the world, on how they handled the outbreak and the benefits and consequences of their strategies. The book is basically a hyper realistic, historical documentation of how a zombie outbreak would affect earth if it were to happen today. And the film disappointed. Apparently the director thought it better to make this a "one man hero film" DURING the war and it barely even incorporates even the most insignificant parts of the book. It's almost as though Marc Forster wanted to make an entirely different film but just jammed in random parts of the book where it seemed convenient. The acting and dialogue, in my opinion, were very impressive, and the zombies, albeit resembling those from the novel in no way, were very terrifying in their speed and utter clumsy and violent behaviour. The movie would've have been a more faithful and more accepted had Brad Pitt played the role of the journalist in a post apocalyptic earth, rather than a somehow "invaluable" UN official. The ending was very disappointing: a very simple "the war isn't over yet but we've found a way to deal with it...for now" kind of thing, as though the filmmaker couldn't be bothered creating a more compelling conclusion to an already mundane film.</fullReview>

I have already suggested to look out for a Romantic Zombie movie titled ''Warm Bodies'' to some of my friends and would definitely suggest this one. World War Z brings a whole new look to the conventional Zombie movies. They are now faster, hungrier and works together as well. And if that was not enough then you can also see Brad Pitt walking past a crowd of Zombies. The crowd in the movie theaters erupted at times with heroic efforts and also laughed and enjoyed. World War Z brings hope to mankind with make us feel that we can still reclaim our world back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Watch... but Suffers From Major Plot Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally gave this film a really high grade. I mean, it is the latest zombie film, and the camera, special effects, and violence are truly monumental to any other zombie film. However, as I watched it a second and third time, I noticed myself getting irritated by plot holes and conveniences. I really liked the violence in the film, however many times the effects were so greatly exaggerated that it actually can bother someone and even get in the way of enjoying the movie. The zombies in the is film are completely revolutionized into superhuman zombies that can run and jump at super human speed much like those in I am Legend. I think that this created problems because it made things impossible and at times made you roll your eyes. It starts to bother one when you think about the fact that these zombies aren't actually eating anyone and replenishing their nutrition. It doesn't explain how their muscles and bones seem to defy the laws of nature. I think where I really started being bothered by the plots is when they reach Jerusalem and the heavily defended and fortified city falls within a matter of minutes. Like LITERALLY! All this because zombies can all of a sudden get aroused when they hear people singing over the wall. And then they rush up this huge wall and sack the city. This is definitely one of the top 100 stupidest moments in film history. There essentially was no point to show this except to show a city overrun.. which they already did, and the way this city got taken was just stupid. Next scene... they jump on a plane and try going to a scientific place to find or make a vaccine. And there is a zombie hiding quietly amongst the crew. This was also something really stupid. Economic class silently gets infected while the rest of the plane doesn't hear a thing. And guess. what? Brad Pitt throws a grenade on an airplane... do you understand what actually happened? He threw a fricken grenade on a plane and survived... They did this and so happenly arrived a mile or two away from his destination. DUMB.It is obvious that there was a different type of zombie style to this film and I think it was just completely stupid. I liked the idea of how the actual infected seemed to ignore those that were already infected with another disease... but damn... this Moses parting through the red sea was stupid as well. Its actually really hard to grade this film, and as I said before, I actually liked the film, because it had many monumental features. And yet, they really went stupid on how they tried to go about the plot. They said they were going to make a second film, and I just don't see how they could with all the damage they committed with the actual capabilities they gave their zombies as well as the forced plot coincidence they put. It is actually very telling how this film is rated compared to most horror films. I believe most horror films are harshly criticized, but this one gets what it deserves which is more than it needs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another zombie movie... plus the PG-13 factor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It kind of surprises me the fact that Brad Pitt is in this kind of popcorn pleasing summer blockbuster movie. Generally he's into something more challenging for his acting skills.Generic zombie movie, really. Pay attention:Apocalypse... check;People infected with some kind of toxin or disease... check;Hero who finds out how to solve the situation before the government... check;People in panic, screaming for their lives as they are attacked by the ones who got the infection... check;And last, but not least...Promises of a sequel in the end... CHECK! Which really sucks because Hollywood showed us countless times that not only they recycle formulas like hell in modern days, but also they really suck at ending things. They usually drag a franchise and milk it until the end of days, don't have the slightest idea how to end things and so ends up rebooting everything, which makes me reach my main point: if there's a sequel to this movie, I'll wait for the reviews, because I don't want to waste my precious time with some other franchise that never gets to the point.The only difference from the rest of the zombie movies around there? It's a PG-13 zombie movie... yeah, you got it, less bites, less blood and more action oriented. Pretty generic. If you want some kind of escapism for your weekend, go watch it, but don't expect anything new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I claim that all zombie films are good, I would say this is a good film even if you disagree with my axiom. The recipe is known and doesn't stray much from what we've seen so many times before - but it's always enjoyable: zombie outbreak, hero leads a team in search of answers regarding its origin. The film plays it safe and focuses on having good action and a lot of suspense rather than try to have a deeper message or get smart, and it's probably for the best. Meanwhile, it avoids the clichés it needs to stay away from: fluke solutions, (too) bad science (like the "oh, we have a drop of blood from patient zero, the vaccine will be ready in 5 minutes" phenomenon), etc are fortunately absent. Brad Pitt has no difficulty pulling off a not too dramatically demanding role and the ending is open enough to satisfy everyone, after a somewhat anticlimactic last confrontation scene. Somewhere in between a few original ideas for the genre are carefully placed.Finally, the film did leave me wondering about one thing. Even though there are some very impressive scenes (especially the ones in Jerusalem) where it makes the difference, is there a reason for a zombie film with such a huge budget, when wonders have been made with -small- fractions of this one's cost? But I suppose this is a question for the producers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfaithful to the book, disappointing exploitation film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!I was so hoping this movie was going to be the ne plus ultra of zombie movies. After all, they had the material of Max Brooks to work from and his book "World War Z - An Oral History of the Zombie War" has SOOO much material that would bake an awesome zombie film.What did Brad and Co. pick to use from the book? Only the title and the word "Zed" apparently.I don't want to rehash a bunch of the other reviews. Just a few points that I agree with. The acting in this movie is very shallow, there is almost no character development and as a result no believable emotion between them. You don't really care what happens to them which is such a disappointment because you really felt a connection to the people in the book.The action is semi-entertaining but there is a sharp censoring to the violence to the point that it takes some of the fun out of an already lackluster movie. Guns are going off all over the place, a few grenades get tossed around and you have about as much blood as you would find at a really sedate bridge club gathering. At one point one of the characters gets infected by a Zed and decides to take his own life, but thoughtfully walks out of camera view before pulling the trigger.Which brings me to my biggest point in this review - the zombies themselves. Supposedly the virus that takes you from human to Zed happens in a matter of seconds. 12 seconds to be precise. Yet in one scene this Army Ranger captain gets bitten and has time to lament "I'm a Zed", hold a conversation with one of his troops over the radio, make the decision to kill himself and actually carry it out before suffering the slightest symptom of the infection. Talk about "Army Strong"! Everyone else in the movie starts foaming at the mouth, twitching violently on the ground and then 12 seconds later they get a new set of creepy eyes and a sudden desire to run around at 90 miles an hour and bite everything or everyone not nailed to the floor. Bite mind you, not eat.Which brings up my next point - The zombies in the Brooks books attack humans as a source of food, the ones in this movie seem to be driven to infect the entire world as fast as they can in a poorly thought out idea to heighten plot tension for the audience. Not for food, not for survival just to see how fast they can overrun the entire planet. It just doesn't make the slightest bit of sense. Run, bite, repeat. Oh and lets not forget their uncanny ability to distinguish healthy humans from terminally ill ones at a glance. What is THAT little gem about? Real zombies don't care if you are dying from black lung disease, they just want to eat you. After all dead is dead and Zed isn't picky about where his next meal comes from.The CGI was pretty good but after awhile it was the only thing carrying the action scenes. Everything in between the action just made you realize how long the movie was and how little thought went into making it. Sooo much potential, sooo much truly awesome material they could have pulled from the books to give us an epic zombie movie and we got... this.Hopefully in a few years Max will rethink how he wants his movie legacy to be remembered and someone with some actual talent making movies and who, oh I don't know actually READ THE BOOKS and has a working knowledge of the awesome story Max wrote about will do a remake worthy of the title World War Z.</fullReview>

Mario to shoot a zombie and then Sonic to zoom past with a bin wagon that can roll over a whole row of cars after being stood stationary in a nose to tail traffic jam!One of those films designed for 14-15 year old kids who with attention span of a gold fish. Stupid film and a waste of electricity ... !It's sad that concepts such as post apocalyptic survival mixed with disease outbreak are treated like this ... the reality of it really happening is really scary, now make that film and make it as violent as it needs to be</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this movie on DVD last week. I haven't read the original book. Zombie plot was nothing new. Plenty of zombie movies out there. What I found unique in this movie however, was the propaganda it carried especially for state of Israel. It kind of reminded of the novels written by Frederick Forsyth. Subtle suggestions that Israel is a oasis of intelligence and compassion whereas all other countries are bumbling idiots or brutes. Wall they built is really built to save humanity. This subtle propaganda does work and I am sure lot of people's existing biases will be confirmed.Brad Pitt was not convincing in his role. Other characters were fairly weak too. Action sequences are pretty average. I personally liked the other recent zombie movie "I legend". Overall this was a fairly forgettable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitt wasted !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A zombie movie with Brad Pitt? Are you kidding me? Brad Pitt trying a Will Smith? World War Z is an attempt gone waste. The storyline is too weak to grip you till the end. In an attempt to make the movie fast paced, there is no detailing and the characters are too week. You never get to know who the characters are and what they do for a living until it gets very obvious. Marc Foster mastered the art in Stranger than fiction and Quantum of Solace, but over did it this time. The movie starts with Brad Pitt, a family guy, who has quit his old adventurous job and going somewhere with his family. Suddenly you see a clichéd Hollywood traffic jam alien movie scene and Gerry (Pitt) becomes an important man for the UN again with no logical reasoning. Inconsistent trips to Korea and Israel makes the movie incoherent and yet predictable. A "zombies on the plane" and zombies climbing the wall as shown in the trailer remains the best cinematographed segment of the movie and leaves you wanting for more. The movie constantly gives you a déj? vu feeling. "I am Legend" zombies and been there done that in a zombie movie over power the Pitt charisma this time. I go with 4 out of 10 for World War Z for cool but scattered cinematography and poor screenplay and editing.</fullReview>

OK, stop doing that, I'm bored with this now. Eventually in the end there is a way to stop them biting you. Great. No cure, no way to save the people already afflicted, no way to get back your zombie loved ones, just titles and everyone in the movie house goes home. WTF ?If you're easily frightened and want to be freaked out by by fake zombies, go and see it. If you want a lack of plot holes and a cohesive story, watch a Harry Potter movie instead.Seriously ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best actors we have, David Morse,is in the movie. That is the only reason I watched it. He is in the movie for about 2 minutes. I think if they kept the infected as 'infected people' instead of using the word Zombie it might not have been as silly. Guess "Zombie" sells tickets. Not too much acting going on and the idea that the United Nations is the protectorate of the World is essentially laughable. The United States Military is always on the spot for disasters not the U.N.Younger people who have not been exposed to classic sci-fi will probably enjoy this. Kudos to the Special effects people. For adults it is to predictable and just a disguised vehicle for Pitt to 'spread the love hippie nonsense' his green self is all about. Does he ever wash his hair or shave?

		<shortDescription>A mindless action movie that shits on zombie lore and, more so, the source material.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout the whole movie I kept thinking: these have to be the same guys who ruined I Am Legend. Nope, it's just something everyone in Hollywood does well. Could a World War Z movie even work? It's hard to say. It's easy to see that World War Z can not work as a nonstop action movie, it is meant to be A History of The Zombie War, a retelling after the fact. Mass-produced for the American market results in zombie action schlock. A passable movie in this case requires more thought and imagination than most writing teams are used to. Luckily, there's an entire book that's *basically* a screenplay in itself just waiting to be ignored in favor of mainstream garbage.At the most basic level, I don't understand why they bought the rights to the book, it would clearly have worked as a mockumentary with separate vignettes featuring big stars in small roles. They obviously just wanted a potential franchise with Brad Pitt, and shoehorned elements of some random book his company had purchased into a Bourne-style action flick. There are glaring problems in the story and completely illogical steps taken by the main character, the supposed "best investigator in America," who is a complete moron and half the characters he meets may as well be card-board cutouts with post-it notes stuck to them reading "go this way". What was the deal with the random establishing of Matthew Fox's character, only to have absolutely nothing done with him because they swapped out the ending for some random crap about zombies being scared of sick people. Why is almost every zombie CG? I get it for scenes where there's hundreds of them swarming around like ants but a lot of the time they even used CG zombies in isolation. Is it really cheaper and easier to animate a CG zombie than it is to use an extra with some zombie makeup?The characters are completely thin, stock cutouts. There is not a single interesting character and they have no development or depth at all. A boring, barely existent plot which feels thrown together. There's also a complete lack of tension because it just isn't made well. Examples:*Fast zombies - A symptom of lazy writing. *Zombies scaling the black gates of Mordor - Silly. *Hey everyone but the protagonist died in the plane crash, how convenient! *This Israeli girl's character has served her purpose, she'll either die or split up with the journalist. - No, the focus groups like her too much. Just have her tag along with the journalist or something I don't know, no I don't care that it doesn't make sense and that we never bothered giving her a personality. Focus groups ruin everything again!There aren't any scenes with enough time or atmosphere to leave an impression. It's disaster porn. It's 2012 with Brad Pitt.And it sucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay just to start with this that the bad reviews written about this are not necessary accurate. Stating all that this movie is a superb watch. The movie from the very start had my attention. The opening scene alone was excellent. I would highly recommend anyone watch this who likes the whole futuristic diseases related end of the world related scenarios. I was impressed with most of the plot....and its not a bad movie as most people are saying it was. The one thing that does concern me in the movie is that it is a PG-13 movie. Well then it is a good PG-13 movie with a very good cast that does a good job acting together, but then it is strictly a PG-13 movie. So the whole crazy zombie effect that most people are expecting from this was an over expectation (in my opinion).In the end it is PG-13 movie so enjoy it for what it is...not what you were trying to expect it to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Max Brooks would be mortified if he if he watched this. As I understand it, once he sold the rights to Plan B (Pitts production company) he ceased to remain involved.....Big mistake Max.....you let us down. It started of well and had a lot of potential, but it just turned out to be another Hollywood CGI fest. It didn't mirror the book. It lacked all of the classic zombie movie traits....."the survival factor" - too many times throughout the movie I never felt like "Gerry" was in any danger. "Gore" - What zombie movie doesn't have blood?! I mean come on, all that money on CGI and they couldn't afford a few blood packs?! "Obligatory head shots" - It goes without saying really. Worried they'll come back to eat you? Double tap a la Zombieland! It's not just the fact that they didn't follow the book. I wouldn't have rated it as a non-book related movie for the above reasons.SPOILER ALERT:Now that there's a "camouflage", I'm wondering how they will make the sequel? I'm hoping they skip trying to provide us with continuity and drifting further away from the book by throwing us into the battle of Yonkers with a side plots of the downed helicopter pilot?Anyway, this is my first review and hopefully not my last. It's a shame to start off badly reviewing an adaptation of what is my all time favourite book. =(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this last night I'm a great fan of Sci-Fi and disaster movies, and had high expectations for this film.The first 45 mins were brilliant. Great suspense and drama and really felt for the plight of the characters.After that, the film degenerated into a chase around the world(!). The purpose of trying to find patient zero, was merely used as an excuse to show one action/disaster scene after another, and the plot line became thinner and less plausible with every passing second.The last half hour was so predictable and boring I should have just curled up and gone to sleep.And as for the ending, it had the typical spongy, gooey happy ending that so clearly appeals to American audiences.I'm afraid the plot line is the same old garbage Hollywood has been putting out for the past 10 years - major event, chase scene, action scene, implausible chase scene, stupid happy ending.This started out looking like an intelligent film - but was really no deeper than the likes of 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow.28 days is a far superior film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth Every Penny of its Budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rooting against big budgeted Hollywood excesses is an on and off again pastime for me. While I enjoy a summer blockbuster just as much as anyone when they are good (see The Avengers), I can't help but snicker when I see a terrible idea go down in flames (see the Lone Ranger).And so was the expectation with World War Z, director Marc Forster's adaptation of the critically acclaimed Max Brooks' novel. The book was clever in that it was written like a historical retelling of a real event, the event here being the zombie apocalypse. Forster and screenwriter Matthew Carnahan shun most of Brook's narrative style, giving the author's witty concept the Hollywood makeover. It should be noted that World War Z had one of the more troubled production phases in recent film history with rumors circulating that its budget had skyrocketed to as much as $400 million (In reality, it was more in the $200-$250 million range). Recasting, script rewrites, and director-star squabbles were all in the mix which usually is a recipe for disaster come release time. But not only has WWZ defied odds by being a runaway hit looking now to eventually turn a profit, it is also one of the most expertly concocted thrillers in recent memory.Brad Pitt stars as Gerry Lane, a former United Nations investigator who is enjoying retirement playing Mr. Mom with his wife and two children. After he and his family narrowly escape the onslaught of the zombie outbreak in downtown Philadelphia, they eventually are whisked to safety aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier where Gerry is recruited by his old U.N. boss to assist in tracking down the outbreak's source. Lane then begins what will eventually become a globetrotting investigation where he and crew face the deadliness of the infection head on in Korea, Israel, and England.Pitt is rolling into his middle age roles nicely. He plays Lane as a low key, slick government flatfoot whose previous experience in crappy situations helps keep him alive in the madness here. And it is pretty much his show the whole way through. He is aided throughout the film by different groups of people with little development of any of these side characters. It is a small drawback and the non stop thrill ride of the film's events more than make up for it.Forster creates sequence after sequence here that one ups the previous one on the nail biting meter. Brook's zombies are not your slump around, Walking Dead type zombies. As savage as they were in 28 Days Later, the creatures here are even more beastly in their speed and brutality. Forster borrows some from Danny Boyle's masterpiece early on but finds his own narrative as WWZ moves forward. From an airplane landing on a pitch black military landing strip to an escape from an over ran safety compound in the middle of the day, Forster keeps viewers glued to the screen no matter where the setting is. The film culminates in a masterfully paced final act in which Pitt and friends zero in on possible relief for the catastrophic epidemic.WWZ is smart while not being pretentious and exciting without being outrageous. It is everything one can want in a summer blockbuster and hopefully the beginning of an excellent franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers?The trailer itself is the first great spoiler. A giant budget wasted this way. I didn't read the book, so that's not the problem. These movies try to hide how their plot sucks with great special effects. There are positive things in this movie, I liked some action scenes but that's it, all the other aspects aren't even decent, the plot is the main problem. This UN agent Gerry Lane(Brad Pitt) who travels across countries like he's the saviour of humanity and he's quite invincible, he gets injured only after the plane crash(he can survive any situation apparently). The zombies are faster than Bolt and you can't distinguish them from normal people. When I saw the first attack I didn't understand why they were all running, then I got there were "zombies" amongst them. The attack of the zombies in Jerusalem?Come on, a stupid mic which does more noise than an airport. Can't the helicopter see that the zombies are climbing the wall?Then the same zombies fall from a great height and they get no damage at all. Sure. Characters?The only character we see it's Gerry 'cause he has the main role, but we can't even know much about it, a former UN agent with some med and fighting skills, stop. The other characters are just background, they are dull, with no characterization at all. Gerry's family?Background. His "friend"?Background. The CIA agent?Background. The Israelian soldier?Background. The virologist?Not even background, I knew he was the first to die the right moment I saw him. The last part is something speechless, the action rapidly falls down and we have this research lab, something horrible. They wasted Pierfrancesco Favino(I know him and he's a really good actor)in a useless role, Gerry, the soldier and him just make noise over noise during their "mission" and that's all. The final speech is just pathetic. Brad Pitt is a great actor, watch Se7en or Fight Club for example and you see the real Brad. There's really no suspense, if some character dies, we don't care. Finally, the lack of gore doesn't help. The worst part of the movie is the 7.4 rating. Seriously?I mean, how many movies have almost the same rating and are far better than this?Many. World War Z is not a good movie with some flaws, it's a really bad movie with many flaws. Don't waste your money like I did.</fullReview>

It's not one of those... you need to jump up, and go to the theater to see right now movies. Now this is my opinion based on my taste. I do, however believe that the movie could have contained just a little more action, with the showing more of the infection spreading in more cities. In the positive range for this movie, is that it was very creative in some aspects of the film, but also decently enjoyable on a level that I could sit through the whole movie. So, my honest review for this movie... is this, it is a okay movie.</fullReview>

If you take a objective look at the movie I absolutely promise you will be entertained, by the effects and action alone. As for the movie, its not a zombie-horror movie, tell me one damn zombie movie with a conflict resolution.... that's right the genre is based on hopeless survival. Trust me when i tell you, I have seen every god damned zombie movie since white zombie. This movie is meant to be sci-fi horror with zombies as the antagonists; expecting ripped open stomachs, and skulls turning into applesauce, go watch a slasher because this movie not for you. If you want a innovative movie that gives a fast paced mysterious story with overwhelming visual effects then go to theaters asap. Remember that's it's science, not a bunch of kids with make shift weapons barricading themselves from impending doom. Not to say that's not entertaining but it's so refreshing to see a movie that isn't tied down by the constraints of gore, survival, and classic zombie antiques that has caused such a great idea to take a dive in the last decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, i know that if they made the movie REALLY realistic, as in put more blood, then it wouldn't have received its PG13 rating, but who cares! There was honestly too less blood. I'm not a sadist or anything, but seriously.Personally, i haven't actually read the book, so i'm gonna base my review in that point of view. Was this movie original? Not really. I've seen other zombie movies where the virus originated from rabies. One cool fact however was that once bitten, you'll be turning into a crazed carnivore in 12 seconds. So at least the massive spreading of the virus is justifiable. Was this movie unique? Well, yes. It certainly had a different approach on the 'cure'. It had these brilliant ideas on how to combat zombie bites, So yes it was unique. With a budget of $190 000 000, the director certainly made use of every penny, and you can see it for yourself in the movie. Brad Pitt put on a demanding display (his usual self) and his character certainly teaches us values which even the youngsters of today's generation could pick up. I wouldn't say that the storyline is predictable, but it was to a certain extent unrealistic. But the flow of events was really great that you'd only be feeling the unrealism of the plot after the movie. In which case, you should watch it twice. I have to say, for a PG13 movie, it should be the best zombie movie so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitt's character can do no wrong in this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understood going in to this movie that World War Z would be taking a departure from Max Brooks' highly respected zombie novel, so I tried to leave that disappointment at home and simply appreciate the movie for what it had to offer. As someone pointed out in an earlier review, "A wasted opportunity".(SPOILER ALERT FROM HERE ON) That being said, it was better than expected and I was optimistic at the early scenes where Brad Pitt and family were stuck in traffic as all hell breaks loose around them. I even thought the use of CGI up to this point was done sparingly and very effectively, although I'm not a fan of CGI monsters (let's be honest, Computer Generated Imagery is just modern day "claymation"). In the traffic jam sequence you couldn't tell where the zombies were coming from as they blended in from behind the panicked pedestrians. Very creepy.There were several other instances of well executed action-filled sequences that I believe would satisfy anyone looking to just be scared sh**less by fast moving zombies out to devour our beloved characters on the run. And to accomplish all this with a PG-13 rating and no blood just shows that a zombie movie need not rely on endless shots of gore to still be scary and entertaining. World War Z accomplishes this, for the most part.Unfortunately, this movie was a lot of big budget special effects surrounding a mediocre script that had me wondering if our beloved main character, played by Brad Pitt, could do no wrong. On numerous occasions Pitt's character seemed to defy the impossible and was incapable of dying in this movie when all else around him did (including a SEAL team assigned to him) which came off as a little insulting to my intelligence and far-fetched (yes, even in a zombie movie).First, there's the unexplainable escape in a borrowed RV from the downtown traffic jam as the scene simply cuts away showing Brad and family on an open road heading away from the city.Second, the fortunate escape on a commercial airliner from the city of Jerusalem when the city is overrun followed by his miraculous survival of an airplane crash (after causing the crash by throwing and surviving the hand grenade blast as he throws it toward the rear of the plane).Third, near the end of the movie he injects himself with an unknown virus selected at random from a box of biological hazards in an attempt to "camouflage" himself from a zombie. Forutunately, he not only selects one that doesn't kill him, but it's also the very one that disguises himself from the zombies (heavy sigh).In a nutshell, World War Z is loaded with entertaining action which I believe serves to distract from a very disappointing storyline loaded with head-shaking, "what the f**k was that" moments.Is is worth seeing? Sure. Worth remembering? Nope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Brad Pitt it is a hit or miss performance. Examples are Mr. and Mrs. Smith, a strike out to end the game while Fight Club is a grand slam. Then he did a movie like Troy which is more like an intentional walk. He was boring and almost unnecessary but still useful. With World War Z out I gave it a fighting chance it's easily an RBI double. You know I should have said Moneyball with all with all the baseball references but I haven't seen it but I assume he did well. World War Z is a zombie movie loosely based on the book and with all the zombie stuff that came out in the past few years with The Walking Dead and all the videogames about zombies I feared this movie would be too little too late. I had high hopes for this movie and I was not disappointed. The movie starts with a bit of a far-fetched action sequence but it kicked off the movie in strong fashion. We saw a little bit of his normal family life and everything seemed really good. We get a hint at an old job Pitt had but he left to be with his family. I personally liked his family. I was afraid once he left them they would not really be seen again but every now and then the audience is reminded of their existence and that is important. His family is why he fights and it is his drive for everything he does in the movie. With the way the movie kicked off I was a bit worried. In terms of action it was awesome and set a great pace but in terms of story it lacked, badly. The zombie outbreak just happened. No idea how or why. It was sudden and it came out of nowhere. One second the family is in traffic and the next there is an explosion and a huge truck plowing away traffic like snow. I was sitting in my theater giving myself a reality check seeing as that truck would never get thru those cars so easily but I let it go. The movie then took a turn and dug deep into the story. It turns out Pitt used to work for the UN and he is set out on a quest to find the origin of the virus and the leverage to actually do it is his family. I also loved the little Spanish kid they take in while they are in Newark, kid is a beast.Brad Pitt gives another stellar performance and so did the actress who played the little girl in The Dark Knight Rises, it's the little girl with the shaved head we all thought was a bay, yeah her, she was a good fit. In terms of acting Brad Pitt was the only one that mattered. By that I mean nobody else got enough screen time to get connected to. Anthony Hopkins plays a criminal in a South Korean prison and his character was awesome. The conversation between him and Pitt was my favorite scene is the entire movie. I wish it was possible to see more of his character and many others but to push the story along they had their fifteen minutes of fame, literally, and moved on. In terms of suspense this movie was grade A. The scene where the zombies are climbing up the wall by using a giant pig pile was brilliant. That whole scene was a giant mound of awesomeness I didn't want to end. The zombies themselves looked amazing and real. When I say real I mean if zombies were a real thing they would look like these zombies. The way they run in packs and swarm cities is terrifying and awesome to watch. The transformation from normal person to a hungry zombie was creepy and hard to watch. The action scenes were great, especially the scene on the plane. I saw it in the trailers and I was afraid it would be awful but it was awesome. Other than explosive and physical action there was a sense of suspense in sneaking around. Pitt finds himself in a hospital because he thinks has found a way to become immune to the virus. He and two other people are sneaking around and its gets intense. The crawling and sneaking is like something from a video game and it was fun to watch. It wasn't a short thing either, it took a long time for the scene to finish and it was highly entertaining. Overall, I thought World War Z was going to be a disgrace of a film but I walked out enjoying it very much. I heard this was the beginning of a trilogy which I am now OK with. With the way it ended I left with a feeling of wanting more. Brad Pitt did way better than I thought he would have and when it comes out on blu ray I will buy it. For now, World War Z gets the WillyT Honorable mention. It is a very good movie for the summer and is one that you should go see and enjoy as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was going to write a long detailed review but after reading a few of the other low scoring reviews they pretty much nailed it.The zombies were terrible.The pg13 rating for a horror/action film doesn't work..not ever!The characters were cardboard and really couldn't care less who lived or died and that's including Brad Pitt.The Ending.. last 40mins of complete and utter boredom.I heard they had another alternative ending which was in Moscow and was all action but they chose to switch to wales and give the audience a break from the action scenes. Well whoever decided that needs to be fed to a group of zombies because that pretty much was finished off this already suffering movie. Believe me the only little, small, tiny good thing about this film was the action scenes and giving the audience time to think and realise they're actually watching rubbish before the credits rolled was mega dumb. If your cooking up a crap fest movie fill it with action and then more action right up to the end credits, no pauses no breaks just all action that way people will look back and go 'yeah story, acting all sucked but at least the action was good.' So yeah if this film ever appears on TV I'll watch 3/4's of it then switch over. Another film to add to the list of films that could have been good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure some of the nonsensical plot points were difficult to put on the big screen, I mean, the story seemed like an overwrought, worthless husk. But even with the premise that big, dumb action movies can be fun if you switch off your brain, man, this is not enjoyable for technical reasons.The build up, timing, execution and flow of just about everything action related in this movie was bad. Just flat out terrible action sequences that just *chop* *chop* *chop* from each 1 second clip to the next one with no care, consideration, or thought.Don't get me wrong, he could be a good director in another genre, I've never seen Monsters Ball, the acting in this movie was passable for a popcorn movie, but action is definitely not his thing having seen this and Quantum.</fullReview>

No matter how talented one is at stuffing ones mouth with little tiny black tu^ds, one's mouth is still full of filth. Perhaps, Brad Pitt should win the ig nobel award for this film. Remembering how my first baby would fill his diaper with so much brown goo, yet me and Mom loved the little guy for producing so much of it, so often. It was wonderful. Yet, it was still a foul product to others. I hope I have kept at least one viewer from wasting time smelling this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers! I didn't know anything about the movie before I saw it, but I was expecting maybe some political undertones or cleverness or reference to the other world wars but it was soon apparent that the only enemy in the movie is a virus that causes people to twerk uncontrollably. No politics, no territorial disputes, just a lot of zombies anxious to get the best "black Friday" deal at Walmart. What would have been funny is if after Brad's wife calls him in Korea and the phone wakes up the zombies he would have answered and said "I thought I told you never to call me at work!" What was (unintentionally?) funny was the smugness of the Israelis and their country surrounded by zombie-proof walls. Even the schlocky "2012" had a better story of a dad and his family escaping destruction. WWZ disappoints all the way to the stupid conclusion. How does this get 7.1 stars from IMDb? Most of the reviews seem to be under 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And I spent money renting this. Computer generated zombie hordes swarming over computer generated walls, vehicles and fleeing masses gets old after, say, 45 minutes. As our hero flies from country to country barely escaping the aforementioned hordes, the plot fizzles into a predictably scary scenario that we've all seen hundreds of times in lower budget horror films.I had hoped that this "film" would add some interesting twists to the extremely tired zombie genre, but alas, it was not to be. The 50s version of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" was a whole lot scarier and John Carpenter's 1982 remake of "The Thing" had more innovative effects for the time.I actually liked "Warm Bodies" better because it at least had a plot and a story line that wasn't simply an amalgamation of every zombie movie ever made (only with swarming fast zombies replacing the plodding ones).I rented this dog on Pay-per-View and spent an extra dollar for the HD version. My bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ho hum Hollywood.I am not sure what the problem is with writers these days but these screenplays with no characters and nothing of consequence happening are getting ridiculous.It's especially ridiculous in the genre of zombie movies or even Apocalypse movies. You can't tell a story like this without characters people care about and people can't care about characters with no background with the viewer.An example of a zombie/Apocalypse done better (of which there are many) would be Dawn of the Dead remake (2004). The movie starts with the main character as a normal person instantly surrounded by zombie horror, much like world War Z... except the main character suffers loss and the rest of the movie explores a core group of characters and how they relate to each other at the end of the world. It's interesting and involves CHARACTERS.In World War Z Brad Pitt's family is continuously safe. Then they get sent out of safety... to safety... there's zero tension surrounding the main character other than what is happening directly to him. But it's predictable, boring and completely bereft of character.Hell I don't even know what his name was! (?) And I don't care.World War Z suffers what so many Hollywood 'blockbusters' suffer from these days: Lots of money spent on CGI, zero budget into writing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is possibly the worst movie i've ever seen. It is so bad that i actually laughed out loud at several points in the film. I have to wonder why someone as talented as Pitt even go near this fiasco of a film. I went into the movie thinking the reviewers might be right that it is a scary and thrilling movie. I came out wondering who on earth would think that it was a good film? The characters are poorly developed. Pitt did a good job with his character, but ALl the other actors seemed to be taking happy pills or tranquilizers. They weren't very upset that the world was being taken over by zombies. the zombies themselves were ridiculous. They acted like third graders at recess. Actually, the zombies reminded me of a colony of ants. every situation was utterly ridiculous. This is not how people would act if there were a true invasion of aliens. Go to see it only if you want a good laugh and some good ideas for Halloween.</fullReview>

Yeah the special effects are amazing. The graphics were good too. Aside from that though it's not that good. Plus, it isn't scary, yet it's considered a horror film. Maybe one or two jump scenes but it doesn't even have a scary build up or atmosphere. The plot was the same, if not worse, than any other zombie film. It's not your 2013 version of Night Of The Living Dead haha. But it is a good time killer, so if you're bored go see it!

That shows you it's like a sport event where you know, and are disappointed, in the conclusion so you beat the crowd out. The beginning is kind of exciting and they pile it on like a buffet leaving you full and ready to leave even if you didn't get to try everything that looked so promising when you were hungry. If you didn't pick up on that, it's a metaphor for how excited we were walking in, seeing all the cool graphics, getting what we expected, but somehow realizing that this was a mistake.

		<fullReview>As a fan of zombie movies, and having seen scores of good, bad, and totally terrible ones, I'm pleased to say World War Z has acquired a new categorization all of its own. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you.... the "boring" zombie movie. Never in the history of the undead flick has something so tedious been set to celluloid. In fact let me re-label it for you: Yawn Of The Dead. I went to see this with my girlfriend and before it began she asked me "is this going to be scary?" By the end, we both agreed that the scariest part was us paying to see it in the first place. I mean a zombie movie with no gore? What the hell? I don't even know why it was a 15 Cert in the UK. A PG would have sufficed. I'm not even going to mention how you can see it jump scenes really quickly due to all this re-writing business we've all heard about. The whole thing is just garbage. Sure those CGI crowd scenes we saw in the trailers look OK, but that's about it. I could have saved myself 20 quid by just watching those on YouTube. Really, this movie is pants. Go and watch one of Romeros old flicks, or even 28 days Later if you want to see a decent zombie flick. This thing stinks like a rotting corpse.</fullReview>

It is absolutely horrific.The only movie I can think of that comes close to this in terms of inaccuracies to the source material is The Running Man, and at least that was entertaining. Don't waste your time with this film. I have no idea how the rating is as high as it is.Shame on Paramount for getting the rights to this and then flushing it down the toilet.

Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. The hook is just a bunch of computer generated hype in the form of running zombies. The movie doesn't answer any of your basic questions. Why do people become zombies. Why does Brad Pitt survive every zombie attack but others die. Why is this a World War since it seems really lame and obvious how to defeat the zombies. Why is a lame UN dork like Brad Pitt the only hope for our survival? He doesn't seem to possess any knowledge that would be considered exceptional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really anxious to go watch this movie, but I came out of it wondering why I had spent all the money going into a movie that didn't convey half the fright of the book.The book is epic, the movie fails bluntly. Sure, there are great scenes around, the zombie mountains are fearsome, but it's like they picked the book up and used 1% of it, centering around Pitt's character and that pathetic relationship with his stupid wife.I'm sure soldiers these days get to call home and chat while trying to survive, but having a wife call you, not really knowing if that call might kill you or not... sorry, I would ditch the idiot as soon as I got home. Of course we could forgive such a thing, but the movie was full of plot holes and felt like they took the less important parts of the book and pasted it there: movie goers need dumbed down crap, eh? Half the movie is about this couple, and the other half is plain silly.I just don't get where all the money was spent. I mean, sure, I can believe a C-130 taking-off from a carrier. It's been done. It's a stretch, but has been done. Besides it's a zombie movie, but that C-130 turns to an Antonov 12 from scene to scene. Plus, you hardly notice there's a world war, since other than a few scenes with ample outsides, 2/3 of the movie are within doors, the kind of stuff you could make with 1% the same budget.Was Brad Pitt sucking up all the budget or something? This movie feels like nobody read the book, and got turned into a very lame PG-13 in-your-face action flick relying too much on Brad Pitt and not a lot on anything else.Read the book, it's way more interesting.</fullReview>

Don't like reading? Get the World War Z audio book and listen to it in your car! This was such a typical Hollywood junk move: buy the rights to something that was awesome and turn it into a steaming pile of over-hyped garbage.Max Brooks, the author of Zombie Survival guide and World War Z, went out of his way in these books to undo the damage done by low grade zombie movies and give credibility to a zombie outbreak. The zombie moved in a predictable slow rate, they were defeated by faster, more agile living, they were truly undead due to a virus that transforms the front of the brain to an anaerobic organism. The advantage they had was simply their numbers, being able to infect new hosts and their undead stamina.The movie had "fast zombies" who ran and bounced around like a glittering vampire from Twilight. The movie had NO resemblance to the memoir style the book or the events that took place within. The guy who is supposed to be an interviewer/narrator is instead cast as the most "Joe Bad-ass" journalist I've ever seen (Brad Pitt) and he saves the world. Good thing he has Jesus hair, because he went all sorts of savior on this one.</fullReview>

And, only one man at the UN can save the world (like the UN has ever saved anything). That man, of course, is a house-husband (what else would a bum looking superhero be doing). So the few resources left are employed to go get the bum-like house-husband, so he can save everyone. All the other men in the world are apparently worthless...only bum-looking house-husband knows what to do. That fact that people today think this is a good movie is enough to make you cry.

		<fullReview>What is this World War Z (or as we say in the UK Zed) thing all about then I hear you ask?Brad Pitt is having a brilliant morning flipping pancakes and strapping his kiddywinkys into the obligatory ugly Volvo when all of a sudden, oh no! The smelly brown stuff hits the fan. Oh dear me the zombie apocalypse has broken out on the school run- I hate it when that happens! (if it's any consolation mate, I know how you feel). Next we learn he is not merely a lowly house-husband but a handsome UN special envoy type hero guy. Off he rushes to plonk his annoying squeaking females somewhere safe on a big boat thing so he can go and be awesome somewhere else. His boss insists he jaunts off round the world with a rubbish nerd and some thick soldiers to South Korea, Jerusalem and ?.er..Cardiff (which as we all know looks just the same when there is not a zombie apocalypse in full swing) on an epic journey to find a cure for the un-dead menace and of course save the world- as one does when not attending PTA meetings. What we are presented with is a sort of standard disaster/monster movie mash up. I am a horror addict and I would not call this horror, it isn't scary or disturbing at all, neither things are this movie's priorityLet's start with what is most important shall we? The zombies. As a zom-oisseur I really must say these undead are pathetically tame. Not a lot of gut-munching goes on here I'm afraid people. Where is the blood? the goo? the gore? where are the entrails exactly? what on earth do these zombies eat? 'cos it sure as hell ain't anybody's spicy brains!There is just something missing from them, they are neither Romero style zombies, or 28 Days 'Infected' but some sort of diluted take on one or both. These zombies are lacking personality I think there was really no importance placed them AT ALL by the director. BIG MISTAKE. A zombie movie will stand or fall based on the zombies, any true zombie fan knows this to be true, choose the right actors get the right effects and make them your own rather than a seething homogeneous mass as they seem to be in World War Z.On to the rest, the performances here are middling, they are okay but what we horror fans hate is when actors do not take their roles in horror movies seriously. I am not saying a horror movie should be serious- even in a movie like Evil Dead which at not one single point any of three films takes itself seriously it is clear that the actors DO take their roles to heart and understand that horror is a difficult genre which demands effort in order to achieve a good outcome. It seems to me that the actors in this movie do not really seem to understand that they are trying to 'do' horror. They either think it is emotional drama, or action or a thriller. As an emotional drama this film also falls over, personally I couldn't care less what happened to the people in this film, the whole thing is poorly done. This is supposed to be horror people! come on! Jump scares and CGI do not equal scary in any way you have to make us believe what you are selling to us.So disappointingly here is yet another generic zombie apocalypse cash in movie, no more no less. World War Z is a zombie movie lite, it's not for hardcore zombie fans at all. If you want to see something better watch The Walking Dead. If you want to see something more classic go back to Romero or check out The Dead you might like that (a zombie survival film I really DID feel emotionally effected by)World War Z film is really very generic Hollywood fare riddled with tacky product placement and not for horror aficionados. If you usually avoid decent horror movies you will probably get on okay with it though and think it is super-scary and amazables *facepalm*</fullReview>

There isn't much to the story - the plot is fairly linear - it revolves around Brad Pitt needing to get to point A and then point B, then to point C and point D.The direction seems to indicate they wanted this to be a rich realistic experience, and yet the characterisation was mostly one dimensional - this is largely due to the flaw of direction - with too much time spent on hopping around the globe from location to location, there was very little time for audience to build a connection with the on screen characters. The acting was horrendous - most of the actors were pretty wooden in this movie I could mistaken I was watching a bunch of CG characters on screen. Daniella Kertesz was horrific, she barely bat an eye when her hand got hacked off as if she had a mosquito bite. Brad Pitt just looked worried and tired throughout the movie with very little of anything else. Everyone else just keep dying around Brad Pitt so literally there wasn't much acting all around. David Morse had a 1 minute on screen appearance without his teeth acting slightly crazy and that was about it. I couldn't tell if Fana Mokoena is a sock puppet or not because he literally had no expression on his face when he delivered his lines. Elyes Gabel was the UN virologist who turned out to be nothing more than a skit who blew his brain out after he tripped trying to escape the zombies; pretty much every character in the movie was forgettable and I couldn't care less if they live or die.I was also shocked to find out Matthew Fox was in the movie. Was he invisible? I certainly could not remember where I saw him in the movie - that's how forgettable his performance was in the movie.Also, there were some colossal movie mistakes throughout the movie such as Russian Antonov An-12 turboprop transport stand in as US AIRFORCE C-130 (WTF?!) that TOOK OFF from an amphibious assault ship (which was designed ONLY for helicopter and Harrier jump jet style vertical take off and landing as there is no steam catapult or arresting gears on these ships, not to mention there is simply NO ROOM for even conventional landing - not nearly even 1/10 long or 1/5 wide enough - let alone for a GIANT transport plane to land and take off from) !!!!! Last not the least the movie ends with Brad Pitt injecting himself randomly with virus to fool the zombie and NOT die from the virus he injected himself with.Visually it has many truly spectacular CG sequences depicting the zombies overrunning the cities. It was truly stunning, but those were too few and inbetween. In the book there was a crucial sequence where US Army had an epic showdown with the zombie hoards but got butchered in the process, this was NOT in the movie and would have been spectacular if they did. The music score was also horrendous. Throughout the movie the music were at best underwhelming, or just totally inappropriate.Overall, a very dull and unemotional experience. 3/10</fullReview>

Maybe their silly accents? We'll never know...* The test subject the Brits have in the glass box is - shock, horror - a black woman. Who *will* have to go in there and face her!Plot flaws: Why not set up loud speakers and draw them towards a big pit of burning oil? Israel: Why not just add a large 45° angled outward facing lip to the top of the wall? If the zombies are just infected people, why not just wait three days until they die of dehydration?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Again zombies..., no new ideas, no scenario, acting real bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this is a big disappointment, in the end of the movie I left with a feeling, that Brad Pitt laughed at this movie himself, his acting was so indifferent, I didn't see that he was scared of zombies or truly love and worry about his family, I felt like himself he didn't believe in all this situation. Actually it was so strange that the audience was laughing the whole movie and even louder when some scene were over dramatic. After one hour I saw people living. I think it is the worst movie that Brad Pit ever played in. Everything in the scenario is so predictable, I mean everybody knew how it is going to end. Pity, I had huge expectations both from the movie and from Brad Pitt.</fullReview>

Overall it was great, actually, the best film i have seen in years!! its what everyone has been waiting for a zombie movie full of drama,romance,chaos,action and more. 9/10 extraordinary piece of film- making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly didn't know what to think about this movie at first. It had seemed a little over the top. But when I watched it, everything changed. It was great! You could hardly tell they were zombies from what we perceive to be a 'zombie'. They were incredibly fast and just traveled in gigantic numbers. It really had a totally different take on the horror genre. The movie was almost completely different than the very popular TV show, The Walking Dead. It looked like the movie would have a lot of blood and gore, but it turns out it doesn't, and it really didn't need it, in my opinion. Although, at some parts, I found it completely unrealistic; such as when they were talking about North Korea, I believe, and how they pulled all of their people's teeth out so they would no get infected. But overall, I believed the acting was excellent and Brad Pitt had done very well. This was the definition of a great large budget film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, not the usual Zombie fare which is a good thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was much better than I thought it would be, probably for the very reasons some didn't like it.It was a real movie with story, good characters, touching moments, and real suspense (slasher/gore isn't suspense). This actually raises the stakes and probably makes it more impactful in a real way. The whole set up is very plausible. The stakes for the family are also very real. It also did a good balance of how these situations will bring out the best in most people but also the worst in many. It wasn't all "everyone is out to take advantage and evil" but there were some.And sometimes people in the movie didn't react well or did stupid things. But that is realistic if you think about it. Most weren't trained for combat never mind "the end of the world as they know it". Stuff happens and they way it was dealt with made it more interesting.Many movies smooth these things over so they are less realistic and therefore make less of an impact. Let's face it, the majority of zombie fair is ridiculous, even when they have a basic premise that is possible. They are like video games that you know aren't real and half the time you are trying not to laugh or get annoyed at the stupidity, just like the average slasher/gore movies. The movie isn't about the zombies, they are just the threat and the backdrop. The movie is about the people. It's kind of like The Walking Dead in that aspect.I'm also not a big fan of movies that have action scenes that just go on forever. It's usually stupid and ultimately boring. More is often not better. This had great action scenes broken up by real human moments. Like I said, a real, well balanced movie.I loved it and it went by very fast. People I was with also weren't too sure going in but loved it coming out of the theater.And you shouldn't never decide a movie based on a book. They never compare well. Unless you want to go the LOTR route and make 3 movies more than 3 hours long, you aren't going to do what was in the book. As a result, even the best adaptations combine characters, merge situations,etc. Judge a movie as a stand alone piece of work.I agree this probably isn't for kids. The stakes are more real and therefore it would be more upsetting. Unfortunately, kids are used to gore these days, but this isn't that.There is at least one minor clip in the trailers that doesn't seem to be in the movie. There will no doubt be an extended version at some point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombie v2.0</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read the book and am therefore not making a comparison against the book.As a zombie flick on the whole, it is definitely quite different. These are not the traditional slow moving, flesh tearing zombies reminiscent of the Walking Dead walkers or the more classical types. It's zombies v2.0, the faster ones, featured in Resident Evil 5 (the game) and the creatures from I Am Legend. So if you consider this expectation or aspect, then your experience with this movie might be different.The severe lack of blood and biting also makes this movie depart from the classical sense. After all that's said and done, I actually did find this movie 'refreshing' from the usual zombie apocalypse movies. You didn't have large groups of people with a set of melodramatic characters who are quick to whine about every decision made by the group. There is also no cases of a group holed up in any place and surviving the apocalypse. Therefore, there's very less of the older zombie movie formula.If, like me, you've got a good dose of classic zombie or zombie v1.0, then you might find this movie refreshing. Add to that, there are quite a number of intense moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat. There is also another interesting aspect that this film handles which is rarely ever dealt with in classic zombie flicks. I can't give that part away without revealing a spoiler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not awful, but all the same disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am always up for a good zombie movie - emphasis on "GOOD". Most zombie movies I've seen have disappointed me, and "World War Z" is other notch on that list.I haven't read the book the movie is based on, but I suspect it must have been a lot better than this. What went wrong? I'm not sure. Despite all the money that was thrown at this movie (including refilming the ending), the movie at times doesn't seem that expensive. Another problem is that the zombies themselves aren't explored closely. You never really get a sense of what they are like and what they can do. Why would they only bite people instead of eating them, like zombies in other movies? Well, that's probably because the movie stubbornly sticks to being at a PG-13 level. Yes, that's right - a zombie movie without that much blood and gore, which I know will annoy many horror fans.Well, I guess the movie isn't THAT bad, but it's a big disappointment. I should note that I saw the movie for free at a theater. If I had paid any money to see it, I strongly suspect my review would have been a lot more scathing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*spoilers ahead!*An extremely impressive entry in the zombie genre and for me easily the best such since 1977's Dawn of the Dead. WWZ may break one of the supposed rules of the genre in its almost complete absence of gore but Brad Pitt's film more than compensates with an efficiently plotted linear storyline that remarkably shows no obvious signs of its troubled production, a spectacular sense of scale, a satisfactory balance between action and emotion rare in summer blockbusters and an often intense breakneck pace.There's a lot that I liked about WWZ, from the way the film utilises its fast moving zombies as a symbol of the often frightening speed and density of everyday life, to supporting characters who are introduced only to be killed off without any of the bombast you'd have had to endure had the movie been directed by a Zack Snyder or Michael Bay. The emotional heart of the story - UN hotshot Gerry Lane's (Brad Pitt) relationship with his wife and kids - feels refreshingly damped down rather than overblown, believable without being schmaltzy. Rich and famous he may be but there's an interesting grounded quality to Pitt. Casting him as an Everyman sort of character doesn't seem like the kind of stretch it would if you had the likes of DiCaprio or Tom Cruise starring.The story is a ground-breaking amalgamation of zombie horror and one of those plague stories in which the hero is charged with finding a cure. The plot, which sends Gerry from Philly to South Korea, to Israel and then Wales in pursuit of the infection's source, never feels like it's just marking time. Each location holds a clue and by the time Gerry figures out the ingenious solution en route to the film's climax the story tops even that by forcing our hero to make a virtual life or death decision. The payoff includes what might be the most well earned and enjoyable on screen drink since Ice Cold In Alex.The action sequences are sensational with the (rightly) much talked about Israeli siege a standout. The chaos which leads to a hectic chase through narrow streets covered by a wire fence over which swarm countless zombies leads to an even more claustrophobic showdown inside a jumbo jet. The film is genuinely unnerving, often tense - especially the final third - and sometimes jump out of your seat scary. All without any bad language or explicit gore. There's a lesson there.Littered with unexpected touches - the viewer's shock at a would be suicide jump by a certain character who fears he's been infected and can't bear to see his family in danger, a female Israeli IDF soldier who becomes an unexpected ally of Gerry's and who isn't saddled with a lame romantic sub-plot between her and the star, a nuclear blast viewed from the cockpit of a plane in which no words, no explanation are offered and don't need to be (at this point in the movie it truly looks like game over for mankind) and perhaps best of all a last act that eschews the empty spectacle of so many summer blockbusters and goes instead for a tense, low-key and genuinely intimate climax that I'm happy to acknowledge had me on the edge of my seat.But perhaps best of all is the film's underlying message, epitomised by an Israeli who tells Pitt's character that 'For every life we save, it's one less enemy we have to fight.' This is a movie about the end of the world that unlike so many other zombie films shows people refusing to retreat into small survivalist groups but instead doing their best to save as many lives as they can. It does not surprise me in the least that World War Z has defied months of hostile online sniping to become a big box office hit and I'm very happy it has. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know about this film's troubled production history and movies with that kind of problematic shooting process always seem to turn out to be either stunning enough to silence the critics or as awful as everyone expected.sadly WWZ falls into the latter category. Its a mess. Marc Forster shouldn't be allowed to direct action movies. He can't construct those sequences at all well. The superfast cuts and hand held camera make it difficult to see what is going on. The script is a mess, and the fact that the last third of the flick was rewritten and reshot doesn't help.Brad Pitt is certainly not my idea of a learned man or an intellectual. He looks like a big issue seller.His family add nothing to the plot as Brad travels the world looking for clues to the zombie outbreak.The set up of the outbreak and the zombies themselves vary greatly from the ( far superior) book. The idea that the virus takes eleven seconds to turn you into as full blown zombie yet apparently the disease spread so fast because of air travel. With an incubation period that short they must be letting zombies go on holiday nowadays. So the script fails from the outset.Anyway Brad is sent on a high priority mission to find what caused the infestation. he is not the first choice and is subservient to a virologist. It is a sign of the laziness of the writing that the audience knows the other guy will die allowing Pitt to be the hero long before it happens. The lazy writers make no attempt to handle this subtly and the obstacle to Pitt's heroism simply falls over and shoots himself in the head. Brad Pitt doesn't understand the concept of focus unless the focus is on him. Several other unlikely and completely bloodless action sequences occur including Bradley cutting off an Israeli soldiers arm with one blow to stop the infection turning her into a zombie. No blood is seen during this and Pitt must be faster than the Man of Steel if the virus turns you into a zombie in eleven seconds. ( Incidentally the Israeli woman is super tough because as well as being bitten by a zombie and having her arm chopped off to save her she survives the blowing up of and crash landing of an aircraft). Brad throws a grenade on the plane kill a zombie- unless he really really doesn't want to go to Wales.For the so-called climax does indeed take place in Cardiff. After the original ending scenes of an epic battle in Russia were junked, the reshoot was set somewhere cheaperThe resolution of the movie would be the stupidest thing in cinemas this year if not for A Good day To Die hard.I'm sure some will say that you shouldn't analyse things too much but suspension of belief only goes so far. I don't see why IO should make excuses for a shameless cash grab like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Which Ones Were the Zombies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gerry Lane (that's pronounced Jerry, played by Brad Pitt) is a former UN worker of some sort who finds himself and his family right in the middle of the zombie apocalypse while living in Philadelphia. After being saved by another UN worker who just so happens to be a Deputy Secretary General, Lane and family are put on a UN ship that has also collected far too many other refugees, and Lane is presented with a mission: re- enlist and find out the cause of the virus, or your family is going to be placed in the significantly more dangerous refugee safe zones. Brad chooses the former, and off we go. It has the feel of a really good zombie blockbuster. It has the star, the known and respected director, and the source material. I kept thinking, "can they go wrong?" Yes, they can. For one, they can deviate almost completely from the source material. Max Brooks's eponymous novel traced a surprisingly realistic account of what would happen should a violent global virus erupt and become a worldwide predicament. But the novel never mentioned the name of the mysterious UN negotiator conducting his investigation. It never introduced a character named "Gerry Lane", let alone his family. It never introduced the question; "why did Gerry leave the UN in the first place?" only for it to never be answered. It was much, much better that way.The problems with the film are in the script. The cast does a hit-and- miss job playing their roles but never seem to understand their lines better than the audience does. Just as Lane looks for the stem of the virus, the stem of scripted uncertainty is not in the world of World War Z but in the world of the four people who wrote it. Having more than one or two authors usually means that after the first draft, the script was circulated around and around until only faint hints of the source material are still recognizable when the movie starts filming. Lane flies all over the world, and the audience flies with him, only to find him no longer investigating but solving, shooting, and exploding.As Lane, Brad Pitt plays the role he usually plays of an only slightly less confident Brad Pitt. I kept thinking that the ending would bring about a shocking twist; he was already a zombie! Pitt shuffles through this script with all the interest of watching paint dry, and once an hour passes his ploddy performance grows weary. However forgettable his performance, I always see some of the audience uninterested in plot and only in Tyler Durden's face, so if that's why you buy your ticket, no shame. Just don't think you'll really remember who the main character is or what his mission is. As for his wife, Mirielle Enos turns in equally uninspired work as the only woman in the known world who doesn't seem to be able to create any romantic chemistry with People's Sexiest Man Alive. Following the conclusion of ABC's "Lost", lead star Matthew Fox could have taken any role he wanted. By now he could even have taken Pitt's role at the helm of this film. But Fox decided to take a break for a few years, and now he is reduced to playing some guy who works on a UN helicopter. He might have even had a line. David Morse, the only other American actor I recognized, plays a toothless CIA spook imprisoned in a US military base in South Korea. Morse's performance was undoubtedly the film's best. Hearing the little whistle as he spoke through his gums was chilling as you read about Edward Snowden, Bradley Manning and the like. His too-brief role emphasizes the possibilities that present themselves when you turncoat the United States. Morse alone deserves a star for his work. Effects-wise, the infected weren't anything special, but how would I know that? What does a zombie truly look like? We never found out if the infection led to death of the host and reanimation. It didn't appear that anything external was actively rotting. Some of the undead appear a bit comical, and their gangly movements were just different enough to inspire scattered laughter in the theater. Some of the best scenes of the film involved Lane traveling to Israel and Wales, the only two countries he actually manages to visit. In Jerusalem, Lane discovers that Israel has built a wall to keep the zombies out. We never get an answer to the facts behind the wall; how big is it? Is it just around Jerusalem, or the entire country of Israel? Regardless, a band of street musicians somehow manage to provoke enough ire for thousands of the undead to scale the wall and attack the city. That band must have been terrible. As a zombie is appetized by the possibility of prey, the audience is intrigued by the possibility of entertainment. The undead eat the zombie for sustenance, but quickly want to move on for more. As part of the ravenous audience, I felt the same way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Infectiously good, even if perhaps not a true zombie film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it deviates from the source material more than a tad, World War Z is a certifiable, credible thriller that's part old-time adventure film and part new-school medical procedural. It's a fast-moving, intricate, and solidly acted by the indomitable Brad Pitt.Okay, sure, the "Z" stands for zombies (in the book and in the film), but let's be frank (or Bob or Justine) - these aren't zombies, really. Well, they're sort of a cross between a zombie and the victims of the Rage virus from 28 Days Later. The bitten turn into homicidal maniacs about ten seconds after infection has set in. But they're attracted to noise and to life itself, so essentially if you both have a terminal disease and are really quiet, they won't see you. These infected are sort of like the T. Rex of the human populace.Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN employee with some knowledge about infectious disease. He's driving his kids to school and his wife (Mirielle Enos) to work in Philadelphia when it happens - sudden stop of traffic followed by cars crashing, police scrambling, and finally, a horde of contaminated peoples running amok over the city, coming after those who still live. This sets off the expected chain of events of Gerry and his family ushered out of Newark, NJ to a ship in the North Atlantic, from where the UN is running its operation of Find the Cause. The UN, in the person of Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena), pulls Gerry into the scrum: they feel he's their man; he's the one who can find out not only where the infection began but how to stop it.Gerry's adventures take him to such incongruous places as South Korea, Israel, and Wales at a frenetic pace. Some scenes are eerily reminiscent of John Carpenter's The Thing; in one, Gerry and a military escort must silently pedal bikes to a plane for refueling, so as not to alert the walking dead and thus turn them into running dead. It's a creepy, chilling scene, and never has riding a bike looked so difficult.Now, if you've read the book by Max Brooks and plan to see this movie, you should know that the overall structure of Brooks' book (narration by Lane) is jettisoned for a more straightforward action-movie approach. And you might well be put off by that at first, but once you get over your faux outrage, you may discover that the movie is actually the better for the change; the result is much more suspenseful and riveting on the big screen than a true adaptation might have been.I like Brad Pitt, and this makes up for Killing Them Softly in spades. He's his usual terrific self as Gerry, who isn't some hardscrabble, world-weary action guy but rather an authentic everyman who could be any of us, only with better hair. His Lane is shown to be quite vulnerable (physically and psychologically), and Pitt's able to pull it off magnificently - unlike, say, a Tom Cruise or a Leonardo DiCaprio (the latter made a heavy bid for the rights to Brooks' tome). This is part of what makes Pitt such a fine actor. He's malleable; he can play bad guy, good guy, action hero, clever bastard, and so on without looking out of his element. He is the driving force of this film.As I mentioned, the movie moves (shambles?) at a quick pace. Ordinarily, this might mean that there's little plot involved, but if anything the movie is overplotted. Thankfully, time isn't wasted trying to explain to us every little detail about how Lane arrives at certain conclusions or on secondary or tertiary characters and their reasons for being where they are. It's a succinct plot that makes the best use of its runtime.World War Z, although perhaps not a true zombie film (are the victims killed and then turn or are are they infected and then turn?), is a perfectly good adrenaline-rush movie with a punchy, intelligent script and a typical knockout performance by Pitt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Severe deviation from the source material? Check. Production problems and reshoots? Check. A zombie movie with a PG-13 rating !? Check. With all these "issues" I was ready to swear off the movie completely, but curiosity got the better of me and I'm glad it did because World War Z is a movie that certainly shouldn't work, yet it does.As a fan of the book (I read it 4 years ago) I went into the film knowing that the script contained a cohesive story built around one character. Certain detractors of the film may dislike it solely for this reason because it is so different from the book. I would urge them to consider them as two separate entities. Once that is accepted, the film can be a pleasant surprise.Let's be honest, in the last 5 years film has become over saturated with zombies. So the makers of this film made some wise decisions intending to set their film apart. I'll admit I'm more of a traditionalist (slow moving zombies), but I like when film makers take risks at a new approach. The fast zombies in this film often use coordinated attacks,swarming like insects and that is something to ponder as well as visually behold. The film has a breakneck pace, with intense sequences...and it really has the feel of a global epidemic since it takes place in various locales around the world. I knew I wasn't the only one in the audience on the edge of my seat, as many times during this film I heard the rest of the audience let out a collective sigh of relief. By presenting zombies as a global problem in the first stages, it is a breathe of fresh air compared to the standard "few survivors vs thousands of undead" in a secluded fortress scenario. The film feels more like a political thriller than a zombie film, which belief me actually works to its benefit.Lastly, one gripe I have heard about the movie is a lack of character development. I agree, but I think character development would actually detract from the film. How many times in horror movies are supporting characters only there to serve the purpose of cannon fodder? Also, often times side characters are given moments to make a poignant speech before being killed off, which is a ploy by screenwriters to generate emotion from the audience. You'll see no such tricks here characters come and go, and we are often left to wonder about their fate. The film's frantic pace and lack of clichés really make it a surprising treat. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brad Pitt gets billing as the main star of "World War Z", but the real stars are the zombies. It's a very intense movie, focusing on the world's response after a virus starts turning millions into the living dead. North Korea figures out an inventive, if gruesome, method of how to prevent the virus from spreading within its borders. But the zombies are definitely the stars. They turn out to be really clever creatures, as seen by what they do in Israel. Watching just about any zombie movie, I always get the feeling that the people playing the zombies must have the most fun.I will say that this is no George Romero movie. It's designed more for widespread popularity, while Romero's movies are specifically for horror fans (and thus are gorier). But it's not a bad movie. OK, not great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie's okay, but I can't wait for Hollywood to give up on zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An okay zombie movie. I think the film's main fault is that it does nothing new with the monster. These are basically the same zombies we saw in 28 Days/Weeks Later, except they kind of drop the whole virus angle fairly shortly in and just admit they're dealing with the undead. The plot has a U.N. operative (Brad Pitt) traversing the world trying to figure a way out of the crisis. Pitt is excellent. There are some fantastic set pieces, and the film moves extremely quickly. I'd call it more suspense than horror here - I do think the PG-13-ization hurts the film a bit. I'm not a huge gore guy, but the constant cutting away from any violence starts to get old after a while. I wonder if there'll be an R-rated director's cut on video - that might be a better film. The actual solution to the problem is pretty lame, and not especially believable. I must say, Marc Forster does a fine job here as director. After Quantum of Solace, no one in their right mind should have let him near an action movie again. He proves himself quite capable, though. I'd recommend this, though maybe not that strongly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mindless action movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mindless action, and I do mean mindless action. The action starts about 3-4 minutes in and lasts until the end, it's not cool, fun action like you might imagine in a big budget movie....it's stupid silly action with CGI zombies running around everywhere. Most of the time you don't even see the zombies, they are a blur running this way and that like a school of deranged fish.The plot line is weak, it mostly just revolves around the fact that a virus has spread and turned people into zombies, that's pretty much about it. You don't get much more than that. I was expecting more, but it didn't come. Despite how bad I found the movie I was still very curious to find out how the virus originated and why, curiosity and all that, but we aren't told that, in fact the movie ends rather un- climatically. The movie basically just ends with him finding a cure, the zombies are not destroyed, we have no idea why all this happened, we don't even know how many "live" people there are left on the Earth. Along with that there are numerous instances which are just so unrealistic that they make you laugh......like an airliner crashing and breaking into bits yet leaving Brad Pitt and his sidekick alive...stuff like that. As you can imagine there really isn't much in therms of characters here, it's a 1 man movie and that man is Brad Pitt, the rest of the people are just bystanders. In short, it's a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I was skeptical, as I don't typically like 'zombie' movies, but this was very well done. There's lot's of suspense, and Brad Pitt was great.What I also liked is that they made the movie without a lot of bloody gore, which I find amazing given the subject matter. There are a lot of scenes that could have been gory for sure, but the Director chose not to focus on that, for which he is to be commended. Instead, he stuck to the plot line and the end result is exceptional.No need to see it in 3D; stick with the 2D version and save a few bucks. Well worth the price of admission! You won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great book, lousy movie. Pretty much no character development, it never really goes anywhere besides finding a "neat and clean" ending (which was pretty much a huge sellout...) It showed nothing of a "zombie war" as the title suggests.. When they say this was loosely based on the book, thats being generous..there's maybe 3 small elements or dialog from the book. It was more of the same fast-paced drivel pumped out by studios these days...no substance. I couldn't believe how little zombie action there was and the CG zombies look ridiculous. It was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I wish I hadn't spent ten dollars on a movie ticket and had just waited to rent it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z is your average, run of the mill zombie movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z fails to bring anything new and exciting to the genre by sticking to a generic plot line that we have seen far too many times in other zombie movies. This doesn't mean the movie was completely bad, the acting was on par, and action scenes were tense and thrilling. However, good acting and descent action scenes cannot compensate for a lack of originality and a lazily written plot. My main issue with this movie was how little I cared about the fates of each character. While the actors did a good job making the characters seem believable, there was not enough work done on the writers' side to develop the characters and make me want to care for their survival. If you can ignore the predictable plot, cheesy clichés, and uninteresting characters, World War Z becomes a mediocre zombie flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been anticipating this movie for months. The previews looked good. The book was good. I understood there was no way to make the book into a movie as written but I hoped the movie would be true to the spirit of the book. Unfortunately... not. The movie and book basically have two things in common, Zombies and a U.N. employee.The most surprising aspect of the movie for me was that I found it to be boring. Something I never expected. There were some great scenes and visual images but they fell oddly flat because their outcome was never in any real doubt. Brad Pitt was not going to die early in the movie or late in the movie. His wife and children were not going to die or turn into zombies. Brad Pitt's character always, magically, no matter how unlikely, had a way out of whatever situation he was thrust into.And the third act? Totally unimaginative. Ridiculous. A cop out. Nothing to do with the book at all.Could have been a great movie. Good special effects, good actors, some great photography, good build up of tension in some scenes, but ultimately a failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War ZZZZ. The movie is like a zombie. Starts out energetic and alive, dies for a while, then comes back for a bit, and finally ends with an bang.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning had promise, but then it became to CGI-ish. It's like they released it 28 days too early. If you read the book by Max Brooks, and then watch this movie with the same title. There is little to no connection. Even the zombies are completely different. They finally use the term Zombie but their "zombies" are the furthest thing from modern day zombies. They don't die, they run, they pick who they eat (actually they don't eat they bite you and run away), and they climb. This movie is more like 2001's '28 Days Later' infected or 2010's Crazies type of zombies. The different between those movies, and this are three things: 28 Days Later had characters with depth, the infested were scary, and it had a lot of gore. This movie had action, the characters had little to no depth to them and the zombies were far from scary. I prefer the undead mysteriously coming back to life and the real conflict is how the living can still "live" on. Anyways. There is something about 2010's Walking Dead that makes this scarier than World War Z. It's the fact, that no matter how much you fight or hide from them, you will turn into them in the end. This movie would have work better with a Rated R version, movie had this happy go lucky ending that makes me puke. I can accept that the books style was not directly translatable to a movie story line, but I am severely disappointed that so little was mined from the source material, save the title it seems. The zombies themselves were scary enough but the mechanism chosen to neutralize the them was scientifically absurd, especially considering the books solution was conventional, methodical and thus believable. Someone needs to re-do Z as a miniseries. It can't be done it 2 hours. The book was a series of zombie like short-stories, not one whole story. Since the book isn't exactly a story, the filmmakers just used the same concepts and put an story together for the movie. There was a lot they could have used from the book that would have made this movie so much better, like the underwater zombies, the zombie ships at sea, the battle of Yonkers, the methodical military solution that turned the tide instead of the ludicrous "zombie camouflage", the birds eye view of events from the International space station, how about "patient zero". They had a gold mine of material and only used a few very small nuggets. The book had certain great themes such as government ineptitude, American isolationism, and social commentaries that made the book great. In the film, these topics are little talk about, instead we get a United Nations employee Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) able to travel around the World, to look for a way to stop the Zombie pandemic. Don't get me wrong, it's nice seeing how other countries like South Korea, U.K and Israel are dealing with the zombie outbreak. I like how a country so small, and lose nearly all its population like Israel, can build a 200 feet wall in 7 days. Still, there is little to no way Gerry Lane is able to travel around the world, while the brick of humanity is happening. It's nice to see that airplane service is still around, after billions of people have die. I like the fact, that you can toss a grenade at the back of the plane. A plane can take an internal grenade explosion and still maintain enough direction to land. The explosion depressurizes the cabin causing everyone to be sucked, and when you crash. You're able to survive. What? Director Marc Forster presented us with a lot really tense moments at some points and the action scenes were good, but my only problem is they killed off military dudes so quickly that I didn't really get attached to anyone besides Gerry Lane. Plus, Brad Pitt in no way show any sense of fear and uncertainty against the zombie plague. I would love to see Brad Pitt have one break down moment, one scene where he's looks like he is really afraid, but we never got that. The film could have been better, if they kept his family there rather than sending him out wasting fuel and time going to countries. However, I had problems with my viewing the film as night scenes was not clear enough or too dark. It was really hard to watch what is going on even with the day scenes, with the zombies moving in such a fast pace. The action scenes became a little too blurry. The 3D didn't add or help the film, in my opinion. Lot of shaky camera shots made it dizzy. Well, I know they had to do reshoots and rewrite the script a butt load of times in order for World War Z to come out. Overall: Was it worth seeing? It was OK, at best. Not the best zombie in my opinion, it's just felt like watching ants on an anthill, biting me. It was annoying. Maybe a normal audience member might love it, but for me, a huge Zombie fan. I was disappointed by it. There's nearly no controversial about it. The movie had little to no depth, and it just felt like a really safe popcorn flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all the fuss and hype, I felt I just HAD to see this film.Oh dear ... how did they manage to spend $200 million on this?Same formula as was used back in the 1940s. Horrible disease that turns people into zombies. Enter hero and family, plus obligatory young child. Fight zombies every so often to wake up the audience, board planes and helicopters which are incredibly economical on fuel, then oh miracle a "cure" is suggested but one has to fight yet more zombies in order to get whatever has to be injected. Zombies fooled, worldwide joy as the "cure" is parachuted and zombies blown by deadly CGI. End of movie.Embarrassing goofs galore. I can't use a phone in my garden shed because of the metal shelves and fittings, but the hero's wife uses hers in a metal cabin below deck in an aircraft carrier. Yeah, right... Cardiff Airport is 3 miles from the seaside in the Bristol Channel but never mind, they crash the plane somewhere in North Wales and promptly walk in the Cardiff (South Wales) laboratory. A baseball bat in a Welsh laboratory? Hello props department ... this is Wales in UK! Do your US laboratories keep cricket bats in the reception area? Incredibly stupid staff in the WHO laboratory, our hero is told in which room to go to, but not which bottles to pick! As for sick people being invisible to zombies, that's a very lazy solution.I was conned by the hype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "PG-13" zombie film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a lot riding on "World War Z." Some of it was filmed where I live (Glasgow, Scotland) which generated much buzz. I'd actually read the book before seeing the movie (Not that I read a lot, but when I do, its usually the other way round) plus being possibly one of the biggest "Walking dead" fans around, I was really wanting the movie world to add something new (and to the epic scale promised by this) to the Zombie genre. Problem is, "World War Z" plays out nothing like what anyone would probably expect.The first complainants that many have had. Is that for a zombie movie, the flick is relatively bloodless. Now I'm not going to say this entirely ruins the flick, but it doesn't help. The Lack of horror doesn't do it any favours, but I was willing to enter the cinema excepting the fact that this was a "PG-13" zombie film, and so, one with vertially no blood. (Unless you count that massive cut Brad Pitt gets on his head after the big plane crash of the flick) No, my main problem with the film, is that there's more Brad Pitt than there are zombies, and that all of the wrong stuff has been taken from the book and thrown on screen. All of the locations in the movie I can remember being important in the novel, but I'd have rather they'd spent less money on all these locations (Which is probably what landed the film in its infamous financial trouble) and shown us more of the catastrophic amounts of zombies that are described in the book.Outside of one major monster attack, its all business as usual in the zombie movie world here. Its hardly a "World war" when we get restricted to a plane and a "huge" finale in a science lab. Again, I was willing to stick up for the movie turning into "the Brad Pitt show," as having everything evolve around one character (unlike the novel) would make it all more movie-like. But this one guy doesn't seem to see much in his expensive travels.As an action film. You could do worse than this. But your going to be disappointed in every other way. Whether your wanting a horror movie, a good adaption, or the epic that we were once promised. The final product of this long drawn out mess is unfortunately still very so-so. Even if it could have been a lot worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Critical Review of World War Z</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you remove the CGI-generated biblical-themed eye candy of zombies climbing up the West Bank wall and you focus on the character development, you are left with a B grade horror movie. Maybe that was the plan, I mean? the last character development we ever saw in Brad Pitt was in Twelve Monkeys in 1995 and then it all went downhill because as long as Brad is bigger than the film around him, Brad is not going to be taken to be a serious actor. It's a doggone shame because he is a great actor whose personality keeps getting in the way of his role. If I compare this with the original 1920 zombie theme film, The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, with all its expressionist amateurism, Caligari wins hands down on the basis of character development. Did you know that there are approximately 800 zombie films? Brad's in Israel, playing a seasoned UN military specialist who, with no medical knowledge, becomes Earth's last hope to cure the zombie virus. Zombies won't maul a sick human because 10 million years of mammalian distaste for eating soon-to-be-carrion can't be undone by even a zombie virus. Brad goes looking for a lab that holds deadly diseases to create a camouflage vaccination for earth's surviving humans. Let's have a critical look at the science and geography of "Z": 1. If the zombies are undead, what do they care if they get Hepatitis B or Ebola virus? How are zombies able to sense that a human is unwell? Must be through smell. So I guess zombie virus enhances smell, something that film maker and author of Zombie Survival Guide Max Brooks (the son of Mel Brooks) could flesh out a bit more for the sequel (or prequel or whatever). 2. Brad goes to Jerusalem to a virology storage facility to find frozen viruses. We know the trip to Israel wasn't about meeting Bio-Strategist Dr Warmbrunn because Brad could have called him on the sat-phone he had on the plane, the one on which he managed to call his wife. But ? isn't Israel's Sheba Medical Center located in Ramat Gan in Tel Aviv, 70km W of Jerusalem? I mean, you'd think Dr Warmbrunn would have met Brad at The Sheba Center for Regenerative Medicine, considering this is a zombie movie? 3. Jerusalem is a last stronghold of civilization. One of the walls seems to be the West Bank barrier wall. It doesn't come near the city wall, does it? 4. The zombies start climbing on top of each other until there is literally a stepladder of zombies. The soldiers start shooting zombies and the zombie tower starts crumbling down. As explained in the film, the only place to shoot-kill them is in the head. Even if one in 20 zombies took a head shot and fell off the zombie tower, wouldn't that just lighten the load of zombies and make it easier for underpinning zombies so more zombies could climb up? Why did the tower of zombies collapse? 5. By the time Brad Pitt gets to Jerusalem, the zone is established, probably for days. Brad Pitt arrives and every zombie within 10km of Jerusalem starts running at the wall. He must be zombie messiah! 6. When the zombies invade the compound, Brad is escorted to Ashdod military airport ? hang on a second ? they just left the old city and there's an airport right outside. Ashdod is 70km east of Jerusalem and it's a naval base, not an airbase. The airport in the film, with its sprawling green fields, looks like Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv, about 45 NNE of Ashdod. 7. As they take off, heading for Nova Scotia, which is of course NW of Ashdod, Brad looks out the plane window and sees the Dome of the Rock. So that confirms that they ran straight out of the old city and into Ashdod. BY the way, there isn't an airport near Jerusalem that can service 747 Boeings. 8. Brad is on the Air Belarus flight over Wales and a zombie starts biting people. Now the world's fastest-acting infection is probably the common cold. It takes a couple of hours to incubate. From the time the zombie bit a passenger until the whole of economy class was a swath of zombies, was about one minute. If homo sapien turned into a zombie inside of one minute, the body would probably die from shock or explode (hey my opinion is just as valid as Brad Pitt's character's right?) Now the zombies can't be undead. They are infected from a virus and need to eat people, so they are very much alive. 9. Then Brad throws a hand grenade into the rear of the plane to amputate the rear of the plane (he amputated the soldier's hand in the previous scene) and the plane manages to stay airborne. The pilots crash land in desolate woods (they were heading for Cardiff). With a piece of metal through his side, Brad gets to the Cardiff Institute of Infection and Immunology in Heath, the middle of urban Cardiff. Except it's in the woods, 5km from where Brad's plane crash landed in the mountains. 10. What zombie movie would be complete without a hospital scene? Brad manages to take down several zombies with a crow bar. When he finds himself trapped in a glass room facing a zombie, he chooses to infect himself with a deadly live virus to camouflage himself rather than open the door and crowbar the zombie. Two minutes later, safe, brad is being injected with a vaccine against the disease with which he injected himself? which disease? Brad brought back a box of 50 vials. Did he actually remember which one? And once you have the infection, can you be vaccinated? The best part about this movie was when the lights went on and there were a hundred people sitting around me. Got all creeped out and so did everyone else!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's super generic just what I expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z. All corners of the globe are overcome by an infectious virus, turning healthy humans into the undead with no mercy and a thirst to kill. Brad Pitt stars as Jerry, a husband and father who is asked by the CIA to help track down the root cause of the virus. On his way around the world, he encounters a number of the undead, and "astonishingly" surviving every attack he comes across. He soon finds his way to Wales where if magically figures out the sick and dying people of the world are somewhat 'imune' to the undead, and go around unharmed, as if they were not there. What will Brad Pitt do to save himself and the world? Infect himself with a deadly virus, and walk through the crowd of the undead like a saint. I want to point out that the film paid absolutely no attention to the characters, and seemed to be much more bias with the visual effects, making sure the undead and explosions look as realistic as possible, instead of making sure the HUMANS are portrayed as fearful, endangered and helpless. I didn't get that, and, what made it more annoying was, at the end of the film, Pitt gives us a spiel about humans working together and helping on another. That seemed slapped on at the end, just to make sure the audience didn't forget the lost theme of the film, shaded by guns, explosions and miracle survivals. The 1st half was extremely generic, something I dreaded, filled with predictable and unrealistic scenarios, and characters that are only introduced by a couple of seconds in the background behind Pitt (I'm still trying to figure out what relevance the woman with the buzz cut had). I wish there were better explanations of characters, especially for those who haven't read the books. World War Z's 2nd half seemed a bit more on the tense side and upbeat, which I liked, but that could've been given that extra push to actually get me on the edge of my seat. It was fairly predictable, as everyone knows a Hollywood film with a protagonist trying to save the world will always succeed, no matter what obstacles, even if he is about to inject himself with a deadly disease. Overall, the film was too star driven, and totally degraded Pitt's and Enos' capabilities as actors. I was appalled at their performances, with the screenplay and the director to blame.</fullReview>

Also being British some issues with the misinformation which showed the whole of Jerusalem as israeli, when in reality this is not recognised by international law. Surprised that Pitt would endorse this propaganda on the Israelis behalf. Anyway realise that's by the by. The reality is that the film is simply a rehash of what we have seen before and if you want to watch a good zombie type flick watch 28 days later. Cheers</fullReview>

On the other hand, the movie is rushing things, too fast, no chance for characters developments... You don't feel attached to them. Plot gap, if we can see, in many turning points of the movie..

		<fullReview>***Spoilers***If you go to this movie expecting to see some similarities to Max Brooks' book by the same name expect to be disappointed. the movie and the book share the name only. The only other similarities I could find was when Brad Pit was asking questions to the Isreal leader who they named but heck if I can remember it.In fact I can't recall any of the characters names. They all seemed like bland cookie cutter characters.In the book, for those of you who haven't read it, follows the narrator as he goes around the world interviewing survivors of the zombie war. World War Z had already been fought and won. The victory was a global victory with all nations coming together to fight the zombie menace.I'm guessing that Hollywood didn't think there was money in a story that wasn't solved by an American. The book had Isreal surviving virtually unscathed due to the wall they built before the outbreak. The movie had them build the wall but apparently they didn't do any research into the zombies beforehand or they would have known the zombies were attracted to sound.I also had issue with the "zombies." In the book they were slow but relentless and couldn't care less if you were sick beforehand. It makes no sense that a person who is ill with another disease would be ignored by the "zombies." I hated this movie and am glad I wasn't the one to pay for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of Time &amp; Money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the 44,370 people that have rated this movie so far, 44,360 must have been women voting on Brad Pitt's boyishly good looks. If you mix Walking Dead, Contagion, I Am Legend, The Andromeda Strain and a pinch of Pitt's boyishly good looks you get World War Z. I'm not sure what I was expecting out of this movie, but the trailers hooked me. I like Sci-Fi and this picture looked to have all the makings of a good, entertaining Sci-Fi movie. Unfortunately, it does not deliver. At times, I almost fell asleep because the action has slowed to a turtle's pace. I'm not sure what everyone else was thinking, but this movie is a complete waste of time and money. Refund, please!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not watch it...It is for your own good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was genuinely excited to watch this movie. I expected to see a lot of action; and by action, I mean decapitation, stabbing and shooting throughout the movie. The typical deaths you would expect to see in a zombie movie. The killing was off-screen, the acting was not believable (in fact Brad Pitt looked like he didn't care for the movie at all) and the violence was almost non-existent. I knew the movie was not going to be true to the book, but this was so far-off, it shouldn't have been called World War Z. Overall: sloppy acting, almost non-existent violence, very unclear story. Absolutely atrocious movie. This is a short review to simply summarize my thoughts on this movie as I as watching it. Do not spend your hard earned money for this in the cinema, just wait to download it or simply rent it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you read my reviews, then you will know that I have never rated a film so low on IMDb in all of my years here. But World War Z was just bad on all fronts, and every aspect of what makes a good story/film was lacking in his film.The best part of the film was the opening credits. It featured a collage of news broadcasts, and images of ecological disasters. After the credits, we get nothing but action...which is entirely computer generated. Brad Pitt plays a UN delegate tasked with finding the cure to what is automatically deemed "a virus" And that basically sums up the plot. There was no human element in this movie, unlike the book, which had some integrity compared to this mess of a film. In this movie, there is no reminder of what it means to be human, and what it takes to survive as a group. All the things that made shows like the Walking Dead great.If you're an action fan, then go see this. You might like the spectacular action, which in my mind, was just comical. There is no gore in the film, so stay away zombie fans. This is not a zombie film at all, the zombies were all CG, there was no gruesome make up effects, there is no explanation of what the virus did the brain, no explanation of how Brad Pitt found out about the cure....other than super intuition. It's downright silly. Never in my life was there a time when I went to a theater and found more people laughing at a zombie film before. If you want to see a great zombie film, watch 28 Days Later or the more recent "Warm Bodies"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprised by high reviews. I thought the movie uneven and not very scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brad Pitt's performance was fine and I loved certain scenes and concepts (like the episode in South Korea) but overall I felt the movie was uneven and could have used a better edit. The biggest problem I had was the inclusion of some highly improbably events.The cutbacks to Gerry's family slowed the movie down like speed bumps on a straightaway. I would have been fine with leaving them on the ship and not seeing them again until the end. Their subplot did nothing to progress the film and stopped the action at least twice. His wife's main contribution was to place an ill timed phone call that gets two men killed.At one point Gerry drags a Israeli solider along with him for no apparent reason. Just kind of brings her along where she plays no role in the plot that couldn't be filled by an anonymous extra.His miraculous survival of a plane crash is where my suspension of disbelief gave out. And the fact the crash occurs within wounded- walking distance of their destination didn't help.I'm split on the "cure" for the zombie attack. It was unique and clever but Gerry's execution and test of the solution was telegraphed thirty minutes before it happened.I did not jump once in this movie. I was never scared or on the edge of my seat. Some of the action was hard to see in 3D and one of the crucial zombies in the lab was supposed to be scary but ended up being comical, if not stupid.I am shocked to see so many people giving this more than a C.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An horribly made movie, trust the bad or mediocre reviews.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I start? The film was just horrible, the story was awful, the casting was awful, the shooting was awful, and the special effect was mediocre.First, let us talk about Brad Pitt. I loved Fight Club, watched Troy, and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith. I had not, saw him acted so badly like in this film before. There were too many scenes that he should be looking at the other directions rather then glimpse over to the camera or stare at it. Poor performance.Second, what's up with the vending machine in the end? How much did a drink company paid for the film to add the obvious subliminal message of "drink this s*** and your life will be good?" I thought I was watching a TV commercial from Asia rather than a zombie movie!The plot was horrible. The protagonist fly from one place to the other like......an investigator.. which was his job description in the UN. But this is what actually went wrong with the movie. It is suppose to be a zombie movie, not a poorly written Sherlock Holmes, where every trance of hint was too obvious to discover.Further, the supporting character has no story of their own. What makes a movie or a book great was that there were many minor stories hidden within a big story and somehow they were all related. We saw this in Max Brook's book World War Z, but not in the movie itself.About the book... all I can say the book was a zombie classic, while the movie was a disgraceful disaster. It has nothing resembling to the book. If a person read the book, there are already pictures, images, and stories that filled up a person's mind. At least several movies could be made out of the book with each of them focused on few related person's story and their view point regarding the World War Z. The Japanese, the Eastern Europeans, the America soldiers, the Chinese doctors, the battle of Yonkers... etc. But the film didn't do it, they have to be creative to a way that made the film tasteless and cheesy.I mentioned previously that the special effect were mediocre. As I reflect more about the special effect, I decided to change my mind. The special effect was horrible. Good special effect integrated into the scenes that makes you feel inside the movie without noticing the special effect was at work. For World War Z, you can tell specific effect from beginning to end. Dead people became zombie and sudden gained a extreme stamina boost that made them jump and tackle people like professional athletes, absolutely ridiculous. Even worst, you can see special effect cut in right the way during the tackling. Horrible, horrible special effect.The supporting actors also acted poorly. Most actors who played zombies were merely acting, and the end of a joke. The zombies in the lab were performed by actors who simply acts without getting into the roles.The actors who played the soldiers, the wife, the scientists... also acted poor. From the beginning to the end you just can't help to notice that they are "acting", which is the poorest performance done any actor. When an audience can tell that you are acting and not drawn into the story, then you have failed as an actor.The movie itself was a horror movie, watching a zombie classic by Max Brook turned into a joke surely horrified many zombie fans. The movie itself was not worthy to get your movie money. Best wait till it went on Netflix or borrow from your friend's DVD collection - if he was so into collecting that he didn't care about the content of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z is more about the visuals than the characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the summer blockbuster movie season in the swing, audiences expect all the usual trappings that come along with such; i.e huge explosions and no plot. That's what you'll get with World War Z, a film that is flash and substance, cranked to insane levels with bucket loads of CGI and little regards for smooth and cohesive narrative which could've elevated it beyond just action and special effects.I'm not familiar with the original novel on which this film is based, but from the looks of it, it seems to be aimed at only a specific demographic; that is those that crave mindless action above all else. There's nothing wrong with that, but I suppose those(like me) that want story and character development ALONG with action, will be disappointed as World War Z, to them, only resembles the original novel IN NAME ONLY. Superficial performances from some of the lead characters, save for Brad Pitt, dull the experience immensely as a film of this caliber demands hard, vicious violence and tense, frightening atmosphere, that, unfortunately enough, are sparsely sprinkled about in this film. There's no doubt that some of the film's action scenes are impressive, but one gets the feeling that because of it's PG-13 rating, a bane of zombie flicks, are so tame that to call it a TRUE zombie flick would be an act of blasphemous disservice. Ultimately, it would seem that with so many rewrites to the script and filming of scenes, it clearly became a case of "too many cooks spoiling the broth".The potential for something like this to be greater than the sum of it's parts were here, but the execution of such potential into something natural, organic, and emotionally and intellectually engaging, falls equally and devastatingly flat on it's cinematic ass. World War Z once again proves the inept and ADD-riddled filmmaking process of Hollywood is once again, cropping up and utterly ruining a film's potential to be something great. I'm not sure if I want to see this film again; I'll wait for the director's cut. IF indeed such A CUT exists, then I suspect it would be an overall improvement over the theatrical release, but since it's too early in the game for such a thing, I've no choice but to conclude that World War Z, ultimately, pales in comparison to it's much superior counterparts "28 Days Later" "Night of the Living Dead" "The Walking Dead" and to a certain extent, even the bloody yet comedic romp "Night of the Comet" and other notable films of this tried-and-true genre. If a sequel is made and judging by the latest box-office numbers, I don't fail to see why. Only ardent, die-hard fans can hope for the next film that features more blood and guts, more heroism, and most importantly, more character development.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointingly average.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to give this a 6.5, but having to choose between a score of 6 or 7....... It's a 6!I had quite high hopes for this one. Having read lots of positive talk pre-release about how the source material breathed new life into the somewhat tired Zombie genre. Not to mention the endless hype, massive budget and Brad starring.I'm not going to give away any plot points that you don't see in any of the trailers, so don't worry if you haven't seen it yet.Firstly this is the first movie that I've seen in 3D that I actually think might have been better in 2D. The 3D adds nothing. Except makes is a bit darker and adds some lens reflections from the plastic shades you have to wear.As you'll have seen from the trailers, the 'zombies' are of the fast moving variety. But the only really new twist is that they 'swarm' and that's given away in EVERY clip so there is no surprise left there really. This type of 'zombie' will be familiar to those who've seen "28 Days Later". In fact it was done better in that movie. The 'zombies' in WWZ for the most part don't feel like zombies. In fact it doesn't feel like a zombie movie, it feels like a disaster movie.If you watch a lot of zombie movies you aren't going to find much new here. There are no 'frights' no 'shocks' no 'horror', it's a movie about a plague. Not a bad effort, just nothing new. Overall a disappointment. I'll probably wait for the next one to come onto TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most action packed zombie movies around. Its realistic graphics does a great job of interpreting zombies and how they are represented to be.The film makers really make sure you're aware of every scene and keep you on your attention the entire time. They use a number of shots featuring hundreds and hundreds of zombies swarming all over each other and the city. I think Brad Pitt also was the prefect actor for the main role of the movie and did a great job portraying the hero in this film. There are a ton of zombies in this movie creating a lot of action scenes. The hordes of zombies allow for a lot of action scenes and are arguably the best parts of the movie by far. In general this film is really action packed and the plot keeps the movie together and not get out of control. I enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it if you like zombie movies with a lot of action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombies were good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read up on reviews, and most of the negative reviews originate from the individuals who expected an honest- shall I say- adaptation of the book (this is exactly the issue that faced The Great Gatsby or any other adaptation for that matter). I haven't read the book, which means I don't need to furiously rant about the film's disconnection from its novelistic counterpart. If you haven't read the book, you have no reason to worry about potential disappointment; that's practically reserved for the book's fans. If you're a book fan, on the other hand, you should be expecting the two's differentiation from one another. So, to put it most understandably, if you're entering this movie the way it was marketed, you'll experience a wild, roller-coaster ride that's fairly effective in its capability of featuring some dramatic moments of diplomatic negotiations and political discussions over the world's collapse and then placing you into intensely impossible situations only to be followed by an incredibly suspenseful, nerve-wracking sequence. It's highly entertaining?however, it's the furthest from originality a film can get. I mean, it's yet another zombie movie, dealing with the entire world under a deadly zombie virus. You've basically seen everything in this movie already as 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later highlighted the serious effects of such an event already. In that case- during its first act- World War Z feels unbelievably similar to the two films mentioned above. Especially considering the decision to exclude the more political aspect of the novel and turning the adaptation into an action flick instead, there's not much here that'll bask in uniqueness, really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Focuses on Brad pitt's Character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>one act transpires underneath the roofs of a daunting apartment building when another act takes the audience across the world to Israel where the people left are forced to defend themselves against a monstrously colossal horde of zombies as they pile in. There are jump- scares. There are grisly and highly unfortunate deaths. Anyways, the film focuses on Brad Pitt's character (Gerry Lane) who's required to assist the UN with discovering a possible vaccine/cure to the horrifying virus that's spreading throughout the world and turning human beings into ghastly creatures. If he refuses to comply, they'll willingly kick his entire family off a tanker- one of the few safe locations left in the world. From there on, Gerry Lane is forced to transcend country after country in order to secure his family's safety and possibly save humanity. A hell of a lot is at stake, that's for sure. Now, I can definitely state that one of the best aspects of the film is its acting, especially Brad Pitt's, which, as usual, doesn't disappoint. One can clearly witness the fear and terror present in almost every character's eyes, as well as one specific character quite convincingly pulling off the feeling of sheer pain under horrendous circumstances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 seconds to chaos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets get this straight, World War Z is a great film. The Internet Movie Database, (www.imdb.com) rates it at 7. Is it 'the' summer blockbuster? Maybe not, but rumbling under the general intensity of the whole movie is a really good story that struggles to get told in a mere 116 minute thrill ride. The intensity of the film is matched only by the pace. This is set early as Pitt and family make their first run from an unknown and unseen threat in morning traffic. The escape sees everyone, myself included, frantic as the first infected people show themselves. Pitt counts the eerie 12 seconds it takes for the deadly virus to take hold, voiced over by his daughter learning to count for effect and so the film commences...The whole story is literally crowded out by the spectacle of cinema. Brad Pitt carries off the retired UN specialist who chose a loving family over a career very, very well. One can't help but recall his real life family and special UN envoy wife. But blink and you'll miss this story line, just like the contribution of Israeli soldier, (Mireille Enos), who has her arm chopped off with a flash of inspiration by Pitt. Rather than allow the young soldier die next to him seconds after saving his life he takes drastic action and saves her life. She is by his side until the end but sadly never has the opportunity to develop her role with virtually no lines. This is perhaps the biggest disappointment for me. Many other story line opportunities are not adequately developed for my liking. It is a fabulous premise for the apocalyptic movie lover, which makes the sick immune from the cataclysmic spread of a virus. Pitt takes the producer credit for World war Z and should be pleased with the outcome and probably hungry for more. Although it is not perfect it is very good, an easy 8.5 from us!</fullReview>

The only downside for me is that other zombie movies were more thrilling and scary, and there were more running and more zombies to get thru or escape from more dangerously and also more protagonists killed in the process!!.. That's not how the movie is designed tho bec. he's a UN employee so the route is different. Just a little different from other zombie movies that I watched in which most of the protagonists were just civilians! Not a lot of character development but it's okay and understandable. But still, this had the best plot and string of events, and is more realistic! The events were creative and well played out!! I like the part when Speke got bit! The lines were memorable and epic! I like Gerry's mini flashbacks and when he was counting 1 thousand, 2 thousand.. little details like that add to the impact of the movie.. The best events for me would probably be when the city got invaded, their ascent to the building, plane scene, .. and of course the lab!! They had ammunition and explosives so other zombie movies were more trying.. kind of.. but still.. a great zombie movie!! Lines, events, acting were not exaggerated or unrealistic! Just right! I loved that the cure was getting infected by a human disease. The ending when he drank from the can and opened the pop machine with all the cans falling and luring the zombies.. and walking straight past them was BADASS!! :D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War Z is a book I admittedly haven't read, but what I do know about it sounds like an interesting and unique take on the now-tired zombie genre. This in-name-only adaptation is the most by-the-numbers zombie movie I have ever seen. The plot is predictable, to the extreme that I was able to predict the dialogue as it happened. The characters are flat and Brad Pitt gives a disinterested performance, likely due to all the re-shoots that only seem to have added to the confusion in the narrative. On the whole I'd call this something of a sub-par prequel to I Am Legend, which isn't a perfect movie either, but it does enough with the formula for me to recommend it over WWZ.P.S. I was highly disappointed that a film titled World War "Z" had no Super Saiyans to speak of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just finished watching this film for the second time (yes, I know--once should have been enough), and apart from Brad Pitt's really rough-looking hairstyle (did he gell it with superglue?) one thing struck me that I'd somehow completely missed the first time. On the aircraft carrier Pitt is asked to use his expertise to help save Mankind. He refuses, not once but three times. Why? He has to stay with his family. Why? Dunno, since his family is in a perfectly safe place and his presence isn't going to make them any safer. He only changes his mind when threatened with being chucked off the ship as non-essential personnel.So, let's get this straight. Pitt is the hero, the guy we're supposed to sympathize with, but he won't try to save Mankind because he prefers to stay with his family, even though his family has no chance of survival unless he or someone can find a cure for the zombie disease. He's supposed to be a very intelligent guy, but this simple fact appears not to have occurred to him. So, even putting aside his astonishing selfishness, his total lack of altruism, he seems not to be that bright, and certainly not the sort of hero we should be rooting for. Pity we don't have an alternative, like the young scientist who unfortunately gets killed the moment he steps off the plane. Of course, as a bit-parter this guy was always going to get cacked and leave good old Brad in charge, but did it have to be quite so soon? Dreary film. Selfish hero. Seasick camera-work. Wooden acting, especially Pitt. Dumb script (didn't they know that singing would attract the zombies? They knew enough to build the wall, but didn't know that). Yep, pretty much par for the course these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How would the world react if there is a zombie apocalypse? How nations from around the globe respond? "World War Z" gives us an interesting insight on the mentioned topic. Kinds of action performed by countries to freeze the attacks ? some nuke, some build a wall, some remove teeth of her people to avoid bite, while some ignore. But, in the movie, instead of picturing the world as the hero for the disaster, it closes on Brad Pitt instead.It begins with an eruption of a zombie outbreak; an inconceivable but frightening catastrophe that threatens to consume the whole planet. The source is unknown though ? where it started, and how. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is a former UN investigator ? a competent man that one has loads of experiences behind him. A story has a tail of Gerry to disembark on various cities, to halt the outbreak. Although the picture is being hailed as a horror/zombie in general, it could be an adventure/action, with its protagonist jumping from one country to another, to rescue the world from extinction.The suspense is a killer, and the movie is great in that aspect. The atmosphere is commendable, as sense of healthy escapism well developed. The fact that the story never sticks with one location, it generates interest in the audience. To get a load of zombies in different regions amongst different groups of people, is an absolute fun.Brad Pitt holds the film's strength in my opinion. His strong presence, and good performance, brought forward soul for the medium, and thrived for good senses of sincere play that is, humane. In one scene in particular, where a plane carrying infected-survivors crashes, Lane, which is Brad Pitt, with his tender eyes, but hiding sympathy, watching so deep at a troubled, infected woman that is strapped and trapped to a seat. The look clearly tells us about the character's disappointment to the condition of the world at that time, in the story.Movie is frightening, movie is entertaining, but inarguably flawed, both in its plotting and screenplay itself. So much filled with plot holes, the film dragged my down my praises upon succeeding to witness the undesirable fact of it. Brad Pitt flies to South Korea, and Jerusalem afterwards, and finally to Cardiff. The journey is so colourful and seemed very much 'scripted'. Furthermore, the story would fare better if the heroes are countries of the world, instead of being one-sided to an individualistic tale.The movie is still pleasant nonetheless, especially if one watches in a theatre where, I will mention it again, it provides perfect cinematic escapism. Well, zombies are zombies, they are fun and I love, and often will I love them. As a big fan of horror-zombie movie genre like me, a low-profile gift of thanks for it would be adequate?

I didn't time it exactly but for what seemed like a good ten or fifteen minutes Brad Pitt becomes considerably more interesting as he enacts a heroic rescue of humankind while Capaldi gazes at him with hawklike intensity and murmurs thrillingly in his low Scottish burr.

		<fullReview>World War Z (2013): Dir: Marc Forster / Cast: Brad Pitt, Mireille Enos, Fana Mokoena, Daniella Kertesz, David Morse: Zombie movies are finally offering a glimmer of hope. First we had the twisted romantic Warm Bodies and now Marc Forster offers up another zombie apocalypse in the fight against death and preservation of life. The premise is rushed with characters introduced briefly then its time to flee rabid zombie people. Thankfully the film regains its focus as Brad Pitt is sent with a group of soldiers to find an antidote. We are given much tension and suspense as these soldiers are pursued and sometimes mauled by zombies. After the first stop at a base they fly off to Jerusalem where an antidote does indeed exist. Directed by Forster who made the hilariously inventive Stranger Than Fiction and the James Bond outing Quantum of Solace. The third act is best as Pitt must maneuver past zombies in a facility in order to get the antidote. This creates an interesting survival method that Pitt witnesses first hand during a massive zombie stampede. While Pitt fares well surviving a plane crash and other near death exploits, other characters are so bland that they make the zombies look like winners of a personality contest. Mireille Enos as Pitt's wife spends much of the film worrying and clutching the kids in fear when after failed attempts to contact him via walkie-talkie. David Morse appears as a former CIA agent imprisoned for selling weapons but perhaps more screen time would have benefited. Much of this is pointless mayhem but its sense of hope offers viewers an opportunity to see the beginning of the end for zombies. Score: 6 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still waiting for my World War.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haven not read the book World War Z was entirely new territory for me and so the unfaithfulness to the book, like the majority of the audience for this film eluded me. So, I was fully open to the story Forster had created to draw in views like me and to some extent he succeeded. I really enjoyed the tension throughout, the visual effects such as the zombies using each other to climb over wall and the story which unlike some other zombie films did not rely on gore to keep the audience entertained. However, the film felt somewhat anticlimactic which is a shame because the jump into action at the beginning of the film showed real potential and I don't think that the characters were developed enough, you knew Gerry Lane was the hero but he's charter had no complexity. They have suggested that World War Z will have a sequel is this is true this would be a film I would be very interested in seeing because maybe this film did not reach it's full potential but I feel it has set up a storey which could create a sequel which could very well live up to it's title World War Z as I really want to see a War with these zombies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty much as mindless as a zombie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is like an ocean 10,000 miles wide and 1/16 of an inch deep. The zombies are really pretty terrifying, as far as these things go, and the movie looks like it had infinite dollars poured into it, but there is nothing here of substance at all. I haven't read the book, but if any poor school child had to write a report on this film, drawing some important lessons from it, I'd love to read it, because I couldn't find anything of value in this film to save my life. It might not reflect well on our society that we are willing to drop a zillion dollars making such unbelievably mindless fluff as this, but then I'm sure that a lot of people would say I'm just being a humorless killjoy or something like that. The upside, I suppose, is that if you are looking for a non-stop, action-packed, ultra-slick, popcorn movie and don't mind huge doses of realistic violence, this movie might be right for you. I would say it's a lot like most amusement park rides--basically purposeless, but many people enjoy them nonetheless. To each their own, I guess, but I absolutely guarantee you that this movie makes no intellectual demands whatsoever, which disappointed me because I thought it was marketed as a thinking-persons zombie flick--probably my bad for being dumb enough to believe that such a thing existed.I, personally, feel a little bit sick that I spent 2 hours watching this, much like I did when I was a kid and ate way too much Halloween candy. I'm going to have to aim for something more nutritious from Netflix next, as penance for this monster helping of cinematic junk food.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, But Not Much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is simply a ride. Nothing special. It's not cheap or anything bad. The music makes it all worthwhile. It has perks such as Philadelphia is the first city you see get wrecked. The zombies are different from what we see in something in The Walking Dead. These are zombies that pile on top of each other so that they can climb long walls. The film is a world war and it takes us around. Not too many character moments but it's all fine for the romp. Because this is something where you just want to chill back, relax, and enjoy the show. It's not mindless like Transformers but not of any high entertainment that sticks out in your mind as others might have. But give it watch if it's on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engrossing if slightly flawed zombie epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a ravenous zombie plague descends on mankind, a determined reporter traverses the globe looking for the start of the outbreak in the hopes of instilling a cure to be able to fight off the infected and save mankind.Overall this one was quite a surprising and enjoyable effort that was quite enjoyable. One of the better aspects here is the way this one manages to handle the infection here without really going all overboard with the concept of the infection. Presenting this in a series of trips around the world is quite a nice feat for that, managing to occupy a large portion of screen time here with the idea of going through the different stages of the efforts to contain it in the varying stages is quite an effective ploy here with the shock of the emerging creatures on the world soon turning into the main storyline which is that cross-global investigation. That also leads into the film's main plus here, which is the exciting and incredibly fun action scenes that are exhilarating as they tend to showcase a lot more than initially expected here with the opening swarm running through gridlocked New York in a seemingly massive ambush that comes off incredibly well, much like the slightly smaller supermarket sequence or the apartment escape but really culminates with the attack in Israel which features the swarm seemingly adamant about scaling the massive fortified walls and then going after the gathered survivors below which is a true spectacle that shows them overtaking the city quite easily and providing the showcase for the big escape scene. It's fun and grand in a big way which is quite nice but really shows off the CGI all too well which is the main problem here. Not that the look isn't bad, but on the whole the ravenous swarm just looks and moves too fake to really make for a believable person running around the cities and jumping over each other in massive groups. There's some great scenes but they just tend to come off way too fake here. Other than the lack of gore here which isn't too surprising considering the fact that it's more about the survival rather than the shock of seeing them rip people to pieces, this one really comes off quite well.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and children-in-jeopardy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just another zombie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that i was pretty skeptical about this film, as i always am when it's a film containing zombies, vampires or werewolves. Then again, i figured Brad Pitt wouldn't probably have done this film if it wouldn't be different. Well turns out i really liked it! I never got bored during the entire film. Yes, there are some typical zombie-jumps-at-you- moments, but they did scare me. The zombies are nicely done and though it's not as gory as The Walking Dead, they still got me biting my lip during a lot of moments. I do understand there is some commotion, because apparently the film has nothing/not much in common with the original book, but if you're not a die hard fan of the book or if you haven't read it like me, you will be enjoying a very exciting action film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't admit this too often, but I don't like Mr Pitt. I had stayed away form any movie that had him in it. Then one day, I heard an interview that he had done to promote this film. I remember he said something along the lines of:" my kids love zombies and I wanted to make a zombie movie for them".Well, that over rode everything that I initially thought about Mr Pitt. How do you make...no,no.. what kind of movie would you make for your kids?!?!?! Let me tell you, this movie was not that bad. I was very surprised about that. I expected something goofy..maybe childish. This is anything but. It's not overly gory, but it does have it's jump in your seat moments. I have not read the book so not able to say whether it is faithful to that story line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be honest, i saw World War Z only because it was in 3D. Another thing that turned me off in advance was that media focused on Brad Pitt's and Angelina Jolie's private life during the movie's release. The rumor has it that the producers feared World War Z didn't offer enough material for the press and opted for this, although Ms Jolie's closest relation to the movie was visiting it's premiere with her husband.Yet all this conditioning was misguiding, because World War Z offers more than enough solid entertainment and serious storytelling. Sure, we're talking about zombie apocalypse unleashed upon mankind and the main character searching the four corners of the Earth for the cure. This premise alone raises questions about the realism and the level of discussion. On the other hand, World War Z shows the consequences of a contagion spreading rapidly across the globe and the consequent dissolution of civilization as we know it.For an apocalyptic action move World War Z is surprisingly well done. The plot held my attention and never turned boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Zombie Romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brad Pitt stars as Gerry Lane, a former UN investigator who has been recruited by the government to try and find the source of a deadly virus which has been infecting mankind, turning them into vicious zombies.The way this movie starts is excellent as it doesn't take long at all for all hell to start breaking loose. From that moment on it definitely keeps your attention. Sometimes the downside to movies starting off so well is that it set's a precedent for the rest of the movie to be as exciting, which is hard to do. Thankfully World War Z manages to keep a really good pace throughout, mixing a good amount of action and suspense, and while I understand it cannot be relentless for the entire movie duration, it does get a wee bit slow in places. Fortunately, these moments don't last too long though, and they are usually a build up to some good tense scenes.A lot of the visuals are really superb, especially when you see the big wide shots of the zombie attacks in New York, New Jersey and Israel from the ground and from above. The tension that these scenes build are excellent as well, even moreso when the zombies actually start climbing over themselves to get over the walls in Israel.Watching it all in action you can understand why the movie cost around $190m to make. Nothing is really original about the zombies in this movie in the way they act and the way they move - as 28 Days Later was the first movie to portray zombies/infected as fast, vicious killers - but they are still done really well with suspense being the main focus for them to scare people rather than a Dawn of the Dead type of zombie where it's mainly gore.I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for a while and while overall I wasn't disappointed, it lacked a wee bit of something. Maybe it's because it's really all been done - PLENTY of times - before. Who knows, but what I do know is that World War Z is definitely a good film to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z movie Review/ Good or bad? ** Opening spoiler****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***** Opening spoiler**** Only the opening is given away and nothing else is told!Brad Pitt stars in this Horror/science fiction thriller. Yet again Brad Pitt seems to amaze us all as he run with his family thought the street trying not to get infected from a outbreak, the movie starts off with him and his family eating breakfast. They then head off into the car and ride the streets of New York city. Out of no where a cop rides and hits there mirror and Gerry(played by Brad Pitt) gets out to fix it, he then hear screaming from the other end of the street. Everyone then starts running away and Gerry does not know what is going on. He then sees these infected people running and jumping trying to grab someone and infect them. He then gets into the car and drives away speeding as fast as he can. Gerry's daughter is in the back of the car breathing heavily and needing her inhaler which they "Mistakenly" left in the car. So was this movie a 10 out of a 10? Well I think not, I would give this movie a 7. I give it a 7 for a couple of reasons but the biggest is because the movie is going too fast.

		<shortDescription>Mediocre blockbuster that becomes a decent B-movie towards the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without giving away anything not seen in the trailer; if I were to separate this film into three acts, I would describe the first two as the usual blockbuster fare which treads familiar territory; only this time without adding anything new or memorable to the genre. Brad Pitt stars as a family man caught in the thick of it, while the rest of the cast make for token fodder in a movie where the set- pieces ultimately take center stage. As far as disaster movies go, it's largely uninventive and tedious; kept afloat almost solely by Brad Pitt's A-list draw.However, two thirds of the way in, the movie slows down. The camera turns away from the mammoth set pieces and instead zooms in on the remaining characters. The third act is where the film really perks up. Everything feels contained, and the suspense that was sadly lacking from the globe-trotting running and shooting scenes is finally present in what you could believe was an independent B- movie. These scenes redeem the film, though to somewhat limited avail.Overall; World War Z is middle of the road, but not unwatchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You want the unrated version from Netflix or on DVD/Blu-Ray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fast-paced action film that was edited down to make PG-13. The unrated version is much more violent, much more graphic and much more entertaining than the theater release.I understand the business decision of editing down to get under the R rating, but if you're going to do a Zombie Apocalypse movie, you have to show some gore and the PG-13 version doesn't have enough blood, guts and foul language to get there.I thought the Zombie swarm of Jerusalem was as epic as it was tragic. It also proves to be an interesting plot point (which I won't spoil). However, I believe the plane crash plot point was unbelievable. How is it that our hero and the only known survivor of a Zombie bite survive such a horrific impact? I mean, come on... he's Brad Pitt and all, but is he James Bond-like invincible?There are other plot developments in the film that may make some folks say, "oh please," but this is an action film featuring the exploits of a bad ass who is determined to save humanity, so some leeway is warranted.I kind of enjoyed the PG-13 version. The unrated version was the director's original intent and it satisfies much more nicely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By no means a terrible movie, but nothing really special either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z is slightly above average and that is all there is to it. The movie even plays itself like a slightly above average movie. You can tell a little bit more work went into the camera work, the set designs, and the ideas, however, the movie never does anything bold. You don't see any real character development, any real character interaction, or any emotion from the characters other than "Oh crap, zooombies (because they are fast)".The Zombie designs in this movie have some nice make-up and always has standard special effects when up close and personal. Fortunately the movie only relies on CGI when the zombies are doing something a human can't. Other than that, the zombies are mostly just quickly edited to appear moving faster. While this is a personal gripe, I never really liked this type of zombie because it didn't make sense. If the movie is pretending to be realistic, then if your arm or body is blown to bits you will not be moving. It doesn't matter if you are a zombie, if you don't have the muscles or the blood then you will not move. For a movie that is trying to make zombies realistic, they are pretty unrealistic.Probably the greatest thing about this movie is that it actually reuses The 2nd Law: Isolated System multiple times. I almost feel like some of the shots in this movie were made just to fit that tune because the shots literally fit the tune exactly.All in all, there is some decent action and moderately interesting moments here and there, but it isn't anything people will remember as being "revolutionary" to how zombies films were made. I Am Legend did a better job with a similar premise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ho Humh...Just your standard Zombie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you set your expectations low, you won't be disappointed in this rather standard Zombie movie. With the exception of having Brad Pitt as the star, and having really fast-running Zombies, there's really nothing the differentiates this movie from your standard Zombie flick.Something happens...ooohh...things start exploding...ahh..crazy people start running around, and boy are they fast. The Zombie craze spreads. Luckily Brad has some sort of special skill, though it didn't look like it to me. He just basically flew around the world asking questions. Reminds me of The International, except with Zombies instead of murderers.The movie attempts to play to your heartstrings by plucking on his family's plight (wife and 2 girls). How sweet - Brad would rather be with them than flying around the globe saving the world as he gets chased by bloodthirsty Zombies. How boring that would be.This movie is pretty stupid, and the non-Zombies are sometimes very stupid, but that stupidity really added nothing to the plot or story. The acting was average. The cast was average. The screenplay was average. The CGI was above average because these Zombies really knew how to climb and run and kill people. If that makes it a good movie for you, jump right in.Finally, the kitsche ending makes you cringe as you say to yourself....jeez I hope they are not setting us up for WWZ2? Enjoy, if you dare...ooh zombies bad, non-zombies good!!! I recommend you pass and wait for it to come out free in your library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Competent, if Mostly Forgettable, Zombie-Squasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strip away the title and any associations with the source material and this is a mildly above-average action/horror hybrid. It's nailed the gritty, vivid tone I expect of a dawning modern zombie apocalypse - the panic, confusion and outright helplessness of civilian life at ground zero - but does gradually get carried away in terms of scope. Brad Pitt as not just humanity's last great scientific hope, but also its vigilant watchdog and bombastic action hero, is something of a reach and smells like several characters were mashed together for the sake of simplicity. In a few instances, World War Z tests the waters of political and social reactions, enduring themes of the novel, but these are contrived token efforts at best and certainly not the film's forte. It's generally content to simply flush the screen with crumbling cityscapes and spitting, sprinting, screaming infected hordes, both of which perform quite well. At moments it's intense, shocking and borderline iconic, but storyline depth is an Achilles' heel, and most of the third act plays out like a bland, predictable obligation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why This is the Worst Adaptation Ever:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this movie had a different title, no one would even have the thought that it might be an adaptation of the book "World War Z". Here's just some of the reasons why:1) The main character in the movie is a retired U.N. worker named Gerry Lane. Nowhere in the novel "World War Z" does the journalist interview a guy named Gerry Lane. In fact, I don't think he even interviews someone from the United Nations.2) The novel WWZ is about a journalist that interviews people AFTER the war happened. The movie takes place all DURING the war.3) The novel WWZ is very realistic and the politics described in it are very accurate. There are basically no politics in WWZ and when there are any they are not very accurate and hardly detailed.Aside from that, there is also no character development at all, and Brad Pitt's character is the only one we see anything of.However, it did have some good points. For example, it was nice to see a zombie movie where their main goal was to infect people and not to eat them in the goriest ways possible.But mostly, this movie was the most failed "adaptation" ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War P.C.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic plot of this sci-fier is pretty good. A rabies-like pathogen is rapidly spreading and zombifying folks over the greater girth of the globe. For viewers who dote on CGI, there are scenes where scads of the afflicted swarm at lightning speed. For those in the audience who prefer killer suspense, there is a slow, scary struggle through the halls of a zombie-infested laboratory. One scene--the flick's creepiest--has Brad Pitt and one of the litchy-looking creatures separated by a mere glass partition. As the two silently size each other up, the monster grotesquely glares and gnashes his teeth. Despite all the snapping and snarling, however, the film has a dearth of blood and gore--which probably disappoints many fans of the zombie genre. The movie seems much more concerned with political messages and, sadly, not the sort traditionally seen in science fiction. There is no hint that the dread disease is related to the recklessness or poor choices of mankind, no clue that science has somehow gone mad and birthed a world- destroying monstrosity. The message of this movie is non-subtle and non-stop, and it's the same one that infects almost all modern, English- language cinema. And this offering is so full of it that a viewer might find himself counting incidents of political correctness rather than attacks by the creatures. The film's creators couldn't change the fact that ticket-selling Brad Pitt is a white male, so they made him a pancake-cooking Mr. Mom in an otherwise female household. His neighbors are a Hispanic couple who don't speak English, his old boss an African, his new helpmate a macho Israeli woman. When the latter's countrymen erect a wall to forestall the zombies, they just climb over it. (Of course, like the Mexican border, it's unguarded!) And, naturally, Pitt's humanity-saving mission doesn't land at world-class Ben Gurion Airport, but at Arafat Airport--which is, in reality, a bombed-out, non- functioning ruin. Fortunately, this film has just enough action and suspense to avoid the same fate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>it still earns high marks from me despite all its flaws. I was thoroughly entertained and the plot seemed decent and semi-original enough lead by a wonderful leading man and numerous fantastic supporting actors and actresses. The only things I did not like were the CGI-Zekes (or zombies) as I felt there wasn't a need to mutate them to a point whereby some of them looked completely computer generated and also the outbreak itself and what it took to contain it. When you look at some of the most epic disease-themed-disaster-flicks (Outbreak, Contagion, War of the Worlds, The Happening, Blindness &amp; even the Resident Evil saga) they begin with mass chaos brought about by something seemingly minute and frivolous and end with something equally trite yet mind-boggling as its resolution. Granted, World War Z blew the standard wind open by not having to depend on patient zero to come up with its solution but it still had its issues one of which was if you can wrap your head around why Brad Pitt's character had to travel all the way to Israel to get the answers he needed to complete the puzzle given him by a seemingly crazy prisoner he met by chance in South Korea (I mean what if he hadn't even noticed or paid attention to that prisoner?) and why when he got to Israel and got his answers did he not speak up sooner warning the singing, shouting and chanting people that the Zekes (zombies) were attracted to loud sounds? Why would that flight attendant on that flight to Wales open the lift compartment upon hearing such a weird sound given the circumstances? Why wouldn't she try to protect herself first given all that she had seen previously in Israel and what are the odds that only Pitt's character and the female soldier would survive the plane crash? Too convenient. I have so many questions but for the sake of peace and entertainment, I'll let them go. Another thing that stood out to me while watching this was how Pitt's adventures in the film seemed in some way to eerily mirror his real life adventures of adopting children and globe-trotting and peacekeeping and problem-solving for the world but then again its his home production and he can very well do whatever the heck he feels like doing so long as he produces something entertaining and worthwhile, which he did here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My least favorite zombie movie so far...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Geez, what a disappointment. Not the best idea to watch "Braindead" and then "World War Z" the same day. That will say, first the BEST zombie movie ever, then a... not so great one. Unfortunately, the movie is rated PG-13, which means that the violence is extremely toned down (you'd in fact be surprised at how little you can get away with), but ironically, that's still not the biggest issue. I thought at first that it was still KINDA bloody for being PG-13, not "Woah" exactly, but sort of "Huh, I didn't know they could do that". I realized suddenly I was watching the unrated version. WHAT?? Lame! Is MPAA sensitive or are they sensitive? Anyway, thought I might count down why this movie didn't quite fit in with my tastes: 1. I thought it would be a quirky little dark comedy considering the book it was based on. Guess I was wrong. I didn't even smile except at the scene where the zombies root for the Pepsi-cans, but that was UNINTENTIONAL comedy. 2. The characters are surprisingly forgettable. Sure, in some zombie-movies there may be stereotypes, but they are often likable enough that you can look past that. In this movie, everyone except for maybe Gerry Lane had little to NO personality. 3. The score is unoriginal and not notable. Not the biggest grip I have though, some movies are excellent even with very forgettable music. 4. Brad Pitt is normally excellent, but for some reason, I felt that he didn't use his capabilities to the fullest here. Watch Fight Club and then this movie. You will notice a HUGE difference in acting-enthusiasm. Most of the time he just stares into the air blankly. 4. Zombie-movies are often full of witty and funny dialogue. Here? Nope. 5. The make-up is terrible. It's hard to believe these are actually zombies. 6. The first half in general didn't seem to have much going for it. The second half was better, though not by a long mile. 7. The ending. There are ALL reasons to hate it.So in short, it's not a complete waste of time, but also not a complete spend of time. Wait, what the hell? That phrase didn't make any sense. Watch "Shaun Of The Dead", "28 Days Later" and "Braindead" instead. Those are REAL zombie movies. Heck, even "Warm Bodies" is a zombie-movie, just of a different kind!</fullReview>

Of course, most zombie movies don't have a much more sophisticated plot, but they don't have the following problems: lack of zany gore, and pseudo mumbo-jumbo pretense of explaining zombies medically!The 'zany' vs. pretentious part: this movie is 'serious' and attempts to elevate zombies to realistic status: it's a disease with an incubation time of 15 seconds, they can chase you at high pace, and lumber around only when dormant because no healthy victim is nearby, they can't be killed by disease because they have no circulating blood, etc. But the premise falls flat with inconsistencies. Too much BS pseudo-science. Like, why would the underlying disease bug prevent the host from biting a deadly sick human: after a 15 second incubation time, your circulation will cease and you'll be 'dead-alive' anyway. No evolutionary advantage here.Speaking of Dead-Alive (also known as Braindead in Australia). Unlike Peter Jackson's masterpiece of zany zombie gore, this movie has no real zombie gore. Brains are bashed in - off-screen; hands are cut off - off-screen; etc - off-screen. Zombie movies are about ridiculous, all-out, gore. Not about pretentious, pseudo-medically-explained off-screen gore for the parentally accompanied pre-teen audience.This film falls flat on all counts. No plot. No zany. No gore. Mucho pretense. It gets a 5 for reasonably professional production values and an OK chase scene here or there. It's mediocre, not awful. Go see 28 Days instead, a better entry in the 'serious' zombie genre that has cropped up of late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Waste of Good Source Material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the book, it pains me to have this be its only big-screen face.First, let me say something about the book. It has a very unusual structure, as it is not about one person but rather a collection of short stories about the zombie apocalypse. Because it is done in this way, it gives a global sense of the undead war and the effect it had on the world. So what did they do for the movie? Make it entirely about one person! The movie stars Brad Pitt as Jerry, an ex-UN official. Why they couldn't have used one of the male characters from the book is anyone's guess. Anyway, Jerry and his family are caught up in an apocalypse that comes about because of fast-moving, semi-intelligent zombies (as opposed to the slow-moving, mindless creatures of the book). He is rescued by some black government dude, who wants him to go on a round-the-world trip, based on the flimsiest hunches possible, to find a cure.This movie hurts me, on a fundamental level. Not because of the bad CG. Not because Brad Pitt plays the blandest character since Hal Jordan. But because a book, an amazing piece of literature that redefined the entire concept of a zombie apocalypse, has been dumbed down into a pandering, dull action movie with inconsistent writing and a mind-numbing conclusion.And it seems the writers were aware of these differences to the source material, because they keep making references to the book so they can maintain the pretense of this being an adaptation. But they even manage to screw that up! From changing the name that the military had for the zombies to letting the zombies into Israel, the whole thing feels like the equivalent of those high-budget, teen-targeted horror movie remakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action film that will fulfill your desires</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot of weird and crazy stuff happening in "World War Z", a zombie film that fulfilled my daily dosage of action. I understand that a lot of people will be against my opinion but I did actually enjoyed a lot this film. You will not find the typical zombie horror film in "World War Z". This film it's like a mix of really awesome action sequences filled with a large amount of visual effects and poorly executed horror sequences. There are some moments when you can't figure out what the hell it's happening because the action scenes are a little bit fast and confuse. The zombies were okay and there were some intense sequences (for example the plane sequence) that made the movie a lot more enjoyable. "World War Z" it's not great but it had style and fulfilled all my expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland and boring, but has a nice ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bafflingly incompetent film about the sudden outbreak of zombie apocalypse. Featuring Brad Pitt in a leading role, this film has decent production values and adds some new twists to the old zombie formula, but it's the storytelling that keeps it from being anything but a snorefest.The main problem is that the story has no cohesion. The locations switch between every scene, as Pitt's character travels across the world looking for the cure for the zombie disease. This is realistic in the sense that if a real pandemic got released, the solution would almost certainly have to be international. One lab comes up with one part of the solution, and so on. Yet an engaging story this would not make, so their solution is to have Pitt travel across the world, collecting these clues and solutions, causing the film to be jumpy and scattered. It's just a series of action sequences and spouted exposition dialogues.That being said, when the film finally calms down and stays in a single locations for a longer amount of time, the film's quality picks up instantly and we get our needed intense zombie scares. And the zombies in this films are actually rather good. They have enough traditional elements to feel genuine, but they have been upgraded with some clever twists that allow for some crazy visuals.Aside from that, Pitt is not a bad lead actor and as stated, the ending is genuinely interesting. It's just a shame that we had to wait so long for the film to turn good. As it is, this is a slightly below average popcorn flick with some redeeming qualities. If you're a hardcore zombie fan, you'll probably receive some enjoyment out of this. The rest of you, there are better movies out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Final Act makes up for some predictable scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a huge zombie person as much as some other people are and this isn't a gore hounds dream of a zombie film (Thank you PG-13) but I will admit I was generally surprised for what I got considering the trailer didn't intrigue me that much. The acting in World War Z is mainly hit or miss in my mind. Brad Pitt, while not a huge fan of his work, does a very good job here and gives a very legit serious performance. Mireille Enos does a very good job as the wife of Brad and does get a few very well pulled off emotional moments. My favorite actor in the film though is Danielle Kertesz who plays a foreign soldier who helps Brad Pitt through Israel and the hospital at the end of the film who has her hand amputated off due to getting bitten and keeping it from spreading. She gives a very good emotional performance and she definitely knows how to pull off the very intense moments in the film. The rest of the cast does well but they don't really focus on a lot of the side characters in the film, mainly its just Pitt, the wife, and the soldier, so a lot of the side characters are either forgettable and just there to die, or just give a passable performance.This is the one thing I was mainly concerned about, because in all the trailers, they show the massive amounts of zombies piling on top of one another and running in MASSIVE groups and it is painfully obvious CG and looks pretty laughable from far away, but up close the zombie makeup actually looks very good and the makeup does have some fantastic details to it, especially the teeth and hair on some of the zombies, especially the last one near the end of the film. And some of them have very graphic detail to them which I was genuinely pleased with that they at least made them look like zombies unlike some other zombie films in the past few years. Considering it is a zombie movie you would expect some suspense and jump scares, and this is my one problem I have with the film, the jump scares are very predictable, and I was even talking to my friend (Very quietly I might add) in the theatre during the jump scare scenes and saying, this would've worked so much better if they did this. One example is a zombie is shown on a stretcher in a flashback explanation scene asleep, the doctor is examining the zombie while dormant, and at one point puts his ear to the zombies face, now I thought it was going to be that the zombie was going to bite him while his face was right there, which would've been a very good jump scare, but he backs up and they zoom on the zombies face and its eyes open up, which killed the whole jump moment. The movie is just full of these moments that kill the jump scares by anticipating them. It's almost like the film is to scared to actually scare the audience which is not a good sign for a zombie movie. And I've seen jump scares done very well in other PG-13 films such as Mama and the Grudge and it is just sad that they don't utilize jumps that well. That is until the last act of the film where Brad Pitt and the soldier are in a research facility with a few other people where they have to find the cure so they have to go into the other half of the building, only problem is that the whole other half of the building is crawling with the other infected doctors and scientists, so some of the doctors, Pitt and the soldier have to sneak through there without alerting the zombies, and this is where I think the suspense is just phenomenal. The whole scene builds up so well having the first half of the scene in quiet while the people slowly have to sneak stealthily through the zombies without getting caught. And there is one scene where Pitt is in the medicine room locked in and I think this scene is arguably one of the best suspense scenes I've seen in a film. I won't ruin it but it is just fantastically creepy and makes you feel so anxious on whats going to happen. Overall, while this isn't the best Zombie film I've seen, I feel that the film has some fantastic elements of a zombie film, adds a couple things, has some good suspense (near the end), good acting, good writing, and some great makeup. I'd say it's at least worth one viewing if you can get over how cheap the CG looks at points and how predictable the jump scares are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the first World War Z book was published it took young readers by storm and climbed to the top of the New York Times Best Sellers list. It was destine to become a movie, especially now, with the popularity of zombies, but ultimately, the highly anticipated film fails to deliver anything different. U.N. Employee, Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), is out with his family when a recently discovered virus hits the United States and all hell breaks loose. The first 45 minutes of this film were literally like the pilot of The Walking Dead. No one knows what's going on, people are panicking, it was all very predictable. The film does go into a different direction after that, but how many different ways of doing a zombie film are there? Lane starts traveling the world seeking a cure for the disease, while at the same time trying to avoid being attacked. The unfortunate fact is that no matter how good the acting or the writing, there is very little you can actually do with a zombie film. The zombies and the circumstances behind the outbreak are always a little different, but ultimately it becomes about survival or the race to find a cure. Brad Pitt is terrific, and as I have been saying for year, it doesn't matter how good looking the guy is, he belongs in action films! This is the genre where he excels and even though World War Z was painfully predictable, Pitt makes it worth watching. He is the focus of the story and it takes a lot of quick thinking and tremendous stunts to keep him alive. For me that was the best part of the film. There was a lot of hype behind World War Z and it was a very intense film, but like I said, there is very little you can do with an end of the world/zombie film that hasn't been done over and over again. While some what entertaining, World War Z is ultimately just another copy cat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this film would have been a college test, it would get a C+. Coveting a Z is far-fetched expectation because the whole premise has more flaws than 2013's number of mega-flops.Starting with fast-paced thrills which only looks like zombie apocalypse turns into a parade of improbable plot twists. Many factors which are stitched together in this gimmick are flawed: the character of Brad Pitt in the whole drama, the zombie premise, the inconclusive dumb kind of an ending. I have never seen such an incomplete film made solely on a single "twist" factor which only comes around towards the end, minutes before the end credits. It makes the whole 2-hour adventure a circus show where not only zombies, but also the people confronting them are dumb.The starting credits showing photographs of cities around the world kinda intrigued me and I sat there revving my expectation up. Then, the pretentious plot started its fabricated course; as if every single turn in the screenplay was thought with a well-decorated closure i.e. "the twist."Brilliant photography &amp; fine CGI makes it pretty watchable but it is highly uncertain if you would enjoy it, accounting the huge list of epic zombie movies we have in catalog...BOTTOM LINE: It would be unwise if Brad Pitt is the single factor you would consider to watch a film constructed on an ambitious novel and popular cliché.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

		<fullReview>A very brief review on the floundering apocalypse movie World War Z. Understandably zombie films can be tricky to pull off thanks to their unrealism, unfortunately this didn't quite cut it. Big names (Hollywood actor Brad Pitt) and a big build up lead to a massively overestimated zombie apocalypse movie. When I saw WWZ for the first time I couldn't help but think of Will Smith's I Am Legend which contained a much stronger storyline. WWZ had the potential to be fantastic and could have been with a better storyline. For those of you who wish to view these apocalypse films, I'd recommend Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later &amp; 28 Weeks later as both masterpieces are thrilling, yet alone moving.</fullReview>

While waiting at the heavy traffic they notice some weird behavior from police helicopters and agents and after an explosion the humans are turning into the undead and seeks for the one remaining. Gerry along with his wife and two daughter must now seek refuge and with the help of one friend that he has they are successfully taken by a chopper from a roof near by. Now Gerry is forces to travel to Istanbul in order to find answers about the plague that drops over his town and many more others. But his journey will not be easy because the walking dead are all over trying to kill him and the others. He discovers something that might save the human kind but it will be enough or the solution is more difficult then a simple revelation? A movie with zombie quite different then other of this gender, with not that much blood and gore but still with some scary moments. I think that Brad Pitt in this movie looks like Chris Hemsworth in Thor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The biggest problem of this movie lies in the hectic dynamic of the narration from the beginning to the end.You're middle of the action right from the start, there is almost no introduction and it's a bit brutal, but the first 30 minutes of pure action are quite catchy.And then, oddly, the rhythm drops badly, the always excellent Brad Pitt begins his journey around the world and the script then alternates between good actions scenes and big slumps. The story is a bit confused, lacks a clear line, and the developments offered are not always very logical.World War Z, barely entertaining, appears therefore to be a disappointment, especially considering the disaster movie theme is worn out and has been the subject of much better productions such as 28 Days Later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's start with some obvious facts: in this (perequel?) movie you don't fight zombies with plants on your lawn. And, of course, if there was no Brad Pitt in this movie, nobody would care about it. It's simply not fun. Boring and predictable. Zombie movies are for other crew who can make it fun to watch (since the whole idea of zombies is a complete nonsense, par excellence) like George Romero (the "father") or Jonathan king ("Black sheep") or all that stuff with the Umbrella Corporation. And some others, who understood the point and pictured it ridiculous as it in fact is. Don't get me wrong: considering the thousand times before seen "plot", it has been correctly directed and made altogether, but what really scares me is the possible sequel (due to the inevitable cliffhanger). Don't make it, please. Let us play Plants vs. Zombies. That's what they are for. To play with and have fun. Not to make pretentious dull movies, saved only by a major star participation. 4 stars for efforts to make some sense of this script. Maybe zombie wrote it. Avoid.</fullReview>

The town escape, the W.H.O run, the airplane battle, Jerusalem. There are many elements to them that are cool but Pitt sails through them like he's already played the game before, no real engagement, he runs blankly from one vantage point to the next (via controller, left left, nudge pause), picking off targets (fire fire fire). He hardly breaks a sweat. The revelation points couldn't have been any more signposted if they'd circled them with highlighter pen for us. So really a video game with cheat sheet codes. Add to that the complete rewrite of the last 3rd of the story, it kind of leaves you wondering if the makers really had anything to say when they started the project.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When an epidemic sweeps over the world &amp; turns the living into crazed zombies, a former government agent (played by BRAD PITT) gets his family to safety on a huge government ship &amp; then takes off for the middle east &amp; other countries, trying to find a cure for the disease that has almost ended the world &amp; find out what caused the outbreak, amidst a series of zombie attacks on him &amp; his colleagues. As they get closer &amp; closer to their possible cure, their numbers drop off rapidly &amp; he soon fears that he may just wind up joining the undead ranks.WORLD WAR Z was a hotly anticipated movie by horror fans, based on the popular book of the same name. However despite it's huge box office success, fans of the book wound up being split on the film, some enjoyed the film immensely, while others despised it. None of this is really all that surprising, especially since it was a troubled production from the early stages of writing, through shooting &amp; finally right into post production. WORLD WAR Z as others have mentioned, bares very little connection to the 2006 book written by MAX BROOKS (Son of MEL) many of the far more interesting &amp; superior aspects &amp; interesting themes of the book have been noticeably dropped from the film, with little or no explanation from the studio or film-makers at all. In fact the film is nothing more than a big budget rip-off of 28 DAYS/WEEKS LATER &amp; DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004), both of which were inspired by the gory &amp; very scary Italian horror films DEMONS 1 &amp; 2. The film features the same growling, wild eyed running zombies you seen in those movies &amp; most zombie films since. Due to WORLD WAR Z'S troubled production history, which includes numerous re-shoots, script revisions both before, during &amp; after production &amp; the fact that the film went well over budget, the film is hampered by a few questionable plot inconsistencies, such as how BRAD PITT'S character is allowed to lead a very serious, life or death mission to find a cure that peoples lives depend on, rather than a strong &amp; well armed military troop, since his character has no military background whatsoever. How a zombie that can no longer think for itself, would know how someone was sick &amp; therefore their bites would have no effect on them. How Pitt can inject himself with a lethal virus that can kill him, doesn't wind up gravely ill, how he can toss a grenade on a plane to blow it up, while it is still up in the air with him in it, doesn't thrust him off with the rest of the attacked passengers &amp; their zombie attackers, much less kill him. When he awakens on the ground, he only has a chunk of metal stuck in his side &amp; hardly any scrapes, cuts, bruises, missing body parts, much less no broken bones!. Director MARC FORESTER does well for himself behind the camera, delivering many cool shots &amp; manages to keep the film watchable despite it's needless over length. The acting for the most part is pretty good, with Pitt okay as the hero (I personally felt he was miscast). All that out of the way, despite the overt silliness to some of the scenes, I will say that I am in the same class as those who enjoyed the film for what it was, the story always remained interesting enough, the film delivered several plot twists &amp; turns &amp; had a healthy dose of suspense &amp; tension &amp; despite the ridiculous over length of the movie (did it really have to be 115 minutes long?) the film moved at a fair pace throughout &amp; always had something in it that would make even the most jaded of horror fans watching.All in all, while I admit to enjoying the movie immensely, still when it was all over, I just felt the film could have &amp; should have been so much better than what it was. One can well see a Hollywood studio had their say in the production &amp; called all the shots, simply because the film features almost no gore at all (a rarity when it comes to a zombie movie) no rotting stiffs, no gut munching, no atmosphere. In fact the film is basically the horror movie take on films like OUTBREAK &amp; CONTAGION, but to even call it a horror movie would be pushing it. Since the film is really an action suspense thriller, with a light sprinkling of horror around the edges. The films PG-13 rating &amp; the fact it was put in 3D was further proof of the studio not caring anything about the book, or what fans wanted &amp; only about getting as many people to see the film as they could, so they could line their pockets. Had it not been for the writers &amp; the director trying to make it all work, the film might have wound up as a complete dud, but thankfully it doesn't &amp; it's big studio's greedy intentions thankfully don't override the film's fun story. Despite studio claims, the film is not the first 3D zombie film ever made, that award goes to the truly abysmal XOMBIES &amp; the 2006 remake of George A. Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Definitely recommended to horror fans, despite it's many short comings. Not surprisingly, a sequel is in the planning stages, that will hopefully stick much more closer to the themes &amp; idea's in Brooks novel &amp; turn out to be a far more faithful adoption of the book, but I'm not holding my breath.***1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read the book....Skip the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the book and could not stop wondering how they could possibly make a movie that was faithful to the book. Either they did not read the book or just chose to pretty much ignore it. About the only thing in common with the book was the title.In the book, the zombie war is over after 10 years and a journalist is traveling the world to interview survivors so he can write a book. The stories of survival and the politics of the war are totally ignored in the movie. Actually, pretty much everything in the book was ignored by the movie. The Brad Pitt character does not even exist in the book. The battles, decisions and strategies from the book are absent from the movie while the action scenes are totally made up for the movie. Now, I will say that the scene in the WHO was quite intense and great for those who cherish action over plot and script.I think this movie was made to set up the possibility of sequels to this movie. This movie sets the beginning of the war before people begin to stand up and fight back. If that is true, perhaps some of the well written accounts can be brought to the screen. Hopefully they have time to read the book before the next one is made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why You Might Like It: If you enjoy zombie films, then you will likely be entertained by this film. It has a very good plot, solid special effects, and an engaging pace that will keep your interest. For fans of Brad Pitt, this is obviously something you would enjoy.Why You Might Not Like It: The character development is lacking and it is hard to have much connection with some of the characters. It seems like the story was condensed drastically, which makes for a somewhat abrupt ending. The cast is also nothing amazing, but that is a minimal issue as the acting is still very good.Acting/Casting: 7* - Outside of Brad Pitt, the cast is fairly average at best. The acting isn't terrible, but you will not see many recognizable actors beyond Brad Pitt, Matthew Fox and David Morse. Morse and Fox have very minimal roles in the film. A more robust cast with some larger roles might have helped boost this film a bit, but it appears they decided to not go that route.Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 7.5* - The zombie animations are convincing and the film has a nice pace to it. I wasn't a huge fan of the abrupt ending to the movie and felt there was some potential for some more footage there. There are some neat aerial shots in the movie that I found to be interesting.Plot/Characters: 7* - I thought that the plot was very intriguing and the story was well put together. I will say the character development in this film isn't great and therefore it loses some value. Overall, the plot is a neat take on the whole zombie apocalypse.Entertainment Value: 6.5* - The movie was fairly entertaining, but will likely not blow anyone away. It is better than your run of the mill zombie film, but not by leaps and bounds. That said, if you enjoy zombie films, it is worth a watch.My Score: 7+7.5+7+6.5 = 28/4 = 7.0 Email your thoughts to filmwatchinfool@gmail.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombie movie with a twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This zombie movie added elements of modern warfare that is rarely seen in other zombie movies.There is one thing that bothered me. In the movie, the zombies are attracted to sound and they come running towards the source of sounds.Somehow, when the sound is made by one of their own, they don't come running. How can they tell whether a banging sound is made by a zombie or a human? And nobody ever investigated how the zombies could tell a zombie from a person. If they did, perhaps they would find another way to fool the zombies.Also, why don't the human just bombard them with sound to confuse and distract them? I can't believe not one person in this movie thought of throwing an object away to distract the zombies until near the end.Just because Brad Pitt is in the movie, doesn't mean it's a good movie. The movie was well edited and maintains a good pace. I never feel the urge to fast forward, but then I have a preference for horror movies.</fullReview>

The film stays conventional in terms of concept. It even deviates from the novel (by Max Brooks) it's adapted from. However, if you are a fan of the genre and extreme destruction and survival get your adrenaline flowing, this one's highly engaging. Be prepared to play hide-and-seek with the terrifying undead creatures for there's no place to run, no place to hide... Note: You may not like the film if 'zombie-action' fails to thrill you.

Now that's WORLD WAR Z in a nutshell. WWZ arrives at the zombie party a tad bit behind schedule. DAWN OF THE DEAD, SHAUN OF THE DEAD and WARM BODIES are three titles at the top of my head which makes WWZ just another zombie movie. Clearly WWZ exploded in the box office but why? Was it Brad Pitt or Marc Foster? Obviously Brad Pitt's presence was the lubricant in the well oiled moneymaker WWZ but Foster is The Man if I may say so. Foster changed the game and baffled the audience. The myth of Quality over Quantity is proved wrong. WWZ is all about quantity. The zombies don't walk they bolt. There are lots and lots of them. They don't jump you instead the tackle the spines out of you. They don't eat you whole; they bite you and dash to the next victim turning you in 12 seconds, there is so much happening with CG that the last time I was this impressed was with GLADIATOR. One of favorites of the movie is how Foster creates the fall of Israel this just may get a nod at the awards early next year. While all this takes place there is a subtle question too sent through this Zombie Apocalypse. See if you can pick this up when you watch the movie since it's sidelined with all the action that takes place. Who has a better chance of survival if SARS was not contained back then? A closed society or an open Society?Wrapping up this piece I will admit that WWZ lacked closure to this 116 minute adrenaline rush. It feels a bit like PROMETHEUS. You will look to the left and then to your right and then shrug your shoulders and say "that's it? What happens next?" Well there is a silver lining to that since Paramount pictures has confirmed a sequel on the studio drawing boards already with a hopeful return of Brad Pitt.Until such time, this explosion of lots and lots of zombies will have to do for summer 2013. There is enough excitement, ample suspense and dashes of lighter moments that concoct a good movie.TITLE: WORLD WAR Z DIRECTED BY: MARC FOSTER STARRING: BRAD PITT RATED: PG13 RATING: 07/10 RUNTIME: 116 MINUTES</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a surprisingly unambitious effort to cash in on the zombie craze. With some very decent talent in the cast, a little energy on the other side of the camera would have made a world of difference. But no. The "suspense" relies on cliché plot devices at the level of a TV drama (car won't start when you are trying to escape; cell phone rings when you are trying to hide).Pitt holds up his end of the bargain reasonably well, but there are no strong performances because the actors have too little to work with. Occasionally a writer managed to drop in potentially good moment or line ("Of course I'm not" could have been a memorable movie quote) get lost in the seeming rush to get it over with.I thought the most promising character was the virologist, who actually seemed enthusiastic about playing his role. So of course HE doesn't last 5 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets by on CGI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I put off watching this for quite some time, after hearing mostly bad things about it from friends and relatives. Still, it's not unusual for me to disagree completely with what my friends think, so I decided to give it a shot. This was not one of those movies.I should mention upfront that I have not read the source material for this, and came into it with zero expectations. With that said, this movie is not exactly good advertising for the book. It consistently failed to impress me and I found myself pretty bored after about an hour of watching. Sure, the CGI was so well done that I for the most part didn't mind the fact that many of the zombies were animated in, and there was plenty of action to at least keep you from falling asleep.No, what bothered me the most was the entire idea that some retired investigator would be the trump card for the UN in a disaster such as this. That they were willing to send their absolutely most important person to a zombie-infested area along with a handful of soldiers and this one investigator, as if the character played by Brad Pitt was some superhuman? I don't get it, and it annoyed me all throughout the movie.Please, please stop making the characters in movies where suspense is so prominent constantly kick over bottles, touch a fence, or make any other noise by accident? I understand that the zombies reacted to sound, something that you were constantly reminded of, but it's not exactly good when you have to make every action-filled sequence start with someone accidentally make a noise. And then suddenly, on the airplane, the zombie makes zero ruckus till the elevator is brought up, in spite of being ON A NOISY PLANE.This is in no way comparable to the classic idea of zombie movies. Going for a PG-13 rating was probably the worst decision made. Zombie flicks have always had a fairly heavy focus on gore, blood, and the absolute terror caused by the walking dead. The closest you'd get in this film would be CGI blood, and that was probably the only part where the CGI really didn't work out for me.When I heard the title I expected much much more. I expected more than just a single man travelling from country to country in search of a cure. I expected a war, not people hiding in cramped settlements, trying to stay away from rather than battle the zombie "invasion". Overall, it was extremely underwhelming compared to what the trailers and teasers and title made me expect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>28 days errr.... i mean world war z</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big budget, big star, lots of zombies, lots of....re-shoots? World War Z is loosely based off the book with the same name. However from what i'm told they are nothing very alike. World War Z was plagued with production problems much like it's zombies. I tried to like this film but in the end I could just not enjoy myself enough to get over this mediocre slump. World War Z suffers from pacing problems and a nonsense plot....even for a zombie film. Sure a pg-13 big budget movie might be great for the younger crowds but this movie was already made so much better a few years back it was called '28 days later' it even had a good sequel called '28 weeks later'. The other major problem that plagues this film is that it is complete cgi overload. it looks fake and flimsy. It's distracting and a big turn off. World War Z has a few moments of fun (zombies on a plane) and even a few jump scares, but they are to far and few between. Brad Pitt tries to save this film from falling into being average grade, but even he cannot save this film. I won't even rant about the ending and how it makes me cringe with how stupid it is. Many average audiences will love this film , however seasoned zombie veterans and horror fans alike will best avoid this film. Rating: 5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid summer blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War ZLike gold dust, a hefty-invested blockbuster with a problematic partial re-filming (including a complete overhaul of the ending owing to its financial curb) and a procrastinated release date could actually trounce its foreboding karma and pans out to be a competent money-maker in the bloodthirsty summer season, not to mention has earned itself a sensational caption as " the highest grossing film ever for the mega-star Brad Pitt". Directed by Marc Forster (QUANTUM OF SOLACE 2008, 7/10; STRANGER THAN FICTION 2006, 7/10; STAY 2005, 8/10; FINDING NEVERLAND 2004, 7/10; MONSTER'S BALL 2001, 7/10), who is to some extent oscillating between a major company's hack and an accomplished auteur in the indiewood. WORLD WAR Z craftily grafts mind-blowing visual feasts onto an apocalyptic milieu with rapid-running zombies infected by unknown virus, and keep contaminating the residual humankind. The backstory sounds familiar but film constructs an alternative coda, not the hackneyed one-man-saves-the-world heroism, instead, it offers a more plausible expedient to both avoid the callow overkill and underscore the future with a bleaker hope for the story to continue. The film never stray from a standard zombiefest routine, but the execution is commendable, an indeed white-knuckle experience from A to Z, the process of this prerogative family's running away from a zombie-invading Philadelphia has been handled even-handedly, although Pitt's wife and daughters would only be the burden for his further mission. Bounding from South Korea to Jerusalem, then a considerably smaller-scaled finale inside a secular lab in Scotland, the film brings us a gripping journey but there is no superhero to save mankind. In the South Korea chapter, an unexpected self-shooting accident happens out of the left field, in view of the executor's seemingly essential role as the last straw to stop this mess. This is a wonderful surprise I don't mind watching more on screens nowadays. Moreover, the treatment of silence is another feat creatively applied here, pretty contrasts to the common hubbub in the action pack, but as a corollary, there will be an inconvenient silence-breaker thanks to the unwitting wife's timely call, otherwise, the act is too smooth and casualties can never be spared in this case (farewell, James Badge Dale). However, the pinnacle no doubt should attribute to the raiding of City of David, excellent airborne shots render viewers a stately sacredness to witness the havoc, a sarcastic indication of a rabble of Muslims hymning cheerfully would insanely precipitate zombies to rally outside the bulwarks and eventually break into the city thanks to their umpteen quantities, which is a tad offensive but from the prospect of a non-believer, the irony is a bonanza since we are in desperation for some gallows humor under the circumstances.Most dissenters would argue the reshoot of the final act (an original plan includes a massive combat sets in Moscow) is a letdown simply because it is not epic enough to culminate the prescribed "the bigger the better" adrenaline drive, nevertheless, this thriftier approach options a no-gut-no-glory scheme which turns out to be a fairly conducted indoor thriller, and one can even laugh about the ostentatious plugging of the beverage company during the revelational discovery. The cast is inherently viable, Pitt underplays his charisma to be more approachable, it is rather comforting to see Enos clench a major film role and she could have been a better fighter than her screen hubby. In a nutshell, WORLD WAR Z is an entertaining popcorn fare, and doesn't try to patronize and outsmart its audience and showboats its CGI stunts to offer a bombarding sense of instantaneous grandiosity, which ultimately will fall bland in aftertaste. This alone can make most tentpoles pale in comparison!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watchable zombie blockbuster with decent special effects, some effectively tense moments, and a solid central performance from Brad Pitt. However, it's a letdown with a strange mixture of apocalyptic/zombie material, an episodic storyline in constant motion (sometimes just to keep moving), and an emotionally blank script tagged with a PG-13 rating for the masses. The movie frequently substitutes impressive CGI shots of zombie swarms for storytelling. The rushed ending feels cheap, and fans of Brooks' source material are going to wonder what happened. Too often it feels like empty chaos in an over elaborate disaster movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the HD unrated version on demand last night. First, the only relation this movie has to Max Brook's book is the title. Second, the first 30 minutes were fantastic and had me on the edge of my seat - maybe because I am a father with two girls about the same age as the characters in the film. Lastly, after the first 45 minutes or so the storyline devolved into the typical Zombies want to eat humans and humans are trying to stop them apocalypse film. Having said that, if you liked 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead (2004) this movie is definitely worth renting; it is full of solid action, a different kind of zombie (if you're a Romero purist, this ain't your genre) and interesting ideas about defeating the zombie plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Zombies are invading just about everywhere. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) a top-notch UN investigator is called out of retirement to stop the invasion. Yeah, I know another Zombie movie as if we don't get enough of them including those on TV too. The only other Zombie movie IMHO that was any good was ZOMBIELAND with Woody Harrelson. But, let's be clear: Zombies do not exist. Right?Actually, this one is pretty good. Yeah, I was surprised too. Hey, Brad Pitt is in it and he doesn't do bad movies. There is a lot of CGI going on for vehicle crashes and hoards of Zombies attacking everything in sight. Gerry's job is to find out what can stop this invasion and he goes to S. Korea where it is believed it all started, to Israel and then to Belarus to the World Health Organization Research Center there. When Zombies are not on screen, the acting by all is very good as is the suspense and tension. Okay, okay, the Zombies were good too??for Zombies. I wouldn't call this scary, but I wouldn't let little children watch. There was one scene where I must have jumped back about 20-feet. No, I can't tell you what scene that was. I want you to jump too. I shouldn't be the only one. See?You don't see any gore except in one scene where a hand is chopped off so that person -who was just bitten - wouldn't turn. Okay, I did cringe some. See, when you watch a movie you have to believe what you see is real (It's only a movie, Bob).How would you end an invasion of Zombies (they don't exist, remember)? Think about it for a minute or even while watching. Gerry Lane comes up with the answer, short term though it is. But, it is very clever. Oh, there are clues along the way and later Gerry puts it all together. Will you see the clues? Huh? (7/10)All in all pretty good for "another" Zombie movie.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No. Only soft stuff and not much of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you watch zombie movies there is an expectation that the film will contain blood and guts but this film has gone for a different route in order to appeal to a larger audience with its PG rating. Watch the unrated version for a less family friendly version. As you would expect from a zombie film this movie has a ridiculous plot. It also has excellent locations and dodgy CGI zombies like those in I am legend. Brad Pitt is good as per usual, and the supporting cast all does a decent job. wont win any awards but this is a highly enjoyable film and is full of action. the ending was slightly anticlimactic but it closed the story off nicely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A PG-13 Zombie Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3/4 World War Z is loosely based off the novel by Max Brooks of the same name.The story involves kind of the standard plot with a virus going around and people turn into zombies. Brad Pitt plays in the starring role where he has to leave his family and look for a cure for the virus. So the plot is pretty basic but smart at the same time with some great dialog and good direction. Yes, this is a zombie movie that is rated PG-13 which makes it obvious that this movie is not really going to be gory like earlier zombie flicks like Dawn of the Dead (2004) or Zombieland. It has a lot of zombie action but never gets to be gory where they make it involve no casualties or they cut the camera before there's any explicit gore. It kind of comes more to a disaster film where it really shows the global effect of the zombie apocalypseBut just because this film isn't gory, and stomach turning, doesn't mean it's not entertaining. There are many great thrills through the movie, but it does get a bit uneven which can throw audiences off. It isn't very powerful, but its a smart thriller of how they find the cure by using a familiar and kind of weak narrative. As far as entertainment it delivers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable but seems to miss the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the off, one of the major issues with a film adaptation of World War Z is that its source material wasn't suitable for a theatrical narrative, putting much more effort into constructing its setting than a traditional storyline. A more straight adaptation would have been fine with a more indie mindset, but it wouldn't have worked with the desire to create a blockbuster. Instead, they dragged zombies into more of a thriller scenario than the typical horror genre, as Pitt scours the world in search of a solution so everyone can have their happy ever after.Gone is the political and societal reconstruction, with each country just another place for Pitt to chat to a scientist and run from some zombies with different wallpaper. The criticism of American isolationism is gone, with Hollywood drafting in an all-American hero as the protagonist and a merry band of soldiers willing to sacrifice themselves for the cause, although we should probably be thankful they decided to re-shoot their original ending rather than having Pitt stick it to all those mindless, frothing communists.The film ends up as fairly standard entertainment, with some nice set-pieces and okay characterisation repeated from pretty much any doomsday film, but throws away the interest of its source material to become a less gritty 28 Days Later knock-off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombie movie with a difference... But still a zombie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In general, I am not much into science fiction where villains are not aware of their cruelty, but the names related to the movie (Forster, Brooks, Carnahan, Pitt) let me believe that I would see not a trivial zombie movie focusing on blood, shootings and related smutty shouts... To a large extent, I was right: zombies are not prevailing and often not even visible, there are versatile places of action, and the protagonist's activities are supported by high-minded goals (sometimes the latter is stressed too much, however).Brad Pitt (as Garry Lane) is pleasant as usual, but the whole movie is too focused around his character, and there are only a few memorable supporting actors - e.g. David Morse and Peter Capaldi. Proceeding from the logic of events, the presence of Lane's family is superfluous; so are some story lines.Nevertheless, skillful directing and big budget (different locations, mass scenes, digital effects) have helped to create a smoothly running script, with some unexpected twists and expected ending. If you like epic-apocalyptic movies, you will enjoy World War Z and have sympathy with brave people and non-sympathy with the undead...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mediocre in parts but refreshing to the genre in general</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all the badmouthing I was actually surprised about how enjoyable this title was. Sure, it follows your usual dramaturgy so very well known from about a quarter million other movies from Hollywood but against the background of the genre, WWZ really manages to shine in some parts.The Novella by Max Brooks, which this movie is based upon, is definitely recognisable even if the writers of the screenplay took their freedoms. The parts where the film borrows from the book are also and unsurprisingly the strongest. The whole setting is a refreshing approach to the genre as the initial outbreak and how people and governments probably would try to fight it is portrayed and not the dystopian aftermath, which is the case with pretty much every other title of the genre. I also like how the fast spread of such a virus/disease in densely populated areas and the consequences with gigantic hordes of zombies are displayed. All these are authentic aspects (as far as a "zombie apocalypse" goes however) you rarely see in other titles of the genre except the beginning of the original "Dawn of the Dead" from 1978.If the characters wouldn't have followed your usual stereotypes and the film would have dealt with the socio-economic implications of such an event more (a bit like "Contagion" from 2011 - e.g. what about oil, food, power etc. if everything comes to a standstill) it could have even been a truly great addition to the genre. This way, it is just a tad bit above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitt saves the world...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the novel by Max Brooks, the action thriller "World War Z" is one of the most highly anticipated films of the year. It is directed by Marc Forster, a director who has gained a lot of critical acclaim from such films as the 2005 "Best Picture" nominee "Finding Neverland" as well as the thriller from 2001 "Monster's Ball" which earned Halle Berry an academy award. The story revolves around former UN investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) who has left his job in order to spend more time with his two daughters and wife Karin (Mireille Enos). His life seems peaceful, he and his family live in a cozy house in the suburbs of Philadelphia. This peace is about to be shattered as international tensions are rising due to a mysterious plague that turns those infected into feral creatures. One day, when Gerry and his family are stuck in traffic in the middle of the city the infected begin attacking the inhabitants as well as causing mass destruction. The Lane's manage to escape within the inch of their lives and hide out with a family in an apartment building. Nevertheless, the infected are not far behind and the Lanes are forced to escape again. They run up the stairs of the apartment building until they reach the roof where they miraculously are picked up by an army helicopter and taken to a safe aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean. The carrier is property of the United Nations and if Gerry wants his family to stay on the carrier he will have to follow their orders. Gerry is forced to return to his old job and is sent off with a task force to find the cure for the plague.Whilst the film's premise is undoubtedly interesting, it is not executed very well. "World War Z" starts off with a bang and creates some great claustrophobic tension. Unfortunately the rest of the film tends to feel dull. The cast give exceptional performances and Brad Pitt once again proves that he is an excellent lead actor. Bear in mind that this is most definitely not a bad film, it's just?OK. Like I said, the film looks promising in the first few scenes, but then becomes dull. It should be noted that one of the films major strong point is the impressive visuals and intense camera-work. One of the main problems that hinder the film is that there is very little character development when it comes to Brad Pitt's character. We don't know anything about his past and we don't know the reasoning behind his actions. "World War Z" is most definitely a movie that should be seen in the cinema with a friend, it provides some intense action, but other than that it hasn't got much to offer. I had also heard that the movie was re-shot after the director decided that the story was too politically driven. This really annoyed me because there could have been some great potential for this film if it was more than just popcorn actionThis is without a doubt a fun movie, but it becomes progressively predictable and dull. What could have been a fascinating social commentary is now a piece of popcorn entertainment. If you're looking for a movie to see with your friends, sure go see it, but if you're looking for something profound or in any way deep, avoid it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was happy to hear how it starts with the soundtrack of a great muse's song.. The intro was pretty fast and it doesn't connects you with the characters, the outbreaking was also fast, it doesn't show us about how are their normal day and this makes me feel no sympathy for those Lil brat girls for example... And then, the outbreaking, and it bothers me, they tell us the virus take years, months to evolve but when it comes to the final stage of ''people eaters'' it suddenly happens at the same time all over the world, I mean it takes 12 seconds to infect and it's via blood, so I still can't understand how can it spread all over the world without a warning of a country getting zombies take over the cities, it just can't happen... The plot twist was pretty soon with getting the doctor killed, otherwise it could have leaded to another whole different movie...On another topic, I'm not a paranoid Illuminati but I think I got a message about Israel protecting people? While Muslims making noise are the fault of Jerusalem getting destroyed... I'm not a Jewish or Muslim but I think there was a messageANyways, incredible super zombies making a human leader, a sneaky quiet hidden zombie on a plane just waiting for his moment, a bomb on an airplane and our heroes surviving the plane crash, some of the reasons why I named this review unrealistic entertainment, also the trailer was the reason why most of us saw the movie, just sit, relax and watch zombies f**k things up. Sadly most of the action we already saw on the mentioned trailer.UN representative meets with high security World health organization after zombie apocalypse. Need to fight zombies over there to free the world? Here, have this Axe, I mean really? How are they defending themselves against the 90feet tall wall making zombies out there? One gun. I just not going to ask how they managed to get that black zombie on that cage because this movie really doesn't make sense. At all.How many people are out there with terminal diseases? Don't know? No prob, I recall 2 on Jerusalem... What do you think they did next? Anything else but informing about their immunity, because Brad Pitt HAD to infect himself with a mortal illness of course. Because the world health organization doctors who sent him KNOW there is no people with terminal diseases in the whole world and no one have noticed yet that they are not good enough for the zombies, yeah, you heard it, cancer patients? they are not good enough, and they smell unhealthy thus, they can't be part of the super zombie gang, the zombies think they are useless, I didn't say it, it's the movie message.Then, why 7/10? Because beside of the plot holes I found it entertaining a bit scary and a good brainless zombie movie with nice effects. Would recommend, not for the story but for the time to time action.OK, if you actually are reading this, thanks. This was my very first review ever. I hope to get better because I really love movies and I love this site. Also please Sorry my English I speak Spanish :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Allegedly based on Max Brooks' innovative book this film throws all intelligent thought in the bin during its failed pursuit of thrills.Even if one is prepared to ignore the fact that they've turned one of the most intelligent books of recent years into one of the most idiotic films, the entire movie is an abject failure on almost every level. The sense of global devastation was realised much more effectively ( and much more cheaply) in the Resident Evil films. Resident Evil also worked far better as action movies with a zombie theme.The script is full of gaping examples of stupidity that make it impossible to identify with the characters, especially Pitt's who is supposed to be a well educated experienced UN investigator. He makes absolutely moronic decisions time and time again.The acting is generally substandard, the direction woeful ( its almost impossible to see what is happening in the action sequences)and the audience I saw it with laughed several times at things weren't meant to be funny.Also, for the most expensive zombie movie ever, its hard to see where the money was spent.

		<shortDescription>Good one time watch with remarkable visualization. Appeals to a wider audience however a flailing attempt at showing the audience a new perspective on zombies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes from the movie, the trailers along with the lure of Brad Pitt being in the lead were highly stimulating. It was a good one time watch although barely escaped marginalizing the zombie genre with a good dose of de ja vu moments. And it fared better because of some superbly contemplated shots and action sequences with masterly special effects. It can appeal to a wider audience because of abated violence and intense visuals.Brad Pitt monopolized screen time for obvious reasons and practically stole credit for nearly every major turn of events; I sympathize with the director for having to balance the star's ego and contribution of the other cast members.At the risk of drawing parallels with previous productions having similar themes, which to be honest is inevitable, I would place the 28 days/weeks duo far ahead of WWZ. Without the star power the two movies were able to create the sense of true despair and a very eerie and uneasy sense of reality that pushes you into an adrenaline high enough to kick start your survival instincts while keeping the thrills in tact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never read the novel based upon this film adaptation, and I am glad that I didn't. Because usually I am a huge complainer when it comes to novel/author-accuracy. I tend to get P.O'ed when certain scenes/events from a novel are omitted that I hold dear in my heart, and P.O'ed when things that never occurred in a novel are include in film adaptations. It's like painting a mustache on a Rembrandt.Okay, I ain't really all snobbish like that.I'll probably never read the novel because Zombie novels don't interest me much anyway. The closest thing to a Zombie novel I've read is some Stephen King novel about cellphones. But I kinda liked WWZ...a little. However, there were several things I didn't agree with. Like Brad Pitt bouncing around from infected-place to infected-place and being the only one not getting bit while hundreds around him are not so lucky. I thought wrapping the magazine around his arm for bite-protection was clever. I thought infecting yourself with a deadly disease in order to make oneself undesirable/undetectable was clever. But still, although ingenious, this last one left me feeling a bit cheated.While it wasn't the best Zombie film in the world, it certainly had some scenes that raised an eyebrow (the Zombies piling up to climb walls, for instance). And I can't say that it was boring. So it gets a 5/10 from me for at least for being something I may want to rewatch in the next 10 years or so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z: Z is for Zombie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story unfolds in the first 10 minutes. The sweet couple wakes up bright and early, the kids (two wonderful little ladies) are happily playing in the kitchen, and the loving husband Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) prepares a breakfast. Then, TV report on martial law -- family, car, panic in the traffic jam -- a hit by car policeman -- running and crying people -- zombies among them! The story develops uncommonly fast and astonishing, especially for those who was familiar with nothing else but the movie trailer. As for me, as a prospective moviegoer, I watched the trailer and that's it. I didn't read any movie descriptions and I wasn't aimed at finding any other "about a movie" information. So the only thing I knew was that the movie-I'd like-to-watch title is "World War Z". Thus, I expected to watch something warlike: men with weapons, army, booms and so on. After watching the trailer, I made a conclusion that this movie is quiet warlike, there are weapons and even copters but I didn't catch who was fighting for and why. There was not even slight mentioning of Zombie. No scary infected men's faces, no Zombie's walking shots, no Zombie's attacking people shots. How should I get that this is an about-Zombie- movie? Now after watching the movie I realize that Z in the title is for Zombie. In the next few minutes we find out that Gerry is an ex-UN employee (but you are never an ex-UN employee as well as an ex-CIA agent or killer, whatever) and he is going to help the government to stop the Z pandemic. The other UN-employee Thierry (Fana Mokoena) itself makes a promise to take care of Gerry's family. Well, first, I have to admit that Brad Pitt was acting in lots of movies during his actor career as a non-family man appeared to the audience as a loving and thoughtful husband and daddy?and failed. Wish he never tried to. Why has he to be a husband according to this screenplay? Why not a brother or cousin? He could be a nice widower living in neighborhood who happened to help a lone woman with kids to get out of that mess by chance. But we know upfront, this is not a love story. I just state the point that being a family man is not what Brad Pitt good at. Herein I'd better put the brackets with the words "in movies". The action is eventful on the whole. The human race's Rescuer Gerry Lane travels around the world, goes from country to country (except Russia; "Russia is a black hole" as his fellow Jurgen (Ludi Boeken) said in the trailer; and perhaps India, that's what Jurgen named "a black hole" in a movie), from city to city trying to understand the reason of mass infection and the way to prevent it. The progressively increasing number of death toll accompanies his adventures. The world, meanwhile, turns into a mess. But miracles happen! The answer how to conquer Z-beings comes to his mind when traveling and trying to figure out the situation. All in all, he is the main character, what means that he has to fight all alone or almost alone; and that is what actually happens in the end of the story. Everyone is happy, Brad Pitt, oops, sorry, Gerry Lane is a national or better to say international hero, his family is safe and sound, the world, as we know it, still has a right to existence. As for his wife Karin Lane (Mireille Enos), she is O.K. I mean there's nothing to add. Just an ordinary wife taking care of her kids while her husband trying to save the world. Nothing special. Happens every day. Or even rare. Except one thing, she is overcareful and nervous, by the way, she calls him not in the right time. She calls him to know how is he doing and so on like he's gone for a walk for a while and is not coming back. Oh God! Why?! So, this is the time when we all know "what" happens, I guess. The idea of mutual support and cooperation is well-presented in the random number of shots where people help each other in trouble. I guess this is a right appeal to stay united in case of something. But there is still one thing left. The reason why people ever get infected is not clear. The movie gave a food for thought for audience on 2 questions: how did people get infected and mutated; and how to stop this apocalypse. The world-wide infection has been stopped. And as for the first question, there's no answer. Whether to accept it as an allusion to a sequel or not, you'd better decide on your own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One part 28 DAYS LATER and one part DAWN OF THE DEAD II (which is one part RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD), WORLD WAR Z, with its fleet-footed, teeth-gnashing zombies, may be the final chapter in the seemingly never-ending cycle of zombie films set in motion by George Romero and Company so very long ago. Where to go from here? What's left to say that hasn't already been said a thousand times before? (MUTANTS was a nice variation on a theme, but even there we were watching what was essentially "just another zombie movie." And THE WALKING DEAD, sporadic at best, has milked the concept dry in every way possible.) WORLD WAR Z has its moments, but many of them seem to be unintentionally memorable; such as when the people in First Class aboard a plane are set upon by the folks flying coach- the one percent quite literally being ripped apart and eaten by the 99%; or when the Israelis try to throw up a wailing wall to keep out the infidels, only to find that they've managed to wall themselves IN; or the one true moment of fright in the entire film, when a dying man's eyes, which have rolled back in his head, suddenly drop down again (a direct steal from RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD)... While zombies still have plenty of potential to scare the s### out of us, movies like WORLD WAR Z (and even THE WALKING DEAD, in which characters dispatch zombies without so much as breaking stride, using a seemingly endless flow of ammunition) cheapen the whole experience (ironic, considering the budgets).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not bad for a glamorous zombie flick considering the monstrous budget. Riding on waves of tension opposed to gore and squeamish nightmares (to the disappointment of sadistic degenerates), World War Z is an intelligent, thrilling, and scary zombie apocalypse movie and has become a strong reminder to never to be too hasty when writing off pop- commercial films. "Really?" you say? Really. Along with Pitt's glossy blonde bangs and the floating re-shoots and re-writes rumours, it didn't look promising. But when Foster is handed $200 million budget, instantly one assumes that the film is going to be mediocre; simply because no film should cost $200 million to produce unless it somehow allows the audience to experience it in a brand new dimension. Instead what this audacious capital investment did bring, were zombies that don't stroll like their under the influence, but sprint, jump and climb to a point where they swarm across the landscape like a plague of insects, creating surreal imagery.An ageing Brad Pitt stars as Gerry Lane, a father, husband and a former United Nations investigator whose life seems content until the world is struck by an infectious pandemic, ironically turning humans into energetic, mindless zombies. After scarcely escaping from the anarchy with his family and a newly orphaned boy to a safe zone on a government harbour of an aircraft carrier, Lane is left with no choice but to leave his family and is sent on a mission to investigate the disease. What follows is the treacherous worldwide journey where Lane's bravery and hope for the human race is brutally tested.The story and character development was flaccid and linear, and at times becomes disconnected with the background of the characters (to which is almost non-existence); so I recommend reading the novel An Oral History of Zombie War to get a deeper insight of lost sections of the film's story which has clearly been done for the purpose of entertainment and Hollywood conventions.Don't be expecting too much because it most definitely, won't deliver. Although World War Z had the potential to be a total disaster, solely Brad Pitt's name saved this film from being eaten alive. Nevertheless it's worth a watch. The suspense will get you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never been so torn apart deciding about a movie before. Main problem is that the movie was jumping from side to side on the good/bad scale, like a cricket on meth. First off, I am a huge fan of the Zombie genre and this movie had one of the best survival scenes i've seen, and i've seen a lot :) And on the other hand we had a completely illogical, lacking basic sense main plot, the absurdity of witch was so irritating it would be better to have no plot at all. Then jumping back to the good stuff, the cast and their acting were great. Problem is the environment established by the main plot (not by the z's) did not give the actors any chance to grow their potentials. So simply put, if you are a big zombie fan and not so much on complexity, originality, or as a matter of fact any basic concept of storyline, you will greatly enjoy this movie. The opposite and you will hate it. I can see how the average rating would reflect on the current trend of the viewers in matter of that aspect :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen a lot of bad movies as of late - I was genuinely surprised that, after all of the bad press it had, Brad Pitt's zombie movie is, in my opinion, one of the best one of the genre I have seen.No, if you are looking for a deep plot and stellar narrative, look elsewhere. More to the point, be content with looking elsewhere, because - guess what - IT'S A FREAKING ZOMBIE MOVIE.What the film nails is the design and behaviour of the zombies. Through some good editing and good CG (for the most-part), they end up being extremely freaky, with a type of supernatural quality that sets them apart from all other zombies. That, combined with the sheer number of them on-screen, adds up to an intensity in the action scenes that will makes for uncomfortable watching, in a good way.The whole plot point regarding how they combat the infection is pretty original, as far as I'm aware.Don't listen to reviews from elitists - if you're looking for a good ol' fashioned nom-em-up, you could do a whole lot worse than World War Z.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z- A review that hurts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with, this review is mostly going to be about zombies. If you're not interested in that, then I can go ahead and tell you that Marc Foster's WWZ is a mediocre zombie movie with Brad Pitt in the star role. The majority of the plot is either extremely predictable or just plan confusing, e.g. the plane ride, which felt added in with no real explanation. Furthermore the ending is irrelevant to the entire beginning plot line, and I'm pretty sure the film in general is anti- Semitic. WWZ is simply a showcase of how hundreds of CGI zombies can look on screen, and how Brad Pitt looks unkempt. But don't despair my dear three readers, as I've already beaten Dead Rising and seen Kalifornia, so this loser that wasn't tricked.I suppose what angers me so bad about WWZ was the missed potential. The film was supposed to be based off of Max Brook's epic book by the same name, which is completely true if you scrap the entire storyline, characters, and style of the zombies. I know all you Honey Bo Bo fans might complain that I'm just trying to be an intellectual who's only critical because I have a library card, but this isn't the usual case of 'the book is better'. This is a case of studio execs and producers altering the entire film to fit an audience that they think are too vapid to handle solid creativity, which if you look at the cancellation of great shows in the last ten years (Deadwood, Firefly, Arrested Development), may make them correct. But for all you non-readers, who for some reason are reading this, let me explain why they screwed the pooch via bullet points.The book starts off after the zombie war, and is told in flashbacks. This is extremely effective as each chapter is about three pages long, and deals with a different person's story of survival, based primarily off the country or society they live. In the book, the main character is a UN census worker who's sent to these different areas of the world to get the total amount of people that have survived. The prologue of the book deals with his boss telling him all he wants is the numbers, and not the incredible stories that he was told by the survivors. Thus the book was created. In the movie, the main character is a retired CIA agent or something.In the movie, the main character's goal is to find patient zero so America can discover an antidote. In the book, patient zero is explained in full detail in the very first chapter of the book. And he's taken to a hospital for research, and they know where he got bitten.In the book there is no wife and family of the main character, as his identity is inconsequential. In this way, he is everyman, much like the interviewer in Interview of the Vampire. In the movie, wife and kids. In the book, the zombies are slow moving, George Romero style, and their bodies are slowly decaying due to a virus called Solanum. In the movie, they run and jump around like Toad from X-men after smoking trailer full of meth. In the book, the real terror isn't as much the zombies, but the fear that comes from a never ending foe, one that shows no signs of remorse or understanding. This in turn creates a claustrophobic reaction, and there's an entire (awesome) chapter which explains how battling them with helicopters and modern weaponry are useless. In the movie, they seem to have some recognition of their previous lives, and they are fought with helicopters and modern weaponry.Furthermore there's no battle of Yonkers, no bad-ass blind Tibetan Monk, and no Paris Hilton getting killed with her dog. Almost none of the original stories were mentioned, except for the Israeli defenses, but that plot line veers 100% away once the zombies realize they can climb on top of each other. Also the North Koreans rip out their own teeth, which is stupid and is nowhere near as cool as what they do in the book. Finally, the main character has long hair. Long Hair!!! Any Max Brooks fan knows that this is ridiculous and massively stupid in a zombie attack.Despite my loyalty to the book, WWZ isn't even a good zombie movie. It was more like a combination of Independence Day and Outbreak, though both of those movies were better by any standard. Even Independence Day's horrible ending of 'let's put a virus in the alien's computer system' made more sense than the resolution of WWZ. Quite simply, it was a crappy action movie, not a zombie movie.In the end, WWZ is a Brad Pitt vehicle instead of a solid adaptation of a great zombie book. It's predictable, rips off half the action films since Die Hard, and has major plot lines introduced/resolved in less time than it takes to cook an egg mcmuffin. Add in an ending which is sillier than Sign's 'they're allergic to water' ploy, and this makes a film that is more confused than my grandfather using excel. As much as it pains me to advise it, skip WWZ and go rent Shaun of the Dead instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though its plot twist is interesting, "World War Z" is average at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't watched much in the way of movies or TV shows centered on zombies. And because I'm not a horror movie fan, my interest in such films and shows is pretty low. I also don't watch many movies or shows relating to anything medical or health related almost for the same reason as zombie movies and shows. So in a way, I'm one of the least eligible people to talk about a film that combines both of these genres like "World War Z", starring Brad Pitt, since I barely have an expertise in these genres of film. But for what it is, I think that fans of either of these film genres will be satisfied enough with certain parts of this film. As for me, while I don't think it's terrible by any means, I'm indifferent about the whole film altogether. Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former member of the United Nations who is currently raising two girls with his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) in Pennsylvania. While Gerry and his family are stuck in the middle of heavy traffic, a massive zombie attack emerges and they start an adventure around the world where they discover that the rest of the world is also experiencing massive zombie attacks. Gerry is recruited back to the United Nations to go on a mission in which he must find a cure for those affected by this unfortunate outbreak. Although the plot for "World War Z" is average at best, I'll give this film credit for incorporating a fairly creative twist into its story. Without spoiling anything, the writers came up with a very logical weakness for the zombies in terms of what people or creatures are avoided by them. If you've seen this film already, I believe you'll have a pretty good idea regarding what it is. If you don't, then I'll simply say that the climax in the hospital is all the more captivating because of this creative plot twist. Because of this, we are able to feel the suspense in the climax since we know what our main character has to do and how difficult his task is going to be. Brad Pitt does his part with his basic role and there is some meat to his relationship with his family. I respect how Gerry and his family feel like a real family based solely on the few conversations they have with each other. Aside from that, I don't recall being that terrified by "World War Z". I think the reason for this is that I could tell that the zombies were done in crappy CGI. Remember the shot when the zombies climb on each other and end up being able to hike up a tall wall that no one could possibly climb up? I found shots or scenes like those especially implausible. With the exception of the plot twist, there's nothing else about the story that kept me that invested in watching it. With the exception of the scenes between Gerry and his family, the narrative wasn't deep enough to make an impact on me. Whether or not you're into "World War Z" in the end once again depends on your interest in zombies or medical cures for anyone who was turned into a zombie. I respect parts of this film and how some of them were handled particularly with the family dilemmas and the plot twist. However, I didn't get into the rest of the film enough to say that it was worthwhile. Take this review for what it's worth, not my kind of flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Good Things, Other Less So. Enjoyable Yarn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'World War Z' is a disaster movie; I didn't enjoy it very much, but partly because two bitches were chatting ceaselessly in the movie theater where I was. The plot of this movie is unrewarding?though compelling, involving, and I liked several parts?the Jerusalem episode, the flight with the Belarusian airplane, and the WHO building in Britain could have looked scary; the zombies have been given a new look, their behavior is not so much about eerie undead, as about a regression into _animality, a fall down the evolution scale?and fast, tetanus movements, and their assemblies had something entomological in nature, as if swarms of cadavers, of undead. Of course we are told nothing about the nature of the illness; but the quick death of the promising and sententious _virusologist was worth it. The plot itself felt improvised by a very young, and uninformed, person. But it's a disaster movie with beasts, and scenes and episodes are well made, and we travel from US to Korea, to Jerusalem, to Nova Scotia. Essentially a B movie script, with a handsome budget, I assume, but an unlikable cast and stupid lines. The action looks good, the movie looks clumsy and episodic, crumbled, disjointed. A good afternoon fun. Have you seen the Zekes storming Jerusalem's wall? Did you enjoy the ambiguity of Pitt's dream, or vision, on the Belarusian plane?the blonde and the hidden Zeke? And it's all a hurry, but it doesn't look hurried, they enjoy the movie?save for the actors, who seem rather uninspired, Pitt at least.Scientists in cage, as in the British episode, had an unmistakable Lecter feel about it.I guessed the water would harm the undead; but burning them proved efficient.The cityscapes are interesting, and one remembers Pitt and his companions running up the stairs. I liked Pitt fighting zombies while he and his four companions are trying to leave the building and be rescued with a helicopter. So, there are good things. Some might find them enough. I would have been happier without the couple of annoying bitches already mentioned above.The wife, played by Mireille Enos, is severely annoying. But Daniella Kertesz looks cool, and did a good role, as 'Segen', Gerry Lane's Israeli sidekick. As a matter of fact, perhaps the single likable character in the movie.Enos, Mokoena, Gabel, Capaldi, Boeken, Favino were all competing for the most annoying and unlikable face on screen.Favino has a nice girlfriend, Anna Farzetti.Other than that, the script is crap?the young biologist lecturing about nature's murders, Jürgen about the tenth man, fortunately most of the time they avoid discussions.A Mossad official, looking very Israeli, named Jürgen was a weird thing; anyway, the guy takes his time to tell you the rule of the tenth man.After having built a wall, the Jerusalimitans fail to survey it, and the city is stormed by the Zekes. The solution defies belief by stupidity, after inoculating himself, Pitt runs to his team, and then to his family, and, not being the left box, if I remember well, there are no consequences whatsoever, so the solution is inoculating soldiers with WHO pathogens, which would kill anyone immediately, and the soldiers are supposed to fight being terminally ill, because what the zombies sense is not that one has been inoculated, but that one is gravely ill, so one has to be gravely ill, and with infectious diseases, caused by microorganisms isolated in WHO laboratories?and the writers assume that a man with a walking disability would be perceived by zombies as being terminally ill, hopelessly ill (and would still work as a military). So, in its stupidity, this solution, thought out by Pitt, is _defyingly absurd and unworkable, and no measures of prevention whatsoever are taken, no quarantine is instituted. It seems that no epidemics of typhus or meningitis or whatever they use begins.It's true I have been studying epidemiology for six months, as a trained physician, and so I am likely to sense these goofs more keenly?but regardless, it was an abysmally stupid solution to come with.And it's not as if they were obliged to come up with this absurdly imbecile solution.It's a well shot and scored movie, a disaster movie intended as an epic, with good, though few, action scenes, but badly written, cast and played.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the thing, Zombies are a metaphor. The Zombie character is a symbol of the blue collar office workers that drone to the corporate hive and than totter out in wearing a blank facial expression. Zombie epidemic is impossible and Zombie movies epidemic is pointless for quite some time. Longer than the first draft (of many, we learn) of world war z. While Gerry lane (Brad Pitt in a reasonable but unmemorable performance) prepares pancakes for his kids as the ex-UN officer-turned-homemaker that he is, a growing army of the undead is spreading through every city. Brad is called from retirement to try and find a cure. After a brief and rather cryptic meeting with a virologist, Brad heads to Jerusalem to examine close hand the solution they effectively devised against the Zombies. As an Israeli, I was surprised not only by the fact that the Israelis actually solved a problem but also from the visions of unity between Israelis and Arabs. In one scene, Arabs and Israelis were standing and singing peace songs in unison. Maybe such an eminent threat will make us Israelis and Arabs set aside our differences and unite us all as one family but it definitely won't turn us into the Von-Trapp family.Gerry (the formerly retired UN officer) has little time to dwell on the petty. After a brief session with a Mossad official with the least Israeli name anyone can think of and after roaming in in a city that never won the "Jerusalem lookalike" contest ,He continues with a wounded female Israeli soldier named "Segen" (Hebrew for "Lieutenant") to the last resort to cure the world of this endemic. Some of you might think I'm a little light handed when it comes to quotation marks but I assure you there is no one named "Segen", the Jerusalem in the movie has very little resemblance to the real Jerusalem and the entire premise and plot evolution seem like one big quotation mark that's not worth quoting. The authenticity problems with the Jerusalem of WWZ is meaningless to the 99.99% of the people who, in my estimate, have never set foot in it. The thin plot and the flatness of all characters but Pitt's are the movies major flaw and when the sluggish pacing (especially during the last half hour) builds in for the big climax, it's poorly executed and the pieces of the story are rashly held with a duct tape dialog. The flawed writing is evident by the realization that if the (few) surviving characters would have fallen victim to the epidemic, it wouldn't have mattered one bit to the story's appeal. I'll go the extra mile and wildly speculate that the extensive rewrites made the problem even worse.I think the movie's biggest problem is that it misses its mark. If it's meant to be a Zombie movie with a hidden criticism of human ineptness, it loses to the masterful "28 days later", if it's a one man journey in a dystopian apocalypse movie than it waddles behind "I am legend". I have seen these aforementioned movies many times and I assure you I have no plan to see WWZ another time. The only good reason to see this movie is the opportunity to write a snide review in which I strongly suggest to Hollywood to bring the zombie movie genre to a final overdue rest.The zombie metaphor, it seems, is undead too.5 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>don't expect too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure if it's the self-confidence of Brad Pitt or the missing focus of the movie, but I think that World War Z is a zombie movie which although it creates a nice atmosphere has too much problems to be a massive experience.The first thing I ran into and what bugged me the whole movie was that I didn't care if Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) makes it 'til the end or not. It was like i followed the story but had no one who I wanted to survive the movie... and one thing a zombie movie must have (in my opinion) is one or more protagonists I share the excitement with. So the whole movie doesn't really cause some tension.Another problem was the self-confidence of the protagonist what is too uncalled for a zombie movie (what may correlate with my first problem) because there is no weakness in his character and so there is no need to be afraid for him.Nonetheless there were also some nice things, I really liked the zombies and there abilities. There were some really nice scenes (especially in Jerusalem) where they staged the zombies in an awesome way.Another positive aspect was that you felt the zombie cataclysm on the whole world and not like in other movies just in one town which creates some really oppressive atmosphere.All in all it's a zombie movie like you get dozens of out there. But it really has some nice footage and the zombies have a nice touch. So if you like zombies you can watch it but don't expect something special like I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WWZ - almost a 10 star movie... misses the almost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I always say when someone comes and critics this movie in a negative way because " bhaac, this is not a zombie movie at all" or " what the hell, the movie has nothing to do with the Max Brook's book!!!" I, just say : - what's a zombie movie for you? have you already seen a zombie ? Do you know how they are, move, act? well, here is what a zombie is : " is a hypothetical being that is indistinguishable from a normal human being except in that it lacks conscious experience or sentience", so, your imagination is the limit! the zombies in WWZ are so acceptable as the zombie in The Walking Dead. Regarding the second negative affirmation by some of critics I remind that in every official advertising or movie information site is explicit that the movie is "based on the novel " and not an "adaptation of the novel" Yes, yes, I've loved the movie because I love zombie theme movies, because Brad Pitt is one of my favorite actors, because the Muse musics are great, but why only 8/10? well, the first part of the movie deserves 8 stars for all the tension , vfx, adrenaline but the second part... nope .... forget it , to soft, a break in the action, a real production error. So , here are my vote: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>any and every episode of the walking dead is superior to this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is pretty much a cookie cutter action movie with Brad Pitt and his comedy hair. It was robbed of any attempt to generate horror or suspense in order to get a family friendly rating. When watching a zombie film I willingly suspend disbelief that the living dead walk the Earth. This suspension of disbelief does not give the film-makers carte blanche to cobble together any old moronic claptrap that doesn't make one iota of sense. The presence of a fantasy element does not negate the need for a plot, characterisation or acting. Unfortunately the makers of this film seem to think that zombies automatically generate a free pass that permits lazy, perfunctory film-making.Save your money. This is just a Z list film that happens to have Brad Pitt in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great action movie, but far from perfect...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, as much as "World War Z" was hyped up and as it was the summer's big zombie movie, and me being the zombie aficionado that I am, of course I had to go watch it.The movie, however, left me somewhat ambivalent. There were aspects and parts of the movie that were really great and nice, while other aspects and parts of the movie were quite the opposite.First, let me start off with the things that I didn't particularly cared much for. The biggest issue for me was, of course, the running zombies. I never have cared much for agile and running zombies, nor will I ever get to do so. Sure, I can understand it in this movie as the infected was recently turned. But that leads me to the second issue in the movie which I didn't appreciate or understand. If everything here happened in the course of 2-3 days and the zombies were "fresh" (read, recently turned), then how come they all looked emancipated and like they had been decaying and decomposing for about 2-3 weeks? It just didn't make any sense.Also the massive pile ups of zombies as they stacked up to scale the walls in Israel of the sides of towering apartment buildings, that didn't really go well with me. Sure it looked cool and it was a new concept idea to bring to the genre. But come on, it was just too much.Without giving away anything of the ending of the movie, then it was really, really anti-climatic. It was like the movie producers realized that they were over the estimated time-slot and budget and had to wrap it up quickly. The ending was abrupt and too much of a happy Hollywood ending.So what was good about the movie? Well, there was an overload of action, right from the very first minutes and up to the very end. There is a lot of adrenaline and speed to the movie. And it worked out well with the panoramic views of the various cities, when you saw all the infected running around in massive hordes. It was on an epic scale actually. I loved those scenes (eventhough I can't stand running zombies). They looked awesome and there was just something dark about them and a sense of looming doom.The scenes in Philadelphia and Israel were fantastic, they really made good use of the locations and the cinematography here. Great shots and a good sense of panic here in the scenes. However, when the movie went to Korea it was a bit anti-climatic. The military airport in Korea came off as something from a distant era. It was all dark and in small, enclosed areas most of the time. You didn't really have the sense of this was a military area in one bit. And when the movie took us to the viral facility in Ireland, well that was just great. Sure, it was in sterile rooms and long corridors lit up by florescent lights, but it worked so well.As much as I don't really consider myself a fan of Brad Pitt, then he actually did a good job in this movie. However, there weren't really any over-the-top performances in "World War Z" from anyone. People did good jobs with their given roles, but no one in particular stood out. The characters they portrayed, however, tended to come off a one-dimensional and you never really got to the heart and core of any of the characters. As such, they were very impersonal and could just as well just had been hollow caricatures.I am giving "World War Z" a 6 out of 10 rating, because it is a good action movie full of adrenaline, but there were gaps and holes in the storyline and continuity here and there. And also the running zombies didn't help to impress me. There are many beautiful scenes and really well-constructed scenes throughout the movie which makes the movie well worth watching. "World War Z" appeals to a wide audience, but in its attempt to get out to as many as possible, it fails to cater to the hardcore fans of the zombie genre.I should get around to reading the book, as I have been told that the movie deviates and strays far from the actual book upon which it is based.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I want to thank you to ads team of World War Z because on trailer, they don't show up the zombies too much and also to art team because during movies, they avoid the bloody scenes and edited the scariest moment of being bitten by zombies. Second opinion is the implementation of philosophy within it, the superpower philosophy, the salvation philosophy, and the sociology movement to destroy zombies cell. The most fascinating moment is when Brad Pitt as UN employee debates with all aspects of society, family, immigrant, zombies, supervisor, and virologists to persist something that he doesn't understand too much. So, as conclusion, World War Z is not only zombies film as cliché movies could have an envy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I wish to say having see this film then going home and playing Left 4 Dead 2 made it more enjoyable. That game is awesome already.But anyway yes this is not faithful to the source material. However I'm judging this as a film alone and not comparing it to the source material.Overall World War Z is an average movie. It doesn't deserve a 0 and definitely is not a 10 film either. The positive aspects are offset by the negative aspects. I left the cinema neither happy nor sad.Pros: good special effects, great scope of destruction, surprisingly good suspense.Cons: uninteresting characters, muse's repetitive use of one song to evoke emotion, plot holes, silly implausible ending.If you are really interested in seeing this film maybe you might enjoy it more than me. But don't expect too much</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many summer blockbusters, so little time. WORLD WAR Z is based on the first novel by Max Brooks, son of comedy legend Mel Brooks. I read his ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GUIDE with some relish (and learned a fire ax or pickax is the way to go), but have to admit I could not get through the stolid stylings of his first novel.Let me state right up front that I am an unreformed George Romero/slow-moving zombies fan. While not a leftist I thoroughly enjoyed his last two -- of the Dead flicks, almost wholly for the sociological/political subtext and use of self-referential media. As one who loathes post-modernism that is a strange statement to make, but I stand (lurch?) by it.Now we have WORLD WAR Z, a world-spanning epic of a fast-moving zombie plague. Decently directly but obviously re-shot, re-cut, re-everything (oh, those tagged on VO narratives, don't you love it - *cough* Blade Runner *cough*), this is as much a star vehicle for Mr. Angelina Jolie than merely apocalyptic soap opera.The movie starts out well, fast-paced and zombie-saturated from the git-go, hop-skipping from Philadelphia to South Korea to Jerusalem, but then comes to a roaring, screeching plane crash of a stop in Cardiff, Wales, at a WHO research facility. Here we have Brad Pitt and a super cute/super tough (if now one-handed) Israeli soldier (played by Daniella Kertesz; Hollywood PLEASE get this woman a starring role) lost in a vast medical building infested with the living dead. Just your basic night our at any big city emergency room, folks.Needless to say Brad saves the day and gets back to his loving family (who have been cooped up in a remote Canadian enclave since halfway through the picture). Now we get the VO narrative exposition, a montage of unused movie scenes, a promise of a sequel (since the zombie plague wasn't quite solved, you see). I don't think there will be a sequel. The movie is a lot of fun and keeps you on edge, but it is clear there was never any ending. Funny thing, writers (and producers and directors) are supposed to come up with endings for stories. It's kind of their vocation, you know?George Romero, still the master of this genre, taught us that all zombie flicks are about the human survivor, the human condition, and not how many people get eaten (or in WWZ, merely gnawed upon). The human condition is everything, not CGI effects or plastic cinematography (see my review of MAN OF STEEL for a rant against contemporary filmless-making). Brad's character's whole purpose is to get back to his wife and daughters. That's plenty enough for me. SPECIAL NOTE: Loved the cinematography of Jerusalem. Simply gorgeous. I hope this movie was shot on film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as i thought , but not as good as i'd hoped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off , I am a Zombie movie fan. I've seen a lot of Zombie movies and i'm a big fan of The Walking Dead. I've never read the book to this movie , so i don't have anything to compare in that regard. After watching the trailer to this movie , i have to say i wasn't entirely excited about it. The whole running/ant-like movement of these zombies didn't seem to fit what i like about zombie movies. This movie just looked like it was going to be just another action movie with zombies inserted in as the antagonist. I wasn't to thrilled about Brad Pitt playing the lead role either. I like Brad Pitt , he is a good actor , but just hard to see him in this role. So as you can see i had some mixed feelings going into this movie. Well after finally seeing the movie, there was one word that best described this movie for me - "incomplete". I felt like this was the beginning of a story (and perhaps it is). If i knew for certain that this movie was a part 1 of ? then the movie would have given me more closure. Overall still worth a watch in my opinion</fullReview>

More on that in a minute.

They walked right towards the building after the plane crash.. (LOL) Jerry is sleeping at the building when they arrive, and somehow, his satellite phone is charged and working after he wakes up (LOL LOL LOL) There is a part where a bunch of people are in a walled in city, zombies surround the outside. They know by now that noise attracts the zombies, so they play loud music (LOL) There is a scene where they are trying to sneak through a town and they are riding bicycles with Squeaky Wheels (LOL) Seriously... You can't make this stuff up... That is just 10% of what is wrong with this movie. To explain the rest, it would take an entire day of writingAVOID THIS MOVIE</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not the lamest Zombie ever. But for something which had such a big budget, it really sucked. Not because it was thinking movie. The Brad Pitt all over the world scenes weren't that terrible. Rather the idea that zombies can scale gigantic walls like ants and take down helicopters. Everything was absurd. Even the idea that someone could become a zombie in like 38 seconds. Utterly retarded. Any movie requires a certain willing suspension of belief. After all, a billionaire dressing up as a bat isn't really believable, is it? The difference between a good movie and a bad one is when no amount of suspension allows you to buy into the story. World War Z appeals to nonlogical thinkers who are not intelligent. I could not finish the film. Too much silliness. I'll never read the book because if this pile of crap came from the book after spending $190,000,000, how good could it be?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May contain a few spoilers, read this review with caution.As others have pointed out, this does not follow the book, I did have a problem with that; but what if it was standing on its own merit as a screenplay:The characters are not well developed, instead relying on action scene one after another. The people constantly make mistakes and don't learn from them. Oops, I stepped on glass, oops; I knocked over a soda can. The dog is barking at the door, let me press the button and open it, what could be inside. Let's all sing for joy in Jerusalem over loud speakers, obviously turned up to "11" on the volume meter. And the same scene over and over:1) What is going on? 2) Zombies are chasing me! 3) Zombies are over running the area! 4) Let's leave and go somewhere else where there are lot's of zombies! Yeah! 5) Rinse and repeat.By the end of the movie, I was hoping the people would get their dues and just die like everyone else. Max B. was smart to avoid this like the zombie plague.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Zzzzzzzz......Zzzzzzzz......Zzzzzz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted so much for this film to be good. I really did. Yet I knew, deep down in my core that, having seen the "swarming" zombies, it was going to be painful. It was, but not for the reasons the trailer suggested. In fact, the swarming, ant-like behaviour of the zombies is a minor thing compared to the rest of the this terrible, terrible film.1. Acting. I've never been convinced by Brad Pitt in any of his roles. He's the thinking man's cure for insomnia. Here, he seems to just not care enough to make an effort. He does his scenes and delivers his lines but he just flat out fails to be the "hero". I can't remember a film where the main character was so... uninteresting. He's just a nothing character and Pitt plays him without any emotion or energy whatsoever.2. Characterization. All of the characters are laser-cut out of cardboard, complete with little foldout bits to make them stand up. Such a bland, uninteresting bunch you won't find outside of an Asylum movie. The wife is helpless and annoyingly needy. The children were clearly told to just "scream a lot". Nobody else even gets that much development. It's awful because, without any character to the characters, you don't give a damn about any of them.3. Stupidity. There's a whole boatload in this film. Whether it's the nonsensical decision to send just a handful of soldiers with Pitt and the "expert" (tm) off on a mission even though there are assault carriers full of marines on hand, or the inane "invisibility" cloak that terminal disease conferred on the victims, this movie is dumb. Israel builds a wall around their entire country to keep the zombies out. Great! Except that they then don't bother to patrol said wall at all, allowing the stackable lego-zombies to scale the outside unimpeded. The zombies can sense ill people at a run and completely ignore them. Never mind that a sick dude could be bitten and pass on the virus just as well as a healthy person. Ah, but of course, the reason for that is...4. Plot-Driven story. These are always the weakest movies, because they force characters and situations in order to fit the plot. So in the above example, the reason the zombies don't bite sick folk is solely so that Arm Pitt can infect himself later on in the film in order to escape death at their hands. In other words, a terribly obvious plot device.The biggest indicator that a movie has failed to deliver, however, came when I found a minor character more interesting than the main character. In this case it was the Israeli soldier girl. Forget Pitt, she's the real star of the movie. But the fact that she outshines the main character is a clear sign that all is not well with the film.There's also no context in which to place the movie's events. You just get dumped straight in with no explanation of where the virus came from, or why, or how Israel knew to build a wall and so on.It's a mess, honestly, and tries to hide that fact behind action set-pieces and CGI effects with minimal success.With a better main star and perhaps a better written screenplay, it might have been engaging. As it is, it is a bit of a snorefest. Utterly predictable storyline and blatant plot manipulation do nothing to enhance its appeal.SUMMARY: There are many better zombie movies out there. And none of them have Brad Pitt in them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining zombie flick, but nothing more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z is a film about an Ex U.N. Soldier named Gerry Lane who, after being retired, suddenly finds himself in the middle of the zombie apocalypse along with his family. And the government's price for keeping his family safe, is Gerry Lane going back into action to investigate the source of the zombie virus.Now this film is nothing new under the sun, in fact it's basically a rehash of every zombie movie mashed together. You'll probably see most of the plot development from a mile away since other zombie films have already done it one way or another. The movie is basically following one format from one setting to another: hero goes to x place-&gt; hero finds a clue-&gt; complications rise-&gt; hero fights zombies-&gt; guy we just met dies-&gt; hero escapes-&gt; hero goes to y place because of the clue he found. And this happens from start to finish with every setting.Another big complaint is, that we don't get to see much of the so called "world war" yes we get a pretty good action scene in Israel, but man i wanted more based on the trailers. We're basically following Gary all the way and the movie suffers for it.And you could say: hey we don't get to see the war but at least we get good character development seeing as we're keeping so close to our main hero. Well i'm here to tell you it's not the case, Brad Pitt basically takes up 90% of the movie's screen time and yet his character is painfully underdeveloped, it's not even that it's bad, it's just that, if the movie focuses so much on ONE character at least develop him a little more. it would've been okay if we had more characters developed around the same depth as Brad Pitt but no, most of the characters we meet will have either 5 lines in the movie, or die right after we start to like them.What this movie manages to pull off well is: keeping you entertained. Most of the action scenes are pretty awesome and each has something different that make it entertaining. And i credit that to director Marc Forster, he managed to make a lazy script work, even if barely. He even toned down the shaky cam after the first action sequence which every action director likes abusing nowadays.(I guess he realized you don't need Michael J. Fox as your cameraman to make a zombie apocalypse chaotic) and he manages to bring out a decent performance from basically everyone. Even the most underdeveloped, two line characters do their jobs very well. Brad Pitt himself is giving a good performance , but nothing special since the role itself didn't really demand it. Even the children were less annoying than i'd expected.So if you like zombies and and great action, don't look any further. It's a decent flick, and you probably wont regret watching it, just don't raise your expectations too high.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review for fellow zombie movie fanatics ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z is a highly flashy sometimes entertaining film if critiqued exclusively in the vein of the mega budget summer blockbuster, however, World War Z is also perhaps the lousiest zombie movie ever made.Few fellow rabid fans of the flesh chewing genre 'Z' would argue against George Romero's 1968 'Night of the Living Dead' as the celebrated nascence of the zombie film. Forty-five years ago the dead stood up, up on the silver screen and took their first bite out of the living. Horror cinema has never been the same.George Romero had an idea about how to scare us, and much to our benefit and that of future horror film making, chose to tell us his terrifying tale in visual form. The zombie movie genre was born. What Romero did not have was a bottomless bank account from which to draw financing for his vision.With very limited funding, a small cast of talented actors, the cooperation of a local bureaucracy and a few dozen eager extras Romero crafted a horror movie, a zombie movie of intensity arguably yet to be bested in its situational creepiness.His original script trapped five characters together in a remote farmhouse as increasing numbers of the recently reanimated human dead closed in on the property cutting off their means of escape. In spine chilling imagery as unforgettable as the first time we viewed it, Romero explicitly, graphically showed us what the returned dead were after; what those shambling rigor mortis bound fiends craved. His story telling skill left no doubt in the moviegoer's mind what was at stake for the heroes if the living corpses brought them down.In the decades since Romero's original zombie vision nearly countless takes on zombie fiction in print and film have payed homage to his late 60's effort. We fans of the zombie movie have seen numerous shameless rip-offs of Romero's flesh hungry walking dead, and rarely, we have seen his original horror lore broadened or suitably developed with outstanding new imaginings of the ravenous risen dead. World War Z falls into neither classification as it is neither a new take on Romero's original concept, nor is it a blatant copycat.The template upon which World War Z the movie is fleshed out around is of the variety identical to that used for any massive budget monster, robot, virus or natural disaster blockbuster. The script introduces a small group of main characters, takes a very brief glimpse at their normal lives, and then unleashes upon their beautified world a wave of death and destruction that worsens minute by minute. Substituted for the aforementioned engines of global catastrophe in this case is zombies.Where Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' shoved the viewer into a claustrophobic, dark, desperate situation populated by edgy characters driven by fear, animal survival and deep seated prejudice, and then frame by frame used the walls of their very refuge, their last refuge, as vise grips cranked constantly inward on them by plot pacing, World War Z, in the vein of the generic summer blockbuster engine which drives it, trades world view, death statistic counters and impossible action sequences for the tense squirm-in-your-seat situational gloom, chills and suspense around which the concept of the zombie film genre has most always been tightly wrapped.Danger for, threat to the only protagonist classifiable as such (Brad Pitt's Gerry) in World War Z is only suspenseful before the film shows us who and what he really is. Pitt's Gerry Lane is a weakly imagined amalgamation of all five of the characters in Romero's Night of the Living Dead. Outside of a few brief and poorly written scenes that directly put his family in danger, he is the audience's sole connection to a story largely viewed from a global perspective almost as if the director had filmed the movie with an orbiting spy satellite.The audience is never right there in the thick of dreadful terror with Gerry Lane, rather the viewer is thrown into the action and "the action" is the major flaw here. Gerry Lane is a composite of a mercenary, a surgeon, a virologist and some kind of globe hopping diplomat. Building on that skill set the film uses him as a tactical genius, a crack shot - in short as whatever kind of caricature is required to survive whatever situation the script next writes him into.Unlike the many, many much better zombie movies that have come before it, World War Z gives us no sense of being trapped, stalked by the walking dead; no urgency of having to barricade ourselves into a fragile remote structure, no internal character conflict. In short, nothing much to indicate we are watching a zombie movie.We zombie movie fanatics have all seen the micro budget zombie film effort that tries so desperately (and often fails) to convey as much terror or originality as its funding will allow. But even in failure, the absolute most rotten of those made for a penny attempts at zombie cinema rise far above what World War Z has failed to achieve with a budget thousands of times higher.The Zombies. World War Z sells itself as a zombie movie. The reanimated dead have been visualized in many forms since Romero's 1968 masterpiece gave us pale, stumbling fiends whose real terror potential lied in small groups and the mind ripping fear you might recognize the one trying to eat you next as a friend or family member. In World War Z the zombies are superhuman sort of corpses who leap like cyborg frogs, make generic monster, monster movie sounds and use their heads for battering rams. Somehow these sprinting dead also swarm and climb like colonies of ants, and they do not eat the living.World War Z is zombie treason and heresy on high of Romero's vision.</fullReview>

I can't see Tom Cruise as a character other than Tom Cruise, so there is no sense watching a film with him in it. Now it seems, that Brad Pitt has adopted the same self-aggrandizing attitude to the detriment of the films, which he is in. This film was his production, his baby, so I place responsibility for its failure on him. This is basically a one person film on a global scale. Absolutely nauseating! If you want to see how a film like this is done properly, see James Cameron's Aliens. Although Sigourney weaver is the main actress, viewers are drawn in to the characters of at least six actors around her. Even the bloody robot is a more significant character, than anyone other than the star of WWZ. And the Israelis already have a wall to keep out the Palestinians, so I guess this film is inferring, that the Israelis see them as evil zombies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Useless and pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to see this movie. I really like sci-fi zombies, and I've always liked Brad Pitt. So what went wrong? This movie is a train wreck.The first ten minutes was pretty good, but after that? I read months ago there was several problems getting this product into the can, as they used to say, and the result is glaringly obvious.No plot. No character development. No consistency. No continuity. Brad Pitt's talents totally wasted as he mumbles and stumbles through scene after scene.I was left shaking my head about every ten minutes. The movie itself is a total mystery. It gives the viewer lots to watch from a CGI perspective, but doesn't bother to intrigue you with any kind of a story.Truly and totally disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And sadly another movie doesn't live up the unrealistic hype created! With the budget they had making this movie they should have spent less on unnecessary shots of the world and focused on making the "zombies" look believable instead of laughable! No kidding everyone in the movies were laughing like hyenas at the zombies, it turned into an unexpected comedy! And talk about a bloody predictable ending! Double yawn! Oh brad I think it's time you retired you just no longer got it. He acted as though he was bored the whole time! I love a good horror/action movie (give me resident evil anytime) but this movie just shows that with a large budget, a big star and creative use of media everyone expects it to be a big hit... Well big miss!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best zombie movie i have seen in a long time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World war Z is one of the best zombie movies I have seen in a really long time. The direction was fantastic. Probably one of Brad pitts best roles. The story line moved forward very well putting you on the edge of your seat wanting more and more as the film was rolling from start to finish. The zombies were vicious, the kind of zombies you want to see in a zombie film. The action and suspense in the movie were absolutely fantastic. Yes Brad pitts character is the only one you get to know, but with the way the film moved he is the only one that really need to know about. Definitely worth the watch it is in my opinion one of the best movies of the summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm surprised by all of the ridiculously harsh reviews, so often paired with 1 star votes, which I view as absurd. I'm sorry, no matter how bad this film is, it's a far cry from Johnny Mnenomic (and that piece of refuse has an average score of 5.3). Equally amazing is the percentage of reviewers who have been compelled to opine that 28 Days Later is a better film. Personally, I wasn't especially impressed with 28 Days Later, which was full of scenes where I found it especially difficult to suspend my disbelief. For example, there was one ridiculous scene in 28 Days Later, I recall, in which the protagonist et al, while trying to escape a mob of angry zombies, manage to drive over a pile of vehicles in a VW Beetle or some other compact car. So I guess my question is, why are these 28 Days Later fans nitpicking World War Z? Perhaps the gore factor wasn't high enough. Perhaps expectations were too high. Personally, it was nice to see a zombie movie where the director decided not to titillate our morbid curiosity with scenes of gruesome cannibalism. I also thought the special effects were brilliantly done, especially the scenes that took place in Jerusalem. Overall, I felt World War Z was a satisfying, fairly epic, action movie. Perhaps the people who hated it were looking for more horror--another Dawn of the Dead (reboot). I really do think the film, when viewed on its merits, warrants the current 7.2 rating on IMDb. Just wanted to make the point that WWZ is hardly as bad as some people are saying it is. It's actually pretty solid and I doubt you'll be bored watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re-imagines the zombocalypse but misses the heights of 28 Days Later.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's been much hoo-ha about Marc Forster's (Finding Neverland, Quantum of Solace) interpretation of Max Brook's novel, not least of all the, ah, 'restructuring' of the story but, here at last, we have the Brad Pitt zombie flick we've been waiting for.World War Z re-imagines the zombocalypse with an eye on Contagion and a hope of matching the brilliant freshness of 28 Days Later ? heck, Forster's even brought in Muse to blast some tunes across the bloodshed ? but though it entertains and occasionally re-imagines what zombies can and cannot do (and that's not a problem ? the vampires of 30 Days of Night are vastly different from Nosferatu and more frightening for it), it falls very far short of Danny Boyle's modern classic. In 28 Days Later we appreciate the devastation that has befallen the world as Cillian Murphy wanders through a deserted London with only pigeons and the husks of crumpled double-decker buses for company. The World War Z equivalent is Brad Pitt strolling along a short street of terraced houses somewhere in Wales. It's a pale imitation and, though far from clumsy, is inadequate.Inadequacy is the overall feeling of World War Z. It's enjoyable enough and has the occasional periods of tension, though most are given away in the trailer, and a few moments of magic. For my part, I loved the surging mountain of zombies attempting to breach the city walls in Israel but I wanted tension, I wanted to feel unnerved as well as excited. Alas, I was left wanting.Brad Pitt makes an able hero, as Gerry Lane, and he's believable as the dad who must return to the job he left with the UN to understand the cause and evolution of the disease that is wiping out mankind, in order to guarantee safety for his wife, Karin (Mireille Enos), and their children. The scripting is acceptable but there's a dearth of characters that really matter or that one can care about until the arrival of Segan (Daniella Kertesz) as a soldier Gerry acquires along his trek.Peter Capaldi, as a W.H.O. doctor brings a certain gravitas to proceedings but by then World War Z has stumbled into a reasonably predictable formula and, though Capaldi is a pleasure to watch, he's just another body carried along by the film.The occasional moment of genuine delight is marred by the odd example of clunkiness and the periodic travesty. World War Z may boast the best zombie mountain since the last one but it also shrivels under the glare of absolutely the most blatant, jarring, gratuitous product placement since Will Smith gushed over his Chucks in I, Robot: Tired of killing zombies? Why not relax against a drinks machine for a couple of minutes and pop yourself a Pepsi as the other survivors and the audience tick off the seconds and watch you? It's unnecessary and it convinced me to knock another star off the rating.World War Z is emphatically not as bad many people will have you believe. It's fun, it passes the time but, coming from Pitt and a director of Forster's caliber, it jolly well should be better!

		<fullReview>When i first seen the trailer i was geared up and waiting for it's release. When it finally came out and i rushed to see i was left underwhelmed. Maybe because i built it up so much in my head, or maybe because it just isn't that good. I gave it a 5 because it is an enjoyable film but it was often unintentionally funny and it felt rushed a lot of the time. Now before i upset a few people, i do like Brad Pitt. But this is one of the worst performances by a lead man i have seen in a while. He is almost like a robot at times. I in no way felt attached to his character, i felt no urge for him to succeed because he just didn't seem human. Even the infected had more emotion and they are just killing machines. Lastly, although the action and chase sequences are very good, it's what is in between that has summoned the additional Z's on my summary. There is no energy and as i said most of it comes across as funny rather than serious; look out for the angry infected who can't get her seat belt off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not The Best Of It's Genre But Acceptable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z, a zombie film with a big budget and has Brad Pitt as the leading man, it sounds excellent. Turns out it's only decent. I came into this film thinking it's a zombie film in a much more grand scale. Now that I've seen it, I now know that I came in expecting too much from it.This film was based off a novel of the same name, which I haven't read so I came into this blind in plot. The film's plot is quite straight forward and doesn't take a genius to understand the goal of Pitt's character but what made this film feel a little flat is the stakes. In a zombie or apocalypse film, usually there would be more than one guy that the film is following and with that focus, the characters then have a sense of weight to them if a soul is lost but in this film there isn't a lot of people to care about aside from Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt). I understand that this film shows a much bigger picture than intimate survival films like Dawn of the Dead but at least those films had characters that means more to us as an audience if they die. I see the tragedy and horror of the situation but these are people seen from a distance and they feel expendable. The film's ending may seem underwhelming but it makes sense as zombie films never truly have a defining conclusions, it usually ends with everyone dead or stuck somewhere hoping someone will save them. This film feels like the first step in fixing the issue and needs at least a second film to tie up the loose ends. The film though has it's strengths. I love that it still had it's suspenseful moments and that it didn't really focus on the killing for survival but rather the search for a cure in order to survive. Overall, the film's story feels like a mixture of Soderbergh's "Contagion" and Emmerich's "2012".Marc Forster has proved that he could make action with Quantum of Solace but so far his films with high amounts of action have been not so strong with it's core story and this film is another example but his work on the simpler dramas like Stranger Than Fiction and Finding Neverland seem to receive more positive responses. His efforts here is not horrible though, it's just not up there with his better films. I like the fact that the film has large moments, the attack on Israel, and frightening small moments, World Health Organisation in Wales. The film doesn't feel deep and with a film like this with such ambition, it would have benefited from it.The cinematography feels very generic and is an aspect of the film that won't be remembered. It does what it does, captures the image and creates some sort of tension, but I hoped for a film like this that it would be a little darker and moody.Beltrami's score was fantastic in films like The Hurt Locker and Resident Evil because they create this dark mood that supports the film. Surprisingly for a film that focuses on zombies, it feels more like a action film which at the same time is unsurprisingly as the moments with tension is very fast paced and exciting. The scenes at the WHO centre or the refueling of the plane was fantastic, the times where the film are at their most suspenseful and dark.I have no issues with the acting in this film, my issue is that the screenplay doesn't flesh out these characters enough that anybody besides Pitt could show off their acting range. Brad Pitt, as always is fantastic, but this type of film doesn't really try to challenge actors in showing their skills. The supporting cast were fine but wish was used a little more.Definitely won't be up there along with my favorite Zombie or Apocalyptic film of all time but it's good enough for me to watch again when it comes out on Blu-Ray or DVD just to pick up on things I may have not picked up in the story. I had fun though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not watch this movie in 3D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So my friends booked the tickets for this movie and for some reason they've booked the 3D-viewing one. It's such a long time ago I saw a movie in 3D at the theatre that I've forgotten how bad 3D really is, especially in this movie which doesn't seems to be made with 3D in mind at all. So if you like zombie movies and decide to see this one, see it in 2D.My only thoughts after the movie was: what a waste of talent! In my opinion Brad Pitt is an excellent actor and this movie didn't't do him any justice at all. His character is really boring and uninteresting and they could've used any other actor in the entire world instead of Pitt and it would still be as bad of a movie. The other characters are also rather boring and uninteresting and for the most of the time it's just Pitt running away from zombies.I'm not a big fan of zombie movies so I had literally no other expectations than the fact that this movie will suck, and so it did. So I can not say that I was disappointed, but they could've used another actor since the only reason that I went to see it was the name of Brad Pitt and in that case it would save me 2 hours with a worthless 3d-movie.And then there's the end(?). They find a way to "hide" from the zombies, basically making them invisible to them. When it was over I said to my friends: "So there'll be a second one?" and they said "no, zombie-movies end like this". So if you don't like zombie-movies you will leave the theatre without a proper conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Hollywood becomes the zombie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah... That's right: I've read M. Brooks' story (both in Portuguese and in English) and I loved it. Yeah... I'm a huge fan of living-biting movies, so I had great expectations. Yeah... Maybe I'm not the biggest fan of Pitt's. Sure these are very good reasons for how disappointed I was after watching this movie... But maybe the true reason is not the most obvious one.If I didn't like how the story flips and turns, if I wasn't convinced by the acting, if I missed some of the classic premises of the 'zombie genre' in this movie, maybe that's because Hollywood itself became a zombie a long time ago. It keeps moving, it keeps growling, it keeps interacting with audiences... but, most of times, you can tell Hollywood is not alive anymore. And that's exactly why, in my opinion, this movie fails.When B. Pitt got to snatch the rights of WWZ, we saw in his eyes that beautiful glitter of a kid's eye in a candy store. We anticipated the endless possibilities of a project built over the dream of a non-compromising fan, rather than over some bureaucrat's plan.But all the options, all the solutions, all the answers were the ones we've seen over, and over, and over again, from Hollywood great contemporary 'minds'. And... guess what?... We like to be surprised, we like to be challenged by different approaches, we are opened to new perspectives. We don't need the same old and comfortable pea soup...And this movie is a big fat disappointment. Plain and boring when it was easy to be something else...Maybe next time. In the sequel. Another dumb option.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast, pacey but not scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In todays 'Call of Duty' generation where viewers can't seem to go without action for more than 10 seconds, horror films have to be diluted into action spectacles. Removing the subtleties and tension that make films scary only creates a mindless action fest. World War Z follows Brad Pitts character as he travels around the world investigating the cause of a 'rabies' style outbreak which is turning people in fast, agile crazy people. The zombies themselves are more like rabid dogs, so calling them 'the undead' doesn't seem appropriate. The film relies on large CGI set pieces rather than tense and claustrophobic horror (although to its credit, the film does include some of this classic horror later on) In terms of characters, the film leaves them undeveloped and one- dimensional. There is potential, but the film would rather jump from place to place, feeding you the same formula each time without really giving you any deeper meaning or discussion.World War Z suffers from what many generic action films do - a huge VFX budget and a bland un-engaging script, designed to wow audiences with a flashy look but leaving very little food for thought or substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a disaster movie than an action or horror movie but it's not always a disaster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite zombies being a cult-hit for decades and decades and a favourite of indie filmmakers, it feels like only now it's hitting the mainstream. The last 12 months is already home to three of the top five zombie movies in the box office with Hotel Transylvania, Warm Bodies and now World War Z at number one. It was only a matter of time there would be a blockbuster zombie movie with a big star to sell it. If the concept of a blockbuster zombie movie is to simply to take it to an international and epic scale then that's enough to get me intrigued, if not excited. It's just a shame that it means the filmmakers can never make up their minds with what the damn movie will be about. World War Z throws us into the action with absolutely no investment into the characters at all then expects us to be excited. With it's inevitable PG-13 rating, it cuts from all the gore having the core problem that plagued The Hunger Games - it's about the one thing it's not allowed to show.I love Brad Pitt, I think he's a great actor and his wallet is especially great for contemporary indie cinema, he certainly did make the film much more watchable. The only reason I wanted to see this was to support him as the film reportedly had massive production problems. Unfortunately the problems are quite evident as some scenes feel cut short and simple and stupid. The problem with all these new zombie movies is that each one has to set up the world and each time it's dull. The last zombie movie that did it efficiently was Shaun of the Dead and the last movie that worked was Zombieland which completely sidelined the origin of the zombies and was much better for it. Granted, World War Z does have some good ideas I liked scattered around such as Pitt's character going to commit suicide if he turned into a zombie and North Korea removing everyone's teeth. But the flaws definitely outweigh them. The amount the protagonist survives and the contrivances to get the plot to where they want it is a bit much. Characters seem to react in quite unrealistic ways, a very clear trope of a blockbuster with no focus. But at the very least it's consistent.I keep forgetting that Marc Forster is essentially a director-for-hire. He impressed me far too much with Stranger Than Fiction that his output before and after is dishearteningly disappointing. As Quantum of Solace proves, he can't direct action. I didn't like the cinematography here, it's too hand-held and washed out whereas I wanted something cinematic. I actually quite liked the epic shots of the zombies, particularly the one where they clamber over each other to get over the great wall. It was only until the small scale third act that it was saved from being mediocre. While the action/setpiece scenes did admittedly get better and better by a little bit, it was only until the end when the film had suspense. Perhaps it was due to the context of the adventure that preceded it where the stakes felt high to the audience that made it better, but I definitely thought it brought the whole film to being at least average. World War Z is technically a disaster movie and not an action or horror movie and it's at its best when there isn't much disaster.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War 'Z' ? should've been World War 'Y'?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie for me, most of the times is either good or bad or somewhere in between. Very few movies evoke a response like, Why? Though I have been contemplating writing a review ? a friend suggested I should write one if I completely wanna crash it.Now we all know that World War Z stands for a future war to prevent extinction of mankind and 'Z' for the obvious reasons meaning Zombie. But coming back to my point why World War Z should have been called World War 'Y' ? Lots of 'Why' in my head after the watching this Brad Pitt Production.'Y' did Brad Pitt produce such a movie especially after the his last highly acclaimed production Moneyball?'Y' did Brad Pitt act in such a movie?'Y' did the World War Z happen and how did the zombies come about spreading like an epidemic?'Y' on earth the zombies or the "UNDEAD" who are on a mad warpath totally able to annihilate some of the finest armies of the world?'Y' is there a sermon by some scientist about mother nature being a serial killer and some other philosophical bullshit which virtually has no context to what is happening?'Y' does Brad Pitt manage to keep his cool and look hot 'n' sexy despite being in a life ending accident, mauled by Zombies, surviving a sure- shot death air crash and still be the only one to come with answers?'Y' most importantly when we have so many uber-cool villains, technologically advanced aliens and our home grown vices did the production team had to depend on a 1980s lame formula of introducing funny faced Zombies to end our existence? Surely, we as a race deserve a more worthy nemesis.'Y' could not the movie start with a much stylish origin and end with the good guys winning ? it is just horrifying to think that they might be cooking up a sequel to it.'Y' was the climax (like a friend suggested) straight out of Michael Jackson's thriller video and the audience couldn't help but laugh even in such a grave situation?'Y' ??????. ?Just look out for Brad Pitt in the movie ? oh wait ? there is no one else you'll see so don't worry about it.The flip side to it is, spend 116 minutes in an AC cinema hall in this sweltering heat and enjoy the 3-D effects if you must.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie needed Abbott and Costello or The Three Stooges.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two types of movies: those with strong endings and those with weak endings. This movie is in the latter category. The movie starts strongly, presenting an apocalyptic picture of humanity in crisis. The cause of the problem - a disease - seems intractable and how it impacts on humans most alarming. Then the story loses steam and what has been scary becomes laughable, and the movie soon devolves into an unintended comedy. One problem is that the mysterious disease itself is too en debilitating to transform its victims into ogres. Their jerky motions and emaciated bodies create an image of illness, not horror, and soon the movie seems to be spoofing illness. After a while, the movie takes on the mantra of slapstick comedy as the people are running around frantically, going hither and yon, making lots of noise and accomplishing nothing. In some scenes, this movie more resembles a Mac Sennett production. People, some dead, others alive, colliding into one another, making all kinds of noises and gesticulations. At that point, the presence of Buster Keaton would have helped. Instead, the audience gets Brad Pitt whose character is grimly determined to set things right, and his solution is ... well, let's just say it is a novel one, even for Hollywood. The scary people, or rather non-people, after a while lose whatever scariness they project as they demonstrate a talent for dancing a jig, which one could call The Twitch, and producing an interesting array of sounds denoting an acoustical form of communication akin to that of whales. They also have protruding teeth which may offend people with dental problems, especially those with upper-bite issues. Introduce Abbott and Costello into the story and you have an amusing comedy; with the Three Stooges a comedy classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chix Cat on File review: Aggressive zombie infestation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer made World War Z look like the zombie population had gone extreme, with them developing the new talent of running. What an unfair advantage now in their favor considering the lumbering gait was the only thing that provided some level of protection for the human race. This year has been evolutionary for the zombie, since we now also know from Warm Bodies that there's even zombie love. There is some consistency in what has been the recent approach to zombification, it starts with some fatal contagion, not like the good old days when a vampire enslaves a human which keeps the numbers low, or a voodoo casting or the result of some improperly contained hazardous chemical, now everything is a virus run rampant. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is a United Nations employee and is reactivated to track down the invading agent and try to figure out how to stop it. I don't know what UN employees do and after this film I still don't. There was a segment where Gerry is sent to accompany mankind's best hope for finding a cure and I'm not sure if he was supposed to be some level of protection but the situation just got direr rather than better. My favorite aspect about the story aside from Mr. Pitt of course is what puts the human race at its greatest disadvantage, the speed of the zombies. The special effects that allowed for them to climb atop each other and perform record breaking tackles added to the intensity. Although the movement and feel seemed very similar to the creations from I Am Legend, it was still rather chilling to watch as the human race was quickly being annihilated. My biggest complaint about the story is that I left the theater with no greater insight into what was the intrusive culprit than I had already gathered from the previously mentioned trailer that it's a contaminating virus with unknown origins and is aggressively spreading. I did not find this story particularly scary but it did pass my 3-D test, yes I flinched, actually a few times. I just kept thinking keep that guy Gerry away, because it just seemed that wherever he was the zombie infestation grew. That may not have been the reality since the problem was supposedly worldwide, but as good as Mr. Pitt looked as 'every man', he was bad luck for everybody except himself. I liked the film, but felt as if too much was given away in the trailer, therefore I give it an amber light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "A" zombie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it can be called an "umbrella genre", zombie movies is likely the one that boasts the largest number of variations, from hair-raising horrors to side splitting funnies. What's more, like the zombie mutation, it doesn't stop growing. A recent one, "Warm bodies", blossomed into romance territory in the proud Shakespearean tradition: "rom-zom-com"? Now, zombies have elevated themselves from the hitherto "B" movie existence to a huge budget "A" blockbuster.It takes someone like Brad Pitt to pull this off, and it has taken him over six years, purportedly. Although the movie has a sizable cast, it is essentially Pitt's one man show, where he plays a UN investigator globe-trotting to find the source, and a cure, for this epidemic of global proportion. Don't be late. Before you can blink twice, a normal big city traffic jam erupts into pandemonium when the zombie attack starts without any preliminaries. After an exciting sequence that will have you at the edge of your seat, the protagonist and his wife and daughters are air lifted to a military control centre comprising a flotilla of warships from which he is sent to various locations around the world on the aforementioned mission. This is in essence the movie, the details of which I am not going to elaborate.Before looking at the actors, let us look at (literally) the zombies. Compared with their counterparts in other movies too many to mention, the zombies in WWZ are among the least terrifying to look at. You may even see objects resembling them in a normal after-work rush hour subway ride. There is also a conspicuous absence blood and gore. What makes them terrifying here is speed and sound ? lightning speed matched by, unlike in the normal physical phenomenon of thunder-and-lightning, a spontaneous audio assault that make your heart stop. The set pieces are all impressive, but the one that everybody mentioned is the high walls build around Jerusalem which reminds me of a similar wall in aforementioned "Warm bodies" which in turn reminds you of the one in "Game of thrones".Brad Pitt basically carries the entire movie. While there is a large supporting cast, they do no register as memorable. Two women however deserve mentioning. Mareille Enos plays his wife who after the initial sequence, interacts with our protagonist only by phone. You would wish that she is given more screen time. Comparatively, you see more of Daniella Kertesz playing a professional Israeli soldier in a role of his action sidekick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Brad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The review: This movie is tough to classify into a genre. I'm not even sure what genre I would say it fits into. It has some elements in common with popular zombie movies like "28 Days" and "Dawn of the Dead", such as moments of complete silence and suspense and then utter surprise, screeching, and shock when the attack comes. There are also some elements of war movies and crisis movies. The zombies in this film are like none I've ever seen in a movie before and probably because of the limitations of visual effects previously. They are fast, swarm in packs, flail about recklessly and did I mention fast? The movie moves at a moderately fast pace for the most part, especially the scenes involving the zombies. It seems like there is some drama and conversation, then some foreshadowing of some sort, a noise, or something strange that happens, and then cue multiple zombies coming hard, and coming fast. Gerry Lane is a man working against time, working to get back to his family, and working to save mankind. The gravity of the end of mankind isn't really felt in the movie. I think the trailer actually stressed the dire nature of the outbreak and the end of mankind better. Gerry first arrives on a military aircraft carrier with his family during the crisis and doesn't want to leave, but after he gets an ultimatum that his family would no longer be welcome if he doesn't help, he and a tactical seal team of three and a doctor travel to find the cause of this virus. I think it goes without saying that the whole team does not survive, and their demise doesn't take long either. Soon Gerry is forced to make multiple alliances with various strangers and allies to figure out the source, a weakness, or some revelation to help the "good guys". In this formula are the strengths and weaknesses of the film. It helped the film because it made everyone expendable, and Lane entered and exited each location in style and either very quietly or with guns blazing and usually ended up leaving with thousands of zombies in pursuit. It was also a weakness because Lane (Pitt) suffered a bit from "McClane" syndrome. He is incredibly lucky, almost dies many times, but never quite is affected enough by the crazy attacks, crashes, or explosions. There are no cynical, sarcastic remarks made though about mortality or the bad guys like we usually get from Bruce Wills however. It's also odd that Lane is the "only" hope and we don't see the leadership talk about back up plans, anything else that is happening, or what will happen when Lane fails to come through. Are there other people doing the same job or is everyone else mindlessly firing at swarms of zombies? Overall I think the tone, length, dialogue, effects, etc. work well. Some things could've been stressed more with a longer run time, but limiting some of this broadens the audience and makes it slightly lighter if this type of movie can be light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that the development of this was a mess. What mattered to me were three things done well:The transition from normal life to the human waves was jarringly effective. What I expect is a traditional zombie story. Some explanation and setup is given for the impending invasion and then we encounter the unrelenting but slowly moving threat. Here, we have a different formula: one we have tested with Tom Cruise and Will Smith: we are involved in everyday tedium and then bang! Explanations come later.How do you innovate with this, make it more compelling? You leverage the effect mentioned in a moment. A tsunami builds. No one knows what is happening. You only know that people are desperate to flee at any cost and the panic is the initial horror. What could cause this? The pacing is perfectly timed to outrun our ability to absorb what is going on, just as it is for our on- screen folks.Even in the midst of this shared confusion, we note that our hero has a different relationship to panic. (We know he is the hero only because he is Brad Pitt and that this film is produced by him for himself). He alone seems to absorb what is happening faster than anyone else, including us. We see him notice without knowing what he is understanding.This is the highest level of craft, it seems to me, focused on the hardest part of the story, the beginning.A second notable feature is what got this movie made, I suppose. The threat, at least in the first 2/3 of the movie, the original bits, is not zombies but zombie waves. Elsewhere I have written about using architectural water as a threat. A major advance was Perfect Storm and later Titanic where water could be given behavior, personality. Then we had Hereafter, where Eastwood directed a tsunami with intent.What we see here is mobs rendered as flows, and the CG processes being those used for water working against gravity. There is genius in this as well, and a genuine advance in the art. (This comment is on the two-d version. I cannot see how a three-d-ization could improve anything.)We also have a couple sections of good writing (noticed by my writer partner). These are placed where we expect to hear boring exposition, something about military labs or space probes. Something dreary but necessary. The first instance is with the Harvard genius who we are told is our best hope for understanding. he gives a speech instead about the capricious weakness of violent nature. It is a magnificent short speech, and then this last hope is dispatched.The second great hope is also a trope: the Jewish doctor. His speech is well crafted as well. It runs against what we expect from the genre; no exposition. It also runs against what we expect from the WASPy Harvard guy. It is instead a meditation on perception, something which furthers the (at that point still undeveloped) special power of our hero.This thing falls apart in the ordinary challenge of wrapping up a story. You can tell where a weak last third was pasted on. Now the zombies become individuals again and the storyline stops countering the genre. This is tense in the traditional way and works, but is far from the skill level of the earlier decisions which placed us in a new place concerning our view.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Meth not even once" campaign</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked the Israeli self-defense plan. I could be that tenth man! My best asset is going against all conventions and just gumming up the works. I see this movie as a way to glom onto the zombie fad, and to take a quick bite out of the lucrative undead market which is wandering the world.I noticed that these zombies have perfect teeth as humans, then at the instant they get a little nip on their bum, from a colleague or a family member, they turn into a 36 month chronic crystal meth fiend, with their teeth all cracked, chipped, blackened and rotten. What's up with that? I certainly understand wearing down the enamel after a few weeks of gnawing the man-flesh, but, not in the moment of undeath. Honestly, the true value of this film could be to use it as a PSA for "Meth not even once" campaign. It was interesting to find out that these poor meth heads won't bite sick people. Really??? They smash there crania into windshields &amp; plate glass windows. They jump from the roofs of high rises. They climb onto moving planes, trains, and automobiles. They make themselves stepping stones for their fellow undead to climb and crush them under the weight of thousands. Yet, they won't dare to take a taste of Brad Pitt with meningitis? That's just not plausible. Most of the women I know and a couple of the men, would "die" for an opportunity to get a hunk of Brad Pitt. Am I wrong?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel is being planned, but if it's any worse than this installment, count me out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"World War Z" (15) Director: Marc Forster. Starring: Brad Pitt, Mathew Fox and James Badge Dale. Rated: 15 for containing sustained threat and strong violence. Running time: 116 minutes. Out now, in UK cinemas.Former UN representative Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) must travel the world in a race against to find the cure to the zombie apocalypse and return to his family all in one piece. Originally a best selling book written by Max Brooks, "World War Z" is (supposed to be) a story told from different accounts of people during the great Zombie War. The film version is completely different, just featuring on one character and his struggle to find a cure. "World War Z" (in my opinion) fails completely. To call itself a horror film would be a lie, in fact you could possibly call it a cuddly version of so many zombie films we have seen in the past. One of my concerns, is that it wasn't gory enough. It is almost like the film company weren't sure which age group they were aiming for, so they cut out all of the gore to play it safe. After all, what is a zombie film ,without a splash of gore? The action is almost comical, with set pieces as large as I have ever seen before completely put to waste. The special effects were fairly decent, but become boring after so long. However when they have the invasion in Jerusalem, they work quite well, with zombie hordes climbing an insanely tall wall. The acting, is shallow; even for Brad Pitt's standards and leaves the viewer with the impression, that nobody really cares for this production.Personally, I feel that the real reason for the failure of the film was the time, the production spent in development hell. There really is little to praise in the film, except that "World War Z" works well as an action film, but falters on the concept of the zombie apocalypse. A sequel is being planned, but if it's any worse than this instalment, count me out.2 STARSWritten by Scott Gentry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really --- Aren't You Sick of Werewolves, Zombies, and Vampires YET?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Brief Prelude:Kids were laughing about werewolves, zombies, and vampires by the 1940s -- is there really anything more to any of them? They've done them 'scary'. They've done them funny. They've even done them as mysteries, romances, and even *shudder* musicals. So the best I can figure is, as with gross-out comedies, producers keep making them for teens and brainless people (yes, I got taken in, too) to waste money on.Case in point, World War Z. Plus: Brad Pitt is in it. Minus: Script, Acting, Plot, DirectingMy excuse? I took a chance because Brad Pitt makes interesting movie choices -- mostly. Wrong decision by both of us, in this case. Frankly, I find it very difficult to justify wasting even more time to go deeper. Suffice it to say that if you enjoy watching flashbacks of survivors (a la Blair Witch jigglecamery) telling you how scary it all was, or if you enjoy seeing Saganistic "billions and billions" of fractalized zombies crawling around -- this tripe is for you. For the rest of us, we've been seen and heard all this before. Dreck!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceeded Expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will be the first to admit that I was very skeptical going into this movie. When headlines broke that extensive re-shoots would cause it to be delayed six months, I lost almost all faith. I found myself suckered into seeing it, and I now have no regrets. It wasn't nearly the best film of the year, but it was enjoyable. Following Brad Pitt's portrayal of Gerry Lane was a thrill, as the supporting cast of humans and zombies alike created a tense atmosphere in every new location that was explored. The acting was fine, although I'm still unsure why Matthew Fox was even in the film. Truthfully, Gerry's wife didn't have much of an impact on the film either. Brad Pitt was the obviously the star, but the zombies were a close second. Their speed and strength reminded me of the infected people in 28 Days Later, another "zombie" movie I recommend. Whenever you can throw together a nice amount of suspense, solid acting, and intimidating zombies, your recipe is a success. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not your typical Zombie movie-really excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was fantastic. Friends, family, and co-workers who had seen this had told me to not waste my money going. Which meant that I HAD to go. As a zombie fan this was a nice change of pace from the violence and gore typical of recent zombie films. Even such comedies such as ZombieLand were more about the fear factor or blood spattering gore than actual story line. And those that do have a story to follow like The Walking Dead go out of the way to be gory for the sake of gore. WWZ doesn't need the gore to keep your attention.***Spoiler**** This was a film more about investigating rather than a run, shoot, and kill as much as you can. Much of the film is spent either running from, sneak past, or otherwise avoiding zombies and only engage if no other option. Those expecting something like "Rambo vs Zombies" is going to be disappointed. Now there was a lot of shoot'em up, explosions and MASSIVE amounts of zombies, but it was not part of the main story line. Most of it was happening in the background and around the main story only intersecting sometimes where clues were hidden in the may-lay but not to the point that it distracted from the story. This is a medical pandemic movie that happens to have zombies as the medical crisis. However, like most zombie movies, the movie ends at the beginning of the problem and no solution to the problem at hand, only band-aids and the hope for a sequel.Now notice that up till now I have not mentioned the book. The reason is that books and movies are NEVER repeat NEVER comparable. If you like a book, DON'T go see the movie based on it, you will ALWAYS be disappointed. Movies are not books and books are not movies. For the morons whining about it not being as good as the book, they would be better off going and reading another book and stay out of the theaters. As you can tell, I dislike those who badmouth movies for not following books. But with few exceptions (can count the number of exceptions on one hand with 3 fingers left over), movies never live up to books and shouldn't have to, they are different for a reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie should have a different title. Pandemic: the rise. would have been better, Its not world war z. This is nothing like the novel or the absolutely amazing audio book of the same name. congratulations to max brooks with his six figure deal to sell the name, and none of the original ideas. SPOILER ALERT!!!This movie has problems. 1: speed of infection. ranging from 10 minutes to 12 seconds there is no way the airports could have been the perfect vector. the infected would have wiped out the airport before the planes left. 2: fluid virus spreads by all fluid. the blood in the mouth would have meant instant infection. bite alone is stupid. 3: even dead they are not dead. so a bite makes you immortal? the burned one's were still moving and they were ash? 4: the zombies all make the same noise that sounds like if you tried to suck in a fart while clenching. fart scream. 5: horde running at you. don't worry. if your a main character they only attack one at a time the rest Waite their turn and don't really use their arms. 6: a bolt action hunting rifle holds three to five rounds. not infinite. 8: those kids! what the hell. I have never seen a more irritating family in a fast paced thriller. Its worse then asthma girl in panic room! 9: who the hell is Brad Pitt in this movie? investigator, weapons and evasive driving expert, instinctively knows how to operate most vehicles. knows military operating procedure and they treat him like jams bond and archer had a baby. but hes a stay at home dad in his mid 40's? how much drugs did he sell on the job to make that happen?my advice. avoid this zombies for tweens Brad Pitt flick and go watch something good. or sneak into a theater at night and stare at the dark screen alone. its scarier and you would have more funthis is really the hangover 2 of zombie films. lots of build up, lots of let down.how this movie has seven stars just shows how rigged the rating system is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Zombie Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best zombie movie ever made up to this point. Really, nothing more needs to be said. Watch it, you will not be disappointed. Some seem to be disappointed because the movie doesn't perfectly follow the book it's based on. I haven't read the book so I don't care :) From a completely unbiased perspective I loved it. I am someone who is addicted to zombie movies and other post-apocalyptic thrillers. I've seen them all and typical of genre aficionados I nit pick them to death. There really isn't much to nitpick about this one. The acting is great, characters believable, and things are visually pleasing, it's really not gory at all, and the plot is smart and makes sense. The movie is unique in that it's quite believable. For example, it doesn't have the typical zombie pitfalls of not explaining common sense things, like, why people getting splashed by blood aren't being infected. Not saying holes can't be poked in some of the science, as much as one can expect from a zombie movie, however, it made sense. Watch and enjoy.</fullReview>

The movie as a whole is focused AROUND the Zombie Apocalypse instead of being focused ON it too much. The imminent threat is being felt throughout the Movie yet the zombies aren't pushed into the spotlight too much and to achieve the right balance is a hard thing that World War Z pulls off in my opinion. Seeing how different places deal with the Zombie outbreak is interesting yet not too long so it doesn't become boring. All in all a very well done Interesting movie that finally does something different in the genre instead of just "shoot em zombies".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally broke down and saw this high budget zombie film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me awhile to finally go and view this movie. I had gone back and forth on rather or not I would see it during the past few weeks. At first, I was going to see it as I like zombie films and this was one with a huge budget. However, the fact it starred Brad Pitt made me iffy (not a big Brad Pitt fan). Then I saw some trailers and I was a bit more excited, until I saw the film was rated PG-13. At that point it was a no go as I just thought a zombie film should be R. After seeing several people on Facebook say they enjoyed the film I decided I would see it and it turned out to be a rather good zombie film. Granted, I still say it would have been better rated R as I could tell by the editing that there will be an unrated DVD version.The story has a man and his family having breakfast and going about their daily routine. My thinking at this point was that the film was going to take a while to get going. However, the family is not in the car for too long before explosions begin to occur within the city and people are fleeing in a panic. Finally, people begin attacking other people and the zombie outbreak has begun! It is up to Gerry (Pitt's character) to help a man try to discover what is the source of this horrid outbreak, however things do not proceed as planned. Gerry goes to South Korea, Israel and what I believe was Germany in the hopes of finding a source of the outbreak or at least some way to combat it.The effects are pretty good, once again I think they should have just released the film with an R rating. My guess is though with such a huge budget they decided that they needed as many people as possible going so that is why they ended up demanding cutting the film so it would be PG-13. Pitt does okay and the movie as a whole does a great job creating tension. For the next couple of weeks, every time I hear a door slam or something squeak I will remember this film. The film had more action than I was led to believe it was going to have, but I do have to say the scenes in Israel are the best as the zombies find very creative ways to get to their prey! So I did enjoy this film a good deal. It was nice to see something at the movies that was not a sequel or remake. The film throws you into the action quickly as it does not linger long on Gerry's home life. Near the end it turns almost into a stealth movie as there is a lot of sneaking around. It ends in a way that suggests there could be a sequel at a later date as things are far from resolved. If so, I will probably see it as well.</fullReview>

I hope that budget included production of the video games, 'cuz the movie seems like an add.If you've ever wanted to watch something which is a mix of Dawn of the Dead (with less suspense and no horror), Sean of the Dead (without the humour) and Mission Impossible (with less plot) then this is the movie for you!Some of the action was OK, Marc Forster's cinematography was sometimes fantastic and Brad Pitt (in autopilot mode) was pretty good. Shame that the result is a zombie movie which didn't focus on the zombies, a suspense thriller (without any real surprises and almost no suspense) and a comedy (unintentionally). Additionally it's based on a book with a decent social commentary message, none of which is in the movie.Perhaps the same producers will put out "50 Shades of Grey" next; a PG-13 rated humorous version.</fullReview>

I watched the movie in 3D, which is a complete waste of money. No need to watch it in 3D. The plot is very thin. So there is a zombie-outbreak and this UN guy (played by Brad Pitt) is for some unclear reason appointed as the guy who must solve the problem. To do that, he travels first to South-Korea and then to Israel. Both trips are completely useless, except to keep the story going and give the UN guy the opportunity to get the solution in his head. This solution is totally irrational unless you have some solid evidence. None is given in the movie and so it is a totally irrational idea coming out of nowhere. Then the UN guy goes to Whales, solves the problem and the movie is over. There is no depth to the characters.The zombies are not cool in this movie. Compared to the Walking Dead or the George Romero movies, they are just dull. There is no gore in this movie, which makes it even less interesting to watch. Zombies in this movie are just very fast moving, CGI generated swarms of slightly disturbing-looking creatures. Then: the UN guy can communicate by cell-phone with his wife on board of a ship all through the movie, but he has to travel all the way to South-Korea and Israel to find that the persons who are supposed to know something actually don't know anything. Why not just call by phone as well?Don't see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know when I first heard the budget of this film,it really astonished me. Due to it's high cost,I decided to take a look. Ya,it didn't disappointed me,as the scene of the end of world is perfect. Chaos,complete destruction...etc,which explain it's high cost. Most of all,abundance of zombies running is really really frightened and excited. Due to it's ending,many remarks have criticized this film harshly. For sure,I was a little bit disappointed at the end of the film,but if we inspect the film thoroughly,you would realize that this ending was not that bad. The end of the world is easy for film to start it,but to end it is hard. For human,if our world really suffered the disease like this,as the film,we might find the solution,but to restore the world should take hundreds of years. Therefore,for the film,it is really hard to use the rest of few minutes to end the story,few minutes is difficult to represent hundreds of years. If you try to feel the movie like this,you would eventually consider World War Z to be a nice film. Undoubtedly,it's high cost is really worth a ticket. Take a look,my friends. Thank you for reading my idea,I would be grateful if you try to discuss more about the film with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say I was very impressed with this film, I like Zombie films but many recent attempts are the same old same old. 28 days later was probably the last zombie film I really thought highly of.World War Z has just been added to this list, it sort of tears up the rule book on what we know and creates a whole new aspect to the zombie genre. The film gets moving very early on and we initially follow the Lane family as the zombie outbreak hits the City. From here Gerry Lane (Pitt)is reunited with the United Nations in an attempt to stop the outbreak and find a cure. We follow him to South Korea in a dark wet and eerie setting that has some very cool and intense moments. We then head to Jerusalem with an epic daytime Zombie attack which is one of the most intense things I have ever seen in a Zombie film, the pace is frenetic at times and while the plausibility may present a few issues, it is shot in a way that takes you right into the action an leaves you with little time to think. From there Gerry finds himself in Wales after a brilliant Zombies on a plane moment. The climax ends in a more sombre and intelligent way and while it does provide a nice Hollywood ending it does also provide a bitter sweet moment for the hero of the day. The film is highly entertaining and moves at a fast pace and provides scares and jumps as well as some great action scenes with just enough narrative and story to keep things moving along. The 3D in this film is not so great ( virtually non existent ) I'd recommend watching in 2D as some bits seemed harder to see in 3D ( for me anyway ). I will definitely be watching this again and will go into my top 5 zombie films based on the fact it does something new with the genre. 8/10 x</fullReview>

Then I read a little about the movie, watched the commercials, and noticed that it would be nothing like the book. And it isn't. It's a whole new zombie story in itself with the only similarity with the book being the title. The movie is decent, but it's nothing special. In the first half of the movie, they throw everything they've got at you and the last half felt like they got bored when writing the story line. It felt like it was only a 45 min. movie and left me wanting more. And not in a good way. The acting is decent, the sets are believable, and the writing is...alright. I only found one thing laughable in the movie and that was the Pepsi product placement. If you enjoy zombie movies and are wanting a new one, I'd recommend this to you. Just keep in mind that the movie is nothing like the book. It's a zombie story all on it's own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Big Zombie Movie In Several Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been several years since the last big zombie movie. 'The Walking Dead' kind of took over the whole zombie franchise with their mind-blowing series. Anyway, 'World War Z', just like 'Man of Steel', was brought up to be huge. When it went into the box office it immediately made millions of dollars because of all the fans that have been waiting for it to come out for several months. So, anyway, the pressure is on. Here's what I thought about 'World War Z'.It started out moving very fast and flying through scenes, which disappointed me a little. I enjoyed that there was action, and that it didn't take forever, but it just went by too fast. Well, a few scenes after that I realized that they had a reason to go fast: They needed time to build up to the action. The reason I realized that is because it started to go really slow and bored, so 'World War Z' didn't start out that well in my opinion. It needed to redeem itself in the rest of the movie, which it actually did.So, at this point, I had no idea what to expect. I was wandering what was going to happen and how it was going to end. Soon after this, though, what I thought was the coolest part of the movie came up. It was scene where in the previews there were 100s of zombies climbing up on each other up to a wall. That part was in a huge context, well explained, and had a very entertaining and exciting action sequence. I truly loved that part. Also, shortly after that, there was another very cool scene, but then the slowness came back, which is what this movie is: Action, then slowness, action, then slowness. I thought that was okay, but I didn't expect the movie to be like that.There was something in this movie that was interesting. This was the use of the word 'zombie'. Most other zombie movies or television series' don't say zombie. They say 'walker', 'infected', 'diseased'... etc. In this movie the use of the word 'zombie' comes up every now and then. I thought it was kind of cool because no other movie that I've seen about zombies have said it, other than 'Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies', which was terrible. No other monster movies have restricted saying the word of what we call them. Vampires, werewolves, giants, robots, etc. I also thought that in these zombie movies of television series', they wouldn't live in a world without zombie comic books and shows and movies.Near the end of this movie it was getting really slow, and I thought, "Come on now, pick it up." The movie was starting to lose its good points from me... Well, when it got to the end, there were very interesting and entertaining things. It wasn't really action, so you'll see when you see the movie. That part kept me on the edge of my seat, though. There was a lot of suspense in that part. It eventually turned into an action scene, which was cool. Anyway, after that, there was a bit of a twist, which I really liked. Then, the movie started wrapping up, and when the movie stops, it kind of just stops. I was thinking, "Whoa, I guess it's just... Over." My 8/10 rating means that I thought 'World War Z' was really good. I very much recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing but not terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z has been talked about in critics' circles for over a year now; it was widely publicised that the project went through development hell, there were several re-writes and re-shoots of the ending. All of this, plus the fact that it was given a mere 15 age rating, meant that most zombie horror fans and fans of the book were worried.Max Brooks' novel is in a format that would be almost impossible to convert into a faithful film adaptation. It was always going to be tough but World War Z is an adaptation in name only; there is hardly anything derived from the book included here with exception to some film locations and the decision to just call the zombies 'zombies' rather than walkers, biters or any other name that films and TV shows have done. The political satire has been left out (it is hinted that the virus began in South Korea rather than in China) and the film takes place at the beginning of the war rather than ten years after it. These decisions have been made with the best intentions, to make the film more entertaining. This is a good idea but, as with any book adaptation, it will anger fans of the source material. The movie chose to jump right into the chaos so there was no suspicious news reports of riots in distant towns, and Brad Pitt and his family were completely surprised when they found ordinary people trying to have a chomp at them. The fact that World War Z is not an 18 is a very poor studio decision; the main terrifying feature of a zombie is their ability to tear people to shreds, the result of this would obviously be a lot of blood and gore. There are several scenes of people being bitten, people being shot and even one scene where someone has their hand amputated to prevent the spread of infection ? none of these scenes contain a drop of blood. Luckily, the zombies are still quite creepy; the sound of their teeth snapping at people is really unsettling and the way they twitch is just ghastly. These are seen in the final act, which is where you get a chance to properly look at the zombies. Before this, all action scenes are either in the dark or are so fast paced and quickly edited that you have no idea what is going on. The first action scene will remind people of director Marc Forster's previous editing misadventure ? Quantum of Solace. The opening act began quite well; Brad Pitt has shown he is great at playing the average family man ? he and Mireille Enos build up a believable family setting. A not-so-wise decision was made to make their children behave significantly younger that their actual ages ? they look about 13 and nine but both act about four years old! Brad Pitt's performance becomes more and more laborious and doesn't quite look as effortless as it did in the beginning. It is actually quite surprising to see him act in a film that you can tell he just doesn't care about any more ? you can tell that in some scenes these were filmed just as the production was running into problems. The supporting characters were all very disappointing; there were some fairly big actors who got hardly any screen time and their characters were severely under-developed. James Badge Dale makes an appearance for five minutes and in that tiny amount of time we are supposed to care about him and what happens to him, this was impossible. Even the brilliant Peter Capaldi features but his talent is wasted on a basic character that is not even given a name!Aside from this, most of the action was well-paced but the computer generated zombies make the massive action scenes less realistic and therefore less scary. There are some genuinely tense moments that make you want to hide behind your chair ? the plane scene is definitely where the film peaks. The film gets better as it continues but the ending is very deflating; there is a 15-minute long tense sequence where people are sneaking around an abandoned laboratory which is teaming with 'dormant' zombies. All of this leads up to the controversial decision to introduce a solution to the zombie apocalypse (one of the horrifying aspects of the book was that there was no real solution apart from building bigger forts and killing the infected one by one). When Brad Pitt makes this discovery, the film ends after a few minutes of cheesy family reunion with 'our war has just begun.' This is sadly nothing more than a reason to create a sequel and you are left at the end thinking 'is that it?'Overall, World War Z was the best possible zombie movie you could make with such a low age rating. It was fast paced, tense, thrilling and riddled with jump scares. Brad Pitt starts out promisingly but his performance becomes more tiresome as the film goes on. The film is not very recommendable, simply because the ending is so lazy it ruins the little sparks of talent that it had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made movie that was missing a little something?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie almost had it all for a zombie movie. Its like they took a zombie movie and tried to make it bigger and better. Sure it was a good movie with some high quality effects and acting. It was also not boring at all, nor was it the same old zombie thing.. However it was missing something I couldn't quite put my finger on. It was good and I really wanted to like it a lot, All the way to the end I wanted to like it but is was missing a zombie movie quality. Maybe because it didn't seem that scary? maybe because there were too many zombies that i was desensitized?Anyways I will watch it again on DVD or HBO to see what I think about it then. Even though it was a fast moving movie I found myself thinking about work, thinking about my kids or what to have for dinner. It didn't quite have that zombie movie grip on my mind where nothing could distract me til it was over. (Did anyone else get that same feeling) Hmmmmmmm It was almost a great movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's be clear here with the title including the words "world war" and the word Z representing Zombie the film would naturally appeal to men. I think it would naturally imply that you are going to see a reasonable amount of shooting from the films main character and a large amount of gore people being ripped apart, eaten etc. Sadly if you made those quite reasonable assumptions you would be completely wrong.The main character seems more focused on micro managing his family who are continuously brought to focus (as opposed to the world wide zombie invasion that's going on around them killing millions every day..). He is asked numerous times to help save the world and he turns it down in favour of .... You guessed it looking after his family who are safe 99% of the time throughout this movie. How any bloke is supposed to relate to this character is quite frankly beyond me.From what we have heard the film was focus grouped to death presumably by a bunch of 50 year old women who didn't like the title and didn't want to focus on any of those things but instead thought what should of been a minute part of the plot his family should take precedence.Sadly what you are left with is a watered down gutless movie with clear signs of its focus group attention. Even the soldiers that end up defending Brad Pitt were replaced with female soldiers just to try and appeal to the female audience (if the other overplayed parts about his family were not enough)At the end of the day if you are female and like Brad Pitt you will probably like it. If you are a guy and wanted what the title promised you are going to be sorely disappointed.I just really hope if they make another of these that they get someone to do it properly and fire the female focus groups, there is a reason zombie movies have stuck to a formula in the past, it's because it works this film is a perfect example of when it doesn't.</fullReview>

Well as I grin with a very sickly looking face? try zombie.Has anyone ever heard of a zombie movie and thought they were for kids and then thought how dare they show this to kids is horrible and sick. And then have you seen or walked away from a second and a third and fourth zombie movie thinking they're also sick and similar.Well in this movie they vibrate their ugly their eyes are all gimped, they bite you everywhere blood goes flying everywhere. Well a lot of scenes go by with out any dialogue at all. I bet it doesn't take much talent when there is no script to be found anywhere. How do you write a script for a zombie.Even though I am talking I'm still speechless. Basically this is a movie of the times that we live in more evil corruption Dare I say Satanic times. Truthfully that's what I believe.Question the person you sitting next to that says they enjoyed this movie maybe even seek help for them.sorry you've just wasted your money and if you watch the movie for free you've just wasted brain cells.Oh to be fair I never did watch the whole movie if there was anything good it would not make any difference it was overshadowed by the basic premise of absolute garbage</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombies In Jerusalem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember those moments in "Starship Troopers", that savage and nihilistic film by Verhoeven, when you start to root for the bugs? "World War Z" is so awful you can't even take sides. Down in the deepest depths of cinematic badness, where only Capital Letter BAD movies reside - down there next to von Trier's "Melancholia" - is where this monstrosity belongs. Not because of the hackneyed storyline, but because it actually uses Jerusalem as a prop. What's in the sequel? Will the zombies chew on the refugees at Zataari? Does the unbridled self- importance of these big-budget directors and stars make anything fair game for their ugly fantasies? After at least a half-dozen destructions of Manhattan since 9/11 in various dystopian blockbusters, someone must have said: "Manhattan! That's too obvious! Let's wipe out Israel! Let's turn it into a wasteland!" Seven miles deep, at the very bottom of the cinematic ocean, is where this thing belongs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sick people are immune to zombie aggression. And it takes a retired hipster UN investigator to find this out (because he is really good at running away). Wow, who sold this brilliant, not in the book, plot-piece to the studio? I guess there are no HIV-positive communities in New York and all those hospitals filled with only normal patients and zombie doctors and nurses.The rest of the story is also for the brain dead. The hipster doesn't communicate his results but does call his wife. Like a true James Bond kinda guy there is always an evil dude around to tell you part of his evil plan. A few people singing behind a 30 meter high wall(who just wandered out of a totally zombie infested area)are too loud but helicopters flying over the area are not. Zombies have anti-gravity booths to climb the wall or wolverine-like skeletons because having 20 zombies on top is just fine for them (but shooting knees works fine). Somehow it is more efficient to transfer 4 people 4000 miles than it is to let them keep their small cabin, the captain of a jet carrier says so after hipster dude goes missing for 1 day. Aaaaarghh, it just doesn't make any sense. Like making a zombie movie without zombies and gore but with at least 45 minutes of totally useless family dribble. Voice over: "I'm hipster dude, I love my family. To protect them I'm on this mission." Images from the outbreak while the voice over plays. Ending with annoying daughters waving on the flight deck. That could have saved a good 40 minutes of boredom for me. This movie is really very bad. Just watch the trailer 2 times, you won't miss a thing.</fullReview>

I recently saw my first new take while watching the BBC3 Drama 'In the Flesh' and was very pleased with that effort.While that was a spin into a new direction, WWZ sticks with what we know, but adds a shed load of awesomeness! We only have 5 minutes to get to know Brad Pitt and rest of his family until we are thrown head first into unrelenting action and it doesn't bring us back down until the end of the movie. It was very well paced, and no stage did i feel bored but i don't feel like i'd missed anything either! I voted 9/10 simply because it does have clichés in it, and unintentionally funny moments which ruined parts for me. But despite this i am going to go and see it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More action than zombie horror, but still entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So a couple of weeks ago, I won passes through a radio contest to the New York City premiere of World War Z, which went down last Monday(6/17/13). When I initially won, I was more excited about the thought of seeing Angelina Jolie (and her new breasts) in person than the actual movie, but it turned out that she was MIA that night. It was still cool to see Brad Pitt in person when he stopped by to introduce the movie after the film's director Marc Forster spoke for a few minutes. Pitt ensured us that they had a good movie in store for us, and he said that we should get the film going and not waste any more time.When I first heard about World War Z, I had no idea that the Z in the title refers to zombies, and even when I saw the trailer, there was no mention of zombies. If anything, the scene they showed from the beginning of the movie, when everyone was stopped in traffic and they heard explosions, made it look like it might be some kind of lame monster movie like Godzilla or even worse, Cloverfield.Brad Pitt stars as a former United Nations investigator who reluctantly abandons his family in order to face the task of figuring out what's causing the zombie pandemic all over the world and stop it before it destroys all of humanity. I've never read the book it's loosely based on, but people who have say the only thing the book and the movie share are the title. They wonder why Brad Pitt's production company Plan B Entertainment bothered to buy the rights to the book, which is a collection of individual accounts of the ongoing war against zombies.Despite his underrated talent and tendency to take on a wide range of roles, I was surprised that he did a film like this, being this is his first "disaster/end-of-the-world" movie. This seems more like something Will Smith would do, not Brad Pitt. In fact, the amount of violence and the creatures themselves were somewhat similar to the vampires featured in I Am Legend.The zombies featured in this movie are a combination of the virus-infected victims that are featured in 28 Days Later and the traditional Romero-esque zombies. The zombies in this movie would've been a hell of a lot scarier if they weren't CGI 90 percent of the time. Personally, I find the classic slow-moving zombies to be scarier than the fast-moving zombies. This film felt more like I was watching a Roland Emmerich film, like Independence Day, than a horror film. It seemed odd to me that a zombie film is rated PG-13, and I can imagine that hardcore zombie fanatics will be even more disappointed than I was.I'm not the biggest zombie buff around, but of the handful of zombie films that I've seen, the remake of Dawn of the Dead is one that really stands out for me. Shaun of the Dead was also great at spoofing zombie movies while simultaneously being a great zombie movie, similar to what Scream did for slashers. I can't really see World War Z going down as one of the greatest zombie flicks in history, nor as a great apocalyptic flick for that matter.Historically, I've never been too impressed with 3D, and this film was no exception. There were a few "jump scenes" that, although looked slightly cooler, I'm sure would've made me jump just the same. For much of the film, wearing the 3D glasses is just distracting in scenes where they're unnecessary, such as the first few minutes inside Gerry's house. At least the official World War Z 3D glasses that I decided to keep are a cool souvenir.Overall, the film definitely looks great, and some action sequences kicked so much ass that the audience erupted into applause. Although there are better zombie movies out there, you will certainly be excited and entertained, as long as you don't expect the same thought-provoking political commentary that you'd receive from an episode of "The Walking Dead."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted this to be a good movie, but it seems that the Director was more interested in CGI than anything else. It was barley entertaining, it was long, no real character building, just a lot of CGI which could not be helped in some scenes, but not as many as they did. The script was not really great, you knew what was going to happen before it happened, it was that predictable and no real climatic ending.I heard rumors of production issues, aka, rewrites, and it shows. Actors look like their hearts were just not in this, and so many goofs, aircraft taking off from a carrier that is sitting still in the water, are you kidding me! As I said in my Summary, if you like Zombies, this will entertain you, all others will most likely be lukewarm on it. All in all, not really worth the cost of admission in my view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An astonishingly poor film, it could've been one-of-a-kind, instead we get this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casting my mind back to 2008/2009, I could barely contain my excitement upon hearing the unique novel 'World War Z, an Oral History of the Zombie Wars' by Max Brooks was being taken onto the big screen. Wonderful, I though, the practically limitless elements of the book they can show here with the budget available, which is why Max Brooks deigned it workable in the first place. I envisaged Yonkers, brought to life with cutting edge CGI and up close shots with the same make-up artists who'd renowned themselves on the sets of The Walking Dead. Adding to this, I could practically taste the deep political, religious and military tidal waves Brooks placed in his book, the nuclear exchanges, the Jewish Civil War, the infamous Reddeker plan and its subsequent adaptations by other nations. The years ticked on and I followed the slowly leaked information avidly. From the script- writer changes to budgeting issues and the shelving and re-announcing of sequels, I was starting to lose hope. Surely, surely they wouldn't let this slip? I'm not naive enough to assume that it was an easy book to transgress into film-adaptation, but what we have is a paintball gun's attempt to match a world-famous art piece, it could've been presented in a way that showed the deep repercussions of humanity at war with the undead, rather then a half-dozen areas where, frankly, very little happens. The film opens, after a brief montage of world catastrophes, with Gerry Lane (Pitt) who has left his life as a UN Investigator and turned to his family. Overall, the acting from Pitt and to a large extent the cast at large is excellent. Nothing to write home about, but certainly successful. Its only a few minutes before we're dropped in on the action, but its also the final point in which this film's control is lost. There's elements to this film that will have you rolling your eyes, tutting and simply shaking your head in a 'what-were-they-thinking?' manner. Direct conflicts with the book, without sharing spoilers, are rife and the film becomes a flashy remake of B-movie zombie flicks. Throughout the book, the undead are slow, slouching and not an ounce of intelligence. In the film it seems every zombie is an olympic athlete with a promising future in acrobatics. They tip over buses, repeatedly manage to find their way into cars, rooms and buildings with head-butting and there are even zombies who hide silently, only making themselves known when they're discovered in ridiculous places two hundred people would've noticed them tuck in to. The film also makes practically no use of the geo-political shades used in the novel. We see none of the major elements and only a brief nod to a nuclear strike, but we have no idea by who, against what or its effects. We see nothing of the Israeli Civil War and certainly nothing of the Russian religious oligarchy beginning. No ferals in American cities, no mention to the space station's constant updates, etc. They took barely anything from the book, which in most cases I'd admire but when you've a golden goose just waiting to be used and you instead douse that goose in tar, you've taken a poor step in the wrong direction. Another injustice to this is its age-rating. Now, I understand the need to make films more accessible to a wider audience, but I do not believe this is the way. Zombies are pitched back but we see only speckles of blood here, explosions tear through crowds and the bodies just disappear, people are torn to the ground like animals and ripped to shreds and yet the camera cuts away conveniently. This is the grime of the novel we could've of had but we're denied by the ridiculousness of a wider audience. I wont mention the final, most ridiculous plot-twist of any film I've ever seen to those who haven't seen the novel but the element introduced by Gerry's glimpses of the sick made me want to punch the script-writer in the face for this monstrosity of an idea. World War Z is a poor film. The CGI is fairly decent, but it would've been excellent to see more make-up padded humans play zombies rather then CGI through and through. Furthermore, the acting is on par and its entertainment at the end of the day. Though I'd encourage anyone who hasn't yet seen the films or read the books to read said books; they're remarkable and put this film spin off firmly into its grave. Well, a potentially unique and awe-inspiring film wasted. Just wasted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slick, uneven zombie film that ultimately fails because it doesn't prey upon the preexisting fears that the viewing audience has. The apocalypse in the film does not unnerve and the zombies have no metaphorical significance. Hence, we are not scared. We are merely left with a Brad Pitt saves the world movie, rather than a terrifying zombie flick with psychological resonance. The movie does have its moments, but is ultimately forgettable. Pitt's love of his family is overplayed and its irritating how he is merely a UN worker. We are unclear why he is the one called upon to save the world, since we learn very little about his skill-set or background. The scene where he tosses a grenade on a plane is beyond ludicrous. However, the way in which they defeat the zombies is very clever and it's nice how the film ends with a respite from the problem, rather than a solution to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know. Clever title, right? But seriously, this film is thrill-deficient. Sure it's got a global scope, but it has a tiny scale. That may be par for the course in your typical zombie movie, but this one happens to have the word "War" in it. Yeah it has a few large-scale set pieces, but it really doesn't add up to anything more than hordes of computer generated zombies descending like locusts on groups of hapless victims.Attempts to add character depth by saddling our hero (Brad Pitt, in a solid turn) with a family that we know is never in any real danger because Hollywood would never kill off kids in a PG-13 film, fall flat and only serves to slow down the film's already lethargic pace.World War Z isn't a bad movie, but its attempt to blend popcorn movie aesthetics with zombie movie sensibilities doesn't quite succeed.</fullReview>

So consider this review on behalf of the average gal interested in a movie lacking gore, but with a handful of good jolts. Fun special effects, especially the zombie climb up the Jerusalem wall. My husband and I both woke up from zombie nightmares later that night. :-) As for the Brad Pitt angle, he managed the role just fine.

		<fullReview>This is my first review and I just needed to write one after seeing all the bad reviews about the movie.As you can see from my voting I truly think the movie deserves a lot more than given. I can say that I am not a person who have read the book/books and can judge from that aspect, however, you cannot change the fact that I went to watch the movie only to be grossed and entertained and ended up so, in a positive way if you could say.Some people hated the movie because it was not true to the books and missed a lot of good things. But people you should know by now that books are always better than the movies(a reader creates a world in his mind that no other person can imitate) you can never expect a producer to make scenes exactly as you wish. Nor can you find every thrilling scene(you loved) to be in the movie. This movie wanted and needed to be a blockbuster and the fact-that it became one but did not fit the normal sort of sci-fi fantasy far fetched movies-made it a favorite for me.The climax was different from expected and what is better than to be intrigued by the producers choice for an ending, this is what you will get from the movie - something to think about.What truly scares me that this time an apocalyptic movie seemed really doable and something that can happen to us any moment. The first thing I asked my friends after watching it was "what kind of an illness will look the most plausible to a zombie Apocalypse" and will even Jerusalem be safe from it, because I truly believe that Jeursalem is the third world Power and our next high commander, before forming a "New World Order" the ones on top will find an inexpensive way to get rid of half the population of the World, make an infestation and find a cure for the privileged ones- not us ofc, we are doomed :D</fullReview>

The special effects were terrific and zombies were extremely well done and believable, they are a lot more aggressive and much faster than the usual zombies, especially compared to the "The Walking Dead".

		<fullReview>Can I just start out by saying that I was really looking forward to this for ages I thought it looks like it will be quite good but what I got was a film that was unintentionally funny it ruined the film. The zombies were unbelievably stupid, the script was crap and the acting was bad (even from Brad Pitt which disappointed me). The way some characters die is so funny that I laughed for like 10 minutes. The beginning was rushed and the child actors were really bad (even by child actors standards). Just avoid it all together and I feel sorry for the ones who bought the $50 tickets. They have just waisted a good $50. I can't believe Paramount spent a lot of money on the ending even though the entire film should have been re-shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening few minutes of a movie are critical to setting the theme of a movie as well as the mood of the viewer. Given that, why do movie makers (i don't care what they call themselves) think that shaking the camera will improve the experience. I was frustrated and angry that I never really saw what was going on. I KNEW what was going because I saw the trailers and ads. I understood the action because Brad is running around and there's a lot of noise..... However, this is a MOVIE not a radio show. That means I want to SEE what is going on. I have five senses and a movie engages two of them, not one. I do not get a feeling of "intensity" or "suspense" by not seeing clearly, I get "upset" (to use polite language). I left after the opening scenes and wish I could get my money back. For the love of all that is good in this world, STOP SHAKING THE CAMERAS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Played safe to the point of being incredibly dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I need to get two things straight right up front here. The first is that although I loved the book, I have no qualms with a movie that diverges completely from the source material. The second is that I have nothing at all against PG-13 horror movies. While I see countless fellow horror fans complaining about PG-13s, some of my favorite (and personally most terrifying) horror movies have had that rating (The Others, The Ring, Skeleton Key, Jaws etc.)I went into WWZ knowing it diverged from the book vastly and not caring if it was PG 13, all I wanted was some half decent entertainment. Unfortunately, this film played it so safe that it was terminally dull - and I don't mean in terms of having no gore, I mean in terms of not being willing to take one single risk in the script. There's simply *nothing* here that wasn't, at best, obvious; or, at worst, dumb. It's one of those films where you figure out what the protagonist has to figure out looooong before he does so, then spend the rest of the film clock watching and waiting for him to have the a-ha moment. Sometimes those kind of films can be saved by fascinating character arcs, or perhaps by some interesting cinematography or direction or even by a rousing score, but again WWZ plays it horribly safe in all those aspects too. Not one moment of the music will stay in your head, not one shot will make you think "nicely framed", not one character will have you saying "I didn't know they were going to say that".I can only imagine the things that went on behind the scenes to make this so horribly mundane. I suspect it involved a great deal of high level pressure to make it inoffensive enough to market to teenagers. But here's the thing - the very subject matter of the dead returning to life requires, nay *demands*, boldness - not necessarily gore or violence, but at the very least BOLDNESS - yet WWZ is as meek as a movie can get. You could show it to your Grandmother over tea and biscuits and she'd probably be just as bored as you would and forget everything that happened just as fast.I'm a big fan of Pitt. Usually he has the intensity to pull even a weak movie up to higher levels - but not so here. His character is the safest of the bunch, a doting dad with nary a flaw in sight. He wanders, set-jawed and honorable, from location to location without his character experiencing a single moment of intensity, internal conflict, or weakness. WWZ is a beige wall, it's a light gray cardigan, it's a glass of room temperature water, it's a placebo sugar pill. It won't offend you, excite you, upset you, fascinate you, thrill you or scare you in any way. It will enter your system and leave without trace or effect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War ZZZZZZ</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These so called "zombies" make Frankenstein's Monster seem like Jurassic Park Raptors ? within seconds fangs bite flesh and the undead transition occurs, resembling an epileptic seizure in double time.Thankfully Brad Pitt's not-so-regular family man Gerry, after being caught in a traffic jam turned zombie attack, can figure things out along the way. He once worked for the government so he has an edge on doomed humanity, all targets for the disease-stricken hyperactive vampire-like creatures.Much of the action occurs as quickly as the antagonists ? not so much the usual modern style shaky cam but with more of a rolling/undulating movement that may cause seasickness, especially in 3D. Yet much of the film has a brooding, mellow Gerry going to various cities, including North Korea and Jerusalem: his mission is to figure out what virus is causing all the bedlam, and, most importantly, if there's a possible cure.After a few big battles, one involving a thousand-plus worker-ant "zombies" climbing a giant wall and using their bodies for leverage, followed by a DIE HARD style scrap in a high flying airplane, we're brought down to earth for a more personal standoff...Gerry (the only character that means anything) winds up at a scientific research center where he figures out how to possibly save the human race. The idea is creative and finally there's a more contained and suspenseful urgency ? one intrepid man against only a handful of determined zombies. Too bad they act like unfed chickens and are completely laughable even at their most dangerous...But at least the movie winds down to a situation we can be part of, far exceeding the overlong buildup which felt like watching war unfold on a cable news station.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombies! and they want to be taken seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard this was a good flick and I like Brad Pitt, so I didn't learn much a bout it when I went in. As I sat there, I was shocked that it was about zombies, and it wasn't tongue in cheek. Remember Zombieland? Yeah, it was about Zombies, but you knew it wasn't to be taken seriously. Especially when they shot Bill Murray who was playing himself. World War Z is silly, stupid and not worth your time. The tone is that the world is being taken over by Zomnbies and only Brad Pitt alone can save it. Zombies are like unicorns, or Teddy bears with lasers, you can't do it with a totally straight face. This movie tries and falls flat on its face. The first scene of the Zombie attack lets you know that you are in for a silly ride. Pitt and his wife and children are caught in a tight traffic jam when the zombies attack. Suddenly all of the cars pull over to the side so that Pitt can drive. It was just like the scene in "Bruce Almighty" when Jim Carey (as God) causes all of the cars to pull to the side. Only that was a farce. Here the cars pull over to the side because the Director wanted to put in a car chase scene. Like oh yeah, the middle of being eaten alive by Zombies everyone pulls over to let Brad Pitt pass. Then after Pitt wrecks his car, he gathers up his family and puts them into a conveniently available RV. Again thousands of people are being attacked but only Brad is smart enough to get into the RV. Then they drive away across a bridge that is jammed with cars, but the cars have cleared a path for the RV. The word on the emergency Broadcast system is to stay away from big cities. What does Brad do? He takes his family out of Philadelphia and drives them to Newark. My understanding is that Newark isn't safe even when it is not over-run with Zombies. The dumbness just goes on. The movie was directed by Marc Foster who I remember directed Quantum of Solace, you know the James Bond film where there were such extreme close ups you had no idea what was going on. Same thing here. Lots of scenes where the camera was so close, you had no idea what was happening. Mr. Foster should not be directing anything. Beware of movies that have only one recognizable star. The drama is a star interacting with other stars. Here you had Brad. So there was no drama or character development or anything of interest, except a few very exciting action scenes. Which did not make any sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To option this book and then make a film costing almost $2M per minute of screen time is criminal by Hollywood standards. No mention of Yonkers or the LOBO. This movie is flawed. I only hope Max Brooks was not only paid well but also retained the rights to option his title for a TV series. Imagine a multi-season cable-length arc. Each season covers one area from his fantastic book. Yonkers I. Traveling North &amp; subsequent "clean-up". The Air Corps crash and subsequent evasion. Intercut with stories from India, Jerusalem &amp; Cairo, Cuba, and political (dis)organization. Conclude with the March Across America.The only hope we have is that Spielberg also watched and learned how to not mess up Robopocalypse.1 star for actually being made, another for Pitt as an actor, with 2 more for some nice shots and effects. Watch once and move on to something better - maybe even something by The Asylum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing an Important Ingredient</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It started somewhere in the Far East. Soon a virus similar to rabies has hit all of the major population centers around the world with no known cure. Normal people are suddenly transformed into psychotic maniacs who attack others and spread the disease at an alarming rate. When it hits Philadelphia, "Gerry Lane" (Brad Pitt) is pressed into service to help the United Nations find a cure. So much for the plot which has been played out numerous times in one fashion or the other. What makes this film unique is the money that was spent producing it. As such the movie boasts plenty of action, decent CGI, various locations and some good actors. Unfortunately, it's missing an important ingredient--gore. As a result it pales in comparison to other films in the zombie genre. Films like "28 Days Later" or "Day of the Dead" for example. Now, don't get me wrong, as I said earlier it has plenty of action and it also has some good suspenseful scenes here and there. But it just didn't seem to be enough. And a person doesn't have to be a gore hound or a zombie enthusiast to recognize this. However, considering all of the money spent on positive advertising, my opinion probably won't matter when all is said and done. In short, I liked it to a degree but for the money spent to produce it I believe that it should have been much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absolutely Excellent Suspense and Semi-Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading tons of reviews on IMDb about how so-so and almost bad World War Z was supposed to be, I decided not to see it. But my sister's birthday came around and that's what she wanted to do so "I had to." And I am SO glad I gave it a chance!I'm an actual movie-going human being, not a critic. And I was RIVETED by this movie.I'd never heard of World War Z or that it was a book before it was a movie. Perhaps World War Z is like the X-Men series, in that it is far better if you have little to no knowledge of the "canon" material. I can't know.All I know is, to me, an outsider coming into the World War Z setting and concept completely fresh, I was swept up and blown away. In my honest and humble opinion, the acting was believable, the effects were never over-the-top or under par, the writing/directing was spot on-- I have no complaints at all.Also keep in mind that I am a 100% bona fide pansy who becomes easily terrified by movies that are not even supposed to be scary. My sister, on the other hand, is a scary movie junkie. I was clinging to her every time the music changed, and even she jumped a few times.TL;DR: This movie was exciting, engrossing, and held my attention 110% of the time. There was never a lull. And, if I'm honest, I was plugging my ears and squinting during a majority of the final third of the film. ;) If that doesn't speak for a thrilling movie doing it's job, I don't know what does.Do yourself a favor, and give this movie a chance.</fullReview>

In all seriousness there is not much place to go if you base your film on Zombies who try to infect the rest of us. At the same time, I must admit that whilst expectations were low the film was made in a way that kept us engaged throughout and there were moment of very heightened tension.Despite this, unlike Contagion, it left me largely uninterested and hope Brad Pitt will resume making the good films he has accustomed us to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On its own OK, but an insult to the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I don't usually write reviews as in ever but having loved the book and then seeing this after looking forward to it I had to add my 2p.As a film it's OK, not great but decent enough, however I can only assume those who've rated this highly have never read the book. I knew they'd changed the plot but I was still expecting something closer to a world war not contagion with zombies. Compared to the book this is awful and I have no idea why Brooks allowed his name to be attached to it. It starts off promisingly but pretty soon devolves into Brad Pitt travelling a bit while whining about his family. The book was always for me more about the ingenuity and compassion of the human race when fighting for survival this captured some of that in the beginning but forgot it pretty quickly, the last hour and a half was essentially as I've said contagion with zombies. All the main sequences were in the trailer so if you've seen that is probably enough unless you really like Pitt and if you read and enjoyed the book just stay away and wait for the DVD Oh and paying extra for 3d is pointless there's like 10mins worth of good 3d the rest just isn't worth it</fullReview>

I have read the book and there was no way it could be confined to two hours. Although it has some references to the book they are few. I will not put spoilers in and as a massive fan of the book I would suggest if you too have read it don't waste your cash on the movie. You will be painfully disappointed. It doesn't even work s a stand alone movie disconnected from the book. All we can hope is that a TV production company will pick it up and do what should have been done. Turn it into a proper series with each weekly hour spent on each story or at least the best of them. It won't happen. Not with the Walking Dead out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underwhelming is probably the polite way to describe this movie. A disappointing repetitive poorly thought out thriller that fails to scare or thrill. It is commonly known that the film was extensively rewritten and reshot and the way scenes and characters are set up then abandoned highlights this. Unfortunately its also short in superfast edits and shaky hand held style, which , combined with the many dark scenes make it hard to watch. I pity those who paid to see it in 3d as that must have made it worse.Brad Pitt starred and produced this and needless to say he is the hero and the only one who gets anything to do. The script is utterly stupid and Pitt gives a performance that seems to alternate between looking constipated and bored. If you must see it in cinemas don't waste your money in 3d. Personally I regret buying a ticket and would suggest waiting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is worth a watch but set your expectations low for zombie genre...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur of the zombie genre as I have seen many incarnations of the zombie epidemic through the classics by George Romero and more recent productions like "The Walking Dead". I have read quite a few novels as well as outlying mock survival books like Roger Ma's Zombie Combat Manual. Of course, I have read Max Brook's collection and what drew me into his writing was the narrator gaining perspective on how all of these different states and countries dealt with the zombie apocalypse as well individual accounts of survival. When I heard this book was being translated into a movie, I immediately felt it would be a huge undertaking to follow the book even loosely due to budget constraints (it would be awesome to film all of these places on-location but not very practical). I knew it would break the bank anyway with the shooting in Malta, Hungary and UK so it was important that the movie capitalize (or at least get out of the red) by employing Brad Pitt's versatile talents as an actor to bring out the best of the relatively unknown actors around him. Unfortunately, instead of "12 Monkeys" or "Fight Club", I see "Meet Joe Black" (which coincidentally was his biggest flop at the time). I know the narrator is supposed to be calm and collected (although the movie operates on a different timeline and seems more like a prequel to the book), but it appears that Pitt has no emotion at all which makes a difference in how the viewer empathizes with his character. Gerry makes no emotional connections (maybe aside from the kiss on the forehead to Segen the female soldier) with any of the other characters on-screen and is all business in hop-scotching from country to country trying to find Patient Zero and a cure. Also, how does a retired U.N. employee hold so much value to the government on finding a cure? It is like there was nobody left (aside from the scientist who comically and accidentally shot himself) on the planet with any expertise in bacteriology/virology. They make Brad Pitt look like Flash Gordon without all of the football moves. Did all of the research scientists with global military training get killed off during the initial outbreak? I guess it is plausible, but if I were president the leaders in medical research would be the first ones I would ship off to safe haven. I digress...Aside from Segen, no one aside from Pitt gets any real screen time so there are no real relationships (even familial) developed hence who cares if they die? Had Gerry died from injecting himself with a bolus of (typhus?), the mortal through and through GI wound on top of a plane crash or getting his nose bit off by the chipmunk zombie I probably would have laughed or felt indifferent. To be honest, the plot was predictable and you already knew that Gerry was going to live because who else besides Brad Pitt's star-power could carry the movie and make it watchable once you decide the plot and characters are bland? I also had a feeling that they were going to let him live to leave the window open for sequels although I think Pitt should cut his losses on this one. Another issue I have with this movie is the gratuitous use of CGI for every scene that involved the zombies. Grant it, you could never accomplish what the movie did (the zombie ladder) with extras alone; however, CGI has no place in a horror film IMO. Why? Because it removes the feeling of terror that lies in your gut after you see something shot with real actors and non-digitized special effects. There is something so visceral and believable about traditional effects that CGI can never replace no matter how evolved the technology. I did like the action and pace as well as the nod to the Chinese physician from the book that treated Patient Zero. The zombie ladder scenes were actually quite entertaining although it made them look more like ants than the undead. I think I understand why they made this movie PG-13. After going way over budget and time-consuming rewrites of the script, I imagine they have several hours of footage that ended up on the cutting room floor that would have branded it with an R rating. From what I have read, Marc Forster and Brad Pitt were at odds through most of the filming and production. I do not think Pitt got the movie he wanted and maybe that was reflected in his acting or lack thereof. He probably felt resigned to go with the PG-13 and obvious ad placements to reduce the financial hit by appealing to the teenage crowd. To my knowledge, this is the first true zombie horror-not-comedy movie in theaters with a PG-13 rating and we now know it does not work. Anyone who appreciates this genre has probably been desensitized enough by "The Walking Dead" with regard to blood and guts that it becomes glaringly apparent it is a missing element in this movie. Max Brooks was also left out of the loop which made no sense to me as they went through at least 4 screen-writers and how bad could it possibly be if he was on board to at least consult. Sadly enough, they veered like a runaway train so far off course from the book with the plot and story, they allegedly had a tough time with the ending which was anti-climactic at best. With all of this said, I still like Pitt's movies overall and will not reject his future work outright simply because he is the star. However, like M. Night Shyamalan movies, I will have to think twice before committing 2 hours of my life to another Forster flick. Now if you will excuse me, I will go read J.L. Bourne, rejuvenate and pray for no film version of his books...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z- A Bewildering Failure in Successful Adaptation That Results in a Mediocre Zombie Apocalypse Actioner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It almost seems insulting to name the new apocalyptic zombie film World War Z after the highly acclaimed novel of the same name by author Max Brooks because there is not one ounce of accuracy in the film to the geo-political insight, thought provoking societal adaptation, or intelligent post-apocalyptic scenarios that Brooks' book contained in every riveting chapter. Mel Brooks' notably talented son crafted an incredibly intriguing novel that was a retrospect on how the world changed during the ten years battling an unknown zombie outbreak and yet Marc Forster's film, plagued by notorious rewrites, reshoots, and a relentless production hell, has only borrowed minor details in order to make a rather generic zombie feature. Critiquing World War Z on the merits of adaptation would result in an absolute failure of concept, execution, and character so the only other way of objectively reviewing the film would be an assessment in how well it fits in the post-apocalyptic and zombie genres on its own where it barely passes the minimum of critical standards. With a television show like "The Walking Dead" and films such as 28 Days Later offering superior options for the zombie genre of entertainment, where complex characters and human nature insight give us a fully conceptual and emotional experience, it's difficult to see desperate, minor efforts as anything but average. Unfortunately World War Z ends up being a drastically uneven affair with some occasionally solid action sequences featuring one dimensional characters we care almost nothing about and semi-intelligent concepts that are inevitably lost in the chaotic, physics defying fray that is practically relentless. The third act of the film has some uneasy atmospheric merit but the beginnings ambivalence to setting up complex characters and the middle's illogical and excessive middle make it a laborious trek to get through that has too much brawn and very little braininess for a post-apocalyptic film. Though the opening twenty minutes are hectically confusing enough to be engaging the remainder of the film feels incredibly fragmented in its tonal inconsistency and empty due to its lack of connection to a protagonist that never seems human, vulnerable, or complex. Considering the unevenness of Marc Forster's direction, the blandness in Brad Pitt's performance, the abandonment of adaptation accuracy from the original novel, and the crippling production problems the film encountered, World War Z can confidently claim the appropriate description of being mediocre.Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-A4; More reviews: Generationfilm.net</fullReview>

And what is the deal with the brainiac doctor at the beginning who was going to save the planet and ends up shooting himself. No person who is tactically trained is going to stick a pistol in someone's hand with a "just do your best" attitude. I'd worry about the guy shooting me or himself...There were so many plot holes in this movie that I don't want to tire myself out thinking about them. Hopefully the book will be better.If you want a mindless, all action flick then this one is great. A big plus for me was that the good guys lived.

Pitt is fine in his role but his portrayal is meaningless as we really have no idea who his character is. He formerly operated for the U.N. and is a family man at heart, that's about it. He lacks any real strengths or any real weaknesses, he pretty much just avoids "zombies" the entire movie and uses common sense to find a cure. I also thought a lot of the CGI used in this movie was poorly done, and often unnecessary in my opinion. Another issue I had with this film was the "zombies", these things are not zombies, if anything they are vampires. We never see them actually devour anyone, in fact all they do is bite people and then proceed to infect others, like vampires only these ones don't mind the sun. This film is no doubt hindered by its rating, who's idea was it to make a zombie movie without blood?

		<shortDescription>World War ?.zzzz?zzzz?zzzz...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z is a movie that jumps around every 15 minutes to make sure you're not bored. But I was. This was a snoozer. The movie is completely harmless, totally illogical but at least just when the wife and kids annoy the crap out of you, the filmmakers handily shuttle them off to a place you won't see them again. There's a feeling a good deal of stuff went under the editing knife, but it may have been for the greater good because there's not much here.There are a couple places of genuine entertainment, but the most interesting characters are gone in a blink.Really I'm wasting too much time. Just when you think the movie is getting started, it's over. Brand Pitt announces "This isn't the end." But yeah it is, because the credits started rolling. World War Z is a movie that will pass some time, but there's no downside to never seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is the kid screaming?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, the youngest kid screams from the first minute of the movie, when there isn't even a zombie in sight to the very last. And it's not even a good scream, alas Dakota Fanning in War of the worlds. It's one of those annoying kids with a group of friends at the cinema scream, I thought I had hit the jackpot seeing the movie when there was no kids there to ruin it with the melodramatic screaming but this movie comes with its very own built in!Speaking of Dakota Fanning in war of the worlds, the movie pretty much steals a scene right out of it; you know when the aliens first arrive and start destroying stuff and the character Rachel starts screaming for her Mother? Yeah that scene, except the mother is already in the car in WWZ so the kid screams for a non existent blanket. Even the kids name is the same.Conclusion - This kid destroys what could of been a good movie. I spent the entire movie trying to work out if the kid was supposed to have autism or asperbergs or something instead of paying attention to the action, at least then it's stupid behavior such as sitting in a trolley screaming, making her father run back in a zombie infested street to get a stuffed animal and running back down stairs when the rest of the family are running up to catch a helicopter to escape as the zombies have literally just broken through the door, would make more sense. And this all happens in the first 10 minutes, I will spare you the details of the rest of this kids nauseating role. You'll thank me if you decide to watch it. but I'd avoid if you are emotionally attached to your ear drums. Don't say I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Max Brooks' hugely successful novel was put through the proverbial wringer on it's road to the big screen. Numerous script re-writes, many scenes re-shot, a re-worked third act, an all new ending, and a 6 month delay in release date. The final product is something that fans of TV's "The Walking Dead" will probably appreciate and many others will find it entertaining enough.Brad Pitt gives an earnest effort as a former United Nations investigator who now enjoys his new role as house-husband. In fact, director Marc Foster (Quantum of Solace, Monster's Ball) zaps us with the first zombie action just after Pitt serves up pancakes to his two daughters and wife Karin (Mireille Enos, "The Killing"). It turns out Pitt is more than just an expert at flapjacks. His expertise is needed in this global zombie crisis brought on by a virus ...or bacteria, that started in India ... or Israel ... or Asia. See, those details don't really matter because the infection has spread to every corner of the globe.I actually enjoyed Pitt more in the "quiet" moments than in the big CGI action sequences. He is quite believable as a doting husband and father, less so as the world's savior. Still, the issues with this movie are not on Mr. Pitt. Four writers (in addition to the novelist) rarely deliver a coherent script' however, since it's an apocalyptic zombie thriller, they almost get away with it! If you haven't visited the zombie genre in a few decades, be prepared ... these aren't the sluggish zombies made famous by George Romero. Instead, these are blazingly fast and able to leap tall buildings, flying helicopters ... and the great wall of Jerusalem. Yes, Jerusalem. In one of the more unusual movie features, this one plays like "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?". Pitt globe trots more than James Bond or Jason Bourne.For many, the zombie sequences and global apocalyptic theme will provide sufficient cinematic entertainment. For the rest of us, it's fine, but will forgotten as quickly as I am Legend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Goreless and script-less Zombie movie..mediocre at best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with no expectations whatsoever, having read several of the reviews here..and they turned out to be perfectly true. Quick Overview: The plot: Brad Pitt shuttling across the globe, trying to find a cure for the 'Zombie' menace. Pros: 1.Excellent CGI effects, which makes watching the movie in 3D worthwhile. 2.The pace of the movie keeps you riveted even though you kind of know, what's about to happen. Cons 1.Poor script, which could have been put together by a 12 yr old kid. 2.Characters are not at all developed, which makes you wonder, what the hell is the director trying to do? Brad Pitt is especially wasted in the movie. 3. No blood in a zombie movie?? I am not even sure who the target audience for this movie is.12-16 yr olds? Verdict: If you are fan of 3D movies, go for this one. Don't expect any award winning performances, but just enough action to keep you interested throughout the movie. The worst part of the movie is that the director makes you laugh inadvertently at scenes which are supposed to be dead serious.Perhaps they could invent a new genre for this movie.... "Comic Thriller"...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War Z is a PG-13 movie adaptation of the 2006 Max Brooks novel of the same name. However, if my Google research is correct, the movie has very little to do with the book. And if history taught us anything is that movie adaptations are often not as good as the books they are trying to adapt - especially if they greatly differ from their source material. I, for one, didn't read the book and am not able to judge whether World War Z was or wasn't a successful adaptation. But I can judge World War Z as a stand alone movie and I must say - it's not particularly good.The movie is mostly about Brad Pitt's character - a former U.N. employee named Gerry Lane - trying to find a cure for the zombie outbreak. There isn't much plot to World War Z and the story hasn't got any important establishing points. That is one of the problems with World War Z - there is no real plot development. World War Z "compensates" for the lack of a coherent story with being a fast paced/action packed movie. The movie's action sequences literally start within the first several minutes and almost never stop during this 2 hour long ADD fest. To be honest, there is some mild social commentary to be found somewhere in the story, but nothing significantly distinguishable from the usual clichés.Besides the weak plot, World War Z, unfortunately, has a problem with how it portrays zombies. It was obvious that World War Z wanted to break the world record for the movie with the largest number of zombies. Of course, the creators of this movie couldn't possibly achieve this goal by using only actors with make-up so they created the huge zombie masses by using CGI. As a result of that, the zombies in World War Z look very artificial. Sometimes I even felt like I was watching something from a live action video game (not unlike Left 4 Dead), which definitely isn't a good thing. In conclusion, I mostly enjoyed the movie during the third act, when the actual actors in make-up replace the inane computer-generated caricatures.Furthermore, World War Z doesn't really invest in its characters, save from Brad Pitt's character: they are all bland, one dimensional and boring - and when uninteresting characters die/fight for their lives there isn't much drama to it. Still, if you're not really that interested in drama/characters/overall story and just want to watch action scenes and eat popcorn - World War Z is the movie for you, since there are some really impressive and tense action scenes. As for the rest of you, I certainly wouldn't recommend World War Z because of how disappointing the movie feels - it's just a weak shadow of something that could have been great.Rating: 5/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War Z - It wasn't the first story about deadly virus and zombie. So, it wouldn't be unusual if it was compared to the other movies we have been watching for decades. I don't really like the storyline and the plotting, not because it was bad, but it was too cliché with some other movies, including the Resident Evil's series. Though I was thrilled with the actions and how it was created. Every scenes was enjoyable and exciting enough. From time to time, it wasn't wasted for nothing. But again, for a science basis people like me, the idea of virus creating zombies was too lame and invalid. I think it was basically brilliant to manipulate such a good fact in bacteriology/virology, but it certainly lack of relevancy in pathology theory. Take a good lesson in how it sorted out the potential hosts to spread. It was a possible theory, but not in this implicated condition. Well, I guess it was a movie for general viewers, certainly to be enjoyed, not for us the scientists. Overall, it was a good movie with good message and point of actions, but still too much to be improved of. It was very enjoying though. And maybe, not a very good movie to those anti-Israeli Muslims who believe in Conspiracy Theory. Just saying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>world war stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate movies like this. Joyless, unashamed cash grabs that just cobble a few derivative scenes together with little sense or characterisation. The pacing is terrible, and with the exception of Brad Pitt, no effort is made to create characters that the audience can care about. They are merely cyphers to provide support to, or conveniently die to make way for, Brad Pitt and his ego.Plot wise the movie is based on a best selling book. I haven't read the book but its hard to imagine a best seller being as idiotic as this film.Pitt is a retired medico ( because Pitt still sees himself as some kind of rebel) who is the back up to a UN expert travelling the world searching for the cure to a zombie outbreak. Obviously Pitt won't play second fiddle to anyone so the UN genius conveniently falls over and shoots himself in the head. I'm serious. That is the level of writing.Pitt travels the globe like a scruffy jinx, everywhere he goes is overrun by zombies almost immediately.Unfortunately the ending is utterly moronic. It makes no sense whatever and is completely anti-climactic. Apparently the ending was reshot, which may explain why the movie's resolution takes place in Wales.The end suggests the possibility of a sequel. If they make one I won't watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror Trunk Review: Global Gobble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>orld War Z follows Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) and his family as they face a zombie pandemic. Gerry is an ex UN employee who (luckily) has previous training in combat, and is sent on a mission to find the source of the infection, and a possible cure. He finds himself in a race against time to stop the virus before humanity becomes extinct....World War Z is a book by Max Brooks that explores individual experiences across the globe during the outbreak of an unknown virus. This adaptation chooses to focus on the story of one family, as they become caught up in the catastrophic events. The film attempts to compensate for the loss of individual and alternative perspectives, by using a variety of locations, as we see Pitt attempt to go 'around the world in one film'. This is not to be considered a zombie film in the horror genre sense, it is a disaster film. The infected are shown as a swarm of frenzied, chaotic locust of human bodies, who are capable of mass destruction (Think scarabs from The Mummy films). The interesting theories stand out like sore (bitten) thumbs in contrast to the rest of the film, where clearly parts of the script have been cherry picked from the original book. Pitt's acting is standard, and you are left feeling that anyone could have filled his shoes. A lot of wasted talented actors in this film, which leaves the story flat and faltering. The film starts out well but the pace and story seem to waver towards the end, offering an unsurprisingly clichéd ending. A 'Zombie' disaster feature that bends over for a nice safe ending. Think less 28 Days Later and more Volcano meets some stray scarabs..with explorer Pitt thrown in for good measure...www.horrortrunk.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The book by Max Brooks was brilliant, and this film is far from that. It is unfortunate that the film will forever overshadow the book, and the message of the book will always be blocked from being told in its entirety. Even if the award winning audio book version of World War Z was simply retold with the passion and intensity of the actors that portray the key characters, it would be far better than this film. Having said that, if you have not read the book, you will find acts I and II of this film to be interesting; but will be sorely disappointed by its misplaced III act. Why they did not follow the book and just convert it to a visual retelling I will never understand- how do you have WWZ without the Battle of Yonkers?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say about this movie is that it was disappointing. I am not a fan of the fast zombie, but I still gave this movie a chance. There was plenty of action, however there was too much of it. The basic formula for this movie is Brad Pitt's character gets attacked, he escapes, goes somewhere else, gets attacked, he escapes, goes somewhere else, etc. Not really a great movie for someone who wants to see a serious movie that makes you want the main character to live. Personally I had no emotional attachment to Gerry and didn't care if he lived or died.P.S. There was a Cellphone that was established to have no battery life in a scene, but in another scene it some how was able to recharge with no help.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor quality rip-off of "28 Weeks Later". Not to mention Brad's stupid hairstyle, and typical underplayed acting "style", which makes the character utterly unbelievable. Seems way too many people are impressed by an actor who no longer seems to take acting seriously (and his own ego far too seriously), overdone CGI effects (as if they've never seen THAT before), cliché Armageddon scenarios, and blatant plot plagiarisms. This was an opportunity completely blown to make this into a political/social metaphor commentary, as District 9 has done for alien films, but "Hollywood" (and Pitt) chose to make it nothing more than an effects-driven, mainstream, unintelligent, shallow, "nothing better to watch", forgettable, summer budget-buster (like "The Avengers"). Such a waste of time and money. Ironic how Pitt is making worse movies, while Jolie is making better ones. Save your time and money and watch the real deal - "28 Days Later", followed by "28 Weeks Later". Do that, and you'll understand how bad this WWZ really is in comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family outing ruined by zombie plague.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it!, with fathers? Tom Cruise, almost as soon as he is in charge of his kids, gets caught up in a Martian invasion, in 'War of the Worlds' (2005). Here, Brad Pitt cannot even drive his kids down the road without being swept up in a world-wide zombie plague.This reviewer was offered a choice of 2D and 3D, and decided if the film was good enough it would stand on it's own merits in the 2D format. It did.Film comes from Brad Pitt's own 'Plan B Entertainment' film company and was released via 'Paramount', therefore Brad Pitt is a producer and the film opens with the 'Paramount Mountain'. The rest of the credits are shown with quick views of US urban scenes and TV. Views are partially distorted by clever graphics. Scenes are typical and pleasant. About halfway through though, this reviewer was disturbed to see a few brief seconds of Piers Morgan, and after that the scenes became more sinister, ending with prophecies of doom.The mood changes though when the film proper starts. We are in a suburban house with Gerry and his family. Gerry is played by Brad Pitt. We quickly find out, thanks partially to the TV, that Gerry is a house-husband and that his most important job is making pancakes, however his old job was a lot more dangerous and involved him travelling to dangerous places around the world.After breakfast, Gerry and his family drive through down-town Philadelphia and get caught up in a traffic-jam. They also get caught up as a swarm of zombies engulf this part of town. These scenes are very intense, the pace slackens only after some time, and only then did this reviewer notice their own very accelerated heart-beat.Around St Valentine's Day there was a nice little Rom-com zombie film called 'Warm Bodies', that told the heart-warming story of love conquering all, including zombies. 'World War Z' is not that film. 'WWZ' rather is a fast action horror and thriller (which also makes a few interesting little political points). The only thing that 'WWZ' shares with 'WB' is regarding the speed of the zombies. If, dear reader, your own previous experience of zombies, extends no further than the slow lumbering clumsy zombies, populating the shopping mall, in George A. Romero's 1978 'Dawn of the Dead', (one of a trilogy), then be prepared to be shocked and scared. Like the bonys in 'WB', these zombies can move, and run, very fast indeed. Again, unlike 'DOTD', the gestation period for developing into a zombie is much shortened too in 'WWZ'.The film starts in Philadelphia but there are also scenes of different parts of the world. In reality however many scenes were actually shot in the UK. Most of the opening scenes were shot in Glasgow, Scotland, UK; mostly in and around, George Square. Glasgow, like many North American cities, has a grid-system street layout. So it is then that in a ten minute walk from 'down-town Philly' you can come to the street in 'San Francisco', (this reviewer had always thought "San Francisco!" for many years), where Halle Berry did some filming for 'Cloud Atlas'. Glasgow also has some interesting buildings that could help it pass for many a European city. Previously the Council's City Chambers on George Square have stood in for the Vatican (in 'Heavenly Pursuits'), as well as the Kremlin (in 'An Englishman Abroad').Some have thought the pace slowed later in the film. This reviewer disagrees. The danger from zombies is always there. It would be ridiculous if this film was just one long chase scene. The film starts, like 'War of the Worlds' with the family caught up in the situation, however unlike that film (which seemed to spend half the time in one cellar, and the rest in the US country-side), this film moves around a lot more, various countries are seen. Seen too are the zombies, who are ready, able, and willing, to chase throughout the film, and do too.Brad Pitt should be rightly proud of this very exciting and scary zombie film, (rated 15 in the UK), that he has produced and starred in. If you liked 'War of the Worlds' or you like zombie films then you will enjoy this. Top marks. 10/10.Health Warning: Beware of zombies! They tend to bite and their bite is usually fatal. When being chased by a zombie, or even seeing zombies moving, you may experience an accelerated heart-beat. Most importantly, take all the necessary precautions you can to avoid being bitten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not read the book but I am an avid horror fan and heard (like many of you) that the book was great. That being said I was excited to see the movie and was promptly let down and left with a feeling of meh...I can forgive the cliché virus that instantaneously infects people that seems to rampant in modern "zombie" movies, but this is one of the reasons why this movie does not separate itself from its predecessors. Again, the main character's family is dead weight and often leads the Gerry into trouble. I could not even foster any emotional attachment to any besides Gerry because they pretty much do nothing except whine and shriek. What also bothered me is how predictable everything was. Besides seeing all the exciting scenes in the trailer, all the zombie attacks were triggered by some idiot(s) who make noise or do something stupid. My biggest problem was the title. Why call it World War Z which invokes the imagery of an exciting war with zombies against vast armies when all it was is a guy flying around the world?Now for the actors. Most of them are forgettable except for Brad Pitt who really didn't add much to the movie. Brad Pitt is known for his charm and interesting characters he plays for example, fight club, oceans, moneyball. As an admirer of Brad Pitt, I believe anyone else could have played the part and gotten the same feeling.(SPOILERS) For those who are reading this after watching to confirm your negative opinions... Seriously, the guy freaking shoots himself cause he slips, and why were there only 3 guys defending humanities best hope? Why is Tommy look perfectly fine after his parents were killed and what was the point of having him there? Why are there 4 people in the main wing of the W.H.O. and 80 people in the B wing?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Premise: A virus outbreaks causing millions around the world to have rabbis-like symptoms. How will mankind survive? Review: The idea isn't original, but Max Brooks put it to the test with "real world" situations in his novel World War Z, which is a great zombie novel that I would highly recommend. That being said, WWZ the movie doesn't live up to the hype or book. The main problem I had with it is the camera?it's often times out of focus (how many tops of zombie heads do I need to see), moving around so much that it's actually difficult to see the action on the screen (the camera never seems to find a good angle to film the action), and it doesn't take the time to build up any tension (no, it wasn't scary, it just gave me a headache); unfortunately, all of the best shots are included in the commercials. I'm not exactly sure why it was shot in 3-D other than to make more money as only 10% of the film or less actually makes good use of it. Lastly, like many film that have been touched by the writers from "Lost," it's always interesting to see their unique twists added to the films they're involved with (Prometheus and Star Trek Into Darkness) as two of them worked on the ending to this movie; I honestly didn't think their additions to this film detracted. So, overall, I give it a 4/10 stars. It's slightly entertaining, not original, bad camera angles making the 3-D version worthless, not scary and has an interesting conclusion.</fullReview>

This movie has nothing of these qualities.OK so far everything could be alright with the movie, if there where more trash-scenes in it. A few scenes are so stupid, that you can laugh about the movie-makers, but the majority of the movie is just absolutely boring. Sometimes the setting is so dark that you can't see anything and sometimes just nothing happens.In some scenes the actual cg zombies appear, for example when somebody talks and the camera zooms to his fearful eyes. These scenes are so damn stupid, and these scenes are even repeated a few times in the movie.SO IF YOU EVER HAVE THE CHANCE TO WATCH THIS MOVIE, DON'T TAKE IT!!!

		<fullReview>I was expecting something unique and different that the same-o same-o Z flick. It is as if the movie was a set up for a second movie and THAT movie would be the one that I was expecting. This one was just a cliché, remake of most every Zombie movie made.......except Zombie Land which had comedy and is worth watching.And, Zombie-ism aside, anyone that has studied science beyond the 7th grade will be baffled by most of the outcomes, plot, and decisions; biological, physical, and militarily too. I'll spare the details of these as they would be spoilers but you will see them march across the screen left and right. I look for actual plausibility in a sci-fi action flick....like Jurassic Park or the original War of the Worlds. This is miles from that. Even in the fore-mentioned Zombie Land, which I would classify in a different genre; if one could get over the Zombie-ism...it was plausible. This movie was more Brad Pitt being sought out as the only man on earth that could do any deductive reasoning and then was able to somehow make the conclusion that (and this is a metaphor) that 4+8=26. Sorry, but you will have to watch the show to see what I mean by that metaphor but his and the movie's conclusion follows that line of logic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion 28 days/weeks later is the best zombie film out there so I was expecting a mordernised version of it. I saw the trailer for World War Z and I was absolutely excited, but unfortunately I was left feeling very disappointed.First of all, the 'zombies' in this film were created by a virus which came out of nowhere. There is no story to how everything happened. It just did. And Gerry (Brad Pitt) is given the task to find out where it originated from for some reason. The film states that he's had experience in battle before so he knows his stuff but as of now he's abandoned that profession...so why do they need him when they have perfectly able marines and seals on hand?Additionally, World War Z continuously switches between the enemy being 'infected' or 'zombies' or 'undead'. They are not undead. Undead is where they were previously dead and have been reanimated. They're just zombies. The bite transmission kind. You don't actually see anyone get killed by an infected person.Also, this film was so evidently rushed. At one point Gerry is in South Korea, and then a moment later he's on a plane to Israel. The action scenes last five minutes each and the action involved is short lived and predictable. In fact, Gerry is hardly involved in the action scenes. If you're looking for a zombie film which will thrill you, this film is not what you are looking for. Action is weak, there is no gore, the story is pointless, all of the characters are pretty much expendable...it's amazing it can even be rated as a 15. World War Z. Z, being the sound produce by the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple Yet Very Kinetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simple and typical may be what I may describe this movie. World War Z is good enough not to fall on the classification of lousy or awful. At least it does not drag; the movie is engaging and never ever slows down to cause the slightest bit of boredom. At best, it feels like what I imagine would be a perfectly well-made zombie video game adaptation. I'm sure that the movie has some intellectual or subliminal message hidden in and around the movie, or whatever message the writers want to convey. Whatever it may be, we could not really notice that since the pace of the film is fast and hyperactive. But at least it's never chaotic and messy.On the horror aspect, it effectively does generate some screams and shouts. The scares are moderately efficient, and the zombies do indeed manage to be horrifying, even though they did not need to be extra disgusting and/or gory.Although this may be considered as a zombie movie, it never crosses beyond its PG-13 rating. Meaning, it does not have the usual gore and violence other zombies have. Whatever violence the movie has is never focused or highlighted. It's a horror movie that may be considered "pretty safe" for a younger audience.The problem with World War Z is that it's blown its wad by showing some of the best money shots of the movie on its trailer. The flooding stampede of zombies is the film's most impressive and unique eye candy. We've already seen fast zombies, we've also already seen extra-strong zombies (in "I Am Legend" they're not exactly zombies, but they have similarities with the zombies in this movie), but we've never seen them like this, the way World War Z presents them. On one point of view, it's refreshingly unique, on another point of view; it's a childish, over-bloated exaggeration of the concept.But the flooding, stampeding zombies; that's the movie's one ace card. Aside from that, the movie is pretty simple horror suspense. What happens in the end is not your typical summer blockbuster climax scene; there's nothing extraordinary, like a big boss fight of some kind. With the way it was executed in the end, it felt like an indie horror movie.But just because it has a quiet ending, it does not mean that it was a bad movie. The ending is consistent and fluid. It's not something impossible, incredible, explosive, or cartoonish. It's simple, and it makes sense that way in a manner consistent with the movie's tone. Overall, World War Z is a moderately good zombie movie; entertaining enough to be worth your money and time. But you will not be missing out on anything if you happen to skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just plain terrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both my husband and I thought this movie was terrible. the only link to the book was that..... spoiler.... Israel had a wall. The fact that this movie did not resemble the book wasn't the reason it was so bad either. It was terrible as a stand alone movie and god knows why they wasted their money in a bidding war just to use a name and nothing else. Fast zombies lose their luster quickly when they move faster and are seemingly stronger than human bodies are capable of. The lack of blood was noticeable immediately and coupled with Brad Pitts very dry performance, interfered with my ability to feel any fear or empathy for the character. Brad Pitt seemed to want to look like a hero and in every continent he visited, he had to save someone. I know everyone's complaining about the directing but Im going to lay most of the fault of this utter failure on a very craptastic editing job. The movie was cut to bits, even the opening credits were noticeably boring and the idea overdone. The visual effects were cartoony and outlandish. I cant get on board with a mostly cgi zombie flick when physical make up effects are still superior in the zombie department. Shaky camera throughout and the ending?..... Straight up retarded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the title said, World War Z is a zombie apocalyptic blockbuster that travels across the globe. It sounds like an epic turn to the genre, bringing a larger scale which a terrifying apocalypse movie should be. The film is basically based on a book that serves a couple of interesting ideas. Disappointingly, it lacks enough ambition to the concept and enough exploration to its world's condition which results into a somehow smaller and generic Hollywood blockbuster. What remains is a sort of ridiculous experience as typical blockbusters go. But it's ought to tell a better survival story and the film couldn't apply all that.The plot calls for a different take to the genre. It features some smart innovations about the viruses, but the execution is more like the opposite. The film isn't quite concern on what's going on around the world other than the risks of the protagonist. Instead of an engaging adventure, it's an expanded version of a cliché zombie thriller. A band of random survivors fighting off and running away from the monsters until they decided to look for a cure. To that point, it instantly becomes a totally generic survival movie. The film can still work for its scale if the journey is well developed, but the storytelling is painfully straightforward and isn't interested for decent characterization and exposition.It's more focused on the action and suspense which are the only great parts of the film. It becomes more and more crazy, from usual running zombies until they climb to ridiculous heights by forming a swarm and throwing their own bodies together. The special effects look fine enough to give these creeps some ridiculous movements. The performances at least made the non-action scenes quite entertaining.World War Z is somewhat gripping, but it's really cluttered with generic zombie movie plot points. It's basically like 28 Weeks Later then ends becoming a less ludicrous Resident Evil. It could have been bigger than what the film has shown, but I guess they don't have anymore stories to tell. People might find it a little fun by the visuals, camp, and the performances. In the end, it's going to be difficult to remember all of that. It's amazing how a great source material became a film that is so uninspired. Now it's just plainly about zombies invading the whole world. And just like most blockbusters today, World War Z is fond for explosions and thrills, and nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An expensive computer game still waiting to be made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is a family man, with a wife (Mireille Enos) and two daughters (Abigail Hargrove and Sterling Jerins), who is thrown into an apocalypse where people are being turned into zombies. After he helps his family escape they are escorted onto the safety of a battleship. It is revealed that Gerry is a former U.N. investigator and he is told that his family can only stay onboard if he helps to uncover the secrets surrounding this global disaster. Gerry is forced to travel through numerous countries littered with zombies, including Israel and South Korea. Will he be able to find the cure and reunite with his family? If only the film gave you a single reason to care. Directed by Marc Forster (Quantum of Solace, Finding Neverland), this is a colossal disappointment for a movie that was once unlikely to ever see the light of day. Brad Pitt is a producer on the film as he bought the film rights of Max Brooks' apocalyptic novel ahead of Leonardo DiCaprio. By the time it's over you'll wonder why he bothered. The film is rumoured to have had its budget ballooned out to nearly two-hundred million dollars, as well as speculation about rewrites of the ending and an ongoing feud between the film's main star and director. As you watch the film it's not hard to see many of these problems visible on the screen. To counter the budget blowout they've taken the easy option by diluting the film down into a derivative action movie. Brook's novel is a collection of faux U.N. reports, outlining the observations of a zombie apocalypse. The film has the very basic framework of the book in that its join the dots plot shifts Gerry from one continent to another. Yet there is so little time spent on establishing Gerry or his family that the movie is emotionally inert. For all of the holes in its science, Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds is a comparable and superior film. It spent more time establishing the family dynamics and the characters so that the action was meaningful, tense and involving. The terrible reactions of the humans were a lot more interesting and damaging than the aliens themselves. World War Z has scenes of looting and post-9/11 images too but when we know so little about the central character and Pitt's performance is uncharacteristically dull, it's extremely difficult to care. The film is also terribly impatient. After one family scene together it bolts straight into action scene from the trailer where the cars are blocked and attacked in the street. This is one of many setpieces used to substitute the humanity, characters and plotting. These big showy moments are all choreographed to the same rhythms and beats: Gerry enters a new country, the next stage of the plot is explained and then the zombies strike. As with Quantum, Forster believes that cutting as quickly as possible makes the film more intense. There are a few jumps but the film is murky, bloodless and at worst cartoonish. Where is the tension when Gerry can lob a grenade inside a plane, become impaled and still survive the subsequent crash-landing? The only interesting setpiece is towards the end of the film when Gerry starts using his surroundings more by relying on sound to avoid or call the zombies. If the film has any subtext at all, it is the cornball message of the world finding its savior of mankind, who is simultaneously the preserver of American family values, fighting against the unknown and the outsiders. Largely though, it's an expensive computer game still waiting to be made, and a hurried, overproduced film that should have impressed considering the hype, talent and money behind it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z - is inevitable ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The white man has done something wrong and it's spread all over the world. They claim the "source" of the disease that transforms the dead into the walking dead is elsewhere, but you know the U.S. has its hand in it. Brad goes all over the world to find a clue. You know that the Jews are involved in the script because they even went to Israel, a nation usually kept out of any movie that has to do with a pandemic because the blame for such disasters is usually blamed on brown people from the Middle East. I'll spoil it from you: the zombies will only attack and eat you if you're healthy, Brad Pitt -- (again, the 'super man" is motif is apparent from the beginning to the end of this film) "discovers" based on his personal observations. This is a theme borrowed from "Species," where black Mykelti Williamson was not approached by the sexy alien because he had sickle cell trait. But he notices, deduces and otherwise "solves" a problem that has escaped every scientist on earth. And although it's only a theory, he turns out correct and saves the day. Again, he is ex-military, has medical training, and is fearless as he leaves his family to head to all parts of the world to search for the source of the virus. He even survives the crash of a jetliner! As was the case in "The Purge," and "White House Down," the "super white man" risks his own health by injecting himself with a virus and then, to test it on the spot, walk down a hallway filled with maniacal and hungry zombies. At any rate the solution is to infect everybody with some kind of virus which will render that person invisible as far as the zombies are concern. "Then we can fight and defeat them," Brad says at one point. Let me get this straight: infect yourself with something that will make you sick and possibly kill you so that you won't get killed by a zombie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'World War Z' may not be the perfect story or character-driven movie we wanted it to be, but its incredible action sequences and suspenseful situations deserve a look.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We begin in downtown Philadelphia with retired United Nations investigator Gerry Lane (Pitt), his wife Karen (Mireille Enos) and their two young daughters. While they're stuck in heavy traffic, the zombie apocalypse hits the city with a vengeance. Within a matter of seconds, thousands of people have turned into bloodthirsty and incredibly fast-moving zombies. Gerry moves his family and calls his former boss to rescue them from a nearby housing project rooftop. They're taken to a temporary refuge aboard several naval ships anchored in the Atlantic Ocean.Things move very quickly, and not in a good way. It seems like everybody's first thought and first action is always the right one, and nothing is ever explained in full. For example, it's never explained why Gerry is the only man capable of stopping and solving the zombie outbreak; he just is. As Gerry embarks on a worldwide journey to find answers, his first stop is South Korea, where he meets a team of elite soldiers and scientists looking for solutions. Gerry only listens and follows the advice of a former operative who has been relegated to a prison cell for treason. This former operative informs him that North Korea has fixed the zombie outbreak by enforcing a mandatory teeth extraction from every citizen, but that he will find more answers in Israel.After a suspenseful attack, Gerry jets off to Jerusalem, where the city has erected a six-story concrete wall to keep out the undead. Inside this wall, life is back to normal, but as soon as Gerry arrives, the zombies somehow manage to climb the wall and destroy the city in a matter of minutes. This escape scene is pretty spectacular and frightening, even if aspects of it don't make sense at all. But that seems to be the theme of the movie so far. During the escape, Gerry comes across a wounded female solider named Segen (Daniella Kertesz), whom he takes on the last plane out of Israel. His contacts aboard the naval ship then tell him to head to Wales, where a medical research facility is still intact.When a scary incident forces their plane to make an emergency crash landing, Segen and Gerry stumble upon the facility where the climactic finale takes place. This is the segment of the film that the studio demanded be rewritten, reshot and re- edited many times over. Gerry and Segen, along with a couple of remaining scientists, have to navigate a maze-like research facility full of zombies to get hold of a certain solution that could perhaps put a stop to this zombie outbreak that has by now engulfed most of the world's population. These particular final moments are completely different in tone than what we've seen prior to this moment, by way of adding a slow and suspenseful situation, rather than the high-octane action scenes that came before. It's not a wrong decision, just a strange one. Then, as if the movie has no more budget or time left, everything gets wrapped up very quickly in a vague matter, but not before Brad Pitt takes a long cool drink of Pepsi.There are certain aspects to 'World War Z' that work very well. The zombies themselves are fairly frightening. They turn instantly after being bitten, and develop super strength and super speed to attack their prey. They hurl their bodies at full force, even off buildings, to attack. They twitch and move in ways that human bodies aren't made to move. As heavy as this movie is on action sequences, one would hope for some pretty incredible action beats. Luckily for us, the filmmakers deliver that on a silver platter. Never before have we witnessed a zombie epidemic on this grand a scale. From the helicopter shots that show literally hundreds of thousands of the undead running for food and biting people whenever they get a chance, to the intense zombie outbreak aboard a plane in mid-air, you're guaranteed to be on the edge of your seat. I only wish that the filmmakers had put this much effort into the characters or story.Pitt of course does an amazing job as the leading man. He's set on saving the world and is fully believable in such a position. The rest of the supporting cast aren't A- listers, but still do the job. I think we would have been taken out of the whole experience if the supporting cast was full of Academy Award winners. Kertesz sticks out as a fresh face who holds her own alongside Pitt. Sadly, gore fans will be sorely disappointed as there isn't a drop of blood or any decent flesh-eating scenes in the entire flick.One thing that I liked most about 'World War Z' is that, for the first time since '28 Days Later', I didn't fantasize about wanting to be in a zombie outbreak afterwards. Movies like 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Zombieland' make it seem like a fun and a wild ride to be involved in this sort of apocalyptic situation. But with this flick, I found myself scared to even think of such a worldwide infection happening. Instead of watching people kill zombies in unusual and creative ways, we mostly see people running from them and unable to defend themselves, even with the most dangerous weapons. It gives the movie a realistic aspect that is all too horrifying.'World War Z' may not be the perfect story or character-driven movie we wanted it to be, but its incredible action sequences and suspenseful situations deserve a look, despite all of the film's flaws.</fullReview>

Almost unheard of to be honest. The last time she was gripped by something cinematic like this was the entire Band of Brothers series.We do NOT do zombie films, horror films, slasher films or anything of that ilk so we have been somewhat reticent to watch this.It is in our opinion not a 'zombie movie', it is a movie which has zombies as a part of the story line.We found it exciting, gripping and really hugely enjoyable.Watch it and decide for yourself, don't listen to negative comments from schloick horror fans, it was never meant to be in that genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You kind of get what you expected as it is similar to many other movies, this is the kind of movie where as usual 1 American goes through hell, risking his life and at the end saves the whole world by finding a vaccine, that ''camouflages'' people so they don't arise interest of the zombies. Aside from the predictability of this movie it was well filmed, packed with action, very fast paced, of course, had Brad Pitt in the leading role, a classical movie, no big surprises, but it's still enjoyable. Anyone who likes zombie movies or movies about a huge infection spreading through the whole world will surely find this movie great. One thing that stood out was that Brad Pitt actually showed some pain from his injury at the end where he was running around the medical research facility, in most of the movies a metal going through your whole stomach is not a big deal and characters don't usually even feel any pain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that bad, but a perfect example of hollywoods horrible film standards.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to start talking about "the old days", mainly because I am not nearly old enough to be around back then, but Hollywood can't get anything right nowadays. First off, I actually saw this before I read the book, and now I have read the book and realized they left out all the book's key elements: While the book was shockingly graphic and very violent, with thousands of people being killed, this film has practically no blood, even the unrated version could have passed as PG-13 like 15 years ago! I'm not just mad because it's bloodless, but because a movie about most of the world being wiped out and murdered, probably would have some blood, but no- none during attacks and none on the streets. The best blood we get is on a few of the zombies. The book had details on battles, fake cures, safe houses, effective weapons, and global impact. The film features the global impact, and nothing else. It's very frustrating because the book is a recipe for the perfect zombie film- just remove the interview style and you've got the base for one of the best zombie films ever made. I'm not trying to tell you that you will not be entertained or scared, because you will, but that this is not for someone expecting a zombie flick. This is much more a fast-paced action movie (like every film now that's not a comedy or a romance/drama). It's just a great example of Hollywood's way of using the same plot and same watered down rating for every movie until they get lucky and actually make something successful or decent. On the bright side, World war Z does include some breathtaking scenes of the zombie takeover, and an old school ending, but just don't expect The walking dead or Dawn of the dead, or any other real zombie film/show, or you will be disappointed. Just enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've seen this movie before - but under so many different titles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm no fan of the zombie genre, but having seen nearly 1,000 movies in my day, I thought "What the heck, it's free" before viewing it just now on Amazon Prime. Well, I do pay a membership fee.Before I go on to pan this film I want to say that for a genre I don't like, it was well made and not gratuitous with the violence. They could have been quite graphic when Pitt dispatches a zombie with a crowbar, but they appreciably spared me the obvious carnage. Pitt was actually good this time around.There were moments when I felt the tension and fear that one could imagine they'd feel if they were to find themselves in such circumstances, but this movie played like one of those "Resident Evil" offerings - and in typical Hollywood fashion - accompanied by a message that came across not too subtly. I don't wish to divulge my thoughts on that as it is better suited for a political conversation.The elements of the film I didn't like were, again, the subject of the undead, which is preposterous. The downfall of civilization. The fall of governments. The smell of anarchy. Martial law. All things that are part and parcel of the mood in the wealthiest parts of the Hollywood scene and those whom support our Celebrity-in-Chief and what he stands for.One scene has a character saying "If he chooses any (of the bacteria or viruses in the vault) from the left, he's already dead" and we see Pitt's character do just that. Then later, it is implied that every human that isn't a zombie can be inoculated with it. Yay, happy ending. But since I'm no virologist, I'll digress.Being that this was a sci-fi backdrop I was able to suspend my disbelief in order to allow myself to be entertained. And that's what makes this movie unworthy of a higher rating. It played out like so many movies I have seen where the protagonist is well-connected, separated from his family, sacrifices life and limb to reach an objective, and countless antagonists are mowed down before the closing monologue of scenes of reunion, hugs and kisses.At least this wasn't one of those often-used broken family premises ala the remake of "War Of The Worlds".If you have young teens or older, they'll want to rent this one because I assume the zombie-mania has not ebbed one bit. That's probably why this is Brad Pitt's highest-grossing film to date. If you want to exercise your brain, pick another title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For all its talk and special effects , the result is rather flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's best to start by saying that the trailer for World War Z was just superb- dramatic, tense and action-packed. It was indeed the trailer that convinced me, and I'm sure many others , to watch this movie. You can probably see where this is going...the movie never really lived up to the hype.The film revolves around a global pandemic that causes people , once infected (bitten) , to attack each other. Naturally it contains lots of dramatic action scenes but as the plot progresses it becomes apparent that it relies too much on these and as a result the film does stall in parts. I'm not saying it's boring but it certainly doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat for two hours. Brad Pitt is reasonably good as the main character , Gerry Lane , albeit rather clichéd - the typical family man called back into action to save mankind ..it's certainly nothing original. Neither is the dialogue , some of which is particularly cringe-worthy. A particular disappointment was Matthew Fox's remarkably minor role as a paratrooper - he appears in two scenes and gave one line of dialogue. That is a massive let-down as a movie like this would have been so much better if he had had a bigger role.The biggest falter of World War Z is it's lack of emotional resonance. The director made the fatal mistake of thinking the audience could be entertained for two hours through expensive action pieces. In doing so, he lost focus on the most important aspect- the story ( and more specifically the characters ). So much time of the movie revolves around Pitt that it prevents other characters from being developed. Numerous characters die in the movie but since they aren't properly developed, the audience don't really care. Also, the relationship between Gerry and his family diminishes as they hardly feature in the second half of the movie.World War Z is a pretty average action-disaster movie. The action pieces are tremendous but cannot compensate for the lack of substance in the story. The ending sets the movie up for a definite sequel , in which I hope will contain a much better story and supporting cast. If they can achieve that, then the follow-up could actually be the blockbuster we were anticipating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a few sci-fi films that are not just mayhem and action. There are sci-fi films that contain mayhem, action, and stupidity. World War Z is about an ex United Nations worker (Brad Pitt) who embarks on a mission to find a way to save the world from the current zombie apocalypse. World War Z has a couple of intense scenes, but for the most part it gets repetitive. Not a single character is interesting or well- acted, the action is minimal, and the ending is ridiculous. The film gets to the point where it is so fast pace that it fells like the zombie apocalypse lasted an hour before the climax. The visual effects is nothing we haven't seen, causing disappointment in my review. The thing that drove me crazy in this film is that it didn't keep any sense of reality at all. In films with impossible plots like in 'World War Z' it is good to keep a least some sense of reality. It doesn't! The film moves so fats, the events that occur during action sequences are ridiculous, and the whole solution in the story is laughable. Don't be expecting a film with great zombies, instead they look like normal people. It's great to have a popcorn film once and a while, but at least see one that is somewhat good and not ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generic zombie movie, with A-grade production and star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generic zombie movie, with A-grade production and star. Zombie movies have always been a B-grade type of movie. The cheap production values fitted well with the apocalyptic horror of the genre. Add to this the fact that every zombie drama has pretty much the same main plot, and it's a recipe for easily making hundreds of movies which are fairly indistinguishable from each other.The only innovations in zombie movies have come in zombie-comedies, which are often parodies of zombie dramas. Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead are the best examples of these. Warm Bodies was probably the most original zombie movie since the first one, as it took a very different tact. Plus, it was half-comedy.Plot-wise, World War Z isn't anything new. Where WWZ is different is that it has A-grade production values and a mega-name star. Take those away and it could be just another zombie movie.This said, the special effects and other big-budget features do help. The scale of the movie is huge, and makes the production seem so real. Makes you think that what happens in WWZ could well happen in real life.Performance-wise, Brad Pitt does his usual action-hero plus caring- family-man routine, and does it well. His appearance must have used up almost the entire acting budget, as there are no other big names in the movie (unless you are a fan of The Thick of It: good to see Peter Capaldi land a Hollywood role). David Morse, Matthew Fox and Moritz Bleibtrau have minor roles.Reasonably entertaining, but nothing special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World Wars A through Y?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Are they ever going to explain what happened during World Wars 'A' through 'Y'?Typically, I don't watch movies more than once. Probably because I'm anti-contrarian.It's why people think I'm a hero.I'm kidding, but I generally avoid repeated viewings.You might think this strange, but there are still plenty of winners waiting in my unseen ether.This inventive new take on the zombie apocalypse grips you within the first ten minutes, and never relents.Wawazee is one of my top five films of 2013.I'm nearly positive the opening shot is in homage to Dawn of the Dead, but apparently am the only one who's noticed.Sure, the CGI's not immaculate, but that's nitpickery.The pacing may slow down at moments, but even the dreamy Brad Pitt (as Gerry Lane) needs the occasional breather. But it doesn't slow for me; I care throughout the snappy action and all the space between.Besides. With such a well-rounded narrative unfolding around Mr. Pitt's international adventures, the audience needs reminding that these great action scenes, take place within a well-thought- out story.Anyhow. This film has the second best rating: PG-13.It's rare to find a movie that veils this deficiency so adequately.The supporting cast is excellent. There are several characters you grow to love by the end of the film. Although none from Gerry's immediate family, come to think of it.Don't be a square and turn your nose up at WWZ. It's not 'just another zombie movie.'It's a wonderful film.But spoilers follow; so if you haven't seen it yet, tear your gaze from this wildly compelling review!World War Z takes place in several settings across the Earth. Bradley's pit stops begin after fleeing with his family from Philadelphia to Newark, NJ. Then he journeys alone onto Jerusalem, Wales and finally reunites with his family back in Nova Scotia.The only real criticism I have is that even after two viewings, I'm not 100% certain why the Jurgen Warmbrunn (played by Ludi Boeken) character's necessary to the plot.More specifically, I'm confused about how his position as the '12th' man (or the one who must always disagree) on the Israeli council relates to the greater conflict. But honestly, I really don't care; I'm sure there's a reason I'm just not seeing.I won't go too in depth about the cast, but I think Daniella Kertesz's performance as Segen, is spectacular.Not to get too abstract here, but the scene where Gerry severs Segen's hand, is one of those 'magical cinematic moments.' My best description of this emotional swell is 'breathtaking,' cliché as it is. But watching that scene I feel extreme tension, elation and a deep appreciation for the writing; all within a short moment.James Badge Dale as Captain Speke delivers an exceptional performance as well. It gets a little dusty in the theater when his character says goodbye.The scenes in the apartment complex, the two separate calamities on different runways, the chase through the streets of Jerusalem, the plane crash, the World Health Organization; all are so, so good.By the way, I hear there's going to be a sequel?If so, you can count me in.But we better find out about the other twenty-five World Wars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Henry and Kristl engaged in World War Z (2013)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Z means zombies, I suppose?," Kristl remarked."Sure," Henry nodded."So?""It is about Zombies," Henry said in a matter of fact voice."I can see as much..""Zombies for the masses," Henry added, "For people who do not like the icky bits. Like the walking dead.""Like me.. I am a regular squeamish person. Warfare okay.. but people gnawing other people... No.""So what do you think?" "Think? Is that required in a movie like this?""Geez, Kristl..."Okay....I think that Brad Pitt is a good actor.""I agree.""I would have been honored to have Pitt for my spouse...""but...""If I was inclined that way..." "But you are not.. so we skip to the sensible part, which means:it was a cool movie, but hampered.""Take it away," Kristl said."Oh.. well I liked Brad Pitt. He carries the movie without a doubt, but the movie has buckled under the inept story. I mean each and every scene is cool to look at and in itself a good scene, but it is as if they had like way too much story on their hands, so instead of boiling it down to manageable proportions they overreached themselves.""Seems so.""Still the zombies are cool.. when they swarm you and scream and change," Henry said."Yeah.""This is the problem. Each setting is but briefly used, no character development or story arc has time to develop before they fly off to the next scene. So we start in the US, go to a fleet, then fly to Korea, then to Israel, then we are in a Russian airplane flying to Wales and finally we are in Wales. Each setting is a whole scene with characters and a background and we skip the scene before we get 'settled in'," Henry said.".. which would not have been too bad if they had Brad accompanied by a group of people. Like they do after Israel with Segen. But they should have tried and stick to a limited group of characters, maybe one for each scene he picks up so we can get involved with them, care for them and are shocked when they are killed or whatever," Henry continued."Now Brad has to do that all on his own," Kristl said."Yeah, if they had done that I think that all the other problems would have been less of a problem.""Lol, like Segen picking up a two handed weapon while she misses a hand," Kristl laughed."Or building a wall against zombies because you have information on their existence, but forgetting they react to sound and then have a group of people sing just behind the wall, so the zombies get attracted and assault it.""Did you ever get that idea of the tenth man in Israel?""Yeah, I understand the concept, but they never quite explained how he convinced them and, what is more, why did they not warn their allies? I mean they made a wall. It is not something you just put up in a week. Israel building a wall would not go unnoticed even if it took them a week," Henry said."I think that was implied," Kristl laughed."The movie has many nice settings and a good cast, but the story seems to have collapsed under it's own weight and for sure the script writers are to blame for the shortcomings.. I read that originally the movie was different with a final battle in Russia. Which stands to reason as the plane that takes them from Israel is Russian.""So an okay movie, but with many shortcomings. But saved by Brad Pitt.""We could call it maybe World War B?""Sounds good to me.""Even if you are not inclined that way.""Oh God, I will get that thrown in my face from now on. I know it will.""Kristl likes Brad," Henry grinned.Kristl tried to boot Henry, but he saw it coming.www.meritcoba.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved this movie!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why oh why do so many have to be so critical when it comes to good ole' fashioned zombie movies? There is no such thing as a "perfect movie" folks and if you think there ever will be then disappointment is definitely in your future. I found WWZ to be extremely entertaining and suspenseful and also very entertaining to not have had blood and guts spewing every 5 minutes. So why do so many have such negative things to say about this? On a lot of movies I view on IMDb it seems that regardless of whatever movie I viewed, there were far more negative comments than positive. So I've come to the conclusion that most people only get online and write reviews when they're disappointed in whatever it is they decided to go see. But, when people are pleased or walk out of a theater saying it was the best movie ever then they're not going to take the time to go online and write about it because they feel no need. Why is that? Why do people feel obligated to express their opinions when they are displeased with something but completely ignore it if it satisfies them? I just don't understand it is all and I read the reviews before watching this movie and went into it with an already negative approach and when it was over I was just in awe. Not only was I impressed with the acting and whole movie period but I was appalled at the negative reviews. So I say give it another chance. If you saw it and was unhappy, try it again. I absolutely loved it;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This isn't a zombie movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why did they send him? why was he the expert? if communication was so good between locations, why didn't they just email or radio-call these places instead of physically landing and getting the main character to talk to people? This isn't a zombie movie at all. You believe there is some threat to the main character in a zombie movie. When a guy goes to several locations and escapes an orc-like zombie mob again and again, it's as if he's invincible. Superman vs the Zombies. Why doesn't that concept work for 2 hours? This film had very little tension or horror. You can make anything jump-scare you."Yay! pancakes for breakfast!" - that sums up the relationships/character-building in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Z stands for ZZZZ!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start this review I must say I have only ever seen 2 other zombie films and they are Zombieland and Warm Bodies and I thought those were brilliant films. With this is mind lets get on with the review for World War Z.The start of this looked promising with Brad Pitt and his family trying to escape the hundreds of zombies from Philadelphia but after they escape the film goes down hill. After Brad Leaves the ship his wive and kids are not seen until the end of the film and the ending in disappointing. Its not all bad though Brad Pitt is brilliant in this and the zombies look amazing. It becomes good when Brad goes to Jerusalem and the zombies get clever and climb each over to get over the walls and invade the planes.I hoped this film didn't do that well at the box office so they don't make another and I hope the company lost a lot of money for making this rubbish film. Stay away from the zombie genre Brad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flat, unexciting latest addition to the zombie staple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningGerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is a retired UN worker who has taken his family out on an ordinary, everyday trip, only, for, well, zombies to suddenly start running around out of nowhere and killing everybody. Being the hero of a Hollywood movie, naturally he gets himself and his family to safety, and gets in touch with his old muckers at the UN to find out what's going on, and they end up taking him away from his family to lead a trek over to Israel to discover the source of the mayhem, and look for a cure to stop it before it's too late.Shot in a new, almost experimental digitally altered lens, World War Z is the latest film to re-hash the 'zombie' genre, already explored by the likes of I Am Legend and Dawn of the Dead, not to mention Brit entries like 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later. So originality isn't the name of the game here (when is it in Hollywood these days?) and with the bar set so low, you'd expect this knock off of other films before it to at least try and take the genre in a different direction. But World War Z simply explodes in to the action within the first few minutes, without any sort of attempt at character development, meaning we could simply care less about the fate of these characters, which makes the ensuing ride all the more tedious.Impressive zombie effects can't hide a banal, boring script that's lost your attention within the first few minutes. As such, lead star Pitt blandly goes through the motions, at the hands of slovenly direction from Marc Forster. Sometimes these types of films can try and have some kind of hidden social message to them or deeper significance, but it's hard to pick up anything here. Despite being the type of film it would probably have been better to have seen there, this failed to draw me to the cinema to see it, and I left it to DVD, where it's minimal impact is felt even less. Not so much World War Z, more World War Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Certainly Z grade. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It fails as an apocalyptic film but works as an OK action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have finally just got round to watching World War Z after all the hyperbole has died down.Now I must make it clear that I read and thoroughly enjoyed the book when it was first published and that I agree with all those other critics' who question the film's faithfulness to its source material and that it is was indeed a real opportunity wasted to make a worthwhile and credible film about global politics and the fragility of human society. Zombies in the Romeronian sense have always acted as a visual metaphor for society's cultural Other, yet this film lacks such depth and therefore I think it is only fair that the film should be considered in isolation, that we forget about its faithfulness to its source material and view the film for what it is ?a Hollywood star vehicle and money making visual blockbuster.-If we keep this in mind then the film is not as bad as everyone has made out.There is a lot to be admired in the film. Brad Pitt is steady as always and some of the set pieces including the beginning in Philadelphia and the scene in Jerusalem are visually impressive. The decision to make the zombie's fast rather than lumbering as in Romero's films makes sense and it gives the film a sense of dynamism which is administered effectively in the set pieces. Also I think the lack of gore as some fan boys have complained about does not detract from the overall film and there are a number of jump out of your seat scares, although these do become predictable after a while.Of course there is nothing original about this film, there is nothing being offered here that we haven't seen before and done better. This is a shame, but given the amount of money invested in this film is it any surprise they played it safe? We can also sit and pick apart the plot holes until the cows come home, they are numerous but it still shouldn't detach from the overall film, I mean how many times do we watch the Die Hard films and think "no, that wouldn't happen!" This is pure visual popcorn fodder and as such it does a competent, sometimes good but never amazing job.Where the film really falls down is in its lack of overall cohesiveness. It feels like a series of separate spectacular action sequences loosely tied together with poor dialogue. Brad Pitt's love for his family is unconvincing and the story of human survival which should have underpinned the whole story is seriously underplayed. As such the film just doesn't work as a whole and you come away at the end feeling a little cheated, a little unsatisfied. As a huge fan of apocalyptic cinema in general I found the film disappointing because it plays down the human struggle and it really doesn't have a lot to say. Given the promise of its source material this could have been spectacular addition to the genre if it had been placed in the hands of the right director. Nonetheless, zombie films have always tended to be more niche in cinematic terms and have not always fostered mass appeal. This was a huge blockbuster film made especially for mass appeal so it is understandable why certain generic elements take centre stage.In view of this the film works better as an action film that just so happens to be about zombies but really they could have been anything and the film would still feel the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mindless Action and PG-13 Zombies; Weak, but Serviceable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WORLD WAR Z was everything I expected from director Marc Forster, the man behind QUANTUM OF SOLACE. It's an action-centric PG-13 zombie film with a major actor in the foreground to draw in mainstream audiences for a guaranteed box office success. I've heard nothing but awesome buzz about the novel from Max Brooks that loans the movie its title (and apparently not much else) but I've not had a chance to read it before seeing the movie. I suppose this might've helped me keep a more unbiased perspective when watching it, since I wouldn't spend the movie grumbling about all the wasted potential in the source material. Nope, instead I had my own series of gripes with the film. Primarily, I hated that the movie seemed more interested in crafting major action sequence after major action sequence than actually creating an engaging plot. I wouldn't go so far as to call WORLD WAR Z a bad movie, but it's certainly the epitome of mindless summer entertainment. The movie follows former U.N. investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) as he and his family struggle to survive once the zombie apocalypse erupts across the world. Once his family is secured on a naval vessel, Lane is roped into joining an investigation into the origins of the zombie epidemic. Lane jets off to start his investigation in South Korea and will follow the trail around the globe in hopes of finding the source and, maybe, a cure or vaccine to save the planet from collapsing under the scourge of the undead.Let's start with a minor quibble. What sort of fun can you expect from a PG-13 zombie film? Seriously. Zombies are rotting, shambling undead with a hunger for human flesh. But WORLD WAR Z spares us any real violence or gore associated with the zombie genre, instead giving us swarms of indistinguishable zombies and bursts of mostly bloodless gunfire. The zombies in the film are (mostly) your typical fast-sprinting, growling beasts. Some discoloration of the skin and a bit of blood around the mouth, with the occasional bit of facial deterioration when you're lucky enough to see one up close. No disembowelments or half- mangled zombies with their insides out. It's all toned down to fit into its more audience friendly PG-13 rating. The zombies are treated as more of a global virus, swarming and climbing over obstacles in tidal waves of faceless monsters. Their shot and blown up without any payoff and the victims are never more than tackled and vaguely munched on, convulsing on the ground before jumping up to join the masses. I don't know. Maybe I'm just old- fashioned but I miss when zombies weren't yowling athletes who run down their prey at super speeds. This leads into my next major problem with WORLD WAR Z?This movie is all about the massive action sequences. Plot takes a back seat to elaborate action scenes on a global scale. As if to make sure you know what you're in for, the movie gives you little to no time to introduce its characters. We get five minutes of a family pancake breakfast with Gerry, his wife, and their two daughters before we're thrown right in to the first major action scene: the fall of Philadelphia. From then on, we get bits of character development to fill the quiet moments between explosive action scenes as Gerry begins his globetrotting mission. The scenes themselves are pretty impressive. I'm not going to deny that. When the zombies invade Jerusalem, it's a pretty awesome sight; and the initial chaos in Philadelphia sets the tone for the film pretty effectively. My problem isn't with the action or its execution; it's that it's the main focus of the movie. Just as with QUANTUM OF SOLACE, the plot here is nothing but filler for when people aren't running from zombies or slaughtering them by the dozen. The best part of the whole movie (for me) was the final act when Lane arrives at a World Health Organization center in Wales where the bombastic action steps aside and allows for some quiet suspense. The Wales portion of the film is exactly the sort of stuff I love in a zombie movie. Taut and thrilling with our main character stalking through a facility trying to avoid confrontation as opposed to just running in, guns blazing. I thought the final resolution was a nice touch. Lane's major discovery that is meant to turn the tide of the war against the zombies is an interesting development, but I wonder how it took so long for someone to formulate that theory. Someone had to have noticed it before Lane had his realization so late into the zombie war. Whatever. Thoughtful storytelling isn't exactly this movie's strongest point.WORLD WAR Z is a perfect example of mindless summer action. Leave your brain at the door when you settle in for this one and try to find fun in all the gunfire and zombie hordes. You won't want to try and think about this one too hard. Kudos to Brad Pitt for his role in the film. Pitt's a great actor and he brings some gravitas to a genre that doesn't often see big name stars in the cast. He does the best he can with pretty weak material, but he's mostly just running from Point A to Point B while avoiding becoming some zombie's next meal. The visual effects are great and the final act attempts to redeem the movie's otherwise shallow, lazy nature. WORLD WAR Z is far from memorable and I suppose its greatest success was provoking me into reading the novel to see what I've missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast-moving action thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the book by Max Brooks, "World War Z" is a gripping, adrenaline-pumping thriller about a worldwide zombie apocalypse (a phrase that is fast becoming one of the most overused in modern pop culture).Brad Pitt plays a retired UN employee, now stay-at-home dad, who barely makes it out of Philadelphia alive with his wife ("The Killing's Mireille Enos in a largely insignificant role) and two little daughters as the zombie attacks spring up seemingly out of nowhere. Because of his previous experience maneuvering through arduous situations, he is sent out into the world to find answers as to how the plague may have started and to discover what possible remedies there might be to keep the human race from literally devouring itself into nonexistence.These are not the shambling, foot-dragging zombies of the Romero films or TV's "The Walking Dead." They're not only fleet of foot but are able to scale seemingly impenetrable walls by piling one on top of the other like a cheerleader pyramid on steroids (in their speed, they actually have more in common with the creatures in the "24 Days Later" series). This may make them a lot harder to outrun, but it robs them of some of the creepiness we normally associate with the zombie figure.Because the movie is done on a global rather than intimate scale, it lacks the haunting, soul-searing dread and emotional desolation of a work like "The Walking Dead." In contrast, "Z" feels more like a grand action movie but, even as such, it hits all the right notes. Thanks to Brooks' beat-the-clock scenario (adapted herein by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof) and Marc Foster's full-throttle direction, the audience rarely gets the chance to relax the muscles, as we hurtle right along with Pitt from one close-call encounter with a baffling, seemingly intractable enemy to the next.Not all that memorable really, but entertaining while it's going on.</fullReview>

Bradd Pitt carries this film, although it was so nice from him to hire unknown actors to work with him. Please go watch this film, you will have fun!The only weak point in the film is the end, it somehow ends too abruptly. I like Bradd Pitt and Angelina Jolie so much, they are such a nice people, their work around the globe is precious. When they were coming to Sarajevo I tried to meet them but I was not successful, well never mind I wish both of them make many good films which all of us will enjoy.

I would absolutely advise checking this out one time if you are a horror fan. A different spin on the zombie genre that i believe intelligent movie goers will find above average. Everyone is allowed to have an opinion, but some of these reviews are flat out horrible in terms of being able to convince the reader that this movie was sooo bad, without coming of like biased jerks. For that reason I always scan through a few pages of reviews to find intelligent takes on films if i am on the fence about a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different perspective on the zombie genre that works!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie was coming out, I didn't really want to see it because I felt I had enough of big blockbuster zombie movies for one lifetime, but when I finally did get to see it I found it really different from other zombie movies out there. There were several differences in the movie "World War Z", differences that sets the film apart from others such as "Dawn of the Dead", "Resident Evil" and the classic that started it all, "Night of the Living Dead." "World War Z"stars Brad Pitt as a United Nation hotshot (Gerry Lane) who is living with his family when the zombie outbreak begins in the heart of Philadelphia. Utter chaos ensues as the living dead take over and begin to turn frightened humans into an exponentially growing hoard of the walking dead. Due to his prowess and skills learned through years with the U.N, Gerry gets his family to safety and then embarks on a journey to find the cause of the virus and stop the pandemic. "WWZ" stands out among all of the other zombie movies because the film is not about surviving the zombie apocalypse and the degradation of society once every human is fighting for their own survival. "WWZ" takes the audience on a journey of attempting to understand how a pandemic of this magnitude is possible in the present, and begs not the "What do we do from here?" question, but "Where did this come from, how can we stop it?" making the plot of "WWZ" extremely intriguing. In most zombie films, the only way to deal with living dead is to completely destroy all brain activity in the ghoul, whether it be from a shotgun shell to the head, decapitation, or severing the spinal cord. "WWZ" however, uses a scientific/detective- like search for a cure or vaccine to undead virus and in the end uses an ingenious way to fool zombies into not attacking living flesh. In this way, "WWZ" brilliantly flips the art of avoiding zombies on its head. But, a lot of people out there criticize this movie because it had nothing to do with Max Brook's book with the same title. In "World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War", Max Brooks writes of several tales, happening all around the world, interwoven with each other as society tries to survive the living dead. There is no solid plot line, no connection of stories with each other and no real beginning or end- a great fiction read. The intentions of the film "WWZ" were to provide a plot and center on one character and the journey through the pandemic. One cannot compare the two, or criticize for their lack of similarity because they are two different pieces of work. "WWZ" was not an attempt to adapt the book, merely using the book as a guideline and for the name, which in itself sparked major interest. In the end, the movie "World War Z" gives a refreshing take on the zombie genre and may lead to possibilities that have not yet been explored. Simple twists to the zombie apocalypse framework of hundreds of movies before, creates a different, highly profitable and more relatable horror movie reaching a higher number of movie watchers than ever before. The film should not be discounted because of its name and relation to a fiction novel, but should be viewed on its own as the instant classic and welcomed addiction to any zombie movie collection. See it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A zombie film that entered production hell, very much like a zombie, the film had to be revived with re shoots and a different ending. The result a modest success even though the film is not without flaws.Pitt with his long, ironed hair which must surely be contender for best supporting actor Oscar (the hair that is, not Pitt) plays a former UN troubleshooter who left to raise his kids in New York city when suddenly an outbreak occurs where people bite each other and soon become zombiefied with blood-lust.In order to protect his family Pitt with a virologist goes to Korea to locate the outbreak of the source and a possible answer. Well the virologist takes a nasty fall and Pitt ends up in Israel and later Wales where he might have discovered a chink in this worldwide pandemic.World War Z is an adaptation of a popular book but the liberties were taken with the adaptation especially the ending as the original cut of the film was deemed to be too grim.The film has great scenes of panic with zombies on the loose, zombies attacking as a team as in Israel but some of the lines and scenes make you wince with its cheesiness and lapses in logic.This does not mean its terrifically entertaining, with the film starting off the blocks with a bang, there are some visceral scenes depending which cut of the film you have seen and it does rack up the tension.Its rather refreshing to see a film being so successful when it had such public post production issues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is actually a good movie I thought it wouldn't be good because lets face it, only The Walking Dead can make zombies cool .. but this was actually good. We aren't given much story before the zombie apocalypse begins, so this was generally unexpected, as directors tend to push the mayhem after 30 mins, but this jumped right to the first 6 mins of the film. The zombies are really fast and quite scary, so you will have few jump scares here and there. Oh, the performances weren't that good actually, the little girls, especially the little one was so annoying and screaming all the time, I can still hear her scream as I type ... All in all, enjoyable movie (but please don't watch with your kids- my little sister didn't sleep for days)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read the novel so my review is solely based on the film.This film has all the chances and the potential to be one of the greatest "Zombie Apocalypse" movie of all time, I was totally expecting a concept that nobody has done before till it kept teasing us with those questionable and feebly scenes especially when they always startled the "zekes". The story lacks depth, the only distinctive thing about this film is that the zombies were extraordinary in my opinion, they were very intense,fast and so hard on people that made me cringe (not your average walking dead zombie). However, It's still a disappointment especially for those audiences who expected a lot on this film (including me)On a positive note, hands down to Brad Pitt he did a remarkable and outstanding job portraying the protagonist,the savior &amp; the father that will do everything for his family whatever's at stake, it may conceivably the reason why it's facile to relate, empathized &amp; root for him. i'll give this movie 7 out of 10, i could have rated it lower but i was blown away by the cinematography and how Brad Pitt carried the burden of this film. This film may not be on a staggering or spectacular level but it's still worthy to be a box office hit</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since yours truly is all about giving the fans what they want, I'll split this review in order to satisfy the only 2 demographics which exist in the world of entertainment: Those who "like zombies" and those who do not.Where I fall is irrelevant, and did not influence my review of this film.Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former investigator for the United Nations. He's preparing to be sent to some of most undesirable places on Earth to investigate war crime, find out who's stealing humanitarian shipments, and validate/refute claims of genocide. But, while living with his family in Philadelphia, he is called back into service when a "zombie apocalypse" occurs. In order to work up a vaccine for pathogen, Gerry is tasked with tracking down "patient zero," the original host of whatever creepy crawly causes people to lose skin pigment, cognitive abilities, speech and their sense of humor. Zombie FansI'm pretty sure you will enjoy the movie a great deal. Where it works : Pacing - This movie starts very quickly, 3-4 minutes after credits finish, you start to see the beginnings of very bad things happening in the "City of Brotherly Love" (along with EVERYWHERE ELSE). Rarely does it slow down from there. When it does, you just catch your breath and it's off and running again. Effects - Top notch CGI equate to some very original and memorable images/scenes. The makeup and zombie effects are nothing new (more on that in a moment), but there are a lot of wide "big picture" or wide angle shots which made my jaw drop. Originality - This film was based on what is purported to be a very good novel by Max Brooks. One person I talked to was upset about the film version, saying it was abysmal compared to the novel. That's not a shock. But the speed &amp; agility with which the zombies move and the "resolve" they use to overcome obstacles is nothing I remember seeing before. Where it doesn't work : Gore (or lack thereof) - This is an assumption, but if you are into zombies, you may find this movie a little too sanitary for your taste. It's PG-13, which means that you will find more blood &amp; guts in almost any episode of "The Walking Dead" than you will in this film. Standard makeup: veiny, skinny zombies with bad teeth. Story - No spoilers here, this film doesn't present you with the nice clean time-line most films do. Be prepared to have lingering questions.Un-dead ? Ain't nobody got time for thatIf you enjoy action/suspense....give it a shot. I think you'll be glad you did.Where it works : Pacing - This is an exciting movie. It's starts quickly and really does keep genuine tension very tight through the length of the film. Just pretend the zombies are terrorists or bad guys if it helps you with suspension of disbelief. Performances - Everyone in this film is wholly believable in their roles, from Pitt on through to the supporting cast. There's not a great deal of "star power" but it does feature solid actors and actresses who take the story seriously and turn out a movie no one should be ashamed of. Story - There is a "solution" to the zombie problem offered in the film which I found very intriguing and original. Where it doesn't work : Characters - They are a little flat. This may have come from condensing the story from novel to film, which often leads to the removal of most character development in favor of action/events (see 90 % of films adapted from a story or novel by Stephen King). The usual nagging questions - How can zombies move without heartbeat? How do they can keep going so long without rest? Why do they all vote for the same party? (sorry, got a little carried away with that one). All I can say is fish gotta swim, zombies gotta roam.In the end, I wish I had seen it on the big screen and my wife liked it as well.My rating: 7.5 out of 10 (very good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting and well-done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z has garnered its fair share of unfair reviews, to be sure, but I found it exciting and plenty scary, throughout its 2 hour length. The criticisms of others seem to all be based on expectations of how zombies are "supposed" to look and act from other zombie fare and are not based on what actually happens in this well-produced, fast-paced flick.In fact, one of the scariest aspects of this imagining of a zombie apocalypse is how fast and ferocious are the zombie attacks and how quickly a bitten human "turns". And since the entire film takes place over about a week, it's ridiculous to complain that the zombies in it don't look decayed or festering enough. Instead, the fact it IS sometimes difficult to tell the zombies from the still-humans in the scenes of mass attacks is one of the things that makes it so frightening.Good acting, surprising scene shifts, and effective special effects complimented the story and left me sufficiently creeped-out to recommend it for horror fans. A warning: not for little kids! The PG-13 rating is not so much for blood and gore (LOTS less than in any Walking Dead episode) as for the horrifying intensity of the action when humans confront zombies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good action film, fast pace grips you right from the start. Not sure why this films getting bad reviews as its a worthy 8/10. With brad Pitt in the driving seat and good solid acting from the rest of the cast, including all the zombies I was always going to give world war z a go and I'm glad I did. The film bursts into life straight away and grips you, With a solid performance from brad Pitt, bit of humour, some jumpy bits and lots of explosions it makes for a good hour and a half's entertainment.I found the pace of the film on par with Olympus has fallen, nothing at all like 28 days later.. apart from a 30 second piece of music! The story isn't amazingly strong but I didn't feel that took away from my enjoyment of this film at all. The direction is brilliant, it certainly keeps you on the edge of your seat, there are places where the film slows down but my interest didn't.A good all round action end of civilisation film thats definitely worth the watch. Grab the popcorn and fizz and be entertained by Hollywood this evening.</fullReview>

It was nice to watch one with a different story line (Not just a group gradually declining in numbers as they get picked off one by one whilst walking through a city and hiding behind stuff) - I well and truly sh*t myself ten minutes in, as did my so-called 'scared of nothing', 6 foot boyfriend. It was refreshing to not have guessed what was going to happen ten minutes in either, I had no clue, and certainly didn't expect to spend my walk home from the cinema jumping out of my skin at every person walking by me in the narrow lanes of Brighton.

		<shortDescription>Read the Book instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outside of a few things, Warmbrunn, dogs hating Zombies, Moscow being pretty bad ass, and the use of the term African rabies in the first five minutes, there was very very little from the original book in this movie. I was hoping to see the battle of Yonkers, and what happened to North Korea in this movie, along with many other scenes from the book. I wanted to see the shambling dead taking over, more 'Max Brooks Approved! Anti-Zombie Weapons', hell, I would have loved to see them use horses to get the the W.H.O. (which are considered just below a bike in terms of 'Approved Transportation in a Zombie World') I loved seeing the handful of book references when the popped up every now and again. But there was maybe ten percent of the book itself used in this movie. Warmbrunn could have mentioned that it was him and about a dozen others who had put together the zombie email, or mentioned that there were people on the internet who had gotten very close to the truth themselves before the network went down. When they showed Moscow, they could have mentioned that they had to fight back before spring and the Zombies thawed. They could have shown Canada trying to close their borders as Americans fled North. There was so much more they could have slipped in, if they had only given the writers a little more money out of the CGI budget. However, the movie itself was a fun one. Using a virus on yourself in order to hide from the Zeke was a new concept that to my knowledge has not been seen in Zombie movies before this. It was stupid if you'd read the book, but a clever idea. They did follow a few major incidents from the book, including New York being overrun very quickly and that Patient Zero was never officially located. There was a possible in China, Korea, and of course Africa, which was touched on during the story. All in all, do NOT get your hopes up that this will follow the book. Watch it for the movie, but try not to look into it too deeply. You will disappoint yourself that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another Apocalypse movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not awful (although you sometimes dose off), but I can not help but view this in the same light as more or less any recent Apocalypse meets Zombie movie.Yes, obviously an awful lot of money was spent to produce a good quality product, but that is where it kind of ends for me. There are no real likable characters and even the "Zombies" or "Infected" are not that scary or believable. It just feels like something we have seen before, (28 days later, Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, The Crazies etc etc), with Brad Pitt as the lead character (his character also not really believable or likable in my honest opinion.) The Plot is also somewhat of a let down, and very predictable (I have not read the book, but some claim that the Screenplay missed the mark completely.. )If you are really into recent Apocalypse Zombie type flicks, do yourself a flavor and rent Zombies of Mass Destruction (ZMD). Even with it's low budget and very obvious dark humor approach, it was way more entertaining to watch than World War Z. I also would definitely recommend Zombieland above this rather boring attempt.</fullReview>

There are some things of note to this though. One, would be the used term of "Zombies", not beating around the bush to be fancy. Ecept that these ones are highly attracted to sound and sight, with their sense of smell seeming apparent in some ways. They're more concealed though, but I found this movie to be an enjoyable watch. it jumps right into the story, but I've never read the books themselves. That doesn't take away from this experience though, it's a good ol' zombie flick, in the way they should be done. The Cgi is impressive, at first I was skeptical by the previews of this movie, but it gave me a pleasant surprise.If you're looking for a good time, wanna kick back, and get into a movie that can still have some jumps, this is your movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The bar has been raised in the character department</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z has the direct makeup of a summer blockbuster; a premise that is appealing to a large percentage of the public, enough action to fulfill another percentage's demands, enough background knowledge towards the final act, and a universally recognizable stare at its center. On that note, the film is a success because it features a lot of things that will appeal to a great deal of people. However, examining it from a smaller viewpoint, one that analyzes character-investment, development, and layout, one will see a cluttered film that goes on for a long time but never seems to make much progress.Even though I have not read the book, I can't help but feel that the film does something of a disservice to it. If I had not read the novel a film is based on, I try and research the contents and the impact it has garnered in order to provide something of a relatability point. The novel appeared to have contained a wide-variety of characters impacted by a zombie apocalypse, a series of instances that bring up commentary points for contemporary America, and provided readers with a plausible "what-if" story about a zombie apocalypse.My immediate question upon viewing World War Z; where was this in the film? Where was the broad focus, the multiple characters, and the points about social and political life as we know it? Even if I'm misinformed about the novel, Brad Pitt's Gerry Lane character and story are still very thin and underdeveloped. If the film has incorporated all of the above, or even half of it, it could've possibly raised the standard for summer blockbusters into shockingly subversive territory. Instead, it sells its material and cast short, and the deeper the analysis, the clearer the evidence; World War Z is basic entertainment with a gargantuan budget, which is rumored to be over $500 million with advertising expenses.The story revolves around former UN employee Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), his wife Karin (Mireille Enos), and their two daughters as they try to survive a zombie outbreak that occurs right when they are sitting in New York traffic. When all hell immediately breaks loose, they hide out in a small apartment, where Gerry learns he must go assist Dr. Andrew Fassbach (Elyes Gabel), a virologist looking to find the source of the outbreak. Once an origin, production on a vaccination can be mass-produced and quickly-delivered before the entire country is nothing but a wasteland inhabited by the walking dead.The first act of the film assumes traditional action and disaster movie-style, which is to portray a cacophony of catastrophic events occurring all at once in an overpopulated cityscape. At the middle of this chaos is, as stated, Lane's family, who survives numerous instances of peril akin to how John Cusack's family survived numerous close calls in Roland Emmerich's 2012. However, as these close calls aren't what World War Z rests on, thankfully adhering to a more cause-and-effect relationship with the way this outbreak began.This relationship takes up about the last hour of the film, and as a result, drags a bit because character-investment has been traded for meticulous and plodding plot-development towards the outbreak. With that being said, World War Z makes for efficient summer entertainment, but if one is seeking a zombie picture with a human focus, selective gore, and true vibes of uniqueness, the undiscovered gem The Battery lies on all video-on-demand services waiting to be viewed.Starring: Brad Pitt, Mireielle Enos, and Elyes Gabel. Directed by: Marc Forster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of time and budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are too many things wrong with this film to possibly list them all, but I will do my best.**SPOILERS** Here are some things i could not get over. 1.) Why is Brad Pitt the world's only hope? I don't understand why he is the only one traveling the desecrated world in search of a cure. Did they only have one scientist ? (who dies after being a pretentious idiot, by falling and shooting himself... really?) 2.) Our protagonist can only be so heroic when he is being saved by a 9 year old latino child with a mystery gun from nowhere.3.) How immense was the budget for this film? I legitimately do not even want to look up that figure because it will most likely make me ill. The money sure as hell did not go towards a screenwriter. The dialogue seemed improvised and tired, like Brad Pitt was just trying to get out of the studio for the day. And for a film with such resources, why are the only impressive outdoor scenes Jerusalem and Philly? This Forster guy needs to go back to 10th grade budget class.Im gonna stop there, i do not intend to waste my night ranting. Just thought I would let all innocent souls be warned. This movie is miserably bad. Oh and PLEASE DEAR GOD no more "this is only the beginning" voice-overs at the long awaited and disappointing conclusion. please. I'm literally begging.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really expected more, with a concept that seemed interesting with good actors. However, we are quickly slapped by a poor script. Even if the main actor put all his talent in it, he can not save the film, he can barely make it interesting. What disconnects me from a film is firstly this kind of scenario that seems to have been written by a 10 years old kid, and this is the case of World War Z. In addition to stand on a soundtrack that is struggling to harmonize. Well, on top of all, one continually has the impression that it is a collage made by a new director who dream of paying himself a movie with Brad Pitt, and to include in it all interesting shots he saw in his favourite movies. A copy paste movie.</fullReview>

I couldn't wait for the movie, I was so excited my wife thought I was crazy.....then this came out. WTF??! Like seriously, WTF was this?? The only things that the book and the movie share is the fact that there are zombies and a guy travels around the world to talk to people, but its very brief in the movie. In the book, the experiences of the people he talks to is what makes the book so interesting, in the movie, yeah, he briefly talks to the special forces guy and the Mossad guy in Israel...but thats it. The rest of the movie is a basic, stock zombie movie, nothing new, or exciting. Yeah, the zombies climbing the Israeli walls is a cool visual, but Dawn of the Dead was a much better zombie movie. All in all they had a great opportunity with this movie, hell, make it into different parts like the chapters of the book, but total fail. For shame, you wasted the actors talents on this sleeper. For the love of god, buy the book and read it, its amazing, the movie, at best, meh.

		<shortDescription>Solid Zombie Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just say, I'm a huge zombie fan. I'm not talking with the new wave, I have loved zombies since I was old enough to watch them and have almost worn out my 'of the dead (including Return) VHS collection over the years.That being said, I was very happy to see a zombie movie get the budget WWZ got, and I was fairly pleased with the result. I wish that it would have been more of a horror movie, there were some Resident Evil elements here that I wasn't so sure about. In this movie, it's no secret that zombies are not some kind of hell spawn, but they are simply hosts to a particularly nasty parasite. This was a good take to try to make the zombies a little different, and also bring them a little closer to reality (they were based on Ophiocordyceps -&gt; google it).I have to say, without spoiling anything, I wasn't a fan of the ending. I have read about the original ending and I'm not so sure about that either. It would only depend on if it got the same kind of treatment. For me, there was no finality, and I'm not saying a decisive ending. I am hopeful (but not holding my breath) that there will be a sequel, but the movie's ending was setup to either be a final ending, or it could be a continuation. I wish they would have decisively ended it, or lead it into a sequel. There was some turmoil and indecision in the ending of this movie, and it shows. They kind of took the easy way out, and I think taking a chance in this case would have paid off.The effects in this movie were big budget top notch effects and it shows. There are many memorable scenes from a walled Israel, zombie hordes galore, mass destruction, hysteria, the jet scene, and much, much more. I was so happy to see this as it looks a lot like what you would imagine it would look like in your mind. The scale was huge and added a large amount to making this movie as good as it was.Pitt is on his game in this movie. He is pretty much the only character that is in every scene through the whole movie, and he has to carry each one of those scenes. He does it with a natural charisma, and I think this is one of his strongest roles. He seems to be really into this character, likely because he was so heavily involved in this project from top to bottom.There are only two actors who get any prolonged screen time and that's Mireille Enos as Karin Lane, and Daniella Kertesz as Segen.Mireille Enos does a good job playing the concerned wife, although her role is fairly limited. She provides a source motivation of Gerry Lane and also impacts a key scene in the movie.I found Daniella Kertesz' Segen character intriguing. She becomes a brave and imperative ally in Lane's quest, and I really liked the addition of her character as some added support for Pitt. She doesn't say a whole lot, but she's obviously tough as nails. She is kind of the anti-Karen (Enos), which balances things out nicely.In the end, I would say this is one of the top zombie movies of all time. Night of the Living Dead had it's plot, Day Remake had it's running zombies and fast pace, and this movie has it's realization of an infested world and high calibre acting. The ending was a bit weak, but I get why?fingers crossed for a sequel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this a 6/10, which means it's okay but not something I really want to watch a second time. There is one major and two minor problems with WWZ. First, the first 25 minutes of the film is almost unwatchable because the editors kept switching the camera angles every one or two seconds during the action sequences. It makes your head spin trying to follow the action. That's the major problem. Second, the zombies move too fast. They move so fast you can't really get a good look at any of them. I'm used to the slow-moving ones that you see on The Walking Dead. That to me seems more realistic. Third, there's a little too much CGI. It's not as overused like in The Hobbit or 2012, but those action scenes in Israel definitely did not feel real. Overall, this film was disappointing. It's something worth paying a couple dollars for to rent, but buying the DVD or the Blu-ray would be a waste of money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing a trailer i was excited to watch this movie, after all it has good leading character and even the story itself was supposed to be interesting, at least for those who enjoy to watch a film or TV series ( like The Walking Dead) with a zombie theme.But something went kinda wrong in the writing room.As we are immediately sucked in the action without any warning which is actually a good start for me, the entertainment begins but lasts not so long. I divided this movie into two parts, part one when we see Brad Pitt in his role of a father who is trying to save his family in a city full of zombies and even is willing to jump of the roof of a building in order to protect them when not knowing if he was gonna turn. It is a part full of suspense, action and mystery since we have no idea what is really causing this catastrophe. This was the good one.Suddenly, part two begins and the main character becomes a hero who is sent on a mission where the only thing that happens that even in the place where you least expect it, there is for sure a zombie with epileptic movements. The suspense is gone, action remains to feed the viewer. The plot is for sure not original, there are many movies with apocalyptic scenarios, but some of them at least bring something new, not this one.The ending also lacks any explanation ("but this is war and it is just beginning")and the way of survival of the main character in the end is actually laughable like many other situations.When you are NOT trying to figure how something like that could happen you can enjoy this movie, but after a while there is nothing left, no impression, etc...There are many better films, so watch it if want, but don't expect too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually a Zombie movie indicates the same theme which is gruesome killing and gore in no win situations. This movie gives us a break and adds intelligence to the subject matter. We have a plausible beginning, a good story, a serious problem and a not so clear cut solution of the problem. Good! Because it sets up the movie for a sequel to have more of this intriguing premise of man having a problem that he may not be able to cure or if he does; How? Good pacing which produces thrills, some parts in it that are a little Hollywood especially within the main family setting. I felt it to liberal and not true to life. In an emergency situation, acting doesn't cut it. Chaos and creativity does. See this but don't snack on anything that well splatters when bitten into.

		<shortDescription>Decent film; chaos &amp; human landscape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The good news is they salvaged this, because usually when you hear about reshoots the thing has more fundamental issues than a little repair can solve. They did it here, which is reason enough to celebrate because who needs a ruined film? It's tense, it's efficient in the right spots, if not a particularly great film. It adequately conveys the chaos and desperation, though we lose Romero's claustrophobia for disaster movie scope.The bad news is you can see the stitches and damage left on the walls by all the repairing they had to do. I assume the ridiculous points were inherited from the book. But they added explanatory monologues that chaperone us from one place to the other, announcing the stakes and what needs to be done; none of it really necessary. Bad decision that reveals a studio pandering to its generic conception of some brainless audience.It must have been a tough shoot anyway. They had to film panicked crowds in nearly every other scene, staging the panic. They had to touch it up probably frame by frame to enhance the spasmodic 'zombie' motion. And they had to weld that with digital footage of mayhem, presenting it as one world. I'm sure many a perfectionist would have bulked at the fundamentally chaotic idea.Now if we're lucky, in such a film we have a somewhat revelatory chaos. Isn't this what separates Romero from Italian knockoffs of his films? a sense of common fabric with the world we know, a plausible extension.We have it here. One thing is the first violence; the original sin. Contagion from last year humorously rendered this as some absurd, indifferent machination in nature which down the line destroys the world. Romero in Night had posited something from the stars, abstract, bigger. Here, the cause is resigned to be unknowable. It fits, if we are to have a mirror of life. The hottest news topic of the day is that the Congress approved US intervention in Syria; if we were to look for some original cause in that bloodshed, what would it be? Meaningless to even try. (you'll see that pundits will go as far back as it supports their storytelling agenda of how the world is put together, constructing destiny)However, more interesting is to see how this unknowable first cause propagates through the world, ripping stuff. Abstractly seen, from one of the many helo-shots, movement creates movement. Violence replicates itself through human fabric like surfs through water, the energy rippling through. There's so much flowing human landscaping here that you won't fail to notice this pattern. Of course, later on we find that it's some viral pathogen actively 'seeking' its biological continuation. We always have to fall back, and hold on, to some objective world. But for a while this opens a portal in perception. In the Israel segment, our guy first notices that zombies will run past a boy who stays immobile, perceiving here the key to the problem. Here also the water metaphor is used, a riverflow around a rock. Unwittingly, the filmmakers illustrate a cool thing; stillness disarms violence; violence being motion attracted to and constantly creating itself. I recommend reading a bit on waves in general, maybe nature's greatest work of art. Not the film's purpose, just an observation. But interesting of itself is that we have switched to fast zombies, and fast 'subjective' camera to capture the motions. It could be because this heightens plausibility and thus placement. It could be that we altogether have a faster perception of things than even 30 years ago, hugely so. Do we lose the stillness though? I mean broadly in the sense of a contemplative space.Pitt is totally out of place here, he has that smirk in the eye that does not speak of the hardened man he plays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can Zombie Flicks Continue to Stay Fresh?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though my initial reaction to the trailer for this film wasn't all too favorable, the film itself just barely exceeded my expectations for the film to be mediocre. What saves this film from descending into the basic tropes and clichés of this genre is probably the massive use of locations and how they incorporate the zombies into it. The zombies in this movie are presented to be very ant-like, devouring structures larger than them in formidable numbers. The film actually tries to create original concepts around the zombies, and the question that's brought up in the film is why they aren't attacking certain people and whether or not the reason can be applied to all humans. This along with Brad Pitt's restrained but visibly concerned performance added a bit more uniqueness to the film. The locations vary from your typical action set pieces with mass confusion and chaos to quiet, rainy military bases where zombies are all but visible and lurking in the dark open. Both types have a level of tension to them. Though some scenes don't entirely hit the mark, most of them do have a thick tension in the air, especially the final sequence. The film's flaws do weigh it down, however. All the other actors are pretty typical and forgettable. The film's pacing becomes somewhat repetitive, as you find yourself just waiting for the talking bits that fill the gaps between each zombie sequence to be over (especially since the talking scenes aren't that interesting until the final set piece). Also, the film rushes in a second character to tag along with Brad Pitt when before she just appeared to be your background military personnel. I can forgive that, though, since the film is trying to pose a more realistic interpretation of this type of situation, even though when an airplane crashes, Brad Pitt and the girl are conveniently the only ones who live. I also think that the film is a bit too draggy at times. Maybe it treats itself too seriously. I mean, we've seen plenty of zombie films, and while this film does try to bring some more originality, I don't see why we should ultimately care. The film suggests a sequel in the future, but I don't see myself sitting through it. In the end, it basically brings up the same themes similar zombie films that deal with global viruses already have. I'd recommend at least one viewing, but I have no doubt this film will disappear into the void as one of those "other" zombie films that exist. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Apocalypse.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films, rather than standout as cohesive, engaging, entertaining works that operate on a consistent, level base, in fact go down a different, more risk taking approach in the hope it will work out. Often due to an assortment of production difficulties, the initially envisioned motion picture turns out to be a completely different final film. Famous examples include Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" (1979), Sam Peckinpah's "Major Dundee" (1965) and infamously, Michael Cimino's "Heaven's Gate" (1981), that succeed in putting its studio, United Artists, into bankruptcy. However, conflict doesn't always produce a great film, or even a flawed great movie. Sometimes it just sits on the screen as a catalogue of disaster. If "World War Z" isn't entirely bad, then perhaps it is a testament to director Marc Forester's ability to marshal his footage and admit that his present ending was no good and proceeded to film a new climax.Throughout the epic-scale film, elements of a smaller, more personal film are ever present: the sight of a cop, facing the breakdown of civilisation, helping himself to food supplies like everyone else; a drunk on the streets of Philadelphia calmly oblivious to the confusion and violence around him. The surreal sight of soldiers in South Korea, in pitch black, driving rain, cycling on small bicycles to avoid attracting the plague-ridden zombies. The implicit point that countries that are prepared for war, like North Korea and Israel, are better organized for cataclysmic disaster. The deathly, eerily unnatural silence of a Welsh village; these details give weight to Forester's direction, as does the impressively mounted small-scale action scenes such as the initial zombie attack in gridlocked Philadelphia traffic. These scenes are the best in the film and help to displace (but not vanquish) the film's many manifest flaws.Brad Pitt has a commendably intense performance and is backed up by a host of small roles from actors such as David Morse, James Badge Dale and Daniella Kertesz who are all very good, yet their effect is diluted by the unfortunately linear, globe-trotting script that suffers from repetition despite a few ingeniously cruel twists of fate. The constant cutbacks to Pitt's family throughout the course of the film help anchor his character, but they're too short to establish their characters as anything but ciphers, a problem for everybody except Pitt.The ending, while fine in isolation, hardly creates a sense of conclusion while the tacked-on coda contains enough hastily sketched information to furnish two more films, leaving the last ten minutes rushed.The lacklustre computer generated imagery for the Jerusalem sequence is only one of the film's problems in a movie that finally, struggles under them, some due to poor scripting and others because of a lack of literal direction. It's hard to be convinced by it and that may well be its greatest failing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love zombie films, but the quality over the years has been very mixed to say the least. Of the most recent zombie films going around, I would rate Dawn of the Dead (the remake) and 28 Days Later as the top two in my opinion. I had read quite a lot of positive reviews on World War Z, so I was excited by the prospect of a big budget zombie film that may not disappoint. I was also surprised when I saw Hollywood superstar Brad Pitt as the leading character, as these days Brad doesn't choose too many dud films. I watched World War Z in 3D to get the full affect and it didn't take long to click into action, with the zombie outbreak starting in the busy streets of Philadelphia. About 30 minutes into it I remembered thinking how awesome it was and if it kept its pace it could rival the top zombie films mentioned earlier. While I don't think it quite reached that level in the end, I still think it was a very entertaining and worthwhile film for fans of the zombie genre. One of the things that impressed me most about the film was that the storyline actually had some depth to it, with Brad Pitt traveling across the world trying to track down the origin of the outbreak. Surprisingly this film was rated PG-13, so if you are a fan of horror films with plenty of gore, you might be a little disappointed. While I enjoyed it, there are still plenty of flaws which hold it back, as it had potential to be so much better. In parts, the CGI was sloppy, the shaky camera and editing got distracting and some scenes unfortunately had plot holes, but what zombie film doesn't have its flaws right? It's an entertaining film all the same and worth a watch.My Rating: 7/10For more Movie and TV News, Reviews and Rumours go to: www.facebook.com/tvmovienews</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not related...just that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, there's only one thing wrong with this movie...it's name. I mean, the whole point of the books was to show different points of view, from different times, on different locations, to reflect a global war against zombies. The only thing that the movie has in common with this premise is the fact that Brad Pitt's character is a ONU employee. The major factor that is making people dislike the movie is the fact that it has the same name has the books. If the movie had another name, it would have an entirely different reception. So, my advice is, watch the movie, because it's worth it, without comparing it to the books. If you haven't read them yet, then don't. The movie is basically Brad Pitt saving the world in 3 days. It's a good summer flick, definitely not a Oscar nominee, but it's worth your time, if you really like the zombie culture. Overall, i give it a 7, because of the good CGI, the fast paced action and the somewhat different ending to what you're used to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical zombie movie with unusual budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most zombie movies are trying to have a unique approach. As Norwegian "Dead Snow" (2009), who was the first with Nazi zombies. Danny Boyle, best known for "Trainspotting" (1996) and Oscar winner "Slumdog Millionaire" (2008), was in "28 Days Later" first with zombies that are not dragging themselves through life, but was fast as hell. A real shock for all zombie fans the first time the film was shown."World War Z" has zombies running so fast that Usain Bolt would be eliminated already in the trial heats. Furthermore, they are many. Too many. It appears a little too obvious that it is computer animated zombies climbing on each other like ants up the walls and barricades. The film was preceded by disaster rumors, including after an informed article in Vanity Fair. It was about a budget that is constantly rising. About a discord between the film's director Marc Forster and star/producer Brad Pitt. About an super expensive final third set in Russia and that has been completely discarded in favor of a totally different ending. It required several well-paid screenwriter to find. And so on.Many great films suffer similar rumors. They are not always true. And "World War Z" is by no means a disaster. Initially and finally, really good. In the portrayal of the chaos that occurs in the middle of an American city when the zombie epidemic breaks out. And the bare tension that arises when Brad Pitt's UN inspector Gerry Lane in a sophisticated way try to fool a small number of zombies who have barricaded themselves in a research institute where a possible cure for the epidemic can be. It creates scenes that sends shivers through intimacy and silence. Otherwise, you can hardly blame "World War Z" to be a small film. When Brad Pitt's UN inspector travels around the world, it's thousands of zombies just everywhere, as if the whole world had been infected in a few hours. A bit silly. Besides Pitt, it is also just one person in general who makes a impression, a tough female soldier (Daniella Kertesz).Eventually, "World War Z" is becoming as any other zombie film, only more lavish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drags Then Makes Comeback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked into the theater curious about how anyone could succeed in the now overused vehicle of global viral attack in general and zombies in particular. Kudos to the decision to immediately introduce the pandemic, avoiding the slow intro from carrier #1 to the rest of the population. Then WWZ curiously drags with a domestic venue period followed by a darkened screen trip to South Korea that, while ultimately providing key data, has a slow down drag effect on the forward movement. But WWZ picks up spectacularly beginning with the trip to the Middle East. Difficult thing to make such a comeback. There is unnecessary literary dialog here and there; e.g., a "Join the Team" pep talk given our hero, a pearl of wisdom offered by a Jewish senior, etc.. But the special effects, action sequences and, toward the end, suspense, ultimately won me over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but not great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read the book and seen the movie I have to say that the movie did not live up to its potential. I'm going to be hard on the movie but it was entertaining if you can separate it completely from the book in your mind. Others here have mentioned the differences between the two so I won't bother with that. The thing is the movie could have been so much more.First, the characters were flat. Brad Pitt's character was decent enough but generic, but aside from Brad Pitt the rest could have been cardboard cut outs. They were props there so that the main character has a reason to do things.Second, the plot was literally stupidity driven. The plot was moved forward by a series of acts of stupidity on the part of the characters despite the fact that they should know better.****Spoilers**** Stupid Act #1) In trying to escape in their Volvo behind a runaway garbage truck Brad Pitt stops looking at the road to deal with his panicked daughter and crashes. This sets up stupid act #2.Stupid Act #2) They leave the daughter's inhaler behind despite the fact that she has what appears to be severe asthma. She's already panicking and they are going to be running, both situations where her asthma will be triggered. This sets up stupid act #3.Stupid Act #3) After obtaining a RV they go to a grocery/pharmacy to obtain an inhaler for their asthmatic daughter (who BTW never has another attack). They leave the keys in the RV in front of a store that is being looted and seem surprised when it is gone. This sets up the "trapped in the building" scenario.Another part related to #3 is the youngest daughter finds a hunting rifle in the RV. Brad takes the gun away but never checks to see if it is loaded, and never looks for more ammo. This is a guy who it is implied is a extremely competent survivor and is supposed to know weapons. He also shows no aptitude in carrying the rifle. See the next stupid act.Stupid Act #4) Brad and a group of SEALs give a pistol to a guy who is completely unfamiliar with firearms or safety. This is their star virologist who is supposed to be finding the cure. Brad warns him to keep his finger off the trigger, he still ends up shooting himself.Stupid Act #5) The wife calls her husband who she knows is going into danger and gets a lot of people killed. Brad's character a) should have instructed her not to call and b) doesn't set the thing on silent. Both he and wife know zombies are attracted to sound by that point.There are several more but you get the picture...yet the film was still entertaining. It's more of a "see it at matinée prices" though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good-But Far From Great-Zombie Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2003, The Zombie Survival Guide hit the market to little fanfare. But because of strong word of mouth and the hard work of author Max Brooks, the book soon became a cult hit and then a sensation. When World War Z was published in 2006, it was an instant bestseller, and speculation immediately began on when the book would become a film, with a bidding war breaking out over the rights between Leonardo DiCaprio's production company Appian Way and Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment. Brad Pitt won.And then . . . nothing. For years, the production languished. Costs bloomed. Rewrites were rewritten. Many speculated that Pitt might have a bomb on his hands. Instead, World War Z has been largely a success, with box office totals north of $300 million as of this writing. But the questions remains, is the movie any good?Yeah, it's not bad actually.First, if you are going to enjoy this movie you need to forget about the book. There are homages to it here or there, but for the most part this is a different film that, at best, happens in the universe of Max Brooks's work. The zombies are more akin to the infected in 28 Days Later than they are the walking undead of Romero.Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN investigator who now spends his days flipping pancakes instead of on the front lines of the world's conflicts. But when he and his family find themselves in the middle of the zombie outbreak in downtown Philadelphia, Gerry agrees to go back into the field in exchange for his family's safety. His search for a cure to the zombie plague takes him from Korea to Israel to Wales, with zombie attacks galore in between.World War Z is a pretty good movie, but it has some flaws. First, it's PG 13. Violence isn't everything, but when you have a movie that is about the zombie apocalypse, having most things happen off-screen just takes something away from the proceedings. Worse, the movie feels like it would have been better as a miniseries. The set pieces are disjointed and poorly connected. It's almost as if we are going around the world just cause. These scenes need more fleshing out. And yet, the movie also seems overlong. If it were twenty minutes shorter, the movie would have been stronger, in my view.But I'm being overly negative. If you like zombies, you will enjoy World War Z. It's not destined to be one of the great zombie movies in my opinion, but it is more than adequate for a summer blockbuster, and hopefully its excellent box office will encourage more zombie movies in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK I completely lost my first submission so this review will be much shorter and I'll have to recap all my thoughts again here we go: This movie needs a lot of improvement and one of the things I think needs improvement is the character development as well as we don't see too many family relations and how they react with each other. Sometimes we see little short scenes where we see how the characters react with each other but much of the time is a action shots. I have seen better movies and this one i would put in the B rated movie. as an all in all rating of 6/10 OK That's my recap of my review i lost.

		<shortDescription>Expectations dampened...Result - Surprised ish.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, as the summary says, my expectations of this movie were dampened by the pre-launch rumours of problematic production and re-shoots aplenty.To my surprise, the film had some lovely high points.My biggest fear going into this film as something of a Zombie/Apocalyptic/Post-Apocalyptic (yes, they are different) lover, was the fact that the trailer seemed to universally show mass CGI hordes of Zombies. I like my Zoms slow, dumb and bitey, not super-human, rubbery (CGI) and intelligent.In this case, it's a strange, yet refreshing case of the best bits NOT being in the trailer.The beginning of the film is fast paced and manages to convey that all important feeling of solitude, desperation and chaos that is needed in the genre. There are some nice character interactions, but for the most part, the first 20 minutes is full throttle action. to my surprise, the hordes were confined to CGI only in aerial shots, and were up close and 'bitey', during some nice enclosed action within an apartment building.Brad Pitt, as Gerry Lane, a former UN investigator who has seen war torn countries aplenty, is a bright spark in an otherwise quite bland casting roll call. It's through the rest of the film that Pitt's ability to hold attention when on screen is most required.It's not that the film declines in quality per say, it's that the speed of the film is on a downward curve after the first act and Pitt's presence is increasingly needed to keep viewers interested.The key plot point is slowly hinted at until a revelation late in the day leads to a inconclusive ending, and only the potential of a resolution mooted.So, my gripes with this film are not it's direction; indeed Marc Forster (who boasts Quantum of Solace on his CV) manages to provide some lovely shots with some classic suspenseful pieces in there. No, my gripes, strangely enough, are with the writing.I won't go into too much detail, but with Drew Goddard on the crew, I'd have expected better. There were too many plot holes that viewers would have to sidestep to get past and some of the character decisions based on the fact precedent had been set previously for alternate decisions, were quite confusing. Couple that with some odd character inclusions that presumably would have had a point, had the rest of the characters' motivation not ended up on the cutting room floor (see "man in pharmacy" for more detail!), and you've got a bit of a mixture. For me, I think it's almost unforgivable in a time where apocalyptic features (small or big screen) are all the rage, not to fully flesh out a full and complete story and avoid plot holes almost entirely. There isn't a lot of story to work with in this film, so it's even more criminal that some areas were just forgotten about in terms of resolution of specific issues in the film.I've been pretty vague in this review, and it's my first on IMDb, so I'll improve.Conclusion:Worth a view....try not to get dragged into the lore, as it means nothing here. Try and take decisions with a pinch of salt and let it wash over you.If you do that, you'll come to the same conclusion as my for the most part. 7/10 movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dear, oh dear.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pretty skeptical when a friend recommended this movie to me. I watched it, but had so many gripes with the film, I just had to share them.1) There's far too many action scenes for me to take this film seriously: I've parked an RV. *IT WON'T START, PANIC ATTACK*. I'm getting an inhaler for my kid *MY WIFE'S BEING ATTACKED AND MY KID IS IN A SHOPPING TROLLEY* I'll call you. Don't call me because I'll be in an extremely hostile environment. *OH MY GOD, MY HUSBAND RANG ME AND I COULDN'T HEAR HIS VOICE SO I'VE GOT TO CALL HIM BACK BECAUSE HE MIGHT BE DEAD* We'll be sensible and build a massive wall so people can't get in. *NOW WE'LL START A ROCK CONCERT* We're in this supposedly impregnable city. *HOW IS THERE A ZOMBIE ALREADY ON THE PLANE?!* Come on guys, less is more.2) I don't care if any of the characters die. There's no character depth, I don't feel any sympathy or empathy for them. The world's best hope, a virologist (makes sense), makes a grand speech, then dies and I laughed. There's no background info for this UN investigator or whatever he is. How does he know all these military personnel?? Why is he dropped in an extremely hostile zone with only a few soldiers?? The girl he saves. Why did he save her?? What does she have to offer??3) The people are morons. I mean the actual characters and the writers. They can't go 5 minutes without something going on. But the worst offences are a) That they're in Philly, a major US city. Gridlocked. But they find their way to an RV and a miraculously open road. If it was an open road, people would be driving on it. b) The phone call. She doesn't know what he's about to do, why would she call him?? She's safe, he isn't she wouldn't jeopardize that unless she's really stupid. c) The massive Jerusalem wall. Standard idea; keep the zombies out, keep the people in. But, just a straight wall where people could climb over it?? Why not a massive overhang at the top?? And why would anyone want to scream and shout down a microphone when they should have realized that you get attacked if they see or hear you??4) The script is dull. It's so dull that I can't think of a single good line in the film.5) The voice-over at the end. It's an uninspiring "This isn't the end, this is only the beginning" type speech that's been done thousands of times before in a thousand and one different films.6) The zombies. They're undead. Their limbs would atrophy, I doubt they'd be faster than Usain Bolt on fast-forward. They're not particularly scary, the transformations happen far too fast and there's no blood.This films only saving grace is the last thirty minutes or so. Aside from the voice-over at the end. A zombie avoiding an unhealthy dinner makes some sense to me, so poisoning yourself to make you less of a target makes some morbid sense. It smacks of desperation, and there's no denying that this bleak world is desperate for anything. All in all, not one of Pitt's better films. He has centre stage for about an hour and three-quarters of the film, and fails to make use of it with no chemistry with any of his supporting cast. Please Hollywood, unless you come up with a brand new inspired idea around the zombie genre, please, leave it alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Has Far More Weaknesses Than Strengths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no point comparing the book to the novel. At best in any situation that's a fool's game. Movies are movies; novels are novels. They're just an entirely different genre. As much as the criticism that the movie isn't like the book may have validity, it's not really that relevant. Treat this as a movie and consider it on that basis. On that basis, it has both strengths and weaknesses. Let's start with the weaknesses, because they start leaping out right from the start, and they're more numerous.This seems to be a perfectly normal weekday morning in Philadelphia. There's nothing out of the ordinary. The Lane family wakes up and goes about their business, climbing into the car to head wherever they're all going. The only remotely newsworthy thing happening is a news report about an outbreak of rabies in various parts of the world. There are, however, no reports of problems in the United States. OK. There's a big traffic jam, and no explanation, but Philadelphia's a big city; unexplained traffic jams are probably not uncommon. Then, all of a sudden, with no warning, there are police and military aircraft racing ahead of the traffic jam - and Philadelphia is infested with zombies! Really? With no warning that anything was amiss? Really? I mean, if something was wrong Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) seems like the kind of guy who would have known. He's a former UN Inspector, who certainly has contacts as we learn. But this just pops up suddenly? Implausible at best, and given that it's happening all over US and international cities, just hard to accept. I get that a virus could spread rapidly because of air travel - but this was just too much. Add to that the fact that the "zombies" didn't really scare me all that much and had a bit of a sense of silliness about them, as well as the fact that none of the characters really hit home with me as people I connected with and cared about, and you have serious weaknesses.The basic strength of the movie is that it is mysterious (partly, I confess, caused by the implausible suddenness of the outbreak) and it is suspenseful, as you wonder whether there's any sort of solution to the outbreak, or whether this is just an ongoing battle against a hopeless situation. But it really would have helped if I had been given a character to care about. Even Pitt's Gerry failed to draw me in to the story. The result was that, Pitt's obvious recognizability aside, the performances here faded into the background.I'm thinking that zombie lovers will be underwhelmed by this. Personally, if I need a zombie fix, AMC's "The Walking Dead" is actually better. (5/10)</fullReview>

Refuelling a cargo plane on an abandoned military tarmac while fighting zombies? Check! Hordes of howling zombies attacking the heroes who narrowly escape? Check again! I swear someone shouted "HUNTER!" in the middle of the game... sorry, middle of the movie! "World War Z" is the recollection of dozens of testimonies about the great zombie epidemic that almost destroyed the Human race; the author interviewed people from every profession, every religion, every nation, who give us their own unique view about how they survived, and how their own personal episode was a piece of the puzzle of Human survival, thus highlighting the best and worse of Human nature. One of the best stories ever! The movie, on the other hand... was nothing such! Play the game. Read the novel. Skip the movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm so disappointed that I'm tempted to give a one star vote - but that would be unfair. The reasons for my disappointment are: I expected something original, as the book the movie is supposed to be based on is very original. Also, if you have a cast like this, then you would be stupid to not invest in a decent script, right? And then, IMDb currently gives 7.1 stars...The reality is: This is just an ordinary zombie movie, nothing original, let alone intelligent, in it. What's worse is that the script is crap: There are gaping holes in the plot's logic, so big, that they just spoiled the fun for me. To top it all they built this stupid super-social Hollywood-has-something-for-everybody attitude into a ZOMBIE MOVIE! Like children, wives and dogs getting on your nerves (but not getting killed for it). Like some multicultural "we're all the same" messages - when at the same time the hero is clearly elite.. The last thing I found great in the trailer but absent in the movie is good photography. If you've seen the trailer then you've seen all there is on offer.</fullReview>

I'm a movie lover, but let me be honest, there are better uses of your time. The final straw was when there was a plane crash of a large craft and it appears that only Pitt and one other important character survived. Come on. 100 people on board and only they survive? Other examples include earlier in the movie when they are climbing the stairs of the apartment building to escape from the roof. They barely make it to the roof but low and behold Tommy appears.

		<shortDescription>Awful Clichés Aplenty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, can you imagine a typical cliché'd American movie? What will we have? A large family. Right. A daughter with an asthma, all sorts of fears and panic? Yes! Wait, wait, wait, are we describing War Of The Worlds? Nay, silly one, we are talking 'bout World War Z. Brad Pitt? Yes, but he is all the same like he is in many films of his. David Morse? He is good. But he, as well as Matthew Fox, cannot save this slow drabness of typical deep cliché ridden flick. Everything you saw in Resident Evil, Saw or 28 Hours later is here aplenty. Running to the roof? Sure, buddy, you name it! Zombies biting people who become zombies and bite other people? You saw it all before? C'mon! You saw it not. This is the first time, I am sure! Nay, we all did see it, right? Well, let me try and be serious. This is a Bad movie. Very languid, bad, impossibly predictable and very very boring. As if them zombies ate the film crew and the tempo suddenly got faster, but the plot got duller and utterly silly. Funny, too. The more they try to make us scared, the more sillier it all looks. My advice - waste no minute on this boredom. There are two redeeming features here - this Israeli girl who is very nice, believable and very good addition to the plot. And the ending that is far better than many zombie flicks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Safe Zombie Movie with Brad Pitt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brad Pitt plays a stay at home dad with a mysterious past. When an infection breaks out turning the majority of the world's population into zombies, it's up him to become a zombie killing super hero and save the world.World War Z is nothing more than another overly generic, clique-filled zombie flick. The fact that the film stars Brad Pitt is the only original aspect compared to any other zombie movie, video game or television series. Instead of using practical effects, which is what makes gore-filled survival horror films fun, World War Z completely relies on CG effects that, in a matter or a year or two, will look as bad as the over-rated Will Smith film, I Am Legend. The script pretty much follows the same plot as 2012, which was barely watchable itself. What makes the films different? Audiences are more likely to go see a film starring Brad Pitt and zombies rather than John Cusack and a misinterpreted Mayan prophecy.There were many screenwriters attached to this disaster. Give it to Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof for delivering such a pathetic adaptation. Goddard and Lindelof started off writing silly television dramas including Nash Bridges, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Alias and Lost. Both Goddard and Lindelof since has written screenplays that proved they should have never been allowed to make the transition from television to feature films. Films that are impossible to deny that they suffered from bad writing.The most disappointing thing about World War Z is to see director Marc Forster continue to waste his talents bringing such terrible screenplays to life. Forster has had past films such as Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland go to the Oscars. Since he has directed the most boring James Bond film to date, Quantum of Solace, and Machine Gun Preacher. World War Z has sealed his fate as just another Hollywood director unworthy of making the big budget films he is being hired to bring to life.World War Z is disappointing in every aspect and annoyingly predictable. It is the safest zombie flick you can watch which makes it the most most stale and boring zombie flick to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Zombie movie !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I need to admit -I haven't really seen any zombie movie. I try to avoid silly horror movies. But this is different - this one was way beyond my expectations. The story was gripping and I was thoroughly enjoying this visual treat - if I can say that. Brad Pitt was decent but the graphics and the story are the major highlights of this movie. I will be the one waiting for the sequel - hope they do make one. If you are looking for a light 'family entertainer' then this is the one. You may want to warn your little ones though on the horror part, unless you want them to see relive it in their dreams. I watched it at home in HD and loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been reading some very negative reviews about 'World War Z' honestly I loved the movie watched it twice, firs of all when I see a good entertaining movie I don't dig deep into it, 'World War Z' has it all what you want in a movie good action, story and good acting specially by Brad Pitt. There have been many Zombie movies but this one is unique very different story about how you can save yourself from Zombies, totally different role played by Brad Pitt in this one as you've been watching him in every kind of movies action, comedy, romance, drama I think he was the best character I've seen in this one he lives up the hype even in this type of movie, anyhow worth every penny and time you should go for it!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was pleasantly surprised by this one. Not just another zombie movie. Great graphics and good story. I along with the rest of the world am getting a little bored with zombie flicks but this one is worth watching. Brad rocks this one, and They did a great job and put a different twist on the zombies weakness. There were actually a couple of scenes that were really scary, kinda like a action slash horror film. the ending left a little bit to be desired but overall good movie. That being said please take a break from the zombies for awhile. five years ago it was vampires now its zombies. am i the only one eagerly awaiting a great werewolf movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Former UN employee Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and their two daughters sit in heavy Philadelphia traffic when the city is attacked by a horde of zombies. As the chaos spreads, the Lanes escape the city and take refuge in an apartment complex. Deputy Secretary-General Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena) - an old friend of Gerry's - calls and sends a helicopter to rescue them. The helicopter takes the Lanes to a U.S. Navy vessel off the coast of New York City, where a team of scientists and military personnel are analyzing the scope of the worldwide outbreak. A virologist, Dr. Andrew Fassbach (Elyes Gabel), argues that the plague is a virus, whose origin must be found in order for a vaccine to be developed. Because of his expertise as a former UN investigator, Gerry is tasked with helping Fassbach find the outbreak's source.Even though Brad Pitt is one of my most favorite actors, I wasn't expecting anything from this movie. When we were at the theaters for this one, I was dragged to another movie since my friend didn't want to see it based on the ridiculously generic trailers. In a world where there have been all kinds of zombie movies, this one didn't look particularly appealing. I finally caught it and was surprisingly entertained. First things first, World War Z actually admits that people living in this world know about zombies instead of cleaning the state clean and setting it in a world where people have no idea about the undead. Since this wasn't a comedy, that alone was very awesome.The movie travels around the globe as most doomsday movies tend to. Its also PG-13, but the terror of the relentless pursuit of the unconventionally super strong and quick zombies and the impact of the off-camera kills are as genuine as what most good rated R movies can achieve. For a PG-13 zombie movie, it has a refreshing sense of gravitas about it. Brad Pitt looked like he wasn't even trying to 'act' per se, but that came off as very good, while Mireille Enos is tragically underused. It was genuinely amazing to see that both these actors had no make up on. Matthew Fox (Lost) was in a blink and you miss role which was quite intriguing. But by far, the biggest scene stealer was the soldier, Segen (Daniella Kertesz). I just found out about the production troubles of the movie and how the entire climax had to be reshot. I honestly felt that the ending had fluidity and even elevated the stature of the movie by giving us a closer look at the predatory zombies. This doesn't follow the book in any way and has its share of flaws, but can be forgiven for being smart, fresh, immersive and immensely entertaining.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A biased pro-Israel movie if there ever was one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this movie out of curiosity. Sci-fi and zombies sound like a good match.The problem of course is that this movie is neither. It's crappy as a sci-fi movie and non-existent as a zombie movie. I watched about halfway through and then stopped. I couldn't take it anymore.Now I will not revisit the points made by other critics of the movie: crappy story, no character development, still don't understand what made Brad Pitt's character so special, seemed like he didn't care at all for his family, etc etc.The point that annoyed me the most is that this movie is essentially a propaganda piece for the Israeli ministry of propaganda. Lately, the Israelis seem to have answers to everything and they are always a step ahead of the world. The fact that they built a wall that blocks everything seemed logical to the creators of this trash. And of course there's always Mossad the most efficient agency ever created.This is a travesty of a movie and Brad Pitt should be ashamed to be in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The number of poor reviews are disappointing. I love a movie that makes you think and keeps guessing the whole way through, but sometimes I also love to watch a movie that simply keeps you entertained. World War Z does this. You don't need to think, you just need to sit back relax and enjoy as the movie throws plenty of action in your face. It's aim isn't to scare you, make you jump or gross you out, it's simply one cool action scene after another. The end wasn't flashy or full of action like the rest of the film, but it did have suspense and closed out the movie nicely. Recommend watching!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitt vs the World War Z</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the acclaimed horror novel by Max Brooks, this version of the zombie apocalypse takes on a markedly different route than the original source material. Whereas Brooks presented the story as a series of detached stories, which help form the bigger picture, the pretty large cast of scriptwriters opted for a more cinematic approach, mostly owed to the preference of having one on-screen hero, instead of a multitude of short-lived appearances. Given the fact that Brad Pitt is the main star, it was pretty apparent that the super-powered actor would feature full-length and not be underutilised to one of many small segments.Therefore Brad Pitt as UN operative Gerry Lane functions as the heart and soul, saviour and protector, lock, stock and barrel, taking on a one man army stance against the zombie onslaught, flying across the globe from New York to Korea, Israel or Wales. Naturally this is somewhat of an over-reach on my behalf, as Lane is much more frail a figure, requiring SEALs to protect his behind, nonetheless to an exaggerated extent Lane becomes the soul of almost everything positive in this movie, as all the events and actions of the novel are appropriated to Pitt. The movie starts off inconspicuously with Gerry Lane joyously preparing pancakes for his family of four - his wife Karin (a welcome appearance by Mireille Enos) and two daughters Constance (Sterling Jerins) and Rachel (Abigail Hargrove). Slowly news of the appearance of zombies start filtering through the media, but nothing has the world prepared for what is about to take place, when a sudden appearance of the zombie virus has New York quickly fall into chaos, panic and a tidal wave of destruction. Having successfully escaped with his family onto an aircraft carrier off the coast of America, Gerry Lane is quickly employed (as a specialist on survival danger areas) to assist the UN in finding out the source of the sickness, which turns people into undead within a matter of seconds or minutes (depending on the strain). Meanwhile the outbreak goes global...At times immaculately intense, bubbling with relentless tension, at others moments frightening to the core, while not bypassing the potential for pure unadulterated spectacle, "World War Z" is a surprisingly effective movie, which deservedly soared towards box-office glory. Despite its rabid pacing, the story almost never unravels aimlessly, instead affording much time for the situations to intensify, just before the explode with a vengeance. Ignoring the pure simple shock factors, director Marc Forster inspirationally forms scenes overladen with both horror and emotion.Probably the best all-out zombie feature since "28 Day Later", "World War Z" does feature several innate common characteristics, mostly so by redefining the threat as something more akin to rabbis, than to decomposing bodies lazily sulking around. Zombies here are fast, furious and unrelenting, giving them a more frightening presence, which lacks in most such movies (and well ridiculed by features such as "Shaun of the Dead"). The threat suddenly becomes more visceral, as the attacks are reminiscent of an army of insects covering their prey within a matter of minutes. Other changes were introduced into the zombie characteristics, much like in the Danny Boyle English apocalypse, which help redefine the foe into intriguing new directions and thus allowing for new dramatic developments as far the genre is concerned. The relatively enormous budget also affords Marc Forster space for some spectacular scenes with swarms of zombies roaming countrysides, cities and bringing utter havoc on never before seen scales. Forster however also gives time and space for more low-key encounters with zombies, mixing it up so as to avoid repetition. At times the movie is rampant and furious, but also has the capacity to feel confined, slowly building tension and heightened expectations, especially towards the more toned down final act of the movie.Despite the accolades for the overall movie itself, several thorns do stick out, gauchely pricking the wrong nerves. This includes several plot holes, whereas the most apparent is the suggestion that the plague was dispersed across the world via air-planes. However given that the sickness incubates for mere minutes, this just isn't feasible. Instead a scenario more akin to that of Ebola is likely - the virus spreads with such deadly intensity and at such a rate, that the sickness has no time to spread vastly. Another troublesome issue regards the whitewashing of the racist apartheid state of Israel, which is presented as a welcoming, open country with the walls being constructed solely for the purpose of preventing such a zombie onslaught. And not for the purpose of ethnic cleansing as is the reality (scenes of Palestinians and Jews idyllically singing in joy of reunification were uncomfortably out-of-order). Brings into question how much cash the Israeli government flung at the movie to present them as doves of peace...Nonetheless, despite these flaws "World War Z" presents itself as another strong zombie movie of the year (after "Warm Bodies") and a must-watch summer flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Empty Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apart from Pitt being in the movie, another reason why i saw this were some comments and reviews that I read on the internet. I just don't get it what is it that people find interesting and entertaining in this. There are some parts in the movie that have the potential to develop into something interesting but it never happens. The entire movie is about a guy investigating and in the end, all his investigation turns out to be pointless. The plot was just empty, there's nothing to say about it. About Pitt, I kinda felt like he was out of place. There were some scenes with a growing suspense but whenever the camera went back on him, I just couldn't take it seriously. I hope he doesn't continue with this kind of movies, I'm sure he can do way better. But anyway he played his part fine.Another thing that left me disappointed is that I was expecting to see a horror film and what i got was more like an action adventure movie. It wasn't scary at all. The special effects were nice I guess but nothing impressive. Overall, I wouldn't go so far to call it a bad movie but I really didn't see nothing special in it, just a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z fails to deliver - spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched World War Z and it left me wondering what the $190 million dollars was spent on.Much of it was CGI, and a dreary story about a family man (Pitt) stumbling across an anti virus that wasn't really an anti virus.Sorry, but I laughed at the girl having her hand chopped off, who then after losing about two pints of blood managed to run about half a mile or more to catch a plane.If that wasn't bad enough, the plane crash was ridiculously comical. Funny how Pitt and the chick with one hand escaped without a scratch. Everyone else died. Yeah, right... Sorry excuse me, I forgot, Pitt had a 16 inch long chunk of metal through his stomach .Again, he and the girl walked yet more miles into the village. Laughable. And after that they were back fighting zombies in the lab seemingly a day later.Even in horror there has to be a certain amount of plausibility. Look at Dawn of the Dead and Land of the Dead. Horror yes, but it wasn't absurdly ridiculous as this WWZ is. You could see the events in those two other classic movies happening.WWZ had so much potential, all down the drain. And Brad Pitt, sorry the guy cannot act for toffee. He sleepwalks through this entire movie.I'm giving it 5 out of 10 but really it's a 4.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Couldn't help yawning during the film, maybe it was because the PG-13 rating made it fail to be scary or gory.The opening sequence of the beach was pretty, fooling me into thinking that the film was a decent one. Then what followed was crap, occasionally punctuated by ridiculously hilarious moments that made me laugh, such as when the scientist (who called Mother Nature "bitch") slipped and dropped dead (Oh God! That was an accident! Praise Mother Nature!), and when Gerry's ugly old wife screwed up the whole supposed-to-be-quiet evacuation by dialing the phone (Haha! :-) Perfect timing, bitch!).After the screening was over, I was like: OK, better than Paul's pretend-to-be-resident-evil crap at least. Some scenes inside the WHO facility did capture that feeling of suspense and tension, a key element in THE RESIDENT EVIL GAME SERIES.All in all, I don't recommend this film. If you like zombie genre, go to see the great TV series THE WALKING DEAD, or Peter Jackson's Dead Alive/Brain Dead (1992).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WWZ worth a look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read the negative comments during production of WWZ, and knowing they reshot the film's ending, I went into it hoping that the film might live up to the hype.This film is all about Brad Pitt. He is the one constant throughout the film. Other characters were not as developed.The action starts early in the story. The viewer is thrust into the thick of things in a way that might be too abrupt, but the premise of the movie is that the global issue developed so quickly that the authorities could not contain it.The action is consistent. Once we understand what the problem is, the story quickly--through the efforts of Pitt's character--takes us to the heart of the action. We are transported from one location, and its tasks, to another. A claustrophobic feeling is achieved through darkness, confined spaces, offscreen sounds, and even rain. The mood is consistently engaging.The suitability of the ending might be argued, but I was okay with it. It did have an abrupt feeling, like other films that set themselves up for sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z: Look It's Brad Pitt!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>http://filmthroughmyeyes.blogspot.comPreface: I have no knowledge of the Max Brooks novel with the same title, so I will not access the film's accuracy to the book. The plot will be discussed in full in this review, so there are spoilers all over the place. INTRO:Based on the 2006 book World War Z by Max Brooks, the film adaptation is a highly publicized blockbuster staring the one and only Brad Pitt who is tasked with finding a solution to the worlds newest pandemic, a zombie virus. The film is set in the current time period and at various cities throughout the globe that are all responding to the crisis differently. The film blends many genres together to produce a dramatic, action based horror film. ACTING:Brad Pitt is obviously the main attraction for this film. Anything with his name on it sells like hotcakes, and I'm not excluded from that group. I enjoyed his performance; not one of his best but it's still quality. His character is a very common one for Brad, a multi-talented, clear thinking, family oriented military man. A man's man. Someone for the entirety of the male gender to look up to and inspire to be, so the role wasn't much of a stretch for Pitt. He's got that character in his back pocket ready to go.The rest of the cast was very difficult to judge, because there were no other characters that had any significant amount of screen time. The Lane family disappears after about the first 20 minutes. Thierry Umutoni is only seen in brief phone calls. The only character that makes it to multiple cities with Gerry is Segen, but she has maybe 3 lines in the whole film. Overall, there supporting cast is just that there to aid Gerry in his mission and not be noticed. This just makes the acting insignificant and undefined. TAKEAWAYS:The amount of money spent on this movie is pretty exorbitant, but the viewer can definitely see where it all went. There are a numerous airplanes used in the film as well as helicopters. The sets are very large and the animation for the zombies is very well done. That being said, the film doesn't deliver on the $190 million dollar budget that was shelled out to create the film adaptation. The movie will not be remembered even a few months from now. This isn't a movie I ever plan to watch again, let alone buy. That said I do recommend seeing this movie at least once. It's a change from the typical zombie film and the story that followed Gerry's journey kept me involved. The more plague like scenario seems plausible versus most of the other theories on how to cause a zombie apocalypse. The $5 I spent to go see the film was well worth it and I enjoyed the two hours in the theater. RATING:The film gets 2.5/5 Chuck Norris thumbs ups.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's in a name?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's often futile to compare a movie to its source material, especially if the movie is loosely based or just inspired by it. However, the case with Word War Z makes me wonder. Who is the intended audience for World War Z? In all aspects it's an OK zombie flick, a genre ridden with mediocrity. There are jarring plot holes and inconsistencies but not worse than in other similar movies. After all, this is a big budget movie made for a broad audience and that is perhaps the first problem. Is it even possible to make an involving zombie movie with PG-13? The effects are well done but there is no blood and it's not especially scary in comparison. The beginning of the movie is really good. Small hints of a catastrophe are looming in the background throughout the introduction. The audience just waits for the sh*t to hit the fan and with casualties in the billions it sure does, and quick. The organic blob-like waves of attacking zombies as seen in the trailers is a "fresh" new take to the genre. Things take a turn for the dumb quite quickly. There are too many "really?!?" moment, like "did they really survive that?" Make no mistake; this is a movie about Brad Pitt with a few extras on the side. Expect no intricate character portraits. This might be surprising since the book had no protagonist whatsoever. Yes, the book. If you have read the book and liked it odds are you will be disappointed. WWZ is one of the few books that addressed the issues of what the real result of a viral zombie outbreak and its long lasting effects would be. It's obvious that the author Max Brooks was (perhaps a bit too) obsessed with the idea. If you are kind you might say that the movie is set in the same universe as the book but even that is stretching it too far. The book is a well reasoned exercise in different aspect of cause and consequence in the face of an inhuman catastrophe. The movie is without spoiling too much, everything but that. Now, if you are going to throw the basic premise of a book out the window you are bound to alienate a big part of the audience, but why when call it "Word War Z"? "I am legend" made the same mistake. This is a generic zombie movie and I tried to watch it as such, but it's hard to disregard the title. Now if you like Brad Pitt, please try to watch him best a zombie apocalypse without thinking too much about that book, OK?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains spoiler I really wish I could give this movie a 8.5 because its better than a 8 but not quite a 9. I had to just get that off my chest. Now to the movie I thought this was one of the best if not, the best zombie movie I have ever seen and I am pleased that it is doing well at the box office. I have to applause Brad Pitts performance as Gerry lane and I have to say I like how director Marc Foster took the book World War Z and made it into one character that the movie surround one man. The was the zombies were depicted seemed more realistic being that the virus pushed the human body to the brink and how the zombies are consistently clicking their teeth together and how the humans figured it out and used it to their advantage. Brad Pitt was, I thought fantastic and for a man who doesn't do big budget movies or blockbusters, he did a great job and I was very happy he was chosen to be the lead. I thought it was great how Foster had the lead scientist shoot himself by accident and made Pitt figure out the cure. Mireille Enos did a good job as Karen lane, Gerry's wife. James Badge Dale did a good job as Captain Speke and I liked how Segan lives and helps Gerry and I have to applause Daniella Kertesz for her job. And have to say Fana Mokoena did a good job as Thierry Umutoni, the UN Deputy Secretary-General. Marc Foster did a great job getting the movie finished with all of the setbacks and the idea of having the cure be any deadly disease was probably the most creative cure I have ever seen used for the movies and I thought it was such an ingenious idea.

There were a couple moments where hysterical laughter and collective sighs were heard throughout...Now as far as doing justice to the book, it veers off pretty quickly, the main difference being that in the book you get several different viewpoints that end up forming a bigger picture. I had no expectations going in as soon as I read online (about a year ago) that "the zombies were running, they were the fast kind". Every fan of the genre knows that it's unusual for something positive to follow this last two sentences, so I was expecting something more along the lines of "28 Days" instead of "The Dead" series (which does no justice at all to the book).I can understand people getting angry about this as someone who appreciated the book, that this was actually a waste of an excellent book in its translation to the cinematic format, but since I had no expectations to begin with, the "running zombies" ended up adding to the overall pace of the action, and with the best 3d rendition I've ever seen in a movie, it ended up feeling more like an amusement park ride than an actual movie experience. The only major critique is the way it ended, it left me with the impression that the production topped out of their budget before they noticed they had to end it...All in all, totally worth a watch. The 3d is natural and gorgeous, and makes the whole experience very involving. Coupled with the pace, it was FUN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a fan of Hollywood movies but This one seemed like something new and I just wanted to see how good is this experiment of Hollywood. It looked quite funny in trailers but in actual it is not that funny. The characters were terribly played by the actors. Brad Pitt plays the role of a UN representative. I just can't believe that character played by Brad Pitt could get a government job.Good bits: 1. Something new to see from Hollywood.2. Not another love story.3. Not those typical Hollywood moments.Bad bits: 1. Terrible acting except Mokoena and Jerins.2. Not much of Violence, Gore and Gun play that you would expect in a Zombie movie.3. Plot holes, illogical even for a ZomRom.Verdict: You can enjoy this movie if you have never seen any Zombie Comedy before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), a United Nations worker who leaves his family behind and travels around the world and tries to find a cure to stop the zombies from taking over the world.I had mixed expectations going into World War Z. I had a feeling that this might turn out good, but I had another feeling that this will turn out being garbage. I enjoy Brad Pitt as an actor. His performances in Moneyball and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button stand out for me as two of the best performances I've seen from him. He was the main reason why I went into World War Z. Quite frankly, after coming out of this movie, I find it to be simple yet solidly entertaining.Either playing a good guy or a bad guy, Brad Pitt always does a convincing job, especially in this movie where he is mainly the star and delivers a fine job as Gerry Lane, the U.N. worker who not only wants his family be safe and sound, but to become capable of ending this international zombie apocalypse by finding a cure.At first, I became risky on how the zombies will look like in the final product. I found them to be somewhat realistic and somewhat silly. I like how different they are compared to the typical zombies you see in an old-fashioned zombie movie. Usually zombies are moaning and walking slowly, but here, the zombies are upright crazy. That sort of leads to one of the problems with the zombies: their effects. The special effects of the zombies are HORRIBLE!The apocalypse scenes and the cinematography (especially the scene in Jerusalem) are depicted fabulously. Marc Forster does seem to cut the scenes way too quickly at times; he does know how to build suspense within the last hour of the film. Although the movie did end quite poorly, I find it to be quite average.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie did for the Zombie genre what SW I: The Phantom Menace did for the Star Wars franchise. There were a lot of hype and chatter about the movie that will end all zombie movies, but instead we have Mr. Rogers is chopping arms off off screen: The magical journey around the world.I thought that Hollywood would never sink so low after the cheesy virus upload in Independence Day. There are so many plot holes in the movies that it has become the only thing holding it together. One would assume that the communication channels would be more intact (and there weren't any 20 minutes into the movie) and yet at the end of the movie it was suggested that all is working fine and dandy, which means the zombie hordes didn't overrun the power companies??? This movie is what happens if the only movies the director ever saw was Starship Troopers, Independence Day,2012, Jurassic Park and 28 day later (the latter being a superior movie to this one). I think the main villain of this movie is Brad Pitt's character because everywhere he turns up, things goes from just about fine to disastrous.Anyway, this is NOT a zombie movie, it's a Brad Pitt movie. It's not a tragedy when someone arms gets chopped off and the victim almost kind of yells: "Jiminy Cricket mister! You just chopped my arm off". The end monologue was so corny and cheesy that that alone is enough to ask your ticket money back. In any case, a zombie movie where all the biting and gore happens off screen is like a cowboy movie without the cowboys. The only selling point of this movie is the swarming of the zombies, all 4 minutes worth of it! If your thing is to watch CGI zombies climb on top of each other, then WWZ is four you.</fullReview>

The way they find a cure it's utterly pathetic, really disappointed. So disappointed that I've decided to do something I very rarely do: leave a review.

		<shortDescription>The best summer blockbuster movie so far (Date: July 8th)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The summer blockbuster season is not over yet, but this is by far the best one to date. Genre purist will screw up their noses, saying 'this is not a real Zombie movie, it's PG-13 for Christ's sake! And where the hell are the blood and gore'?Well, sometimes it's about seeing the bigger picture. According to box office.com this film has a total budget of $260 million dollars, which means the film has to make $520 million to break even. So good luck trying to get back this much money with an R-Rating. It simply won't happen. So making this film a PG-13 picture is more than understandable. And you know what? The PG-13 rating doesn't hurt the film at all!Because even if you had all the blood and gore you would still need something much more important. Suspense and creepy moments that will make you hold your breath. And this film got plenty. It doesn't even take 10 minutes and all hell breaks loose and the Zombie apocalypse begins. And talking about creepy moments, the one in the staircase of the apartment building will make your skin crawl.Those creepy moments get mixed up with a lot of action in the middle part (the scenes in Jerusalem and on the plane), followed by another calmer, yet very suspenseful finish in a laboratory.This film is very entertaining and suspenseful from start to finish. Highly recommendable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well we enjoyed it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie yesterday with my partner and we both enjoyed it. We took this film for what it is: essentially an action film with rabid, infected victims.....but for the sake of the review we'll call them zombies. The whole movie nods towards a 28 Days Later style of infection than towards zombies.The formula for this movie is very easy to follow. Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane,a devoted family man who just happens to be a former UN troubleshooter who is coerced into racing around the world trying to find a cure for a zombie pandemic that is sweeping the globe. The leverage for this is that if he doesn't help, his family removed from the safety of the US navy ship on which they are taking refuge.The strength of this film is the fast and furious nature of the plot and the action scenes involving the hordes of zombies overrunning major cities, a military base in Korea and, just when you think Gerry Lane and his Israeli female soldier companion are safe, an airliner in flight. Finally there is the final section of the movie where Gerry and companions have to fight their way through a research facility filled with zombies to get to the potential cure.The scene itself is set pretty quickly with Gerry Lane and his family having a normal breakfast time while the TV plays news of a rabies epidemic and martial law being declared somewhere in the far east before the zombie epidemic and all hell breaks loose while they are stuck in rush hour traffic. First of all we see the family struggling to survive as a unit, then after they reach the safety of the US Navy fleet at sea, we see Gerry being sent off around the world in order to ensure his family stays safe. After the aforementioned airliner crashes and UN lose contact with him, his family are removed from the ship to a refugee camp and we are then left to wonder if they are safe for the remainder of the film.Conversely, the fast nature of the plot also works against the movie. At times the plot seems very rushed to get from action sequence to the next and at times the camera-work is so fast it makes it difficult to follow the action. Supporting characters could also be developed more (the movie is essentially a Brad Pitt vehicle and all about his character) in particular Gerry's wife Karin, the UN official Thierry, the Israeli soldier Segen and the chief WHO doctor at the welsh research facility (who doesn't even have a name!).There are also some very clear holes in the plot. Why build only a single protecting wall around Jerusalem when there were so many zombies outside and how were the uninfected refugees actually getting in through all these zombies? What happened to the Israeli government official following the Jerusalem outbreak (given that he seemingly has such an important, if brief, role in the movie)? How were the zombies allowed to get over the wall given there were so many armed helicopters flying over it? How did a grenade thrown on board an airliner do so little damage to the plane?My advice would be go to see this film expecting an action flick rather than a stock zombie film. It's 2 hours of popcorn munching fun and escapism. It's certainly not an Oscar winner and not pretending to be. Oh, and i've never read the book so I can't compare it to that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfyingly good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Zombies, ranging from Romero to Resident Evil (the games not the films!) to the Walking Dead. The trailers for this and the marketing emphasising mass terror in all major cities got me quite excited. This movie will not blow you away, nor will it win any awards. That said, it isn't a bad movie and I left with a strong feeling of satisfaction. In a word, this movie is "good". It has moments of tenseness, but is never scary, which for a zombie movie is very disappointing. I guess that is due to the age rating, which allows it to be viewed by a larger audience rather than your average die-hard gore fiend. The special effects in some places (not often) is abundantly clear and looks hurried and this is never a good thing in a movie. Characters are good, though Brad Pitt's character has more than his share of luck. You do feel for them, but I personally think this is down to the actors than amazing characterisation. It would have been useful to have explored the devastation around the world in greater depth rather than just cities that are visited. The chaos caused to humanity is never fully explored and limited to dialogue. If you want a scare and gore, then this isn't the film for you. If however you want to see a good, entertaining movie, then this is a must.</fullReview>

The acting was excellent as always, the story was good enough to keep me in to it but I've never read the book and I don't know if the movie to it but from what some people say it's not. The action scenes were was above average scenes and the zombies look like regular zombies with less blood up-close but when they run around in those weird groups they look like ants or something but i liked that idea. For all of those people who didn't like it because it wasn't like the book you should know by now that movies that are based of books aren't really like the books most of the time so you shouldn't be surprised when a movies aren't like the book nowadays. So pretty good movie not a must-see but a above watchable movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, I'll admit it. It's easy for me to put my brain on pause when watching zombie flicks. I pretty much love them all. I'm not picky. Throw in a few great actors and high dollar budget, and I'm in hog heaven.As far as WWZ goes, this is a quality movie. Good acting. Good characters. High quality cinema. It will most definitely not appeal to everyone. Some will complain about camera shake (valid). Others will say that it moved too fast (valid). Still many will tell you that it was too far off from the book (valid), it's too improbable (valid), the zombies weren't as cool as other zombies (valid), valid, valid and valid. They are all right. But if you are like me, IT'S A FREAKING ZOMBIE MOVIE - and a pretty good one at that. Just be glad Hollywood put a ton of money into something like this and gave us something good to look at.There will be better movies of this genre in the future to be sure. But this goes into my collection as soon as it hits blu-ray. And if most people don't like it, great. That's will just drive the blu-ray cost down. Supply and demand is an awesome thing.</fullReview>

It really surprised me as to how compelling the stories really were. it was fascinating to get the perspectives from all of the different cultures and walks of life that Max Brooks included in his writing. It was really convincing. The movie however, barely scratched the surface. It would be almost impossible to wrap that book up into a two hour flick but they could have used more elements from the actual writing. It seemed to to me that they just took the idea of the book and created their own story for it. The characters in the film were basically composites of the people that Brooks wrote about. The film was fun enough to watch but it could have been any zombie movie really. It just didn't have the ideas and depth that Brooks brought to the reader. I don't think that they even referred to the virus(Solanum) at all in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A PG-13 zombie movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an era which saw the resurgence of the gore-centric zombie in movies and now with the television show "The Walking Dead", how do you make a PG-13 zombie film interesting? The answer is, you can't really. And as much as "World War Z" tries to abide by the MPAA restrictions by replacing the skin tearing horror aspect of today's zombies with high amounts of action and suspense, at the end of the day this is still a PG-13 zombie movie that seems to have left most of its visual potency/potential on the cutting room floor.Synopsis: Brad Pitt (who looks like he just came off the set of that Chanel commercial) plays Gerry Lane, a family man who is just trying to eat breakfast with his wife and two daughters when the zombie apocalypse hits. But little do the zombies know that Gerry is equipped with "a special set of skills". These special skills (I guess) give him the ability to be one step ahead of everyone else in the movie, while simultaneously the ability to continuously claim to have no idea what's going on. Oh and let's get this joke out of the way. Yes, his character does sort of adopt a young Latino child little a less than half way through the movie. Coincidence? Side Note: OK, so I haven't read the critically acclaimed Max "son of Mel" Brooks novel that "World War Z" was loosely based on, but I've heard the allegations of how only the name was used, while pretty much all other aspects where scrapped. And though this may anger loads of people who loved the original source material, they need to get over it because this is nothing new in the world of Hollywood adaptations. Plus, there is much more here to gripe about than a non-existent adaptation.But first the good stuff: In a movie like this where your average viewer is all too familiar with the villain(s) at hand, what audiences really want to see is something new when pertaining to the zombie look or mythos. So it was not surprise that the things I enjoyed the most about "World War Z" were the few aspects of this zombie movie which could be perceived as fresh or different. Such as: addressing the eccentric ways other countries would deal with an outbreak of global proportions and presenting these particular zombies as an unthinking mass liken to a psychotic mob that quickly devours cities full of people like locusts.While it does speak to how post-heavy the CGI is when Brad Pitt is on record criticizing the look of a movie he financially backed, for the most part the direction from Marc Forster (Monster's Ball, Quantum of Solace) isn't bad. In fact, his direction is more or less the reason "World War Z" is way more entertaining and suspenseful than it has any right to be. That said, the visuals are hindered by a story with hardly any preface and a troubled script that is unbearably sentimental at times.Along with a few battle sequences and more than a few stretches of unexpected suspense, Pitt's performance is a smaller, but still prevalent reason as to why "World War Z" is watchable. He does his best here, much in the same way Tom Cruise attempts to save "Jack Reacher", especially during the overly melodramatic lulls when audiences may be pleading for some kind of action. There is also one really memorable cameo from character actor David Morse (The Green Mile) who plays a toothless Ex-CIA Agent. And while he is only on screen for a few minutes, he does make enough of an impact to garner a few lines in this review.OK, so I know you thought that I was never going to get to them, but here are my gripes: There are basically two huge factors which hold "World War Z" back from being a strong recommendation.1. How the zombies look and act: In mass quantities (shot from extremely long distances) the zombies take on the terrifying feel of the aforementioned swarm of locusts devouring everything in their path. But in latter scenes, when Pitt must go one on one with these zombies (in extreme close ups) their mannerisms do come off as involuntarily spastic and awkwardly laughable.2. The PG-13-ness: The cut-aways here are nothing short of embarrassing. When somebody gets attacked, Forster cuts. When a solder has an appendage cut off, Forster turns the camera away as if something more interesting is going on on the other side of the room. Suffice to say, when any kind of violence that could beget blood or gore rears its head, Forster cuts away in a back handed constant reminder that, like a small child, there are things in this movie that we (as audience members) are being shielded from. I guess you could say that as much as Forster does to make this tame zombie movie entertaining, he does just as much to relegate it to the B movie status that it takes on.Final Thought: Filled with suspenseful, entertaining and surprisingly well thought out moments, in the end "World War Z" is too PG-13 for its own good. And even with the few "new" zombie elements, I would never expect someone to pay for this movie if they have access to a zombie television show with more brutal realism and better writing.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

There could have been more scope with the others in the film, I also thought this could have been considered a spin off from "I am Legend", Brad Pitt's presence sometimes kills the thought behind the movie but other than that its not a bad film, I have seen worse and I have seen better.

		<fullReview>An ex United Nations Investigator is forced to help identify the origin of a virus that envelopes the world transforming the living in to Zombies. The fate of humanity hangs in the balance as he scours the planet trying to stay alive and keep his family safe. Director Marc Forster, the man behind Quantum of Solace, takes on the daunting task of transforming Max Brooks' novel on to the big screen and does so handsomely. Forster seamlessly ties in the grand locations and manic pace with the intensity of the film leaving the audience at the edge of their seat for the most part. In spite of having a good idea of the outcome, you still find yourself rooting for Pitt's character. Although the visuals is the real star of the film, Brad Pitt performs expectedly well while his wife, Mireille Enos from The Killing and Big Love fame, plays her role adequately. Although not an epic and a tad predictable, World War Z is definitely an entertaining blockbuster that ranks among one of the better Zombie films. This is undoubtedly one to watch and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite simply appalling !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just wasted two hours of my life after being drawn into watching this Z movie after reading promising reviews. This movie is flawed from the opening scene to the last. I actually felt as if the plot was being written as it was being filmed. Not so much a cliché horror flick, more of a coagulation of confusing, badly dramatised, badly acted and at times throughly unnecessary scenes. There are so many holes in the plot that I don't have energy or the will to list them. At one point I just wanted the zombies to kill everyone, just to improve the screen play. The one redeeming quality of the movie is the special effects, nothing out of the ordinary here but it does give a feeling of live action, quite unlike any zombie flicks of recent times. That said I still can't fathom some critics reviews of this picture, it must be beautiful Brad that distracts them from the stapled together plot, or simply they are overly impressed by movies respectable special affects. If you watch this movie and enjoy it, then fair play to you. But I dare you to watch it again with a pen and paper and jot down any inconsistencies, any that wouldn't happen moments, any WTF moments or just any WHY moments. Be warned though, you'll need plenty of paper!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was decent. That's the key word, decent. Zombies are rather big these days, since Walking Dead exploded onto the scene. These zombies aren't from the old school, that's for sure. They are fast, vicious, unrelenting, and absolutely unruly. They also do this creepy little convulsion thing as well. Even though this movie was almost two hours long, I did feel that the movie was rushed a little bit, especially with the zombies. While they are fast and vicious, they are perhaps a little too fast. What made George Romero's original dead trilogy so effective is that it was carefully thought out. The action is often quite exciting, but it doesn't know when to fully slow down at times. Zombie carnage is often all over the place, and it became a bit much for me. I realize this movie is vastly different than Romero's vision, but I still felt things moved too fast at times. It does have a fantastic airplane sequence which is truly thrilling, but I was a bit disappointed. I also would have liked more scenes with Pitt &amp; his family. The first 35 minutes or so was riveting stuff. They felt like a real unit, and I was fully immersed in their plight. Then Brad Pitt leaves them, and that's when it starts to wane a little bit. While the action doesn't know when to slow down, the middle of this film doesn't know when to increase the pace. The middle section is slightly plodding. Not much gore here to speak of, either. Brad Pitt was excellent. I have nothing but great things to say about his performance here. His strong willed character and the ability to shine when the pressure is on made him all the more endearing. I'm not a big Brad Pitt fan, but he was awesome as the lead. He was the perfect family man. Mireille Enos had a subtle way about her that made me love her. Her performance as the Mother was great. I really do wish she had more screen time, because she was very good. I must give special mention to the daughters in this film, played by Sterling Jerin &amp; Abigal Hargrove. It's a rarity that I like kid actors, but I adored both of them. David Morse has a bit part as well.Final Thoughts: I know I've critiqued this film a bit, but I did enjoy myself for the most part. It is rushed at times, but it made almost two hours pass nicely. It's far from perfect, and it does have issues, but it's definitely above average. Well worth a watch. I'd be up for Brad Pitt kicking some zombie ass again for World War Z II. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A major studio, PG-13 zombie flick starring Hollywood heart-throb Brad Pitt: rather unsurprisingly, I opted to pass on this when it was in the cinema, preferring my undead movies to be very gory and very scary. But with the film released on DVD in an unrated version, curiosity got the better of me, and to my surprise, I really enjoyed what I saw.The script isn't perfect, certain plot developments being hard to adequately explain, and Brad Pitt's character must be the luckiest sonuvabitch alive to survive so many encounters with zombies (and a plane crash!), but disengage the brain and accept the less likely aspects of the story and there is a huge amount of fun to be had with this spectacular, fast-paced horror offering.Lots of brilliantly realised scenes of zombie mayhem, delivering plenty of scares and tension, go to make World War Z a thoroughly thrilling flick from start to finish, with the superb set pieces including a breathtaking race to the top of a tower block, an awesome 'zombie swarm' in Jerusalem, and the discovery of a stowaway zombie on a packed jet in mid-flight. Throw in a few superbly executed jump scares and what you have is a hugely entertaining movie, despite the questionable moments in the narrative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reason I say that something like this very thing could really happen is the source material from which it came from. Max Brooks, author of both World War Z and The Zombie Survival Guide gathered inspiration from many different and credible sources, sources like the Centers For Disease Control, National Security Administration, Central Intelligence Agency, and even members of the United Nations committees on pandemic response. The feeling from both of the books as well as in interviews with Mr. Brooks has shown that what he found is we are all woefully less prepared for a pandemic of epic proportions then we think we are. Now I am not saying that we are going to need to fear the rising undead as they come for our tasty brains, but that the very REAL idea that is explored in both the book and movie is that this kind of emergency can go from a mild panic to a world wide epidemic. I think this movie was made for fans of the books and not for zombie lovers. It was made for people who loved the references to things like referring to the zombies as "G's" (short for ghouls) or "Zak". This film was made for people who love the suspense that comes with long quiet, and then a shock. This was a great exploration into what we might do to rise above all that may come, and a feeling of hope that we could survive anything even the raising of the dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie Is awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z is an action packed movie that tends to get your heart racing on more than one occasion. The writers and directors want people to think it is a zombie movie, but there is not gore and decapitation like all good zombie movies should have hence it doesn't get past the M rating. There are some funny moments in the movie in which I do not think the director intended. This Movie has the features of a fantastic action movie. Yes the director puts hardly any effort into the emotional side of things but you don't seem to mind for there is just action and more action. there are only a few moment in the film where you can actually relax. I loved this movie and I would recommend it for action/thriller lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Zombie version of Contagion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life as we know it is coming to an end in 90 days. It's on us to change that."Marc Foster is a very versatile director. I loved his work in Finding Neverland, an imaginative drama. He's also directed The Kite Runner, Monster's Ball, Quantum of Solace, and Machine Gun Preacher. He has worked with very different genres and for the most part I have really enjoyed his films. World War Z was no exception, and he proves now that he can make a great suspenseful thriller. I was at the edge of my seat for the most part of the film and there were several heart pumping moments. I hadn't had so much fun in the movies for a while. Of course the film has its flaws, but I was highly entertained with this Summer blockbuster starring Brad Pitt who once again single handedly carries the film. The film reminded me in some ways of Soderbergh's Contagion although this film is more linear and straightforward focusing on one character. It isn't your typical horror zombie film where you have a lot of blood and gore everywhere. In this film most of the frightening scenes take place without showing much. I thinks this is much more effective in a movie than focusing the attention on the gore. O was really pleased with the film. I have to admit I had never heard about the novel which was written by Max Brooks, but I have heard this film is only loosely based on it and has taken several screenplay liberties. The screenwriters did a decent job with the story, but the real fun was watching the fast paced zombies chasing after Brad Pitt.The film centers on Brad Pitt's character, Gerry Lane, a former UN investigator who has decided to retire and spend the rest of his life serving pancakes for his wife, Karin (Mireille Enos), and two daughters back home. Everything changes when a strange viral epidemic begins to spread very quickly affecting every human being and turning them into zombies in question of seconds. These zombies aren't your typical slow paced zombies, they actually move pretty fast and aren't so dumb. Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena), Gerry's former boss at the UN, calls him back for duty considering the urgency of the situation. Apparently Gerry was one of their best investigators and so they ask him to try to locate where the virus may have initiated in order to find some sort of vaccine to treat the disease and stop it from spreading before it is too late. This investigation takes Gerry across the globe, beginning at South Korea, then Israel, and finally ending up in Nova Scotia. Along the way he encounters several secondary characters that give him insight as to where the disease might have begun. A former Israel military officer named Segen (Daniella Kertesz) joins Gerry in his pursuit.The film is packed with suspense and thrills and will have you at the edge of your seat from the very beginning. It probably begins stronger than how it ends, but it still is a great experience. I loved every second of this film and was completely entertained despite the lack of character development and the lack of any explanation whatsoever as to how the disease may have begun. Marc Foster succeeds in creating a suspenseful and gripping movie and despite all the production problems they seemed to be experiencing during filming, the film still ended up looking great and surpassed my expectations tremendously. Don't expect it to be a gory zombie film and you will be very pleased with this exhilarating film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"World War Z" Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"World War Z" is a post apocalyptic zombie film, but unlike other zombie based shows/movies/games, these zombies are super fast, super strong, and super dangerous. The film tackles themes of survival and the camaraderie of others in troubled times. It's a movie that feels very much like a big budget summer blockbuster, but it doesn't lack any depth. The director, Marc Forster, does a great job of creating tension and an ambiance where danger is lurking in every corner. There are some really nice slow points in the film, where we can feel for the characters and sympathize with their situation, that build towards a heart pounding action sequence. I really enjoy how this film sort of throws us into the fray instead of slowly building up to the threat. It really shows how fast this disease and threat is really spreading. This bumps up the tension and the stakes.The actors do a good job of bringing to life these interesting characters. Brad Pitt, while not his best performance, really makes Gerry into a relatable character. He's a family man that is well equipped with survival knowledge and tenderness to make others feel safe. Daniella Kertesz is a real standout as Segen. She plays a Israeli soldier that helps Gerry through his journey. She's strong, confident, and able to hold her own, while keeping Gerry safe. The rest of the cast is in the film for a short amount of time, but serve their roles well. Some characters can be unintentionally annoying, mainly Gerry's youngest daughter, but luckily they're not in it for very long. The zombies are extremely scary and dangerous. There make-up is well done and they're not like any other zombies that I've seen.Overall "World War Z" is an extremely entertaining and well made film. It is both fun, action packed, and well worth your time. The score is one of the best I've heard all year. It is epic, quiet when needed, and really puts us on the edge of our seats. It has interesting characters and a great story about survival with a goal that doesn't become some aimless expedition. I give it 4.5/5, a big budget summer movie that not only delivers on thrills, but also is packed with depth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is sort of familiar, but it works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who is not a fan of zombie movies, I do always find them at least somewhat interesting. I think the obsession with this genre is mainly because people just want to see how bloody things will get. My fascination with them, if I had to find one, is mainly just what caused the outbreak. If the outbreak is original, then the movie will work, in my eyes. That, and it has to be scary, and it needs to have star-power. In the case of World War Z, the outbreak is unexplained, it isn't necessarily scary, and it has Brad Pitt. And it still works.The film follows a guy named Gerry Lane (Pitt), a former employee of the U.N. When a zombie outbreak occurs, Lane and his family retreat to a Navy boat for safety. But for Gerry, it doesn't last for long. He is forced to travel around the world, in search of answers towards the outbreak. Obviously, it isn't smooth sailing. Judging from that plane scene in the trailer (the best sequence in the film).WWZ is a movie that proves just why Pitt is a star. Pitt is an actor who can really get any moviegoer at a theater, and here it shows why. Pitt does a decent job as Gerry, a guy who really wants to get to the bottom of this thing so then he can get back to his family. Even though there aren't really any other famous people involved (David Morse shows up for a scene, and The Killing's Marielle Enos plays Gerry's wife), Pitt is all that's necessary.The film is very well crafted for a zombie movie, even if it does fell a little familiar at times. The film is directed by Marc Forster, a director who has made quite a career transition. He has made films from Monster's Ball to Quantum of Solace, and it seems that he may have found something he's good at. There are some spectacular sequences here, and the film is always intense when it needs to be.WWZ is good fun, and damn does it fly. But that said, it is on some familiar territory. That, and I sort of wish that there would have been a little more of a buildup. We know the Lane family for about five minutes, and then, poof. We see a zombie. But those flaws aside, it is still worth seeing. Not only that, it is even worth seeing in 3-D, something that I myself and not a big fan of. See it. I had a good time.B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to see this movie, I was expecting pretty much what I saw in the previews. In otherwords, I saw Brad Pitt saying stuff in a soft voice while the zombie's run rampant. What sets this movie apart is how the Zombies are so fast and never run out of breath. It was amazing to see some of these special effects. There are many unanswered questioned such as the nuclear blast that caused Brad Pitt to lose cell phone reception. There was a lot of good stuff in this movie though. If you can overlook the plot holes, you will love this movie. You will have to get past the David Morse cameo and why his teeth are grinded into fangs. Great movie.</fullReview>

It started running from the first five minutes and didn't stop till the last five. Well directed, well acted, and a simple story that, unlike typical zombie/horror films, didn't have me yelling at the screen the whole time after characters made stupid choices.People actually make practical decisions.The one complaint I've seen most is that it didn't have enough "bite" or gore. A lot of zombie fans showed up for some intestine ripping and head chopping. Also unlike most zombie films, this one didn't rely on gore to keep itself afloat.Definitely the best zombie movie I've seen. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Didn't see that one coming. World War Z combines a great performance from Brad Pitt with great visuals and a, wait for it, realistic premise. The plot is pretty simple, find out where the zombies came from so we can kill them. But the twists this movie takes are intense and gripping. The overall tone of the movie is realistically tense. Don't go in looking for a gore fest. We are treated to a original story with a good script. Was the supporting cast great? No, but who does look good in the same scene with Mr.Pitt. But they are good enough to make you believe their characters roles. Overall this movie is a pleasant surprise, and is a great zombie flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a perfect zombie film, in every aspect. But remember: it's just a zombie film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw World War Z last weekend, and I decided to give it a quick review after reading so much negative and unfair opinions about it. These are the facts: It's an apocalyptic zombie thriller, so what do you expect? It's a perfect film on the things it proposes. It's the best apocalyptic film I've seen to this day.It has a very good pacing, with a very fast and explosive beginning that gives hints on what's on the way. Different from some apocalyptic films, this does not ease the pace at almost any moment, keeping your eyes glued to the screen. The characters are not the deepest on the world, but they're built just fine.What I really enjoyed about this film, is that it explored lots of interesting and relevant issues on a zombie Armageddon that are usually left out: how did it begin, where did it begin, how it works, and what's the cure, without, at any moment, dropping the thrilling pace. And it actually showed humanity fighting the zombies... This was something that always bothered me on zombie films, and I'm a big fan of the genre... Why the hell does not everyone gather up and fight'em with everything possible? And I also liked it that the cure is actually very plausible.There were some interesting geopolitics references that gave me chills... I'm not going to give them up, but they made me think "Wow, that makes a lot of sense!" And as if it was not enough, there's a great soundtrack, with an incredible theme song by Muse. There was also one of the best uses of 3D that I've ever seen. The scene on the vault on South Korea, with the flying dust around the dead bodies is very beautiful... Honestly one of the few times I've seen a justified use of 3D on a film.As for other important aspects, the acting is fine; the fast action scenes are well filmed, succeeding to pass the whole chaotic situation to the viewer without making him confused. The photography is very cold, exactly what I expected from this kind of film.Well, to sum up: This is a perfect zombie film, in every aspect. But remember, it's just a zombie film, so don't expect anything rather than that.</fullReview>

The zombies in this movie provide a vehicle for (and good old jump-in-your-seat horror relief to) a sort of war-game exercize that creatively imagines the behavior of global institutions and individual people given the Zombie Apocalypse. Other than that basic fact and the general premise, the movie has little in common with the book. The movie has nothing in common with the Zombie genre other than...zombies...and people trying to defeat them. As entertainment and as cinematic art, it's a lot of fun and totally worth a movie date. The characters are well-developed and sympathetic, which makes the storyline engaging and thought-provoking. The acting is great. The script is fantastic. The zombies are freaky.

		<fullReview>I am not really a fan of zombie movies, but this one was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Its not a horror movie, but there are a few scenes that make you jump. It has a ton of action and a great story line. It even has a little bit of humor, which surprised me for a zombie move. Brad Pitt does an amazing job, acting as a father and UN investigator. It is actually a very good movie for the whole family to enjoy. Not a lot of swearing, no romantic stuff either, and they really don't show that much blood. This is probably is one of the only movies that I liked more than the book. They have pretty much nothing in common, other than the name and a few other details, but the book was more like a collection of short stories from the survivors, which would of been a boring movie, plus hard to make. The movie was very entertaining and was better than any movie I have seen this year. I took 5 of my friends with me and they all loved it! In my opinion it is (so far) the Movie of the Year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best thrills arrive in the form of punishing dilemmas rather than actual blood-thirsting attacks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several varying approaches to the zombie craze all collide in "World War Z," resulting in an adventure that's enjoyable, yet heavily imbued with uncertainty and repetitiousness. The movie starts at breakneck speed with a frenzied pacing akin to a disaster film. A few chaotic transitions later and a hearty action flick emerges, showcasing harrowing chase sequences and the prodigious destruction caused by massive swarms of soulless ghouls. Finally settling into the intimate scares of a horror thriller, the climax offers an abundance of creepy, half-lit corridors filled with morbid shrieks and twitching corpses. Such an atypical progression provides early intrigue, but stilted dialogue and a meandering plot capped by an insouciant epilogue suffocate the originality of what is almost a family-friendly zombie movie. Perhaps there's a reason such a genre hasn't appeared before.When a ghastly viral epidemic (zombies) rapidly sweeps across the world, former U.N. agent Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is pressured into joining a mission to find the source of the disastrous plague. While his family boards an airship carrier serving as a makeshift operations base for the last U.S. survivors, Gerry heads to South Korea where the initial reports of infected soldiers first surfaced. As the clues begin to dry up, he travels to Israel to witness even their prescient construction of massive walls fail to fend off the endless hordes of rabid bodies. With time quickly running out, Gerry must piece together his own eyewitness accounts to find a way to stop the escalating pandemic before mankind is forever lost to the slavering jaws of the undead.It takes a mere eleven days for essentially the entirety of the worldwide population to transform into zombies (a term repeatedly alternated with "undead," despite the fact that no one in the film is ever eaten, nor do deceased bodies regularly become reanimated - the spread of the disease is through bites only). While this setup is as spontaneous as Will Smith strolling onto his lawn to pick up the newspaper, only to discover a massive alien ship hovering over the city in "Independence Day," it takes a much quicker approach to the immersion of central characters into bedlam. Like a sudden terrorist act, the creatures swarm the metropolis, creating panic, confusion, and destruction; the use of charging zombies is almost as timely as terrorism, though the horror concoctions are likely to dwindle more rapidly from viewers' minds.The primary problem with the film, outside of the fast introduction and impossibly broad conclusion (like "The Walking Dead" television show, it would take multiple seasons to make much sense out of the search for a cure and careful implementation ? there's just no satisfactory way to wrap up a two hour zombie apocalypse movie, especially since "World War Z" strives for adventure over scares), is the use of computer graphics. The hordes of monsters lunge about with superhuman speed and pile on top of one another with acrobatic maneuvers, stifling much of the realism and obscuring the more convincing use of makeup. Even the superbly creepy environments, full of atmospheric flickering lights and humidity, and the jump-scare cinematography can't hide the phony look of gravity-defying, boneless writhers. The best thrills arrive in the form of punishing dilemmas rather than actual blood-thirsting attacks. Crossing the disaster elements of "Knowing" with the action of "War of the Worlds" while borrowing a few shocks from "Dawn of the Dead," "World War Z" just doesn't have enough originality or momentum to save it from detrimental abruptness. The scenes that are tense are sublime ? and everything between those moments is forgettable.- The Massie Twins (GoneWithTheTwins.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Missed Opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z is a very disappointing entry into the zombie movie genre. Despite its high production costs, and accomplished director and lead actor; the film lacks a convincing story with intensity and heart to support its interesting premise.The film is based on Max Brooks' 2006 horror novel, World War Z. The novel was loved by critics and fans for its fascinating story and characters; the realism of the world leaders' reaction to the epidemic was especially praised. The film version, on the other hand, lacks all the qualities that made the novel an international success. First, the film diverges significantly from the source material; to the point that the majority of the story-line in the film was absent in the book. The movie is about a former United Nations investigator (Brad Pitt) attempts to survive the zombie apocalypse with his family; then later, his search for the first patient to get the disease. I am generally fine with filmmakers distancing the movie from the source material. If a film was simply a shot-for-shot remake of a book, it would seem very boring and uninspiring. Last year's critically acclaimed, Silver Linings Playbook, diverged slightly from the original story, which made for a more intriguing and entertaining film. World War Z, however, has little to no resemblance of the original story or characters that made the novel so successful; the distinctions are so great that I do not even know why they named the film after the novel. Excluding the comparisons to the novel, the movie is still an expensive, but bland representation of a zombie apocalypse. The movie revolves around Pitt trying to avoid, and eventually fighting zombies in different locations around the world (Philadelphia, New Jersey, South Korea, Israel and Wales), while he tries to survive and find the origin of the disease. The action scenes would have been interesting if they were not so repetitive and unoriginal. Each scene began with Pitt walking slowly, telling others to be quiet (even though they never were); then because of the lack of consideration and/or stupidity of the other people, they would get attacked by zombies, with Pitt always being one of the few survivors. What's even more disappointing is that the films visuals were not even that impressive. According to Vanity Fair, the film cost a reported $200 million. I am perplexed regarding where the budget went because the film did not have that many expensive action scenes, while the visual effects were mediocre at best.Often an interesting character with emotion and depth can make up for an uninspiring plot. Even though Brad Pitt puts in a solid performance, his character is too one-dimensional and lifeless to add anything substantial to the film. Pitt's character is the typical reporter in movies who does not get scared by anything; even when his family was nearly eaten alive by zombies, he keeps on a cool face. Moreover, after hearing that his family had been removed from the safety of a military ship, he gave a quick sad face, and then returned to his mission, seemingly unaffected. I understand that some people (i.e. military officials and police officers) distance themselves emotionally from a traumatic event to maintain their focus and determination; however, the character lacked any form of human emotion, which made it difficult for me to invest in his journey.The movie's plot was somewhat boring and uneventful; yet, it is still superior to most expensive action films. The story was realistic and flowed well; moreover, there was only one instance of unintentional laughs, and the story surprisingly did not contain many plot holes.The lack of intensity in the action scenes and characters really restricted the movie. I think the biggest mistake was making the movie PG-13. The filmmakers tried to sugar-coat the zombie genre, so that children would be able to watch the movie. I find it difficult to imagine an interesting and scary horror/action movie about millions of zombies trying to kill and eat the remaining survivors that is made for adults and kids. In the end, the movie that was about cannibalistic zombies had very little blood, violence or frightening images. I was never scared or disturbed by the zombies; nor, did I feel the severity of the world-wide crisis.World War Z is a missed opportunity. Despite its interesting premise, the film's one-dimensional and emotionless lead character, lack of intensity, and unspectacular action scenes makes this one of the most disappointing movies of the summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Zombie Movie With a Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** This has to have been the best zombie movie I have watched. I found the plot interesting and it had much more depth than many zombie flicks have in the past (with the exception possibly of 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later). Right from the start the action began, leading me to hit myself in my 3D glasses in an attempt to hide my eyes from the first real 'fright' moment. I was surprised initially in the previews I had seen to find out that Brad Pitt played the lead in a zombie movie and was a little dubious, considering that he has traditionally, for the most part, been more of a mainstream actor and not someone whose acting really appeals to me. However, he was cast perfectly in the role of the world-weary ex-UN Investigator, Gerry Lane, who was blackmailed into taking on yet another dangerous and potentially deadly mission away from his family. After the blackmail exchange, I immediately felt sympathy for his character and wanted him to succeed.As the plot continued, the early death of the scientist, Andrew Fassbach was unexpected, something I always enjoy. A well-worn plot is boring, and this movie's script is anything but well-worn. The young Israeli soldier was a surprise and interesting addition to the mix and well worth the inclusion to forward he plot and ensure a positive outcome. The originality of the solution to the zombie plague was pure genius and Brad Pitt's character caught on to all the right clues. Considering that almost all of the rest of the cast were relative unknowns, compared to Brad Pitt, the movie had a solid foundation and the acting was superb.

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitt never betrays us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. No, I even loved it! The trailer actually didn't excite me much but I love zombie movies and I know Mr. Pitt picks his movies carefully. I have never seen him playing in a bad movie. So I went and got entertained.In this genre there is so much crap out there and it bothers me every time when movie makers present it to me, as in the last Resident Evil movies that came out. But this one doesn't waste its screen time. From the very first moment (ok, I admit after the first two minutes) it dives into action and spares us long exhausting character and story development.The story and action goes solid, straight and unfussy catching to the line. Here and there giving us small hints at what could be the solution while still staying thrilling. Many other movies fail at that. These are the same pluses which made Judge Dred so joyful to watch. Guys, I am a girl and I am not easily impressed by action movies because often they are made up too simple as if a car chasing scene could make up for bad story-telling but however I watch them a lot because I like me some decent movie to thrill me and always hope they will deliver. Which they sometimes like this one do. This means I need the story still staying to the ground. Like here Brad is no uber-superhero genius, he can fight a little but he is not an martial-art die-hard. I like that. The story twists are plausible and not too much so the audience can keep up and does not get confused like in Inception.Other pluses are the rest of the cast. It is great to see that female soldier at the side of the main character. She is beautiful and feminine without being forced to play the overly sexualized girl soldier pin up as in for example G.I. Joe. Also there is almost a comedic moment when the virologist dies or better kills himself at the very first chance by slipping at the plane. That got my attention because it was unexpected and then I was at a turning point. Like how will they make Brad now save the world? It could have gone the cray cray main character grows up to a uberhero and develops an outrageous plan...blah...but it went good, they managed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected, I've seen all these movies, this is top 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure why the critics seem to be harsh on this. This is exactly what an "end of world" zombie movie should be like. What made this one so great was the fact that the film gave you a sense of the worldwide nature of the catastrophe. The amazing set pieces, overhead shots, views of other cities, aircraft carrier, refugee zones, airports, etc. For once an end of world film gave you the sense of scale here and this made is super frightening. Compare to "The Walking Dead" where all the action takes place in a compact area, a farm, a jail, a small town. You get no feeling for how this is affecting the country, let alone the world. Same for most of these movies -- you get a quick intro with a larger set piece, and then the film gets micro - you see a group of survivors in one small area, with zombie attacks, etc. So this is what makes World War Z simply awesome. The Jerusalem sequences are perhaps the best ever filmed for this type of movie. I also like the aircraft carrier scenes, seems realistic of where the last stand would take place. Only at the end of this movie do you get a smaller set, but it is effective. And again, by taking place in another country, the international scale of the war becomes apparent and tickles the imagination. Ten of out 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honnestly the best movie i've seen in years and the Best Zombie movie I've seen so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I all I won't give any spoiler or anything on the story but I will tell you of my feelings about this movie that I consider to be a masterpiece. I went to see this movie with good feelings about it but with a bit of doubt. The movie starts slow for about 5-10 minutes max then speed up a bit then kicks in. The strength of this movie is not the action it is the atmosphere you are always asking yourself what could happen what you hope won't happen. The characters are well played, smart brilliant, not that they are all genius but they act like real human would. They don,t go running all over the place screaming for no good reason when they know that if they make too much noise they will get in big trouble. The reaction from the characters are realistic. You care for the characters you encounter throughout the movie. The scenario is great, I have not read the book from Max Brooks which this movie is the adaptation but this movie is well written and you never really know what's gonna happen, of course you often predict what happens but when you think about the possibilities they are so numerous that you don't say "OK so now the only possible thing that'll happen is this...OK I knew it" their is always a myriad of possibilities. The movie is not a gore fest it is not full of guts or dismembered limbs at every 2 steps. The movie is creepy, even scary when you put yourself in the place of the characters boots. When the movie ended I was speechless, I see a lot of movies, I love independent films like Exit Humanity, but this movie WOW, I will go see it next week end and maybe the next too and maybe the next too. I only did this for 2 movies and they were 1. The Lord of the Rings : Fellowship of the ring 2. Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers.I hope that my review helped some of you, i give this movie a 10 out of 10 and can't wait to see it another time. Also I hope it does pretty well at the box office so there could be a sequel, it would be really awesome and great if there is a sequel and that it is done with the quality and efforts that the ones who were put into this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing revolutionary to add to the zombie genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for World War Z (WWZ for short, naturally) I wasn't too impressed. First, yet *another* zombie movie and second the CGI looked very shoddy. Plus I had heard that the movie had been plagued by production issues, numerous rewrites and whatnot.Fast forward to a couple weeks ago and for some reason I became interested in seeing it. I think I remember reading an article saying early reviews were positive. Shows how easily I'm swayed. Or it could just be that I love movies and I'll watch anything (can't say I'll always pay for them though)The positive scores on rotten tomatoes sealed it for me so I went today after work.I was just about getting over the headache that Man of Steel gave me so I wasn't looking forward to the 3D. Surprisingly, the 3D was well done. Zack Snyder needs to get in touch with Marc Forster for some tips on properly post converting.Aside from the 3D, there was nothing revolutionary to add to the zombie genre except maybe showing that a zombie movie can be done without copious amounts of blood and gore and still be quite entertaining. The CGI wasn't an issue like I thought it might be.Am I the only person who thinks Brad Pitt is a bad actor? He's not Channing Tatum level but he can't hold a candle to say DiCaprio in my opinion.WWZ is a decent 2 hours at the cinema. I'm not sure I need to see it again when it's on blu-ray/TV, too many other movies to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombie Mayhem at its Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: 4.9/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil KidA first-rate zombie film by all accounts. Brimming with palpable tension, replete with suspenseful moments, and pulsating with heart- pounding action. Fans of zombie movies or horror film in general will love this latest Hollywood rendition of sprinting, wall-climbing zombies. Traditionalists don't need to be put off by the this new, revamped version of zombie mobility and should instead, graciously welcome this innovative conceptualization of zombie action.The back-story is appropriately integrated into the proceedings and the each course of action is well justified from both, the director's as well as the viewers' perspectives. But make no mistake, the movie offers no spoon-fed helpings and you need to pay proper attention - even though you won't need to rack your brains - to attune yourself with the flow of this apocalyptic environment.One of the most delightful aspects of "World War Z" is that it boasts of an abundance of memorable, nerve-wracking scenes - the hallmark of most great films - that will remain with you for days after leaving the cinema hall. Some of the scenes literally have to be seen to be believed (especially the entire scenario in Israel and the film's climax in the WHO building), and you'll be begging yourself to catch a second serving of this delectable film at the earliest. Fans of the novel won't be disappointed, as the author's vision (though certain aspects have been tweaked for creative and cinematic purposes) is maintained in essence and pertinent and crucial parts of the novel have been retained.Most impressive is director Marc Forster's (Finding Neverland, The Kite Runner) assured craftsmanship. With just a few credible projects on his resume and no proof of expertise in the horror or action genre (please don't even mention the appalling "Quantum of Solace"), one could easily be forgiven to dismiss his merit as a director for a movie of this magnitude. But after watching the film, one would again be easily forgiven to plead with the studio not to change the director for the movie's sequel, and make no mistake, this is a sequel that will be eagerly anticipated when it's announced.Finally, Brad Pitt once again proves why he's regarded as a global cinema icon. He succinctly balances the complex task between being a moviestar you'll root for and an actor who you'll empathize and care for. Among a cast (excluding the zombies of course) that has virtually nothing to do - besides the intensely riveting Daniella Kertesz - he ably shoulders the film from the first scene to the last and prevents it from being relegated to just another mindless and fun zombie flick. "World War Z" is yet another jewel in his already studded crown and shall go down as a genuine horror classic in years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a seriously boring ''adventure''. It takes on a well told story of viral/bacteria infected (or what???) people who turn into zombies and a hero (Brad) who is called in by the US government to sort it out (yikes!). He obviously has family (wife and 2 kids) and needs to leave them behind to find the cure for this and save the world...The effects, directing, story and lot was boring. It wasn't really a new take at the subject. It was a very poor repeat.Brad... you surely should have read the script and reject it! If you are into walking dead series you might still enjoy it... if you are not, save yourself time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z has sufficient teeth to entertain you with zombie-led thrills, but its bloodless bite marks will disappear before the ending credits are done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's seldom a good sign when gossip about a movie spreads before you get wind of a proper synopsis or catch a peek of the trailer. The genesis of World War Z began six years ago when Brad Pitt's production company bought the rights to Max Brooks's bestselling novel of the same name. Controversy has since been fuelled by rumours of repeated script rewrites, reshoots, costly action scenes and an army of extras, all of which supposedly ballooned costs to over $200 million (check out Vanity Fair's detailed chronology of the drama here). Contrast that to another film in the same genre, Danny Boyle's 2002 critical success 28 Days Later, which had an estimated budget of US$8 million.So expectations are high for World War Z, which many may know as 'The Brad Pitt vs zombies show'. Directed by Marc Forster (Quantum of Solace, Finding Neverland), Pitt headlines as Gerry Lane, a family man / prized ex-United Nations investigator who gets a ticket out of hell when an unknown virus breaks out in his hometown of Philadelphia. It's contagious among humans, needing just a minimum of 12 seconds to transform a functional human to a mindless zombie with the athleticism of an Olympic sprinter, sensitive to both sound and visual contact. The UN requires Gerry's expertise and in exchange offers refuge aboard a vessel in the middle of the Atlantic. With his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and two daughters in tow, he flees via helicopter after a heart- thumping escape from a swarm of infected chasing them through an apartment stairwell onto the rooftop.Entrusted with the goal of locating the mysterious source of virus outbreak (otherwise known as 'patient zero') in the hope of finding a cure, Gerry unwillingly leaves his family behind and sets off on an international hunt for clues. Every step of the way is plagued with misfortune and accident ? some so predictable and trite that you wonder if it was intended to be humorous. After a luckless stopover at South Korea, he looks for answers in Israel, a country that completed walling itself in just before the outbreak. Just as Gerry gets limited information from a Mossad head, the sanctuary transforms into a torture chamber when the infected masses crawl in, ant horde-like, lured by echoes of celebratory singing. Hubris has no place in a zombie apocalypse. In the middle of a nail-biting escape, genius strikes as Gerry pieces his observations together to form a hypothesis on a possible cure? Testing and executing it, however, will require an extraordinary dose of luck, good fitness, and a WHO laboratory.Forster's World War Z is targeted at the mass audience and is possibly one of the least gory zombie outings in recent times. The crazed infected horde flawlessly demonstrates mindless herd mentality and despite being noticeably CG (unlike the uber-realistic ones in AMC's The Walking Dead), they're easily the scene-stealers. The script is sparse and loose, occasionally borderline sexist. The story busies itself with demonstrating Murphy's Law, throwing out crisis after crisis but rendering each character a level of development that is barely skin- deep. Gerry has little space to emote, and perhaps it is the material that limits Pitt from displaying his characteristic spark so evident in previous outings such as Inglourious Basterds, Fight Club and the Ocean's franchise.The zombie apocalypse is an arguably overused premise, yet still commands rabid obsession among pop culture fanatics. It's been explored in books, on TV and of course the big screen: the all-important 1968 horror film Night of the Living Dead set the tone for cinema. But today, the zombie genre only truly works when it is at its most contemplative, serving as a reflection of ethical, moral and emotional dilemmas or as political commentary. And here's where World War Z falters in mid- sprint: it is entertainment that is exciting, but essentially empty. -www.moviexclusive.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another American Vaccine Propaganda Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the norm now. Films, television and radio, are all tainted by government engineering, social engineering and downright mind control. This movie is really about Vaccines. Not Zombies. Zombies are the smokescreen.I knew after the first ten minutes where we were heading, because this is all American movies produce. Adverts for corporations and subliminal propaganda for their Israeli infiltrated administration. Vaccines save the day - regardless of what damage Vaccines have done and are doing to innocent people currently. Absolutely no evidence, or thought, is given to exposing the actual DANGERS of Vaccines, instead, Brad and his Joowood buddies, decided that they do a Pharmaceutical film, making Vaccines the hero. Forget product placements like Pepsi and the 'Military' again - this film was probably funded by Big Pharma. Pharma like the criminal bankers, are taking all sorts of hits recently, because we have woken up to their antics of poisoning innocent folk for profit. Brad has jumped on the bandwagon and cashed in, deciding to further propagate the illusion that Vaccines are not really about population control at all, or creating sickness among the population. They are about saving the species. What utter BS.The funniest thing is.. the silly people who rate this garbage 10/10. As a movie it's crap in the first place - inexplicable plot holes, shaky shaky shaky shaky retarded camera - utter stupidity - teeth chattering, neck smelling zombies - I could go on. Lift the thin veil and at its core, it's subtle pharmaceutical propaganda. I can't think of a combination more wretched. It's lucky to get one out of ten.Waste of money, waste of brainpower, waste of time, waste of critical thinking, waste of life. Millions spent on nonsense, while billions starve all over the globe. We don't need a zombie outbreak to wake humanity from it's slumber, we just need a species with a conscience.Hollywood is so exposed, it's becoming a farce. They are selling you lies and BTW, if you are another idiot that likes to credit Vaccines with 'saving the world' - go and look at the evidence of their ingredients, links to soft tissue cancers, autism, death. It's taught in medical school. The media tell you what Big Pharma want you to know. 48,000 people alone were maimed in India by these things last year. Of course they are safe. Of course. 'We will control the population with Vaccines'. Bill Gates.Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I literally felt like booing at the end of this film. It was a complete waste of time and money. They spent a fortune advertising this picture and obviously hoped the "star power" of the actors would be enough to carry the film. It isn't (and I like Brad Pitt a lot).I agree with the other commenter in that there wasn't nearly enough time devoted to character development. This is one of a very small number of films that I could not sit through. Sold on its special effects, which aren't that impressive by todays standards to be honest, the film has absolutely nothing else to offer. Alaborious, convoluted plot and terrible acting mean that this film is literally a collection of images on screen featuring the worst type of acting.I disagree with the comment that the film was even mildly entertaining. I was almost angry with the way the movie ended.Is it too late to boo? Please don't make a sequel...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zoombies!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By now, we're all familiar with Zoombies. They're the type of Zombie that runs after you with ferocious fury, as seen in films like 28 Days Later, the Dawn of the Dead remake and most recently, World War Z. Pitt plays a family man and doctor who is handpicked to help save the world from retro rigor morts gone rabid. He joins a team of smart guys on a save-the-world world tour that takes him from the States, to Asia, the Middle East and finally to Europe. The first stop is the East. They arrive in a South Korean airport on a dark stormy night where the only survivors appear to be American. The actors playing the Marines sound like they just played Call of Duty to get a sense of the grunt dialect. Each soldier is endowed with a s***t-happens attitude for good measure. "God damn it! I'm a Zombie!" Things take a turn for the worse when the genius doctor accompanying Pitt trips, falls and shoots himself with his own gun. Don't laugh! It's not funny! It's tragic! Can you imagine the phone call to that man's wife? "Ma'am, I'm sorry to say that your husband is dead." "Oh no, did he get killed by Zoombies?" "Umm, no.... he kinda tripped and shot himself."Then it's a visit to the Holy Land only to find that Zoombies are seriously intolerant of religion. However, the whole undead apocalypse event is convenient for Israelis and Palestinians as they can take a break from killing each other and team up to kill anything that goes zoom in the night. Unfortunately, ethnic harmony makes Zoombies more bloodthirsty than ever. When folks start singing, the harmonious levity attracts the horrible herd and they begin climbing over each other just to make it stop. World War Z is a wonderland of wow-inducing action. You'll find yourself jumping, wincing and possibly even vomiting as limbs are lost and corpses get carnivorous. You may even scratch your head as you watch Matthew Fox provide the most painfully obvious example of a performance lost in editing. Whatever the case, you will love the smell of necronoids in the morning and rejoice in the glorious gore as you enter the Zoombie zone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new kind of zombie apocalypse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you first think of a zombie movie what do you see? Slow, limbering and relentless creatures getting mowed down by a group of survivors with a host of different weapons and insane amounts of gore and violence to go with probably a pretty crappy story. Well at least that's what I think of. My expectations for World War Z were fairly high, despite not ever reading the book. Well what I expected and what was presented was very different, and World War Z changes the game and the way you think of zombie movies.The first thing that caught my attention was the PG-13 rating. As I mentioned, when I see a zombie themed movie I initially expect heavy blood and violence but it was clear right before the first scene that WWZ was going in a different direction. Instead of over-the-top violence, WWZ gets its thrills through mystery and the adaptive smarts of the lead characters through several extremely tense moments. There are the occasional traditional zombie action, where we see zombies being gunned down by the dozen, but they usually cut away quick and involve little to zero gore. However, the sheer scale of this zombie pandemic is enough to keep you entertained. At first I thought that the film missed out on some brutal action scenes that would make the movie more realistic and intense, but in retrospect, I feel as heavy gore would have taken away from what the movie was really about; the mystery of the pandemic's origin and the race against time to discover a cure.Brad Pitt leads the cast as Gerry Lane, a former United Nations employee who is fighting to keep his family alive after a global zombie infection strikes leaving the world at it's knees. Eventually, Gerry is forced back into action and starts a mission that takes him around the globe in order to find where the infection started and if there is a cure. The plot is pretty straight forward, but what makes this movie unlike others of it's undead kind, is the pressure of finding a cure before the entire planet is lost. As stated, the mystery takes center stage rather than a pure survival story. While there are some plot holes, including some predictable moments, the story as a whole is solid.Now to the undead. Zombies have been portrayed on numerous different forms over the years and in WWZ, they are terrifying. While they maintain some characteristics of classic zombies, like being very sensitive to noise, these zombies are brutally fast and large groups can devastate even the strongest forces. These types of zombies fare well in creating some thrilling scenes where escape is the only option. While some parts are predictable, the action sequences are exciting and powerful and the fast paced zombie style adds to that sense of vulnerability and urgency that a human might not make it out in time.The cast is decent, lead by the aforementioned Brad Pitt. Pitt's character is really the only one who we really get to know well,and this is largely because Pitt gets nearly 100 percent of the screen, which isn't bad. Daniella Kertesz displays a strong female role as Segen, but doesn't develop enough to have real depth. Gerry's family doesn't get too deep either, but their presence in the opening of the film gives a larger sense of possible loss and puts more tension behind them trying to escape. Overall, the cast is incomplete and the movie suffers from poor character development, but Brad Pitt shines in the starring role.World War Z without a doubt changes the way zombie themed movies are viewed. No longer do the undead have to be involved with absurd amounts of violence and gore. With WWZ, the rules are changed by creating a race against time thriller with the zombie sticker on it. Despite some plot issues and a mostly weak cast of characters, the high-level action scenes of adaptive tactics and escape from the undead will have you holding your breath, especially the highlight scene near the end of the movie.The zombie apocalypse has evolved, and for the most part, it as evolved for the better in World War Z.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the ultimate zombie movie it aims to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Huge big budget blockbuster adaptation, albeit loosely, of the Max Brooks novel of the same name. More serious in tone, the film explores the consequences of a viral pandemic that turns its victims into zombies, only driven by the urge to infect more people. A star vehicle for Brad Pitt, World War Z follows an ex-UN employee who is blackmailed by his former superiors into tracking down the origin of the plague in exchange for the guarantee his wife and children are protected from the terrors of the outside world. Unfortunately, it turns out it's not so easy to pinpoint just where the virus originated, necessitating him to travel around the globe whilst following various breadcrumbs in hopes of finding an answer, and if possible, a cure. Of course, this results in an array of close calls with ravenous zombies in various major cities, including New York, Philadelphia and Jeruzalem. The movie incorporates both close encounters with only a few zombies as well as major zombie offensives against large human populations as seen through Pitt's eyes. It's the former that make for the most suspenseful edge-of-your-seat moments, while the latter gobble up the vast majority of the FX budget, as we see zombie armies attacking helicopters and city walls in force. Such scenes look grandiose and work equally well as further examples of ever active post 9/11 paranoia, but ultimately feel hollow compared to Pitt's more personal experiences up close with the creepy undead. However, in those instances, these zombies just don't appear as frightening or disturbing as those of previous zombie flicks. In fact, if you're watching the TV-show The Walking Dead on a regular basis, World War Z offers little you have not seen before (save for zombie attacks on a bigger scope) and certainly isn't as poignant as a parable showcasing the failure of humans to work together for mutual survival, nor delivers it any moments of intense horror and gore that can match that show's contents. As an exploration of the legitimacy of our fears for pandemics, this movie also proves less effective as more scientific accurate fare the likes of Contagion: think of it more as the silly popcorn variety of that more intelligent type of flick. In addition, Brad Pitt is much too big a movie star to convincingly play the everyman out for basic survival and answers in a world overrun by the living dead. A less well known actor would have worked better for this movie's purposes, but in this day and age of ever increasing numbers of Hollywood flops, studios are afraid to make summer movies that cannot benefit from having big names to draw in audiences. World War Z witnessed its fair share of production problems, including a need for drastic rewrites and 20 million dollar reshoots of its entire third act. To the credit of those involved, you wouldn't think this film experienced such obstacles, as it has a fairly solid ending ? including a surprising method of avoiding zombie contact ? that still leaves ample room for an unavoidable sequel or two.</fullReview>

So i decided to give it a tryWhen the first zombie invasion occurred, i was expecting nothing more than a couple of bites and scratches.. But what i saw.. With every bite, blood spurts out of the wounds..What the hell happened?After some research i found out i had seen the unrated version.. And everything they say about the movie is better in the unrated version. For example: when Segen gets bitten and our hero Brad Pitt chops of her hand.. In the original version you don't even see the wound, but in the unrated version you can see everything!! Personally i prefer the ending in Russia (if you haven't read the news: the original ending should be a large scale battle in Russia. But this would be to expensive.. Unfortunately) but the "small-scale ending" in the facility worked out for me and is a nice ending to a spectacular movie..In the ending you can briefly see some raw shots from the Russia scene..So if you haven't seen it, just wait and search for the unrated version (they added 10 extra minutes :D) its much and much better than the original</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie. It is done extremely well and has very exciting action scenes in it. Brad Pitt plays Gerry who used to work for the U.N. While with his family he witnesses an attack where people suddenly become extremely violent and start to attack others. This cause people to turn as well and soon is in the middle of an apocalypse. Due to the nature of his work he is contacted by his former boss who agrees to rescue himself and his family if he assists in the investigation into this outbreak of what the USA feels is a virus. Basically he travels around the world trying to discover how this happened and how to stop it. There are great scenes particularly in Israel where the infected climb over a wall and start to attack the public. The ending is quite tense and even though not very action packed and very over dramatic it is still a satisfying conclusion. There definitely should be a sequel to this movie as it is very open ended and would be curious to see more of the fight against the "zombies" that have taken over the world</fullReview>

Based on the bestseller by Max Brooks, World War Z vaguely resembles its literary companion.Instead, this listless adaptation is more akin to a patchwork of expeditious but unexceptional undead, tired clichés and an obvious whimper of an ending.Incidentally, America's best defense against any brain-eating enemy is the Marines.Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting more or less</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie extremely fast paced. The story line itself was great and unique for a Zombie Film, and Brad Pitt was a decent choice for the lead character. Overall I enjoyed the film because it was really suspenseful, however the plot frustrated me. I was watching all of these characters assisting Gerry (Pitt) in his search for an answer to save humanity and they didn't stand a chance. The only one to remain alive in a team of scientists, Navy Seals, and Israeli Mossad was Gerry a mercenary family man. The whole entire movie he survived everything from overran cities to a plane crash, which was not a real enough scenario for the direction the film was going. which I thought the movie was pretty realistic in some ways if an event like in World War Z were to ever happen. The only frustrating exception was the fact that this mysterious ordinary hero survived a trip all the way around the world just to develop a solution to save humanity, so apparently he was a scientist all along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z is engaging , thrilling and stunning. Highly recommended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombies movies are common in Hollywood for quite sometime with Resident Evil series , Planet Terror, Warm Bodies, 28 days later to name few. World War Z touted as the most expensive Zombie film , does lives up to to much and hoopla surrounding it.As the entire world is hit by a plague, Zombies are becoming more ferocious and scattered. UN employee Gerry Lane must travel to the crux of the situation and prevent the disease from spreading to untouched location.From the critical acclaim films like Kite Runner and Stranger Than Fiction , Marc Foster goes out of his comfort zone and takes one step further into an unexplored area. From the very first scene, he goes in the main subject and shows how Zombies are attacking the innocent people and eventually the disease is spreading to other continents. The best among all these scenes was the attack shown in Israel. I would consider to be one of the highlight of the film. Another good thing about the film is they show how to camouflage the dead people and escape from them. Kudos to the director and story teller. Screenplay is extremely engaging and editing is tight. Special mention to art direction and cinematography. The only thing where I felt the movie could do better was the less-impacting. It is Brad Pitt who takes the entire film on his shoulder. Though the visual effects driven film does not have much scope of acting , Pitt is expressive and does a fine job.World War Z is engaging , thrilling and stunning. Highly recommended. 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good zombie thriller, but next time they should adapt the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Max Brooks' book "World War Z" is a masterwork thriller. It drips information about the zombie apocalypse to the reader through short stories, so that as you read the survivors' accounts you piece together a much bigger story. It would make a brilliant anthology series on HBO. They could hand chapters off to individual filmmakers to adapt into hour-long episodes. Rumour is that there was an earlier script that would have made this film 3+ hours and stuck much closer to the book's structure. The rumour also says that it would have been the first Oscar-worthy zombie film.But that is not what happened. Instead, the filmmakers behind World War Z, including producer Brad Pitt, have looked at the macro-political story that Max Brooks wrote and wrote a Hollywood hero into it. Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN agent who is drafted to find a cure. Forced away from his family to globe-trot the apocalypse, he deals with a variety of situations borrowed equally from zombie films and apocalypse disaster movies.Plenty of fans of the novel will be disappointed by this. But the fact that the movie follows a new character while (roughly) following the bigger story of the book means that the characters of the novel are out there. They are facing their own apocalypses. They just didn't cross paths with Brad Pitt. Sequels or (hopefully) an HBO series could give them their time on screen, but for now we have this film starring Brad Pitt.As far as films starring Brad Pitt go, this one is quite good. It didn't try to be funny, which most zombie films do, and the resulting tone was closer to Contagion than Dawn of the Dead. Brad Pitt is a solid leading man as usual. Mireille Enos (The Killing) is his wife, and in her short time on screen she manages to be a competent survivor.Something that often sinks apocalypse films is a transparently manipulative character. The screaming blond in Jaws 2 should have been the first one eaten, but she stubbornly survives to annoy the audience to the end. Fred Astaire's part in The Towering Inferno was specifically designed to break your heart. 2012 was hemorrhaging selfish and annoying characters to hate. These cheap emotional manipulations reveal bad scripts more often than bad actors, so it was nice to see World War Z did not burden its good cast with cheap tricks.Perhaps we will see a WWZ adaptation some day, but for now there is a solid zombie thriller starring Brad Pitt that happens to use the same title.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After trawling through IMDb to try and find a positive review for this movie I came to the conclusion that the majority must be right and that the film would be disappointing and a waste of two hours of my life.On reflection after having sat through it I can honestly say that its not that bad ! I think the majority of the negative reviews are complaints that the plot does not follow that of the book - I have never seen a film yet that matches or betters a book, a book lets the reader use their imagination and is almost a personal interpretation of events, a movie certainly is not. The film does not give a detailed explanation of how the virus is created but more focuses on the aftermath and the race to find a cure. It opens with a fairly dramatic car crash sequence and the pace of the movie never really drops as Pitt travels the globe searching for an answer. The plot has holes big enough to fly a jumbo jet through - such as how can a military plane fly from Korea to Israel without stopping for fuel ? The Israel section is where the majority of the CGI effects take place and is particularly impressive during the city siege. Overlooking the obvious flaws the movie is entertaining enough and is worth a viewing - just don't take it too seriously !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK i watched a short clip and just had to see what the rating was on IMDb, gonna watch this tonight and come back and give a full review, but from the small clip i watched the acting looks very good the sound fantastic the cinematography was absolutely spellbinding, damn... from 5 minutes of a random part of the movie i am really looking forward to watching it now. I have given it a 9 score as it really looks like something i am going to enjoy.... The short part i watched is the part that was in the trailer where the family is in the car and the Zombies or whatever they are start coming alive? Talk about some tense scenes this was really intense, it did not give the intensity in the trailer as much as in the movie and i am glad for that, tired of having the trailers ruin the Movie i watch by giving away too much of the storyline and the best parts of the action scenes, i hope that this is not the case in this movie but from the small clip i watched it looks like it is gonna be really good.Next up is going to be a review of my score and a short review of the full movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat entertaining zombie flick with a big budget...Nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one is a just okay zombie movie despite the huge budget that went into it. Which is a first for a genre like this. This went through a lot of re-shoots because they didn't like the direction it was going. And had like 9 writers on this project. The script just isn't all that great, it's basically those movies that goes from point A to point B to point C to point D in order to find a solution. Movies that go in this direction can work if it can get the audiences invested into the situation and characters but that just isn't the case for "World War Z". This is one of the movies that I had high expectations for the summer of 2013. It wasn't completely let down, it does have few entertaining moments. But for a movie of this scale and hype that has been going for it. It simply isn't a memorable flick and just comes down to being a good popcorn flick. It's a alright watch but nothing all that grand-scale when it comes to substance(although the visuals aren't anything all that grand either) and probably will not stick with the audiences and critics, they just won't really mention this as a movie that grafted into the movies you must watch for 2013. There just isn't anything particular that will engage the audiences to what is going on and what is going to happen next and how it will end. As a matter of fact the parts that are more engaging is the smaller scenes with Brad Pitt and his crew sneaking around the zombies near the end. Brad Pitt is just alright as well, as the hero who is trying to find a cure and save the world from the zombie plague. It's still worth a watch, but nothing special when it comes to the zombie genre.7.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent addition to the genre - go in without expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z is an exciting zombie film that, while it doesn't break new ground in the genre like 28 Days Later, still fares well in terms of entertaining the audience with action sequences and smooth zombie movement. The acting, however, is what makes the film. Brad Pitt gives an understated performance and the supporting cast is excellent, especially Mireille Enos as his wife and Daniella Kertesz as an Israeli soldier. I've read a good number of reviews from people who read the book and found the film disappointing. I have not read the book and did not have expectations as high as that - perhaps that is why I wasn't disappointed. Yes, there were a few weak points in the plot, but on the other hand I found action sequences very well put together, and given the logic of what the Pitt character was thinking, I found the scenes in Wales well designed and quite exciting.So, no, it wasn't up to the level of 28 Days Later, but I thought it was at least as good as 28 Weeks Later, a film that lost its way halfway through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formulaic action film akin to 28 days later...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The majority of zombie films usually end up being pretty awful, and IF this film were ACTUALLY a zombie film, it too, would be awful.However, this is NOT a zombie film.This is an action film. An action film that looks like they spent 200 million dollars to make. That's not a bad thing, for the most part.There's plenty of car chase scenes, explosions, crashes, frantic running, "Hollywood" gun play, and the usual mix of typical "Hollywood" action movie eye candy. It's obvious that the action scenes were the main effort of this film project, and some folks won't have a problem with that.For those that prefer a bigger emphasis on story and character, this film doesn't have much to offer. Nor does it offer any of the eerie and macabre tones zombie fans enjoy. As a matter of fact, this film doesn't even HAVE zombies. The creatures in this film are more like....Olympic athletes.....on a bad "bath salts" trip.Seriously.They run faster than any human, jump further and higher, and could have been substituted by say, rabid dogs, or wolves, or any other fast predatorial beast. If you enjoyed films like 28 days later, than you'll probably enjoy this film.If you are looking for a zombie film, this film won't cut it, however, it holds its own as an action flick.7 of 10 stars as an action film.4 of 10 stars as a zombie film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed but fun Zombie Action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw several negative reviews regarding this movie, yet in the end I still had fun watching it.For starters, just forget about the name because it has little to no relation with the book. And in second place, you should approach this as an action movie rather than a traditional "horror" or "suspense" zombie movie.It is, for the most part, mindless action with some cool set pieces and decent special effects. The plot is rather generic (main character trying to find a cure) and there are several plot holes and unrealistic parts.So yeah, I don't really feel like there is much else to say about the movie. If you are like me and you don't think that every movie out there should be about "character development" and a "deep/clever plot".... and you can enjoy a movie once in a while for just being a fun summer blockbuster with mindless action, then I don't see a reason why you shouldn't watch this</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z lacks a certain bite too it, that leaves audiences in a state of intrigued, yet slightly underwhelmed, flux.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quantum of Solace director Marc Foster returns with the multi-million dollar budget zombie flick World War Z, starring Brad Pitt. The film is based on Max Brooks' novel of the same name, which follows Former UN employee Gerry Lane (Pitt) as he is called back into action when a zombie virus spreads across the globe. The film has received a mixed reaction from critics, with the argument it has failed to live up to its highly publicised budget of a reported $190 million. Despite this, Paramount are reportedly set to give the go ahead for a sequel, whilst its money intake at the box office is growing at a reasonable rate. The film itself focuses on the role of Pitts character Gerry Lane, who as a successful former UN employee, is called upon in the worlds time of need after he and his family escape to safety following their near escape from the zombie threat. As with most zombie-related films, a cure is needed for the virus and the powers that be have little idea how, where and why it all began. After discovering a lead in the quest for a cure, Lane is sent on a task to help uncover the truth of its origins. On his way he is met with accumulating problems, but all are unsurprisingly, Zombie related. Thankfully the film is left on a slight knife-edge. Hope for the world is assured, but it leaves Foster, Pitt and company open for a sequel whilst still holding the audience somewhat captivated as to what may happen next. Thankfully Foster, with a huge budget at his disposal, decided not to CGI the max out of World War Z, which allows for a more believable story. However, despite its entertaining nature it still misses that certain knock out blow that you would expect from a movie of its size. It is an interesting plot that focuses not on just the zombie infection, but on the strain in puts on Lane and his family and his reluctance to leave them behind. But unfortunately World War Z lacks a certain bite too it, that leaves audiences in a state of intrigued, yet slightly underwhelmed, flux.@FilmTrance</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a mixed review for while I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and was sitting on the edge of my seat half the time, I could not help but notice plot and flow discrepancies. There were certain situations that arose that were simply too convenient to be true, or too implausible to happen. I also felt that some of the characters could be better fleshed out.In the end, as I am a fan of sci-fi and doomsday movies, I give this movie an 8 rating. I also loved the cinematography.

		<shortDescription>Better than some say!! Glasgow zombies!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people and critics have taken a swipe at the film but it's far better than any of them say and is overall a nifty, tense apocalyptic thriller with a lot to recommend it. Yes there is a distinct lack of blood and guts when it comes to a film about zombies but you know what? It was refreshing and different to see rather than the same old repetitive rubbish that populate a lot of these films. It works well dealing with the issue of family and finding a cure and gives the story a good shake, rather than drag it screaming to places we've seen a dozen times over. Brad Pitt is good and leads the line well, there is some good supporting roles for the likes of James Badge Dale, David Morse and Scotland's own Peter Capaldi &amp; John Gordon-Sinclair. There is a fair bit of tension and the build-up is cool even though Glasgow only gets 5 or 6 minutes doubling for Philly!! Marco Beltrami's score is very effective and well used as Pitt's Gerry Lane goes from place to place scouring the globe for a cure in the midst of a global pandemic. The set-pieces are great, especially in Israel and South Korea and mid-flight en route to Wales! Racks up the tension and entertains nicely, although not totally like the book it takes a lot of good aspects and creates a good story of it's own, although not to everybody's liking i'd say the movie is a good addition to the zombie genre and very good at showing the effects on a large scale and the swarms of undead and their leaping and climbing give it an edge over other dull zombie flicks!! Enjoyable and keeps moving from beginning to end! Can't wait for WWZ II !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently Brad Pitt is invincible?World War Z is by no means staple zombie flick everyone wished it would be. Nevertheless, it was entertaining and kept me interested throughout the entire film. The zombies were terrifying: extremely fast with vicious snarls and a knack for jump-tackling their adversaries. There were a few scenes (particularly one on a passenger airplane) that I considered 'cool', but I was really thrown off by how everything Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) did was near perfect. It reminded me of John Cusack in 2012 and how he perfectly escapes each catastrophic scene.All in all, World War Z will never be grouped with movies like Dawn of the Dead or 28 Days Later, and it will surely receive hate from Romero zombie purists, but for fans of horror/survival movies, you'll surely be on the edge of your seat.SLOW ZOMBIES RULE, FAST ZOMBIES DROOL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Down in the hole, World War Z hits a double off the wall, just shy of a home run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite problems surrounding the film previous to it's release, World War Z, lead by Brad Pitt, became a box office hit and was met with positive reviews from critics. This film definitely deserved them. This film had very good action, a good plot, and very good cast. Brad Pitt returns to stellar form after the mediocre Killing Them Softly. Also David Morse and the rest of the main cast provided good performances. The CGI was pretty good, but there has been better CGI done in other films without a doubt. The score by Marco Beltrami was very good as it had the same feeling as Hans Zimmer's did in Inception. All of the characters had very good chemistry with one another and felt very realistic. Even with all the good in the film, there were also negatives I took away from it. At times the plot feels slightly predictable as I pretty much predicted the entire last 10 minuets of the movie. Also, even though most of the characters were very realistic, they are not given much of a background or much substance except for a few of the characters which obviously involves Brad Pitt's. in the end, I feel that World War Z was a very good movie that fell just short of being great. I give it a 7.5/10 and a B+. I would recommend this to action buffs, zombie fans, and just about Nyone who wants a fun summer action flick with a good story</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really a Zombie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first off ... i have read the novel numerous times over the last couple of years and I'm not even gonna go into that. the movie is very loosely based on the novel, nothing more. its a fact and no amount of ranting and raving will change that now. as a big fan of Zombie movies the first thought after the end credits to "World War Z" was "this wasn't really a zombie movie". I know its an odd thing to say considering there are zombies in this movie but they really don't play any significant part even if they get a lot of screen time. during the entire duration of this movie there wasn't a single moment(not even the plane scene) where I felt zombies were a threat to anyone. The scene where the Zombies breach the Israeli wall you just think "yeah, they got over the wall but they'll cope, no worries".In essence this is an action flic and not a zombie one. There is no horror or suspense, its in your face action.</fullReview>

With all the bad press this production got ( re-writes, re-shoots, the feud between brad Pitt and the director Marc Forster, etc) I thought this movie was doomed to fail! All that aside it really wasn't that bad of a film. Yes the zombies ran, and I hated that about the film. There was practically NO GORE what so ever! There are a few very intense moments. The action and camera work was decent. Other things were iffy for me too. But! They totally try to set this film up for a franchise, and if they do they can make a much better WWZ film. They can completely expand on what they've started. And make this a worthwhile franchise. One episode of The Walking Dead is much more violent, bloody, and more of a textbook zombie story. A story witch I Prefer! But all and all this was still an entertaining summer film! Once again the 3D was done in post conversion and was pretty pointless to see it in 3D. I saw it on the RPX screen witch is almost an IMAX screen so I had no choice but to see it in 3D.</fullReview>

It is particularly insulting in the way that the Israelis are portrayed as the saviors of the Palestinians whereas it should be the other way around since the Palestinians are already secluded in giant Israeli jails!! I'm just hoping that this movie is not a justification for Israel to build more walls around the Palestinians. The movie is generally full of plot holes, stupidity, and lack of logic. This is fairly obvious since the beginning in the early onslaught when brad's kids are not grasping on to him and actually leaving their parents in the midst of it. Also, while on the run, why can't the mother soothe her daughter who's having some kind of strange attack which seems to be asthma. Also, when running around for supplies, the mom puts the daughter in the cart wasting all the space for survival supplies. She survived getting raped or assaulted in the middle of the supermarket but still managed to get a large supply of flares that were mostly wasted. ... This is only in the beginning so I won't say anymore to avoid spoiling this thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brad Pitt stars in this apocalyptic spectacle concerning a world-wide zombie uprising. A patchwork of scenes of zombies amok and a determined everyday man trying to stop a horrific pandemic. Sounds like money and a winner. Most everything in the life of former United Nations investigator Gerry Lane(Pitt)and his family are falling in line with many hopes and dreams. But how long do you think that peace and happiness lasts now days? Somehow a disease has caused zombies to attack those still pumping blood. Mindless zombies are threatening to spread a mysterious infection to all corners of the earth. Lane is reluctantly pressed into action and takes on the mission of traveling the globe to investigate this horrible calamity threatening mankind. Lane bravely goes against all odds in search of answers before there is nothing left but zombies feeding off of each other. Expect to be totally immersed with this gargantuan production from beginning to end. If Pitt can't pull this off, who can? Well, come on...you know what I mean. WORLD WAR Z is rated PG-13 due to graphic and disturbing images of zombie violence. Rounding out the cast: Mireille Enos, James Badge Dale, David Morse, Peter Capaldi, Sterling Jerins and Abigail Hargrove.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never mind the naysayers, this Z flic is stupendous; intelligent, gripping, even touching in certain parts. One senses a certain fatigue with the Undead trope- movies dating back to the 60s and a popular TV series. Granted, this one doesn't follow the book, there were deleted scenes and (apparently) numerous rewrites during production but the final product stands on its own and merits a sequel. Judge it as a stand alone.Pitt contributes a solid performance minus the customary superhero excesses and Daniella Kertesz, as the wounded Israeli soldier, comes off as courageous yet heartbreakingly vulnerable.There's little gore and the CGI effects and set pieces, for example the scenes within the walled off city of Jerusalem, are stunning. The Zombies inspire genuine fright. Unlike the shuffling ghouls in Walking Dead, for example, these guys go for your throat sprinting.I read Brook's novel and appreciated the sophisticated geopolitical take. But, let's be honest, the fact that it consists essentially of vignettes and post facto interviews with survivors of Z encounters renders it less than ideal for film treatment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saves the worn out zombie genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gotta admit: this sounds like a dumb idea on paper... Take a monster well known to be at home in the horror genre and put it in a summer blockbuster. Well I'll be damned, it actually worked pretty well. The story follows a UN Doctor who must travel around the world to stop a deadly zombie outbreak threatening to destroy the entire human race. The plot, while it deviates from the book in many ways, is really well done and really well told. Brad Pitt stars as the main character: Gerry Lane. Brad Pitt pulls off his role perfectly, and truthfully this is one of the best performances of his career. You buy him as a really smart family man who just wants to ensure his family's survival. The other actors do well in their roles as well, and their characters are pretty interesting and well fleshed out. How are the zombies: F*cking AWESOME! Now, I now some hardcore zombie loyalist (Otherwise known as idiots) are all up in arms cause according to then "They aren't true zombies. Why couldn't you make them slow?" Let me ask you guys a question: which do you find scarier: A slow ass zombie or a sprinting zombie who charges at you. Obviously you would say the latter. Fast zombies make for a far greater threat, and a better apocalypse. Slow zombies would get their asses kicked truthfully. And the makeup for the zombies here is really well done, and they are really threatening. What truly sells World War Z is the great action scenes. This is a summer blockbuster so naturally this is expected, but still: WOW. But by far my favorite part is when they have to sneak around the zombies: The suspension and levels of tension are almost unbearable. And the fast pacing of the film ensures that you will never grow bored. Overall, World War Z is a success. With great performances, awesome zombies, great pacing, and gripping terror, World War Z is truthfully one of the best zombie movies we have had since since the 2004 Dawn of The Dead Remake, and is actually better than 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider The World War Z is the best Zombies Movies I have ever seen. Being have Brad Pitt as the leader actor or the main character that's definitely added a lot in the movie. it's really a great action and the fear in it is delivered so well. the family scenes was addition to the goodness of the movie, the father daughters moments was amazing I by myself enjoyed watching Brad Pitt as the family man and he is absolutely good in it. the main character Jerry (Brad Pitt) have to go to seek a cure to this horrible virus just to keep his family safe in one of the most safest places. the obstacles he faced during his journey was extremely dangerous. the way he saved the female soldier. the way he thought to get a cure was smart. the whole movie is worth to watch even more than once. It's completely entertaining, interesting, enjoyable,and full of vitality and energy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been waiting for a truly amazing Zombie film, and I finally found it in World War Z. There was action, horror, tragedy...but also a great plot and story, and the acting was stellar. The intensity...my God, it never let up. I've since read the book, and though different, I can see where the film cam from. The book was great and so was the film. I would recommend this to any horror lover, and especially those that obsess over the zombies as much as I do.There were no stereotypes, no cheesy scenes or deaths, there wasn't even gratuitous gore...it was all so very real. And that just made it all the more terrifying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The world is plagued by a mysterious infection, turning the majority of the human race into rampaging mindless zombies. After him and his family barely escape the chaos, Gerry Lane is persuaded to go on a mission to investigate this disease. What follows is a perilous trek around the world where Lane must brave horrific dangers and odds to find answers before human civilisation ceases to exist.......In a summer that has been really underwhelming since the end of May, this has to be one of the surprise of the summer, even the year, because along with After Earth, this movie was the one I had little faith in.I needn't have worried, because not only is Pitt really good in this, its entertaining from beginning to end. The cast are great, even blink and miss them roles like Fox and Capaldi, so Pitt has even more strain on his shoulders carrying this.Forster has done a great job making the movie, and having not read the source material, its still a great story and slickly directed, despite him tripping up with Quantum Of Solace.There are three really good standout scenes, the opening rampage, the plane sequence which is by far the most tense scene of the film, and the final act, which despite being set in Wales, is is terrifying.There are a few parts that drag, the Jerusalem piece is a little out of synch, and the film has the worst product placement ever depicted to film, which takes you away from the film because its literally laugh out loud funny.But as I've said, in summer of depressing movies that could have been great, but were not, this is a refreshingly good blockbuster, and not a superhero or robot in sight.Plus, its the best film ever to have Brad Pitt stop for a refreshing can of fizzy soda whilst avoiding Zombies because he's a little bit ill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a horror at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So much negativity about World War Z that I was afraid almost to go watch it but I had to watch it because it's all about the hype of nowadays, Zombies. What I really can understand is the difficulty to categorize this flick. I just should file it under post apocalyptic, not a straight horror.To call it a horror it should be scary or for a zombie flick maybe even gory but none of that is here to find. We have seen it all before, flicks with major names trying to make a horror but failing in the fact that people who are used to see the big names dropping the flick because it's so-called horror. That's what happened here, Pitt buffs never went to watch it because the zombie theme and horror geeks are into The Walking Dead nowadays full of gore and here we don't have any (no gore and brutality off-camera) so they discard this flick too. Not that it was bad after all, but a lot of zombies are done CGI wise. The quickness of the zombies and the cleverness (climbing over a wall) do makes it a bit creepy but the scene's in dark alleys never makes it scary. Still, post apocalyptic lovers will adore this. It's a nice start for a zombie evening, to watch with the whole family before the children go to sleep and you are plugging in the real stuff.

		<shortDescription>A Great Global Zombie Epidemic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a bit cautious of seeing World War Z after reading and hearing some very mixed reviews of the movie, but thankfully I saw it nonetheless. Before I give you my review of the movie, first let me give you some insight on my zombie movie history.I've always loved zombie movies. Whether it be Shaun of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Night of The Living Dead, Land of the Dead, 28 Days/Weeks Later, Zombieland, Resident Evil (all of them), Planet Terror, Dead Alive, Walking Dead (the series), etc., I've always just been fascinated with the genre. Unfortunately I've never been much of a reader, so Max Brook's novel of have eluded me. That's not to say that I wasn't extremely excited to hear that a movie adaptation of his book(s) was being prepared for the big screen. The movie of course had a rough start since it was hindered by production delays, a bloated budget, and other miscellaneous bad press prior to its release. All of this gave me some concerns, but it wasn't enough to dissuade me from wanting to see the movie. It wasn't until I read a plethora of negative reviews about the movie from this site that I became worried this movie was gonna be a dud. I had almost made up my mind to not go and see it in the theaters, when my girlfriend and I decided "screw it, lets go and see what all of the negative reviews are about". We are both extremely glad that we ignored the user reviews we read and went and saw this movie in the theaters. It was money well spent.World War Z is a great global zombie epidemic movie. I have to say that this movie was so much bigger than any other zombie movie I have scene, and I've seen almost all of them. All of the other zombie movies out there are small scale. They are primarily focused on rural areas of a country, or a specific city or state. They would always explain that the zombie epidemic was a global issue, but aside from seeing quick news flashes or a radio announcement, we never got to see or experience the full "global zombie epidemic" first hand. World War Z gives us that. It's an edge of your seat movie that doesn't leave you with a dull moment and keeps you wanting more. I know that there are people that read the book and say that the movie strays too much from the source material, but you shouldn't care about that. If you like/love zombie movies like I do see this movie for what it is... A great zombie movie. If you've read the book, erase the memory of the book from your mind and just go see this movie fresh, without spending every second comparing it to it's source material. See this movie because it takes you someplace no other zombie movie has, "global". It has great special effects, great dialog, great actors/actresses, great action sequences, and it also seems to accurately portray the cause and effect that a zombie epidemic of such grandeur would have on our world. It's an impressive movie that is at the top of my list of all-time best zombie movies because it gives us the one thing no other zombie movie has. It gives us World War Z. See This Movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfectly Good Zombie Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a total Zombie fan, but enjoy some of the films and TV shows (Walking Dead). Went into this with average expectations and an open mind and was pleasantly surprised. I thought the zombies were thoroughly creepy and terrifying. Thought the action and storyline were fine. Some of the camera-work was confusing at times (in an effort to portray the insanity of the moment i suppose).With "popcorn" films like this I make a point of not thinking too deeply about plot holes or realism. Just enjoy the ride on the film's terms and you'll be fine. And I actually like the idea of a PG-13 Zombie flick rather than R rated. I don't care about the excessive gore that R rating allows. I can be scared just fine with the implied gore of PG-13, plus my son could come see it too. Win win.</fullReview>

Brad Pitt never fails to deliver as far as Im concerned, he has a superb screen presence &amp; really connects to the audience. The effects are amazing and it was edge of the seat stuff from the start. I was worried that it may just become another zombie movie, but it really does seem it can hold its own in the zombie market.

		<fullReview>so I went to the drive in to see this movie , note I have never read the novels or anything like that. I just wanted to see what looked to be a great zombie movie, which in this case it wasn't spectacular but it was better than average. it overall had great acting, intense scenes, and scary pop out moments throughout the film. all though the lack of blood, and its PG-13 rating though stopped this movie from being great, and I don't want to put any spoilers out there but also it seems at some moments in the film there is numerous plot holes, and points in the script were they seem to rush things. other than that the film is good. I would say it has potential to get better, but still is a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a tradition gore film but it delivers thrills an is highly recommended.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iv'e read a lot of the reviews for this film and basically it seems the people writing negative reviews went to this film with their own expectations and negative attitudes. I admit I'm not a zombie purist or fanatic. It seems there's a few camps people choose to belong to as far as what a zombie is and how they should behave. I want to be surprised and what a zombie is or how they behave is something that we won't know until it actually happens so I don't care if the film takes a non traditional course. These were bitters, not feeders. They were not dead or undead, they were transformed because of a virus. It gave them rabid urgings and adrenaline fueled strength. This film was not an exhibition of latex effects and gallons of chicken guts and blood. It was more of a cerebral journey with an investigative aspect. I think the characters were developed just fine and there was no reason to have minutes of background and filler to pull it together. This was a virus that spread rapidly and so the film moves quick and touches on details momentarily so just keep up and let it flow. The pace works and the urgency is there all through the film. The hints to the final "cure" are there and when it comes together it has a reasonable and believable theory. I understand the complaint that it moves quick and maybe it wasn't long enough. Another 20 minutes could of allowed for a bit more detail but it works. I expected and feared there would be some heavy handed "green agenda" or anti capitalist bent but nothing in the film touches those issues. Its not pro or anti gun and it depicts how people would actually behave in a stressful situation. I really liked this film and my prediction is that it will trend upwards as regular folks talk it up and people give it a chance regardless of what the critics write. Go see it. It's well worth the money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thrill ride for most of it, only let down by an anti-climactic ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z starts out with a bang, and just keeps upping the thrills from the opening scene onwards. Brad Pitt is a special UN agent who has retired and is now spending time with his family. Then in a mundane setting, they are stuck in traffic, when all hell breaks loose. Chaos and mayhem ensues, and its all done with a great sense of pace and style. Special effects are stunning, and look real. They don't have the "fakey" look like so many of CGI does these days in most movies. It is a real summer blockbuster popcorn type movie.The ending is unfortunately a let down, and everything slows way down with a much too long scene set in a disease research facility. But for most of the movie, it is a thrilling roller coaster ride with superb special effects and a mercurial pace. Brad Pitt is excellent in the reluctant hero lead role, and this is the first time I have really liked him in a movie since "12 Monkeys". And that is good, because he is on screen most of the time and in just about every scene, and carries the movie. The other characters all have minor roles, but the actors do well with what they are given. An atmospheric soundtrack adds just the right touch. A movie that will probably rank among the best of the Summer!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reminded of a simple lesson, and that's to appreciate movie reviews but not necessarily allow them to dictate your decision whether to watch or not. I would have missed out on a great movie if I allowed the negative reviews to influence my choice to watch. Very little gore but lots of action and very high-paced. To me it seemed like a bunch of other movies from different genres meshed into one. Plot is pretty cool, acting was good, effects were great. Couple of scenes/elements cost the movie a couple of stars for me but would still highly recommend this. For those who whines about it being nothing like the book just keep in mind not all movies *based* on novels aren't always *adaptations* but can still be appreciated in its own right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have never read the book of this film and i've heard a lot of people saying "its bad because it doesn't follow the book". it doesn't matter that it doesn't follow the book because if it did then the people who read the book will be sitting there knowing what happens next before the happens. for example if robert kirkman put every story from his comic 'the walking dead' onto the TV series of the comic then people who read comic will get bored. world war z gets right into the zombies and action right away and i at first didn't like that they did that but when they got into the story i thought they couldn't of really done that any other way. the acting in this film is amazing and they really help make the audience feel scared.the special effects were fantastic. one part that made say 'wow' was on the pubic plane and the zombies attack when they were in mid air and brad pitt's character blew a hole in the side of the plane and the plane crash. the twist of 'if you have a terminal the zombies won't attack you' is different but clever idea to bring to a zombie film because when i walked into the cinema i thought its going to be another zombie film of watching people running away with no chance of anything but the writes really thought of 'how can we make this different'.muse did an amazing job of the music for this film. i am a muse fan but with films i don't really care about the soundtrack but with this film is was nice to have a band i like and respect do a soundtrack for a film that i really enjoyed. i think everyone should see this film even if you don't like zombies films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While it was filled with one improbable event after another, it was none the less a thrilling must see for any zombie aficionado. Brad Pitt delivers a solid performance, though far from his best. The zombies, to me, were effective even if the eventual outcome in regards to them was, in my mind, a bit weak. Some scenes were definitely weaker than others, but I did enjoy the fact that military personnel moved and acted appropriately, one of the major flaws of many flicks. I did think the lack of blood and gore to retain a PG-13 rating was a bit disappointing, but they handled it just right so that you didn't feel that it was totally necessary. All in all I definitely recommend seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War Z is a zombie movie that mixes a number of sub-genres together. It's global war mixed with survival, gun-ho fights, local low-tech thrill ride, and cure hunting. You'd think that with such a mix, you'd get a mess, but no, Marc Forster pulled it off.The good. Almost everything. I'll just name the best parts. Very realistic approach, nothing is easy, and characters die. Extremely solid tension, your teeth might ache from all the jaw clenching you'll probably do. Very intense and well made action with eye-popping special effects. Lots of attention to details. A tight scenario that gives the ride of a lifetime. A riveting story that avoids a number of zombie clichés. Great score. Very attaching characters. Finally an American movie with a global event that gives more than just a passing nod to other nations.The actors. Brad Pitt offers us his action hero type with a coating of realism. The other solid performance, beside the two daughter (and to a lesser degree the wife), is given to us by Daniella Kertesz. The rest of the cast performed well, but nothing distinctive.The bad. The "I need credentials before I talk to you" is kind of a little bit much, but easily forgivable.The ugly. Nothing.The result. The best zombie movie ever. Also highly recommended to thrill seekers and action lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done, thought out, and more realistic to what a zombie outbreak would look like.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie did not have all the gore and intense makeup to make the zombies gruesome like a typical zombie movie. Instead WWZ takes a more I Am Legend look. It's very similar to that movie except more developed and better paced. The zombies in this movie are also the realistic type of zombie that we would see in real life if that ever was to occur. This movie seems to be getting a lot of bad reviews for not having the typical "Zombie" which is stupid to me. They are trying to make this a realistic movie and that's not how they wanted to do their zombies which makes sense. In fact I found them more scary because of the realism. The fact that it's a virus that is trying to spread makes more sense for the zombies to be fast and bite a victim without ripping them apart, then a bunch out undead creatures eating people.. I'm sick of movies being all about gore and how much money you spend on your makeup rather than some great, not overdone effects, and a well paced exciting movie. Luckily WWZ did exactly that and I really enjoyed it. Not only did it have me cringing and holding my breath many times, but it left me wanting more which a good movie should do. I think that is exactly what they wanted to do because I'm sure there will be a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Armageddon with Zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie centres around the main character Gerry (Brad Pitt) who is a retired UN investigator called back into action after an epidemic breaks out threatening global destruction through a plague. The movie starts off very fast throwing you into the thick of the action with spectacular visuals and sets the foundation to a very interesting story. It almost becomes a fact finding mission for Gerry who is left with the single task of finding the origin of the virus while simultaneously trying to secure the safety of his family. Gerry is sent globe trotting to find the origin of the breakout in order to try and find a cure. As far as a zombie fest goes it falls short of an all out gore type of movie. The action drops off and it almost falls into the 'War of the Worlds' type of pace. For me the end came far too fast and it didn't live up to the manic beginning. Interesting concept never the less and thoroughly enjoyable to watch. The story line is clever and is well acted with locations to match. If you're expecting a big grand final action packed scene then don't. It has a simple end which could leave you wanting more. Again I think this is more of a War of the Worlds but with zombies not aliens. I watched it in 3D but it wasn't really made for that so if possible stick to 2D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly didn't know what the movie was about when walking in. I was thinking aliens or an earthly being that decided to attack. Fortunately, it's not long into the movie you find out pretty much exactly what's going down. Think "Walking Dead", "28 Days Later", "I am Legend", "Contagion"... This movie is yet another take on the various apocalypse type movies. If you love zombie movies, then no reason why you shouldn't like this one. If you don't like zombie movies, then I still suggest watching it because this isn't your flesh or brain eating stomach turning variety. These walking undead are only out to spread their virus, hence their race, by biting their victims once if they can. It is clear that people are more like hosts for a sinister virus.The movie has a lot of tense moments and cool effects. There are scenes where you see exactly what people look like if they behaved like rabid ants. It is a good edge-of-your-seat thriller as you follow around Gerry (Brad Pitt) in his mission to find the origin and potential cure for this virus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast Zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "World War Z", starring Brad Pitt-Inglourious Basterds, Fight Club, Mireille Enos-The Killing-t.v., Gangster Squad, &amp; FYI: She was also born in Houston, James Badge Dale-Iron Man 3, The Grey and David Morse-The Hurt Locker, The Green Mile.This is a Zombie movie; that is what the 'Z' in the title of the film stands for. It is also one of the newer zombie films that uses a fast moving zombie instead of the usual slow-moving kind. The film is based on a series of books so if box office goes well, you can expect a sequel or two. Brad plays an investigator that works for the United Nations. Mireille plays his wife. They are together with their two little girls in the city when the zombie attack hits. They barely get out of the city alive, with the help of Brad's UN buddies, who then want Brad to do some of his investigating and find out how to stop the zombie plague. James plays a soldier and David is someone with C.I.A. connections that also might have some information about the source of the infection. In most monster movies, they have rules; some use the same rules as everyone else and some make up their own-like in some vampire movies that I know. Anyway, after being bitten by a zombie in this film, you have about ten seconds before you turn into one. As I mentioned before,the zombies here are very fast, with several scenes that reminded me of ants. If you are faint of heart about zombie eating habits, you don't have to worry. I do not remember seeing any mutilations. Most of the time, they would just bite and cover their victims-like ants- so you don't see body parts flying in different directions. The ending is definitely left open for a sequel-You even hear a character on screen say something like,'It ain't over. It's only begun.' It's rated "PG-13" for the violence and disturbing images and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 56 minutes. If you like zombie movies, then you should enjoy this one. I enjoyed it and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read the book, so I can't say how it compares to that (book obviously must have more fleshed out characters and such). I can only say that I was surprised that I liked the movie. And from what I heard it was the most successful movie Brad Pitt has done so far (Box Office wise that is).So while it was only PG-13 in the cinemas (there will be an extended cut available on Disc soon), it still had a few punches to deliver. Mostly emotional but also action wise. While the director wouldn't have been associated with Horror prior to this, he did a really good job conveying the terror and the tension that builds up in a situation that is depicted in the movie. It is pretty straight forward and therefor somewhat predictable I guess. But I thought they would be aiming at another ending.And if you have heard about the history of the movie you know that they actually re-shot 30 minutes. The last 30 minutes of the movie. Maybe it is apparent to some, maybe not. Shouldn't be a distraction or something that will disable your ability to enjoy the movie though</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different, disappointing, gritty and grim.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombie movies should have gore. Lots of gore. In what seems like a statement of dramatic intent from director Marc Forster, WWZ has very little blood and guts, instead focussing on building tension and presenting a rational view on what it might be like if there ever was a zombie-apocalypse. It's a shame, because there's no reason Forster couldn't have his cake and explode heads all over it too. In an attempt to ground proceedings and maintain a realistically sombre mood, this undead-pandemic yarn is also unrelentingly grim and overly serious, sorely lacking in both humour and action sequences designed to thrill (rather than chill). On a better note, the screenplay, based loosely on Max Brooks' acclaimed novel, emerges as ruthlessly pragmatic - despite having had at least five people work on the script at various stages - and gratefully sets the story in parts of the world rarely seen on the big screen. The hordes of CGI zombies are intriguingly conceived and the cinematography by Ben Seresin is unquestionably the film's greatest asset, whilst Brad Pitt is typically solid and charismatic as the ex-UN investigator who gives the audience a man to cheer for. Disappointingly, WWZ is not the film it should've been, but if you're looking for a gritty, Contagion-esque drama that gets under your skin then it largely succeeds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review on World War Z: I believe there are a handful of zombie films that do the genre justice (28 days later being one of them &amp; a personnel favorite). With the zombie craze at a all time high there's little left to the imagination and only so many ideas can come to life. I was always interested in the world war z books but never took the time to read them regretfully, so I had high expectations for the film. I have to say I can't find anything wrong with this film. It's so thrilling that I literally was on the edge of my seat though I knew what the outcome might be. I can see the evolution of zombies from slow moving snails to rapid beasts that move at such a haste. Loved this movie and definitely will be added to my list of great zombie movies. Must see film. RJ's Rating: 4/4 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z Takes Zombies to a New Level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brad Pitt has gone from youthful sex symbol to versatile actor and producer. His biggest project to date is this filmic adaptation of Max (Mel's son) Brooks' novel, World War Z, chronicling a massive, worldwide zombie apocalypse. For a subgenre that has ranged from classic horror, (Night of the Living Dead), to science fiction, (Resident Evil), to modern updates, (Dawn of the Dead remake), and parodies, (Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead), this film represents a rare depiction of the zombie invasion as a global, mass annihilation. Previously, these films focused on a small group of survivors (TV's The Walking Dead) with a news blackout and no idea as to the magnitude of the infection. After publicized problems with the screenplay and director Mark Forster's (Monsters Ball, Finding Neverland) rough cut (particularly a climactic battle scene), a new ending was shot, and the result is a remarkably engaging film. Gerry (Brad Pitt) and his wife, Karin (Mireille Enos), ready their two daughters for school and get caught in a traffic jam in downtown Philadelphia. Suddenly all hell breaks loose and panic sets in amid an invasion of zombies who are bent on mindlessly attacking and converting humans into the undead. As cities fall worldwide, the infection spreads exponentially with startling speed as the family flees to Newark for supplies and a lifeline from Gerry's former UN boss, but while the family finds a brief refuge aboard a US Navy ship, Gerry is called into service to find the source of the infection or risk having his family kicked off the ship as non-essential personnel. Tracking down random clues across the globe in such disparate locales as South Korea, Israel, and Wales, the trail for a cause and potential cure proves challenging as time runs out on humanity. In many ways, this film, which shares much in common with pandemic tales as Contagion, Outbreak, and The Andromeda Strain, is more a thriller than horror, and that's not a bad thing. Rather than relying on gross out murders and graphic blood spattered effects, this film looks at the bigger picture without sacrificing the more intimate moments of sheer terror, not an easy balance. Don't let that PG13 rating fool you! Some scenes are suspenseful and agonizing as the threat of zombies is ever present. The film, particularly in the Newark apartment scenes and an unbearable moment of truth at a World Health Organization lab, is like one big funhouse ride where the scares are just around the corner. Other memorable set pieces include the opening pandemonium in Philly, which is well crafted and builds to an alarming level, a walled in city of Jerusalem stunningly challenged by a growing sea of undead, and perhaps the best moment, a horrifying passenger plane flight from hell that starts innocently enough but quickly devolves into an impossible situation.The film takes the scary notion of fast running zombies from 28 Days Later and adds even more lethal traits as in their ability to not only swarm like insects, but to hurl themselves with great ferocity at their intended victims even through car windshields. Their victims aren't devoured as in other films, but rather a bite turns them into more zombies almost instantaneously. They are also real sensitive to sound as Gerry learns at the worst possible moment.What distinguishes this film above most others is its smarts. The script, while written by many hands, still shows an intelligent approach to a devastating crisis, and the dialogue never sounds phony. Further, the film is like one big mystery with nature's clues in full view waiting for Gerry to piece together a solution. Some of the plot points are a bit open ended and push the limits of plausibility, but things move so swiftly and convincingly, that most won't mind. The supporting cast is effective in brief roles with a strong turn by Daniella Kertesz as a soldier. But this is Pitt's show, and he is the right leading man who has the presence and charisma to carry even a zombie film. Being able to improvise and display cool under pressure, he is the ideal savior that the world needs. Perhaps his Gerry is guilty of being too perfect, but he does it so well.(It is amusing to note that Gerry and his family become guardians of an orphaned boy, and one wonders if Angelina Jolie was smiling at the parallels with her and Pitt's real life, nuclear family.)With a mega-budgeted production, the CG effects are a standout especially when creating the hoards of zombies, and there are many effective camera shots with some particularly startling, overhead views. There is also great use of sound effects that add to the visceral chills while the brooding, pulsing music score (Marco Beltrami) complements the tension. A thrill ride from beginning to end, World War Z is a thoroughly entertaining, scary epic that takes the zombie lore and heightens the stakes with an impressive budget and a star turn by an actor/producer at the top of his game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much better than most zombie films, but still only average.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some things that you get to feel in your bones after watching a lot of movies, one of those feelings that something is wrong at places. I have not read the book the film is based on, but I was having these spider-sense tinglings that some scenes could not have been in the book.Also, the plot reminded me too much of a book I hated with all my heart: The Passage, by Justin Cronin. It starts with character building scenes mingled smartly with action and suspense, than Blam! Reset! A lot of crafty special effects follow that last more than the character building scenes, then there are no characters left. All but the main character get to move to the next stage. Then it starts all over again. It does this at least three times. It gets old and annoying.You have to see this from my perspective: I've watched movies like 28 Hours Later, where complex characters and spooky music create a truly horrorful atmosphere. I've seen things like Night of the Living Dead, filled with social commentary that made the film interesting beside the moving corpses. I have seen films that use plot devices like crammed spaces to build up what they can't possibly build with their allotted budget. The problem with World War Z is that is it perfectly made, tons of special effects, many locations, scary running zombies (in hordes!), but the story is the same lame "lone hero does all the work and saves the day". In 3D, no less!This can be felt painfully in the last scenes, when really well known and good British and German and Italian actors play secondary roles that anyone could have played. It was like a weird twist on the Statue of Liberty text: give us your best and we'll give them mediocre roles, because we have the budget.Bottom line: so much better than most zombie films, but still only average. I know it seems contradictory, but that's how I feel about it. I will read the book only to see if I was right feeling that all those extra scenes were off somehow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast, Furious, and Infected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is recommended.Things have certainly changed in our fast-paced world. Our need for speed has become insatiable. Never is it more apparent than in the zombie genre. The dead are no longer walking. Today's zombies have been redesigned for maximum efficiency. Danny Boyle's ground-breaking 2003 horror classic, 28 Days Later energized that genre, and so does this skillfully-made offering entitled World War Z, the latest apocalyptic cautionary tale in a long line of disaster-oriented movies this summer. (This year's primary theme has showcased the bleakest possible view of our future and paraded those films before us with very mixed results.)In WWZ, the scenario takes a global look at the zombie fever as we hopscotch to various locations (Philadelphia, Jerusalem, Korea, Wales). The virus cannot be contained and we are almost immediately classified in Code Red epidemic level. The film is Contagion revisited as a horror genre exercise in terror. Gone are the slow-moving brain munchers, monsters one could outwit and out-walk in the past. This newer model is fully equipped with a metaphysical souped-up V-6 engine and can travel at breakneck speed, literally speaking. These undead are the new fast and furious with a "yum,yum eat 'em up" attitude.Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a United Nations investigator who is trying to find a cure to stop this pandemic. But first he must somehow manage to get his own family out of harm's way before confronting the problem head-on. Throughout the film, Gerry is put in action hero mode, having to be brave and resourceful as he faces off against the attacking hordes in an effort to discover the virus' origin and stop this epidemic. The reasons why Gerry is the world's only savior and foremost zombie exterminator remain unclear, but it is Brad Pitt after all. Who else can save the world when Tom Hanks isn't available?Meanwhile, the zombies swarm, multiply, and destroy what is left of human mankind, like crazed Walmart shoppers on a typical Black Friday rush (and just as terrifying). Director Marc Forster seems more concerned about CGI effects and creating horrific tension. He sets up one action sequence after the next to insure full audience interest and stages those set pieces quite effectively. (Particularly memorable are the siege at the fortress sequence and an in- flight zombie encounter that is edited for maximum tension and a scene involving ) The gore factor is surprisingly low by today's standards, which might disappoint some hard-core horror aficionados, but I applaud the filmmaker's restraint. WWZ is a fast moving and suspenseful diversion. Production values are all first-rate with special kudos to the sound effects editing team and Marco Beltrami's seamless musical score. However, the film spends hardly any time on character development or much narrative. Pitt carries off his role well, within the limits of the script that is more invested in pumping up the adrenaline rush than emphasizing the personal dramas and dilemmas of its characters. The talented Mirelle Enos as his wife, Karin, is not given enough screen time to help build more emotional impact as are many secondary characters who tend to be dispatched the moment they arrive on the scene. (Was that Matthew Fox who delivered one line of throwaway dialog or was my vision impaired?)But World War Z is essentially an action/horror movie that delivers much of its thrills and excitement due to Forster's vision as a director and the film's strong visual imagery. Seeing this film on the big screen will only enhance the movie-going experience. And if the world's gotta end, well, at least Brad Pitt is there for good company.

		<shortDescription>Zombie flick of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z gets its concept from the novel written by Max Brooks. Although this movie is not an exact adaptation of the book it still impresses in its portrayal of the zombie apocalypse seen through the eyes of UN employee Gerry Lane (enacted by Brad Pitt). Gerry Lane has been tasked with investigating the outbreak of a virus that turns humans into mindless, angry zombies similar to those infected with the Rage virus (28 Days Later) and pushes mankind towards extinction. The zombies in World War Z are far scarier than any you've ever seen on TV before.The movie starts thrilling right from the very beginning and is fast paced with many startling moments that will keep you on the edge of the seat. I watched it in 3D and I must say that I really enjoyed the effects. There were moments when I reflexively ducked to avoid an undead arm from grabbing my throat! The cast played their characters very well and were complemented with dialogue far more meaningful than your average zombie flick, good screenplay and a very intense soundtrack. This is by far the most realistic and thrilling zombie flick I have seen since 28 Weeks Later and will be on the must watch movies list of this year. Fans of the apocalypse will love it! A thrilling ride for everyone is guaranteed. 8/10 Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story driven not gore driven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Think Contagion mixed with a dash of George Romero's original Night of the Living Dead. This movie is about the virus that is taking out the world instead of the zombies that result from the virus. It's about finding the source or at the very least a means to find the ever elusive, patient zero. If you're looking for gore and zombies that are missing half their heads but still moving like an Olympic runner, this will not be your movie.There is little to no gore as gore is not necessary to move the plot along, nor to spice up otherwise lackluster plots or sub-par actors. This movie is not about edge of your seat blockbuster action and gratuitous explosions, it's about Brad Pitt and his adventure in trying to save the world. The story is simple, pretty much the same as most, Extinction Level Event brought on by a viral outbreak; not of man but of nature. The progression of the story does however meet with your usual action movie problems where main characters can escape pitfalls that background characters nor real people would be able to. There are also the usual moments where there are your usual build ups to the very last second of safety, like someone holding a door open until the very last second and then shutting that door with a horde of zombies with the force of a locomotive being held back by doors that wouldn't be able to hold if there were not main actors on the safe side of it.Despite the pitfalls within the story and the action movie formula, it does lend a sort of judgement day feel to, but because more time is spent carrying the plot forward, there isn't enough time to spend in certain locales to give the sense of extinction. Similar to Contagion, it's implied more than dwelled upon. Unlike Contagion, there's no real sense of loss and without that it's hard to care when certain characters die or become endangered. Brad Pitt's character, not having a background in medicine or virology is able to come to a viable conclusion on how to combat the infection a little too quickly given that some of the world's best medical minds have been hitting brick walls in 10x the time it takes him.This is not The Walking Dead, or Resident Evil, or any of the _______ of the Dead movies. If you're expecting anything like this, you will be disappointed. If however you go in with the Contagion drama mentality where there is in fact a plot beyond ready, aim, fire, reload, you may enjoy this film. The premise of the virus does have its merits based in reality to a small degree, more so than a T-Virus or the dead rising from the grave because of some apocalyptic biblical prophecy. This movie is rated PG-13, think about that as well. By no means is a family movie, especially for children who have a history of blowing things out of proportion or some level of pessimistically imaginative anxiety, I was one about 30 years ago and my parents regretted it every time.Overall, this movie should entertain, unless you're looking for a mouthful of human flesh in the mouths of the zombies and blood spewing or spraying out of open wounds. If read the book, then you may want to wait for it to come out on Blu-ray or DVD. But if you want something to make you think for about 20 minutes and wonder how Pitt is going to save the world and more importantly his family, then give it a shot.In reference to the 3D version, it was converted to 3D not actually shot in 3D, so there tend to be errors here and there that your brain will not be able to decipher and thus will detract from the experience. See 2D if this kind of thing bothers you, as it did me. Also, this movie is not worth the price of concession stand refreshments, do your eating and drinking before you get to the theater at more economic prices or sneak something in. Save that money and buy a ticket to another movie after this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't judge a book by its film adaptation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marc Forster's World War Z is an entertaining, if not flawed, adaptation of Max Brooks' brilliant novel of the same name.I suppose that much of what I didn't like in the film was due to my own pre-conceptions of what to expect from the film; I expected political intrigue, a set of logical character choices and actions and the time to get to know the characters, but I got none of that. Instead the scenes jumped from one to another with little to no explanation or pacing, the politics were briefly touched on but then ignored and the characters were two dimensional at best. Hardly the WWZ I read about.The most frustrating part of the film however was the lack of Max Brooks logic and storytelling. In Forster's WWZ the zombies turned after 10 seconds, or was it a few hours?... The zombies run fast, or do they go into stasis and then plod around?... Another bugbear of mine was that Forster's story deviated so dramatically from Brooks' storyline that there was barely any point in keeping the same title... Those who haven't read the book should refrain from doing so before seeing the film, it will save you a lot of heartache and frustration.Don't get me wrong, all of those frustrating little discrepancies aside WWZ is still an exciting action movie with excellent makeup, SFX and acting, and it certainly is worth a watch if you are at all interested in the genre. I am still hoping that someone decides to turn Brooks' WWZ into a miniseries, but until that day comes, Forster's WWZ will provide enough entertainment, blood and zombie gore to satisfy my post- apocalyptic fantasies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was with this film only expecting what i always expect from a zombie movie. Entertainment and action with some horror and tension through out and this delivers. As for the science behind it i ignore that anyway since a zombie is basically a walking dead person its already rubbish to try base anything in a zombie movie on the science behind it.My only negative is i didn't really get why Brad Pitts character was so important to the UN as he doesn't display any special characteristics that make him an asset to the UN. Not like in the Film Taken when he goes to get his daughter back. You totally understand why he was so good at his job and why his country wanted him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, fast action flick without the gore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film. It had me on the edge of my seat for nearly 3/4 of the film and served up a good dose of Zombie escapism. It had more than its fair share of mistakes and missed opportunities- but as a fast paced bit of "the world goes to hell" this is actually great. And this was just going to be a Zombie movie nothing more. It's not a Brad Pitt movie- his acting was appalling- wooden and stunted at important moments, but that's somewhat forgivable as the action does keep up a decent pace.It's obviously been a long time since Thelma and Louis because Mr Jolie is looking a bit ragged around the edges. The plot is completely unrealistic- however this film has cleverly shown what a 2 hour movie should be for escapist movie goers- outlandish plot turns and global travelling that would make Richard Branson go weak at the knees. But that is the whole point of any fun flick- it's not reality and therefore we can actually use our imagination and go with the unexpected turns. It is kind of ironic that the movie isn't realistic- well no, it's about Zombies and they are made up.... Some of the missed opportunities include dramatic moments with planes that could have done with a bit more "2012"-the movie panoramic CGI- it could of turned this into a great movie. The dialogue seems to occur in batches. There were a couple of brilliant dialogue moments, but that was it. However by keeping the dialogue down it turned the movie into more of a visual feast then what we are used to. I wonder if anyone will notice this. And if it marks a turning point in CGI films that are more visually based as a genre. If you want good dialogue then go read Shakespeare or Ibsen. The lack of blood was unsettling- but then considering the budget hit $200 million I'm not surprised they need all the family friendly tickets they can sell. I'm not a big fan of blood- I find suspense far more enthralling so this made a surprising change. However I am not sure it will work for die-hard Zombie fans. And there are some things that just should not be messed with. It's obvious somebody has watched 28 Weeks Later- however the mass Zombie hordes set a new benchmark for sphincter clenching madness. And the rather subtle revealing of how the Zombies operate (I don't want to spoil it) is actually quite intelligent and kept to just the right tempo. It's nice to see a Zombie film with a bit of thoughtfulness. Do not read the wiki listed drama until after you have seen the film (it will just distract you from enjoying the way out moments- because you may be thinking "oh this is what they were talking about") - but then do go read the diabolical mess some fool/s got themselves into over this film- it's hilarious. It also helps explain why so many people are gossiping badly about this film. It is far better than people are saying. It's over the top, a lot of fun and I am sure will be very popular as a DVD because it does have some great CGI moments. Die-hard Zombie fans- maybe not so much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw the Movie at a Sneak peak, and even though it was free, I would pay just to see it again with my Wife, instead of the buddies, because she would really enjoy it as well. A Very well done Zombie movie. Unlike other Zombie movies, it not solely just based on action and killing of Zombies, but more on survival and finding a cure. The movie really brings a new level for the Zombie genre and is on the Top of my list for Zombie movies.Another good plus, is that the Title World War Z is very true, because it is not just based in one City like other Zombie movies, but all over the world. Shows how the US Government reacts, steps they take and so on and so forth. More of a great Fiction style, than a Supernatural Horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you already have a working understanding of zombies or virus zombies and how best to survive a zombie infestation after watching 28 Days Later and/or The Walking Dead and/or Zombieland - skip this movie.The camera work is Parkinsonian at best; the lighting will strain your eyes 70% of the time because it gets hella murky; the family Brad Pitt is saddled with is so annoying you'll wish death upon them after 10 minutes. The supposed special forces are so incompetent they make Andrea from Walking Dead look like a hotshot A-list Zombie killer.If you have never seen a zombie movie, ever, in your life, then maybe, possibly, you wouldn't mind this. Or if you hate gore, violence, suspense or general horror in your horror movies; if you've been on the hunt for a nice, family friendly zombie action flick; or if you want some 3D Brad Pitt and don't really need or want any plot or character development, then this is for you.Otherwise, it's a boring waste of money. Wait for it to come out on TV next year. Don't even spend money on the DVD.I don't understand how a movie can be this bad in 2013 when the "zombie infestation and how to survive it" genre has almost been perfected. This might have cut it if it had been released around 2000, 2003 for the latest. Even zombie movie parodies try harder than this movie did. It reeks of laziness, and I mean come on, the bar is set pretty low for zombie movies as it is. 1 star because it stars Brad Pitt and he has a cool, Nicholas Cagey hairstyle. 2nd star for the silent sidekick girl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Z grade disaster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot understand how the risible script ever got committed to celluloid! There are more plot holes here than in a tramps vest. First off: a newscast mentions "rabies" but shortly after everyone is talking about "the undead". So just what are these creature and where do they come from? Actually, we never find out. This is not a moot point, as, unlike Romero's slavering hordes these critters do not need a head shot to take them out - which does take an awful lot of fun out of the proceedings. Speaking of Romero, well, don't. These "zombies" are pretty toothless, there's zero entertainment for gore-hounds here. I mean, a "12" rated zombie flick? Do me a favour.Where to go from here? A woman has her hand lopped off and is cured by gin &amp; tonic. Zombies are stopped by walls of suitcases. A wide-bodied jet filled with passengers crashes in the Welsh mountains yet only the hero and heroine survive. In the wreck, the hero is impaled with a twelve inch piece of metal - pulls it out and then walks to the WHO centre in Cardiff?And yet it gets even worse. The solution to the zombie pandemic is found to be "innoculating" the population with a deadly virus. There is no explanation as to how this will be done on a worldwide scale, let alone how the inoculated will be re-inoculated to stop them dying from the deadly virus? Or how they will stop themselves becoming zombie chowder again when they do this?? Am I missing something here? Even the best scene - the zombies forming a huge writhing wall to break into Jurasalem city is so badly edited and paced that it loses any emotional impact at all.Finally we are subjected to the indignity of the seminal clichéd speech trotted out in so many disaster movies that don't know how to end "the war goes on but we shall rebuild" yada yada....Yes this, truly, is a disaster movie. Of that I have no doubt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A small thing I wrote may be a spoiler even though I wouldn't consider it so.Though this movie had its good things they just can't save it and make us forget about the bad things. Good:- The special effects. They're very acceptable.- The acting. Bradd Pitt appears in almost every scene and plays well his character even though we never really care about him (following words may be a spoiler) because he's like the hero and the scenes with him are very predictable so... we kinda realize he's "immortal" at some point. The rest of the actors also do a good job even if sometimes they're kind of dispensable.Bad: - The plot isn't interesting having in consideration the source material: the book that the movie was based on is a masterpiece but they totally ignored the book and with a title like this when I watched the movie I was expecting much more than what I got.- There are several unrealistic scenes but I won't point them for I don't want to spoil the movie.- The end of the movie: It's just terrible. I really hated it. Actually, the movie in itself was being acceptable, a lot of flaws, not the best movie of all time, but I was enjoying it. But then the end ruined it. Seems like they created the end just because the movie had to have one. I mean, the end of a movie can make us like it (the movie) even more or even less. This made me like it even less.So, you can watch it but only if you don't have to spend money. It's not a masterpiece, not even a good movie. It's entertaining mainly for zombie movies fans. . I consider it an acceptable movie for the genre.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Successful movie with social messages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are all accustomed to watch zombie movies or TV series that include slow zombies killing their victims in large groups, lots of blood, ripped guts, violent scenes. But this movie doesn't include every cliché that a zombie movie has.First of all we see a different type of zombie which is able to run, climb or even create huge zombie towers to climb up to walls. They are still efficient in large groups but in this movie, we see that one zombie can make a huge city infected by its speed and uncontrolled reflex movements. We also don't see lots of blood and ripped internal organs in this movie so this may help some people who has hemophobia and has a great desire for zombie movies. It is not weird, I have a friend likes zombie movies but can't watch them because of the huge amount of blood and gore in them.The idea "infect yourself with a disease to be invisible for zombies" is really a great idea for a zombie movie script. I wasn't expecting such a thing while watching the movie. All I thought was "They're going to nuke the whole world after they find a safe place."I am a newbie movie critic so I can not make detailed critics for this movie but I can say that there are some social messages in this movie. "World War Z" draws attention to Israeli - Palestine conflict and gives us a message. "These people can hug each other and they can live in peace." But while giving this message to us, it reminds us that a zombie apocalypse is fiction and the peace will be brought these lands with a fiction. In other words, we may say that there won't be a zombie apocalypse so there won't be a peace in that region either.The other message that I got from this movie is the importance of the globalization. If we consider ourselves in the same race as "human beings" without racial classifications we can overcome every danger that our world come up against.Very good scenes, non-stop action, good sci-fi, different zombie movie. Worth to watch, deserves good rankings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is NOT a horror movie, it's barely a zombie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm coming at World War Z as a zombie veteran, I've sat through more zombie films from over the past 50 years than most others so I feel pretty qualified to give a verdict on this title.In a world where we now have a fantastic adaptation of The Walking Dead comic book on our TV's, this movie in comparison is flashy, derivative and unimaginative. You can't blame the source material, the novel is beautifully paced and excellently descriptive, everything this film isn't. This movie is definitely aimed more at the casual, popcorn audience other than anybody who really wants to feel anything on an emotional or cultural level. All thoughts of the novel are quickly lost and you realise that you wont emerge feeling any different than you did when it started.My initial feelings as the movie moved through it's opening sequences were of the equally flashy and emotionless blockbuster "I Am Legend", from not being able to forget that it's Brad Pitt, it's pacing and the over the top CGI zombies I already knew that this wasn't going to be for me. No blood, no guts, no sense, no emotion, no real thought or care.This is a disaster movie plain and simple, no questions are asked and none are answered. I never felt any jeopardy throughout the entire film and never feared for the human race. "The Day After Tomorrow" with zombies basically.CGI, why?? All terror is lost, all lingering thoughts that this is an actual re-animated human being leave you and that feeling is never revisited. When I think of the incredible work done by Tom Savini on the "Dead" movies, especially "Day". I really struggle to understand the thinking of producers and directors on this matter, there are no iconic moments, nothing that makes you not want to turn the lights out at night, it's honestly just pointless brain (no pun intended) fodder. Use CGI when you have to, when zombies are falling from buildings or creating the worlds largest pile-on great, all other times, go with what's real, what's actually there. I'd love to care enough to take this film apart but it's really not worth it, the makers obviously didn't care about the source material or the culture they were exploiting so I'm not going into any more detail. There is no reason why this had to be "World War Z", other than the rights to use the title this could've been any other mainstream blockbuster which is the biggest shame of this film. What a waste.Anybody who has even a slight interest in zombie films will instantly know that this is just filler, it serves a purpose and it'll make some money and then onto the next. Thanks for nothing Brad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>propaganda but an entertaining movie nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read the book, so I have no idea of faithful it is to the book. I didn't expect much and was nicely surprised. The movie isn't subtle in any way, but it's a refreshing take on the zombie genre. On the other hand, it's very old fashioned it the way it handles its propaganda material. Showing the WHO as a bunch of scientists fighting for the good of mankind rather than a lobbyist business can make any informed person smile. But the part one might cringe at is a the whole Israel sequence... Epic shots of the Israel flag, extremely biased account of Israel's history, and a ridiculous justification of the wall of shame. Not to mention the depiction of tsahal soldiers as near superheros (when IRL they spend most of their time terrorizing and shooting at unarmed civilians, called "terrorists"). You will also learn that a Pepsi dispenser can save the life of your pals. Despite all those laughable moments, it is a very enjoyable movie, with a good rhythm, and a surprisingly sober Brad Pitt (I don't remember the last time I had seen him not overacting).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>International Walking Dead with Brad Pitt &amp; Big Budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the Walking Dead TV show and "Dawn of the Dead" movie, it would take a lot for filmmakers to mess up this effort for "World War Z" given such a large reported budget, so you can count my review as biased. Director Marc Forster's movie is a sprawling disaster film with Zombies as the disaster. It manages to work for the most part as long as you forgive some issues which you probably are aware of. The movie essentially an International Walking Dead on steroids with Brad Pit starring. Some of the aspects of the movie I liked was it's pacing, tension , and suspense that it managed to pull off. The effects were OK, but not outstanding. The acting is decent; Brad Pitt is satisfactory in the movie. (Spoilers) What I didn't like (as usual with many movies) were several poor implausibilities that were missed such as Pitt's character forgetting to turn off his cell phone in a critical situation (South Korea) to stay quiet, and ditto later for mistakenly kicking a soda can. Similarly and more blatantly, how did the Israelis military and chanting crowd not know to keep noise down with so many zombies in Earshot? Finally as a technical issue, Satellite phones cannot work in the hull of a ship. The signal cannot pass through the various metal bulk-heads. These are the kinds of written in stupidities that are tiresome, clichéd, lazy and hurt a movie's performance. Still considering, I liked World War Z as it had enough going for it to keep it interesting although not spectacular - and remember I give it the benefit of the doubt for liking the genre in the first place. Recommended for Zombie fans (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Exciting, But Stick To The Book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read Max Brook's wonderful book, I was thrilled when they announced a forthcoming movie. After seeing the trailer, I had my doubts. The book was separated into sections, chronicling how people around the world survived the zombie epidemic. And Max mercifully had the zombies be Romero's slow-moving, flesh-eating ones. In the movie, they are extremely fast, smart and do many unzombie-like things like incredible leaps, bashing through windows with their heads, etc. A few of the stories do make it into the movie. The most notable, for anyone who's seen the trailers, is the wall in Israel. But that's where the similarities end. In the movie, Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN operative. He's driving his family to work and school when they're stuck in a traffic jam in Philadelphia. A building in the distance explodes and people start running away from zombies. The rest of the film follows Gerry and his family as he re-joins the UN and flies around the world, trying to figure out a cure for the epidemic. Don't get me wrong, the movie has its moments. There are a few places where you're guaranteed to jump with fright, and the finale is freaky! My biggest problem is that they took what was an excellent book and watered it down to fit a 2-hour time slot. I'd much rather them leave the story like it was, and have it be a TV mini-series, like THE WALKING DEAD. You could definitely get a good three seasons at least, just following the book's style. Overall though, WWZ is pretty exciting with smart characters and a gripping story. Just don't go into it, if you've read the book, expecting it to be the same!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War Z is a fast paced film, like most zombie movies. But it is also very "detailed" in a sense, that it at times shows the Undead very up close and personal and they even have some interesting behavioral qualities. The zombie masses are surprising in their efficiency at and in their persistent strive to kill (recommended in 3D). In some tense episodes we can get acquainted with the personal qualities of individual zombies quite closely, like a clapper of teeth, inspired by hunger. Or something similar. This film, like many other end of the world films, contains a good scene of a regular morning, when everything looks normal, but then suddenly a mass of people starts attacking other, peaceful and pacified, mass of people, who are unable to resist in any way. One can sense hundreds perishing (and then rising). The turning of fortunes towards the living is the story of this film.Interestingly enough, I had the impression of a "green message" this movie was somehow supposed to convey - that the zombie epidemic was Mother Nature's punishment for the Mankinds "evil ways". At least one can get an idea like that from the opening scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh no, I walked into a zombie movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So... I decided not to read reviews before watching a movie. First of all even the smallest spoiler kills partially the excitement of watching it. Mr Mcluhan is not around to lecture us about reviews on how they affects the movies as media so I'll stop here, enough. Without knowing this was a zombie movie I ended up watching it. All my teen efforts to stay away from "the living dead" lost in a sec! Oh, well, c'est la vie! Gazillion zombies on red-bull and Brad Pitt making some bucks without acting or even learning some dialog. Heres the world' s most famous nerdy virologist with the simple task of saving the human race is sent to where the chaos started on an empty airplane with 3 marines as escort. Next time better send Master Chief along.So Prometheus like! I'm old school, I like dialog, I like a plot, I like character development, I even like fake science but all are non existent here, just a sequence of scenes which are supposed to be connected to each other. The opening scene is awesome and maybe this is the reason why after 1hr 55min folks still say... not bad, worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z - Rate by Movie or Rate by Book Divergence?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am an owner &amp; reader of Max Brook's book "World War Z". As such, it is difficult to rate this movie as a stand-alone viewing rather than in reference to the book. If you loved the book, you will only have the barest whiff of the "World War Z" flavor, kind of like walking past a restaurant and smelling the food.*EDIT* It has been a few days later and my anger at the sheer NAME STEALING FRAUD of this movie has sunk in while my anger has gone into a full boiling froth. I originally rated this as "6" being generous to the movie as itself (it not having any relation to the book except for stealing the name of it). So I am altering my rating to reflect this rage and Brad Pitt's (actor &amp; producer of this movie) fraudulent divergence from the well-written book "WORLD WAR Z". If there is a real movie based on the "WORLD WAR Z" book out later, I will rate it fairly. Since this movie is a FRAUD stealing the name of the book, I am now rating this as a "2". Avoid this movie, you time &amp; money is worth more than this vapid rip-off of a movie. *END EDIT*What is not in the movie? No traveling reporter unraveling the aftermath as the book did. No "Battle of Yonkers", no family reduced to cannibalism at a chilly Canadian lake, no "Battle of Hope" (where the army use the "Cherry Popper" incendiary bullets to roast the undead's brains, no Japanese survival experience with the Otaku &amp; his blind gardener guardian. Pretty much NOTHING in the "World War Z" book appears in this movie (remember the good old days when charges of CRIMINAL FRAUD would be pressed and the movie producers sued for dishonest advertising practices, ah the good old days).The barest SNIFF of the flavor of the book and in that you'll feel deeply cheated. So now that this is out of the way, we move onto looking at the movie as a "Stand-Alone Fame-Thief" using the book as a way to coax viewers in to watch a knock-off lesser quality imitation.The story is pretty much Brad Pitt's character, "Gerry Lane", being a member of the United Nations with his family on the run from the devouring hordes. In that value, it is a fairly decent 1960's or 1970's style zombie-flick. If you rate it by itself, it is tolerable, but somewhat dumb, yet not painfully so.Of the locations referenced in the "World War Z" book (you know, the book that coaxed you into seeing this movie), only the escape from Israel is vaguely in parity to what the audience desired (much like the "Walking Dead" television series has turned into an episodic series about the occasional undead attack while being filled to the brim with packing peanuts of idiots grousing snootily at each other).Sadly "World War Z" the movie has borrowed heavily from "28 Days Later" (fast undead, 12 seconds to zombie conversion) and thrown all plausible physics out the window. What do you know about POWERLIFTERS? What can they lift at the record? 1268 lbs. Average human weight = 135 pounds, result, at your healthiest in perfect muscular fitness you can only support 9.3 humans. The human ladder in Israel would collapse at the height of 9 humans if all the humans were record-setting powerlifters. Undead, rotting humans, of average to lesser build, average weight? You'd be stomping through the ligaments at best when they hit 3 deep in Human Pyramid height. Let's not even get into the "magnetic flying CGI corpse" absurdity in the movie (worse than some of the Gary's Mod animations poking fun with Team Fortress).Well, onto the good points. Brad Pitt is handsome. His real-life freakshow wife Angela DUCKFACE and her mini-multicult "Captain Planet" stereotype squad are not in this movie (yeah imagine being Brad Pitt and going home to something that looks like The Octomom every night, UGH!). Some of the other bearded leading men are rather exceptionally handsome, especially in the rained out base in Korea. The zombies are a tolerable movie plot threat, but comically CGI-animated when dragged about in reticulated spline clumps by their wrists like a poor POSER 3 models. If you plug your ears you can enjoy Brad Pitt being handsome without any stupid plot being too distracting, unfortunately he never loses his pants and only lifts up his shirt for a bit near the end without going bare-chested. Calling the movie "World War Z" is a pretty huge stretch, but Brad Pitt remains delightfully handsome with an ever so cute pouty face.There is also some nonsense at the end about making themselves not-so-tasty to the undead by injecting themselves with a case of the Terminal Spinal Herpes which somehow is detected by MAGIC ZOMBIE VISION, but that is silly and dumb and only fit for 1950's corny Sci-Fi movies where the world is saved by aliens coming down with a case of Jersey Shore Gonorrhea from the Snookie-Monster. Ah, but Brad Pitt remains handsome for now, so if you like Brad Pitt then go see this movie as it is a tolerably forgettable "action flick" (which is a huge insult to the universe presented in the "World War Z" books). Oh well, vote with your dollars. If you hate his freakshow wife, DUCKFACE Jolie, then don't see it and she'll have to start a "Up With Pol Pot" singing group and go on inane road tours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Flick from Brad Pitt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Decent, is what describe best for me for this movie. It is fun to watch and it has many suspenseful sequences and very fast pace story. Problem was once you saw it - it pretty much "ordinary".Well I can understand if people were disappointed. After all it is one of the most anticipated films of 2013 and for the past 2 years they have been giving glimpse of the movie. But it turn out to be "so-so".I think the whole Rated PG 13 destroy almost everything. Zombie movie with no bloodshed, who the hell think that? It turns into very mildly violence movie for kids. And while there is no violence they also decide to rewrite the story that everyone can understand. I heard that it was so different from the book that Max Brooks (Novelist) don't want to involve with the movie. Anyway it wasn't all negative. The movie is extremely suspenseful and if you don't expect anything at all it can be fun and a great time passer. While Brad still look great and give a decent acting everyone else was flat.The fighting sequences though not very grand as hope but still very much fun from start to end.I still do recommend it but don't have a high hope and you might actually enjoy this movie. Rating: 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Initially I was not looking forward to seeing World War Z. Actually I was, only because I was looking forward to making fun of it. The trailers were unconvincing and it looked like they got Brad Pitt so people would see it. Luckily I saw the film and I enjoyed it without having to make fun of it. It was genuinely exciting and it's thrills were well staged and put together. World War Z's issues are there and those would be that the film is uneven. It jumps from location to location until it ends. It had good pacing and a serviceable plot but the movie jumped around more then I would've liked. The little girls did a poor job of acting, thankfully they aren't in it much. Overall the film is flawed but enjoyable popcorn summer action film without having to turn your brain off. I would even go to say that it was a surprise. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfyingly creepy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The awfully-titled "World War Z" may give you the impression that it may be a kind of post- apocalyptic action escapade, but instead it is a smartly-packaged goody bag of thrills that delivers your money's worth at every turn. I always had a perception that zombies never work as proper villains in films, partly because they are limited to being laughably absurd objects that should be shot at and be done with, but director Mark Foster takes the cue and portrays them in a way that genuinely spooks us. The fascination for the exploration of the zombie genre hasn't satiated the appetite of those seeking to make sleazy horror getaways adequately as yet, but "World War Z", thankfully, is an alleviating addition to a vexing genre.Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), a United Nations employee, finds himself trapped in a heavy traffic with his family. A few tense moments later, a horde of zombies attack them, forcing them to flee for safety. Unsure about that's going on, Gerry seeks refuge in a US Navy ship, and meets up with his former colleague Thierry. As his family finds a safe shelter in the ship, a naval commander tells Gerry to help out or take his family off the ship. Unwilling to sacrifice the safety of his family, he gives in and takes off to a military camp in South Korea, which was supposedly where the infection started. In South Korea, a former CIA operative, who is jailed on charges of treason, tells Gerry to head to Jerusalem because Israel had knowledge about the outbreak before it began. Narrowly escaping the zombies who invade the city, Gerry takes off on the last flight out and heads to WHO to find out if a vaccine is possible to prevent the zombies from attacking people. With Sergen, an Israeli soldier who had accompanied him around Jerusalem, Gerry lands in Cardiff to find a possible prevention for the spreading virus. One of the few things that stand out are the impressively choreographed action sequences, which are as creepy as they are exciting. Take, for instance, the splendid sequence in which some Navy pilots have to make their way to an aircraft while trying to avoid zombies in the middle of a torrential downpour. The sequence, wickedly buffed to sleek perfection and striving on palpable tension, is explosive. There are a few sequences such as these which are scattered throughout the narrative, and it's hard to take a calming breath for even a second because the film doesn't let you. The tension mounts by the minute and Foster directs accordingly, working with urgency and patience that a thriller like this demands. The film's final revelation amounts to a finely-tuned crowd pleaser, and it does so with sneaky effect.Besides the fantastic action sequences, the film is unapologetically tedious to watch, making use of every cliché the makers could lay their hands on, the most familiar being an ex-army man trying to find a cure for a rapidly-spreading virus. One of the costliest errs that a film can make is to let slip what's about to happen next, and that's where "World War Z" gets it all wrong. The plot is dispiritingly predictable, and the weakly-structured screenplay doesn't succeed at helping it trod through till the end, but the action sequences surmount most of the niggles I have with the film.Of the performances, Brad Pitt is reliably excellent, and the only actor worth mentioning about. For an actor of his caliber, this must've been a cakewalk for him, I believe. The rest of the cast are either inferior or believable, and remain forsaken accessories when the film digs deeper in its quest to burn through the bag of thrills. Though the film relies heavily on the action sequences, the rest of the cast largely underwhelm in the dramatic scenes. "World War Z" isn't a great film by any standard, but it remains a commendable addition to zombie genre because it has us going when it wants to. Though I don't dig very deep into the genre, the soaring tension gave me enough excitement to make it worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War Z isn't just another mindless Zombie movie. It, actually, has a pretty good story that is feasible in this age of viruses, overpopulation and technology. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) plays a retired UN investigator used to strange circumstances and tight spots. Pitt pulls- off the role as a smart, fast thinking, examiner who is sent out to find the first point of infection. Traveling around the world while what's left of the US Government scratch their heads and hide on a ship. Pitt searches for clues to the zombie epidemic. Once bitten the infected turn into super- fast, teeth slashing, undead?.all in 12 seconds!His family; wife(Mireille Enos) and two, young, daughters are depending on him to save them as the powers that be hold them hostage to make sure Pitt keeps his end of the deal! With a lot of help along the way; from well acted supporting cast ( especially ? Danielle Kertesz- as a tough Israeli soldier, Segen and some pretty nifty special effects. Pitt takes you on a tense, ride that has your heart pumping adrenaline through your veins as fast as the action is thrown at you! A must see for lovers of the zombie/Sci-Fi genre.I would rate this movie as a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Bad !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the film I was waiting for but after seeing it I come out the theater disgruntled. The trailer and the hype are very promising, the execution is fine but logic of the story and plot is a let down. It's like a cross between 'Outbreak' and 'Walking Dead' but there are some obvious illogical background I can not ignore.The story starts when an outbreak of Zombie virus turn a city into a massive chaos. Gerald Lane and his family is there and after some series of lucky events they manage to save themselves on the roof of apartment. Then military helicopter specially sent to pick them Gerald Lane is sort of UN investigator (?), and deliver them to a US Nimitz class carrier which serves as US Army HQ. Then he unwillingly go to North Korea along with US SEAL team and a virologist to find the source of virus so his family can stay in the ship (how cruel...)See, for me this background failed to provide Gerald Lane's rapport. I don't see why he is the perfect choice among probably tenth thousands of highly skilled and trained people in this ship. Simply he has to be in this team to save the world.Then in North Korea he finds out more about these Zombie, that they are drawn by sounds, crushing their head is the only way to stop them but then we see a burned zombie who still has 2 fingers alive though his head is just ashes (?)Next, he went to Israel which is the 1st country in the world who successfully anticipates this crisis but all this time the whole country (compare to a bunch of soldiers in North Korea) doesn't know that sounds make this Zombies go crazy (?). And when a zombie's bite turns normal person to zombies in just seconds, means the virus spreads very very quickly , if someone's hand is bitten, all you have to do is cut just inches above that hand to prevent this person become zombie (?) The virus should have spread to half of her body for god sake.- SPOILER ahead - After surviving a plane crash (yes now you know Gerald Lane is chosen probably because he's the luckiest person who can escape from anything), he concludes that the virus only attracted to healthy people. They ignore people who's terminally ill. Gosh. I can't take this anymore. I mean there are a lot, probably millions of terminally ill people compare to billions of people in earth and not a single one of them can inform this simple fact to any government in the world? Where are they? - SPOILER Ends -So, I really disappointed with this movie. I still give '3' since the acting is decent and the special effect is quite good. But the rest is surprisingly bad.</fullReview>

But like I, everybody who has read the book understands that the book is too hard to turn a movie by line to line. The book and the movie are practically two different stories. Maybe that is a good thing. I waited to see something familiar from the book, but perhaps it is better this way. This is not a bad movie at all. Even the story is quite coarse and ending is downright lame it doesn't bother too much. Good entertainment after all. This movie is not typical zombie movie. Lack of all grotesque mauling and killing is missing here. Reason for that must be movie huge production budget. It just simply needs to get enough viewers to cover at least that massive production value. U.S. PG13 sounds much rational than local Finnish age limit of 16. Movie is racy catastrophe movie, which is at best with it sneak and nightmare crawling scenes. Special effects are great and some of them are quite clever. 3D is quite unnecessary although it surprise you few time to splash movies incident to you face. After all it is an OK catastrophe movie. With better ending it could end up to five stars, now I will give it four stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombie swarming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rather enjoyed this film, even though it is yet another example of the tedious zombie/vampire genre that has had Hollywood in its grip for years now.What makes these zombies different from the others (the many others) that we've seen is that these ones grow in numbers exponentially, become fast and difficult to kill, have an insatiable desire to infect others, and swarm aggressively. This effect is possible partly because it takes only 12 seconds for them to make the transition.And when they swarm, my gosh, is it terrifying. The filmmakers have done an excellent job in showing that. It's not particularly gory, but it is visually exciting nevertheless. With a virus like this, it doesn't take long for a city to be overcome.I had three problems with the film. I couldn't catch some of the dialogue, so some important explanations seem to have escaped me. It's still not clear to me why Israel built walls. The only wall I saw was one surrounding Jerusalem. Also, was I the only one to be bothered by the fact that the plague remained undiscussed and unexplained for so long? I suppose the advantage of this is that the moviegoer has the same sense of confusion as the characters. We've reached the point where explanations about zombies are apparently unnecessary. Finally, there were a few plot holes and unrealistic aspects. Where for example were the child zombies? The elderly zombies? The obese zombies? Why was the Brad Pitt character the only one able to do anything? The writers seem to have a very inflated view of what the UN is capable of.Still, it was a pretty good movie. In my theatre there was clapping at the end.(I've just read some of the other reviews, many of which seem to be written by Americans who are really, really into zombies and people who want gore in their movies. I can't relate to these other reviewers.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is based on the world created by author Max Brooks in the zombie apocalyptic novel World War Z, an oral history of the Zombie wars. Unlike the book which follows multiple story lines into longer time frame into the aftermath, the movie focus on the initial outbreak and follows a retired UN field investigator, now a family man played by Brad Pitt surviving the fall of New York city, who is then forced back into action to keep his family in the secure zone. Pitt is flown with the team in search of patient zero and the origins of the pandemic presumably caused by a virus. The movie is fast paced through out the two hours and holds back on the gore for a PG-13 rating. The movie is much like other zombie apocalyptic movies like 28 days later or contagion.The zombies in the movie are fast agile capable. Some set Zombie masses swarming was excellent. Even so the zombies had a comedic look to them too, with the high pitched sounds they make to the funny facial expressions.There were some tragic but ironic scenes were we laughed, and other were we were on the edge. The movie had very few emotional scenes and frankly had zero emotional impact. Further on Pitt's character later discovers that N.Korea and Israel is the only two countries effectively dealing with the pandemic. N.Korea by removing the teeth of all the healthy, the virus spreads through the bite of the infected into the blood stream. More interestingly Israel survives by building walls throughout its borders and keeping the infected mass of zombies at bay. It seems Israel had prior knowledge and acted on it. The novel by Brooks has a underlying theme dealing with American ignorance of foreign geo-politics outside north America, in the movies Israel building a wall and winning it is only were the movie deals with the theme. Even today Israel has extensive walls and fences running through a large part of their borders.In the movie after being infected it took just 12 seconds for the virus to take over and person to change into a zombie a bit questionable. Finally Pitt's character discovers a work around, a camouflage from the infected. When infected with anther deadly microbe the infected Zombies somehow detect this from a distance and altogether avoid the person and with no explanation given in the movies, I found myself questioning the science.Finally the movie ends with its just the beginning, so it's highly likely there might be a sequel. All in all an enjoyable flick produced for mass appeal has a blockbuster feel to the movie. For me after reading a bit about the book now I'm more interested in the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the book but still a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that WWZ was to get the big screen adaptation I as many people I assume felt a mixture of feelings, excitement and skepticism. Excitement because there are several cinematic moments in the film, The Battle of Yonkers for example and skepticism because the narrative layout of the film is extremely un-cinematic and does not lend itself to the traditional 3 Act structure of Hollywood movies. As the movie fell into such difficulties during shooting my skepticism only grew but then the first audience reactions hit on twitter and hope was restored. Yesterday we went ourselves and saw the movie in 3D, going in my expectations weren't through the roof they were somewhere in the middle. I knew from reading a few reactions not to expect the book and just to embrace the movie for what it is which I did and I actually really enjoyed it.World War Z is worlds away from the book, which I think was inevitable but that doesn't stop it from being an excellent, fast paced, thrilling zombie movie. Brad Pitt nails it, predictably, in the lead role as Gerry Lane the retired U.N warzone investigator who is sent on a mission to find patient zero in an attempt to find a vaccine to the devastating zombie outbreak. To say there is nothing shared between the book and the movie but the title, as people on the internet have done, is actually unfair. There are glimmers here and there but it's fair to say that it's a very loose adaptation. The main similarity between the two is that they both use the zombie outbreak to examine the socio-political landscape on a global level: The North Korean 'solution', The Israeli Wall. Tied altogether with incredible big budget action sequences and special effects, there's a lot to enjoy in this movie.If there is a complaint to be made it would be in the movies third act, which actually goes against the grain in terms of big budget Hollywood action movies. Instead of turning up the speakers to 11 and blasting the audience into submission with a balls out finale, WWZ dials it back and goes for a slower yet still nerve wracking sequence.All in all I thoroughly enjoyed World War Z and would highly recommend it. Can't wait to watch it again on blu-ray and the inevitable sequel JOh and I was actually in Glasgow when they're were shooting the opening outbreak sequence, so yeah :P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the reviews on this movie before attending the show. I had intentions of going regardless the top 3 negative remarks made about this movie 1) A bloodless Zombie movie. 2) Not enough gore. And 3)Horrible acting. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised. I can, however, agree with the top 2 comments made; Bloodless and gore-less indeed. Had there been more blood during the zombie attacks and brain splatter during the gun fire scenes- it would have taken the movie from a 6.0 to a 7.9 rating. On the other hand, the movie had it's suspense, thriller and scary moments which made it's audience jump and cry out in the theaters. Was there bad acting? No, not really. I think everyone played their parts well. Aside from the lack of blood and gore, the only other downfall from this movie is the extremely slow ending. I mean, after watching everything on screen moving at 90 miles per hour, the final 30 minutes of this movie seemed super slow and almost a waste. But overall- I enjoyed it in the theater and I look forward to the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitt's fast-zombie blockbuster was good, but a little underwhelming.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anybody that knows me knows that I love zombie movies?and my favorite type of zombie is the fast zombie. I also have a great deal of respect for Pitt as an actor. So this movie was all set up to be a big winner in my book. It wasn't bad?but it was a bit underwhelming. Like I said, I like fast, adrenaline-charged zombies, as in 28 Days Later?. But these zombies were too fast. They looked more like locusts. Also, this story is really about humanity's fight against the Zombie pandemic, rather than about one family's struggle to survive it, so I didn't feel very invested in the protagonist's survival. Don't get me wrong, the movie was good, but I just feel that I would enjoy the book more (although I haven't read it), because the story is more of a cerebral chess match or puzzle than the action blockbuster that the film's producers tried to create.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out www.livemancave.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombies !!! Let me get that out of my system straightaway. In India we recently had our first zombie movie, Go Goa Gone, which was ummmm.., but this review is about World War Z. I am a big zombie movie fan, have watched countless reruns of George Romero's zombie flicks on AXN. This is not just a zombie movie, its an action movie which straightaway cuts to the chase in the first five minutes. The zombie's here are a part of a much bigger canvas and that has been integrated well in the script. This movie has some jaw dropping aerial scenes and there is hardly any part where you would get bored, even though Brad does not get enough convincing scenes.All around its a good summer movie though its not comparable to the zombie classic.So if you just want to enjoy and see a good action flick and zombies are your cup of tea, go ahead and indulge yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a certain expectations with zombie-pocalypse movies. We expect to see social order breaking down, ripping itself apart, just as we expect to see the undead ripping out the guts of all their hapless victims. World War Z looks to be the end-all-be-all zombie flick, with zombie outbreaks exploding all over the world. Regardless, I wasn't expecting much, given the turbulent production history behind this movie (resulting in the entire last act being re-filmed at the last minute) and the watered-down PG-13 rating.If nothing else, this movie gets the "World War" part of it right, while giving some good attention to the "Z" part. The action hits early and fast, and hardly lets up until the last act. For the first two-thirds of the film, the characters are constantly on the run, having to face danger on all sides, with hoards of zombies pouring out at them. These are zombies that run, sprawl, and hurl themselves at everybody in a frenzy, which could only be topped by the spazoid zombies in 28 Days Later. At key points, they become a vast sea of bodies rolling over everything. As bizarre and intense as these images are, they are slammed into the audience's faces to hard that it becomes exhausting and jarring.......until those last forty minutes, which were completely reshot and inserted into the film for what the producers felt would be a better ending. Frankly, I'm glad they did; as thrilling as the rest of the film is, I was finding it tiresome, especially in regards to the narrative. In the last act, the action slows down, the camera stops shaking, and the scenes become gripping more out of suspense rather than heavy-handed action. These last scenes are actually my favorite part of the movie, and I probably would have liked it a lot better if the film was made this way all the way through.As it is, however, the film feels like a long string of scenes loosely tied together with a flimsy plot structure. It's a pretty contrived series of events; the hero predictably hops around the world simultaneously protecting his family and trying to find a zombie cure. There is no particularly good flow from one scene to the next; the guy just gets told where to go next, and then he's on his way. The film tries very hard to make the characters compelling, thanks to putting the guy's family into danger, but none of them are that well developed or even interesting. Things are made even more iffy with the occasional stupid moment (chief among them, the department store looting scene, the landing in Korea, and every moment where characters make noise to attract the zombies). There are a few smart moments though: who would have thought that taping a magazine to your arm could be an effective zombie deterrent? Having never read the original book, I'm not sure how close of an adaptation this film is (I read that it isn't close at all). From what I've seen, the book touches upon some interesting thematic territory regarding politics and isolationism. The movie ports over some similar themes, thanks largely to its international locations and situations. As the zombies roll over Jerusalem, anti-isolationist themes emerge, suggesting that no nation is safe from war, no matter how secure the borders are.The film uses some very herky-jerky camera moves most of the time, and it can get tiring very quickly. There are occasional moments of good photography though. Editing is good. Acting is okay from the cast, but never felt exceptional to me; same goes for the writing. This production uses okay-looking sets, props, and costumes; special effects are not bad. The film has a pretty decent music score.World War Z is a decent thrill ride of a film, but little more. I felt it could have been better in many ways, but it'll satisfy most movie-goers looking for a quick and fairly safe thrill.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Pretty Good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They should re-shoot more movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After many rewrites and re-shoots, Marc Fosters "World War Z" premiered on the 2nd June 2013 in London. I am a keen Walking Dead fan so I was avidly awaiting the release of this movie. However, after watching the trailer and knowing they delayed the release of this movie, I was not anticipating a great zombie film. All I can say is, whatever they changed in the re-shoots in Budapest, it worked out for the better. Although this is not a flawless movie, it was still quite enjoyable and worth a trip to the cinema.The audience follows the journey of Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) in his attempt to find a cure to the sudden outbreak of an antagonizing virus which basically causes its host to go crazy and try to infect other humans. What I did admire about this film is that it incorporated a sense of mystery about it. At various stages in the movie we witnessed that certain people did not attract the infected, rather they just completely ignored by them. This put in the audience in a similar situation to Lane which enabled them to take an interest into his story around the world.There have been a lot of zombie films in the past so obviously not everything in World War Z is original. This movie gave the sense of the culmination of different zombie film/TV-series. There were elements from AMC's The Walking Dead, aka severing the limb to prevent further infection and also attempting to gain entry into the CDC/W.H.O facilities. The zombie's being drawn to sound is very generic in this genre, but I have never seen hundreds of them stack over each other to get over the wall. That was original. These zombies were 28 days later zombies, fast and horrific. Some people say way too fast for a normal human, but when your rabid, maybe you would run faster than you would think capable. This movie was not amazing or ground-breaking. It incorporated a lot of past ideas while introducing some of its own flair. Whoever Brad Pitt is married to, you cannot deny he is a superb actor and his performance as Gerry Lane backs up this claim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good watch but nothing too special.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite looking forward to this movie, being a solid zombie lover. I did enjoy it to a certain extent, but a few scenes in the movie just made me think, "Really? Really? Why? You were told not to do that but yet you still did it?" I do not have a problem with the character development but some things the characters were doing were just god awful stupid. *SPOILERS* At a scene when they go to B-Wing, they want to use stealth and be as quiet as possible to get to the medical supplies as the building is infested with zombies. Brad Pitt's character doing the sensible thing, didn't want to use the gun because it's too loud and would instantly attract the zombies attention. However, the woman decided to take it but only use it as a last resort. Okay, I can understand that, but she used it really stupidly, and you think that the woman being in the army, she would know all about being under enemy radar, but obviously not. She attracted around 2 zombie's attentions. So when she ran into another zombie, she pulled out of her gun and shot it in the head. Why? Why would you do that? Only as a last resort and she pointlessly shoots, alerting all the zombies in the building, it was ringing the dinner bell. Another scene that was just plain stupid was the song singing in Jerusalem. It makes you think if this film was really desperate for some drama by making the characters extremely stupid. A wall was surrounding Jerusalem, separating those not infected and those infected. A crowd of people from Jerusalem were singing a song, smack bang next to the wall. Okay, sure I wouldn't of expected for the zombies to actually climb over the wall, but it was going to attract a hell load more zombies outside the walls. Another scene, was the wife. This was after her husband was sent away to Korea. You'd think with a zombie apocalypse, your husband was probably away to fight on the front to help aid, that's what I would think, I wouldn't phone, I'd let them phone me. So why the hell did she phone? And why the hell wasn't Brad Pitt's phone on silent in the first place? Finally, if the military is going to pick you up on the roof and take you to safety? Why would you not go with them? Some of the characters in this movie, were literally plain ass stupid, Brad Pitt's character seems to be the only one that actually had some sense in him.Put the dumbass characters aside. The movie wasn't unwatchable. It was pretty intense at scenes as some people were on the verge of getting eaten, this is another criticism I have of the movie. Many of the deaths, you didn't see. I wanted to see blood and gore, at least someone getting ripped apart as the rating is a 15. To be perfectly honest, it isn't really a zombie movie. Zombies want to eat humans and rip out their prey's organs, those infected were just trying to infect everyone else. It lacks the origins of a zombie movie.The good points: Good story, good acting(pretty believible), was intense at scenes. The bad points: Characters doing stupid actions as if whoever scipted it felt as though they needed an excuse to cause some drama on screen, Lack of on-screen deaths.All and all, was a good watch, not something I would go out of my way for to recommend to my friends or family. More of a "if you've got the time and nothing else to do, sure go watch it"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitt Battles The Zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z is an apocalyptic was based on the novel of the same title by Max Brooks. It stars Brad Pitt as Gerry Lane,a former United Nations investigator that must travel the world to find a way to stop a zombie- like pandemic. Marc Forster directs.Happily living in Philadelphia and taking on the role of house husband with his wife and two daughters, Lane's domestic tranquility is shattered in the center of a traffic jam that turns into a run-for-your- life showdown with some zippy zombies whose bite turns you into a killing machine in a few seconds. Lane and his family are rescued by the UN forces dispatched to bring them to a mobile military base on an aircraft carrier. Gerry doesn't want to leave his family but it is made clear that if he doesn't join the global search for a cure, his family will be kicked off the ship. The search takes Gerry and a brilliant scientist to South Korea in search of patient zero. Using his knack for observation, Gerry is forming a plan to fight back and hopes to continue the search in Wales at a World Health Organization lab. However, the plane has a zombie stowaway. The movie's ultimate strength is its ability to consistently create tension-filled situations for its characters after laying out very specific parameters.Although it has an investigative aspect to it,World War Z gets most of its mileage out of danger that is experienced by the characters. Despite the fact that it has a couple of loose ends from a story standpoint, the film's visual spectacle makes up for its implausibility.Overall,World War Z a very tense and action-filled film that wrings maximum tension out of its life-or-death situations using the future of humanity at stake as a plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly racist bit of rubbish.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The big scene, glimpsed in all the previews is a mass attempt to over top an Israeli wall. In the old American tradition of racist propaganda the zombies (yes zombies) behave like colonial insects reminding me of all the times I heard Americans compare the Chinese to ants. The countless zombies move like lightning to over top the wall where they spill down on the smiling happy Israelis below. Previously the Koreans were treated as zombies and murdered without pause or hesitation.One could argue that the Americans were suffering the same difficulty and that the epidemic depicted was on a world wide scale and that is, perhaps, a mitigating factor in the guilt of whoever devised this malodorous bit of slop.One suspects that had the Palestinians, crawling like souped up ants, been black and the smiling happy citizens on the other side of the wall white the movie would have had little or no audience. As it is I think you are ill advised to support this sort of movie making with your dollars.In general the film is just one long desperate chase, of a sort that I find tedious, but which I understand some people enjoy, so if you like a chase and you don't mind the portrait of the subhuman non Americans you might find it pleasant. I certainly didn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad goes slumming in this load of (very enjoyable) tosh!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there an intentionally Biblical parable in the spectacular incident at Jerusalem's infamous 'Berlin Wall'? Another stunning set-piece takes places on the airliner transporting Brad to (no kidding) Cardiff Airport. The climactic scenes at a besieged WHO facility in Wales are more firmly rooted in the George Romero or 28 DAYS tradition of zombie flicks, with Brad Pitt trying to avoid a smaller group of the Undead on a claustrophobic set. The ending does not seem to rule out the possibility of a sequel - WORLD WAR TWO? - if Brad wants to go 'slumming' again (Tom Cruise does it all the time).Pitt acquits himself well in his role, much as Dustin Hoffman did in the 1995 pandemic movie OUTBREAK but we would rather see our leading actors in roles where they're playing against something a bit more challenging than rampaging CGI monsters, wouldn't we? A lot of money was clearly spent making WORLD WAR Z and it shows, but this really is - how shall I put it? - a load of tosh. Hugely enjoyably tosh, though, and I look forward to sitting through a sequel or two. Luckily for us in the UK, a new series of THE WALKING DEAD has just started on free-to-view TV, so we can get a zombie 'fix' every weekend for the next four months!</fullReview>

That said I found World War Z a really good film. I eagerly anticipated the release of this film and I wasn't disappointed. Those who slated this film really need to watch it again. The story line was good, if a little far fetched at times (but we are talking about a pandemic Zombie virus here) and the action sequences were well paced with the...well...not so action scenes...also there was some humour which was needed. The film gave the viewer the chance to figure things out for themselves rather than giving hugely over explained scenes that would've slowed the pace which I feel was one of its stronger points.So to all those reviewers who went to the premier or got tickets to see it at a film festival remember the film is there to entertain the masses and not just you so don't analyse the relationship between director and star or talk about how we've seen it all before in 28 days later......BECAUSE 28 DAYS LATER IS NOT A ZOMBIE FILM, THEY WERE INFECTED WITH RAGE.......ahem.....I digress .....my point is that this is a good action film and definitely one to see.

		<shortDescription>World War Z: Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z is an interesting movie. It's smart at times and yet it makes the same cliché mistakes that many of zombie movies tend to make. In World War Z zombies no longer turn people into undead flesh eaters, but it's a virus like Swine flu or Sars, it moves from host to host infecting them. No one is safe but if it's a virus there must be a cure. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is the U.N. investigator who is called in to find and root out the virus. Going around the world chasing leads from South Korea to Israel to find the potential cure. There were time in the movie that seem so foolish and an obvious set ups for zombie attacks that it took away some of the charm of the movie. Randomly phone ringing when making a dash for safety, zombies hiding in the closest, kicking the cans in an empty hallway, and random Arab girl leading a celebratory song in Israel on a loud speaker, when it has been established that zombies are attracted by loud noises. World War Z is an intense ride that picks up within the first 5 in of the movie and doesn't stop till the very end. There were slow points but they were necessary because they gave us some background story. The fast zombies worked in this movie, they were first introduced in 28 Days Later and this movie uses them appropriately. World War Z is yet another movie that shows how fragile the society is and how quickly people turn to anarchy and looting. When facing impending doom how will you react? Will you follow the rules or do whatever it takes to survive?I give World War Z 7 deadly zombie bites out of 10.</fullReview>

After a while action without purpose tends becomes repetitive and if u always get what u expect and have seen before then what's the purpose of watching a new film anyway i say? This is where exactly "World War Z" differs, u do have action scenes, big visuals but not at the expense of the story, it serves as way to forward the story instead the other way around. Zombies and gore are something we have seen umpteen number of times but to see how this particular Zombie situation could actually turn things around the globe in a split second around without gorge is more of an achievement i would say than a let down. Brad Pitt is more than just a pretty lad, he has somewhat an enigmatic presence on screen which keeps u hooked, u do connect with him at some level and think that gosh if the world did need some1 to save it from Zombies (since no superhero here or avengers would b useful here) u would want to have Brad Pitt be that man on your side!His search for a solution to the Zombie problem is pretty much the crux of the story.There are a few shock moments which does make u jump in the seat though 3d is pretty much wasted an useless. I haven't read the book so cant draw a conclusion but in my experience besides Lord of the Rings books always tends to be better than the movie itself, so i would say its a blessing in disguise if u haven't read the book! Not often can a whole family go and see a Zombie flick which is pretty much Rated R but this 1 actually is PG13 which makes it that rare kinda scary movie a family of 4 could go and see together which i guess is also a bonus. The movie does have its faults and could certainly be better but the fact that in the roughly 2hr runtime of the movie the story constantly moves ahead with a purpose and doesn't drag it feet is what in the end makes it watchable and is the real icing on the cake! Don't be 1 of those blokes always looking for gore &amp; over d top action &amp; give the story a chance &amp; u will enjoy it otherwise u will come out cribbing!To wrap it up i would like to say this movie is more personnel in the form of a blockbuster which doesn't happen 2 often now days!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a fan of Brad Pitt,I actually don't really understand how Plan B production house came up with an idea of a zombie movie with Brad Pitt in the lead role.Well before I went to see this movie, I went through the reviews section of the movie.I was really surprised to see the number of haters of this movie.After I saw this movie I would want to say all the viewers.this movie could not have been more better.The thrilling action and special effects.A great work from the animation team.Well i would give it a 8 for its outstanding concept and touch of special effects.A little bit more drama would have made it more better.I would really want to see a sequel of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not The Book and Barely a Zombie Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the original "Night of the Living Dead" to "28 Days Later," "Shaun of the Dead" and everything in between (and in the future), what hasn't been explored in cinematic Zombiedom. "World War Z" uses smoke and mirrors in an attempt to separate it from the rest... and modestly succeeds.Swapping the gratuitous gore usually present in this Horror sub-genre for tension, 'Z' scours the globe in search of Patient Zero. Leading the immunological quest is former UN employee Gerry Lane who careers from location to location one bite ahead of the Zombies. Mr. Pitt's understated, thoughtful portrayal is a real plus.Unlike the book, these 'Zekes' don't feast on flesh. The infected act like individual parts of a large virus with the single-minded goal of replicating. And that they do within twelve seconds of the big bite.The grim 'Z' wastes no time as Philly is overrun in the first ten minutes. The rest is a good ride: the suspense is palpable; Zombie furor frightening; the set pieces stunning - particularly Jerusalem and the in-flight infection. But film history works against 'Z'. There is a veritable encyclopaedia of Zombie films preceding it. Even though we haven't seen it quite like this before, we've seen it all before.That makes 'Z' simply a Zombie film with the blood dialed down to nada, adding a dollop of "Contagion," folding in the tired plot point of a man dragooned into service while protecting his family.The short running time cuts the story to the bone a bit too closely. There's some confusion about Gerry's past while the end is predictable and pavement for a sequel. (Continuing Hollywood's abysmal record of forgetting how to end their films by leaving them open ended in case the film is a hit and sequel worthy.) There was much buzz about re-shoots and drama in the production of "World War Z." It shows.A no-great-shakes-summer-popcorn film, more thriller than horror, "World War Z" is an enjoyable night at the flicks, but not the rebirth (or re-death) of the Zombie film.Those who enjoyed the book will find little of it in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been better, but overall a decent, fun zombie flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now for a PG-13 zombie flick, I have to say that what the director did for this flick and being very restricted with the gore and especially with the zombies mutilating their victims, he did a good job of making these zombies look creepy and at points horrifying. The creepy side is based off of their movements and how these zombies twitch constantly, while the horrifying moment is based off of how fast these zombies can run and how ferociously they attack their preys. There is a moment in the second and third half where I actually felt the intensity of the moment and thought the director did a good job. I really can't say much about the performances because this is simply Brad Pitt's movie. The main focus is on Brad Pitt and as always, Brad Pitt is a very good actor and the character that he portrays as is very likable. My only gripe when it comes to the cast is that there are recognizable actors from left to right who only speaks a couple of lines and is very limited with their roles. It would have been nice to see them more often rather than having a smaller role. I do like the premise of the film and have to say that I did enjoy this zombie flick; however, the execution by the director just didn't fully present well in the end. Before watching this film, I had this problem that the execution will not be presented well based on the director, who have previously directed "Quantum of Solace." Sure enough, what I feared did sort of happen in a way. How some of the moments and scenarios were executed didn't fully work for me and there were some problems with how the movie progressed. How Brad Pitt's character went from Point A to Point B was very formulaic and really felt like a video game. For example: Brad's character gets to a destination, figures something out, goes through an end chapter scenario and enters Chapter 2 of the game. It's not a huge gripe, but I didn't like and intended the film to progress this way. Also, my other gripe involves Brad Pitt's character finding something out about the zombies. At the third act of the film, Brad's character goes to a lab to where he reveals to some scientists toward some information about the zombie. My only gripe with this scene is that the director did not take the liberty to show how Brad's character figured out this solution and that there wasn't enough information on screen to have us, as an audience, to see how he was able to figure everything out. At a degree, we do see, however, how the scene was shown and how Brad's character connects everything is not fully explained.Overall, this film was decent enough to watch and not as bad as many people speculated the movie to be. I did have fun, thought the zombies were creepy and had some cool moments. However, because of the bad execution and the progression of the plot, I have to give this film a B-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'World War Z' hasn't had an easy road to the big screen. Work on the film began around 2006 and from then on, the production was troubled. Brad Pitt became involved early on, putting up much of his own money for it ? with his production company Plan B ? yet even he must have been worried when he saw how difficult the making of the film was becoming. Directors were changed and the script passed through the hands of about five scriptwriters. The budget started out somewhere around $120 ? 130 million, but it continued to rise and is now reported to be over $200 million. Rumours abounded reporting tensions between Pitt and director Marc Forster. Then, the original ending was entirely scraped, so reshoots were required to somehow be weaved into the existing narrative. After all this trouble, I went into 'World War Z' expecting a mess with cracks evident on screen. However, in a pleasant surprise, it flows nicely with the new ending working seamlessly.This film is many things, but it isn't really an adaptation of Max Brooks' 2003 novel of the same name, even though it started out as such. Brooks' acclaimed novel has a multi-narrative structure that would better lend itself to a TV show as opposed to a film. Whereas the book concerns multiple narrators, the movie solely follows ex-UN official Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) who experiences a zombie outbreak first-hand, narrowly escaping the chaos with his family. However, his former boss asks him to travel the world to search for a possible cure for the pandemic.Most zombie movies and TV shows (good or bad) take place after the initial outbreak, whether it be 'The Walking Dead', or Danny Boyle's brilliant '28 Days Later'. In a refreshing turn, 'World War Z' depicts the outbreak the minute it happens, and these scenes are some of the best in the film, conveying a frenzied feeling of panic. It feels what it would really be like - cars crash, people scramble in every direction, disaster everywhere. Secondly, the majority of zombie films and shows find their characters confined to a small area; for example, the shopping centre 'Dawn of the Dead'. One of the best aspects of 'World War Z' is that it shows the zombie pandemic on a global scale, with the central character travelling from the U.S. to Korea to Israel to Wales. This globe-trotting element provides the film with some thrilling setpieces, in particular the relentless scenes where thousand- strong swarms of zombies flood through the streets of Jerusalem or the initial panic in Philadelphia.Marc Forster is a director with a mixed back record ? 'Stranger than Fiction' may have been great, but he followed it up with the huge disappointment that was 'Quantum of Solace' ? thankfully, 'World War Z' is significantly better than the latter. It's no masterpiece, but it's a quite good and consistently enjoyable romp. Pitt delivers a solid performance and makes Lane an engaging protagonist. The lack of gore and the presence of fast zombies may annoy fans of the book and zombie traditionalists, but I found that both worked (especially the latter) in the context of the movie. It's not the book, but 'World War Z' is still a good film, especially after all the trouble it went through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings and salutations Germers and Jewettes. Its the weekend and we couldn't be more excited to present to you our review for World War Z. Ever since the Germ and the Jew's eyeballs were tantalized with the trailer for World War Z we knew in the depths of our souls that this was going to be a must see. I'm not saying that when we saw this trailer choirs of angels descended from the heavens and we became one with the universe and reached movie goer's nirvana. But I'm not saying that didn't happen either. Speaking of Kurt Cobain, Brad Pitt is a dead ringer for him in World War Z. Awhile back we asked you "who was on your Hollywood Mt Rushmore?" Overwhelmingly Brad Pitt made a lot of your lists and for good reasons. If being a good looking Missourian was an Olympic event, Brad Pitt would obviously take the gold while the Germ and the Jew would clearly be duking it out for silver and bronze. Now back to the review. World War Z is a new take on a zombie movie. Lets face it. Zombies are just about everywhere these days. If zombies moved in next door to you and one of them asked your daughter to prom, you probably wouldn't even bat an eye. So we were glad to see World War Z step it up a notch and play out the idea of zombies on a global scale. And these aren't your daddy's zombies either. These are super ninja spider monkey zombies...pretty much the worse kind. Once infected with the zombie virus the host begins twerkin' like they were in a Rick Ross video. And they're just like Bebe's Kids. They don't die, they multiply(kudos to you if you get that reference). The basic premise of this movie is Brad Pitt has to figure out how to fight the zombie apocalypse, save the world, and get back to his family. The events play out well and the action sequences are ripe with bone chilling suspense. The only negative to World War Z would be the lack of gore we would expect from a zombie movie. Compared to the classic titles there is almost no blood and guts here. But overall this movie is a must see. If you can see it in theaters more power to you. But if you have to wait to rent you will still enjoy it. The Germ and the Jew are proud to give World War Z the band Falco and a dreidel.The Germ and The Jew Movie Review</fullReview>

This was refreshing, fun, fast paced, action packed and a thoroughly enjoyable trip to the cinema. Everyone in the cinema was having fun, reminded me of Rocky 4 when everyone started shouting 'Rocky' 'Rocky', this film pulls you in very early on and kind of spits you out at the exit door of the cinema feeling exhilarated. That is why I am writing this review, had to share the buzz, whoever made this film deserves a slap on the back, well worth a few shekels to get that amount of quality entertainment slapped on your plate....BARGAIN</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z - A good thriller that satisfies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to watch World War Z with quite some interest and obviously, its not like you get zombie apocalypse movies every now and then... The movie was frankly.. an excellent one. The movie wastes no time in bringing up the main plot of the story and right from the first minute, each and everything is part of it. The thing I liked most about this film is that it delivered everything that it was supposed to, beside a few flaws, the plot was a good one accompanied by a cast that were extremely efficient. Brad Pitt alone took the movie to a greater height with his superb acting. The Zombies were quite well-designed and along with their ideal casualness earned their silly antics laughter from the audience and at the same time, some horror. The story revolves around the idea of a plague spreading 'round the globe which infects people and makes the infected people zombie-like. Also, anyone getting bitten by them were likely to turn like them as well. Gerry(Pitt) and his family narrowly escapes the infected denizens of the New York before getting rescued, now Gerry out of his duty and love for his family, agrees to go on a wild trip to find out more about the disease and whether it has a cure. The plot as I said was a good one, the soundtrack's accompanying the movie well, cast superb, graphics fantastic, It sure did have a few flaws though namely not naming the cause of the disease or about how it actually began, but it can be easily looked over if you look on the positive sides. Though there are some other good movies out there such as Man of Steel, World War Z belongs to a completely different category and along with it's elegance singles out the others, so even if you have no idea how zombies look, you would still love the suspense of this film. All in all, World War Z is a great movie and you would definitely enjoy seeing it even if you are not much of a fan of Zombies, the 3-D effects are good in this one, But 2-D went just fine enough for me. So, in case you were wondering to watch it or not, Do so, you will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid summer blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most people, I heard all the horror stories about the PG-13 rating, the script, the bloated budget, and the last minute re-edit of the third act. Then I read a couple of the scathing reviews from people who saw the movie before it's US release. All I can say is people need to take themselves a little less seriously. All the things that people were complaining about just seemed like nitpicky hater-talk. I feel like a lot of people pre-judged this movie based on the budget and showed up just to pick it apart. Spoiler alert: it ain't Citizen Kane. It's a summer action movie, and a pretty good one at that. No more, no less. Try seeing it as a fan looking for some summer fun instead of as an amateur film critic and you might actually enjoy yourself. I did. Totally worth my 11 bucks (3D is for suckers).</fullReview>

I liked the vulnerability of the characters and general hopelessness conveyed. The seriousness of the movie was also a nice touch.To all real zombie-lovers out there, relax, you don't need to have bleeding guts and gore every time. In real zombie-situation there would be no time for you to enjoy watching blood flying in slow motion and intestines dropping in anatomical detail. You wold be running like Brad Pitt did.

		<fullReview>I won't give this film a ten mainly because i saw it in 3d which costs more; this film did not need to be in 3d, didn't mind the 3d, it just would've been just as good without it. Brad Pitt's character is believable and appealing. The film is fast-paced and fun from beginning to end, there's tension and excitement throughout. I personally love zombie flicks, even the direct to video lot. Movies where the viewer can't even begin to imagine the horror lend an excitement that's only available in modern zombie horror, in my humble opinion. World War Z also has it's share of predictable moments, but without giving anything away, you will still enjoy the film. I am not really saying much with this review only to say that if you like zombie, you will truly dig World War Z!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came in with a bunch of friends with respect to all the hype this movie was generating and boy are we ever glad we followed the flow. The movie was excellent, granted, it wasn't a rather unique idea but the way it was portrayed helped it in standing out from the slew of zombie movies that are coming out these days. One of my favourite scenes was in Jerusalem. The wall was both impressive and creepy and the part where the zombies started to climb made that part one of the best ones in the movie. All-in- all I wouldn't mind watching this movie again albeit I wish I could forget what I saw as I want that surprise and thrill to be as fresh as I had watched it last time. To hell with all the other reviewers out there, learn to have fun will you?! It's a rare gem where in zombie and gore did not really depend too much on each other for excellent delivery. Kudos to all those involved in this movie. I hope you don't make a sequel for this one though as I think the end was enough making a sequel might be too dangerous of a gamble.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie! Excitement from beginning to end. Not one dull moment in the whole film. This was the best zombie flick since the remake of Dawn of the Dead. These zombies were wicked and scary. These aren't the boring slow moving zombie that you can dance around, make a sandwich, take a nap, and still not get bit. These zombies make your body twitch when your bit. And when I say twitch, I mean TWITCH. You turn in 12 seconds after being bit. Then you bite a person, they bite a person, and so on and so on. Brad Pitt was fantastic. The story was fantastic, the zombies were fantastic. What else do you need???The only thing I disliked in the movie was the audio. There were a bunch of low talkers and a feel like I missed much of what was being said sometimes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is seriously underrated at IMDb. I got everything i had expected from this and then some.This year has so far been terrible for the movies. There have been big names but for me most of them have been a no-show,specially 'man of steel' which i believe was complete and utter commercial bull crap.Going in with not so many expectations,i was impressed with this movie.Without dwelling into the story I'd say that World War Z does what most action filled blockbusters forget , i.e to surprise the audience.I cared for what happened to the protagonist. The direction and the pace kept me interested. The casting was good and production values were brilliant. But most of all it was Brad Pitt who added to the excellence. I have seen him in a large variety of roles and this is another winner for him.If you haven't seen this movie , all i can say is, please do.This movie is worth the time and money.I saw it in 3d and the effects were good but however , i felt this would be more enjoyed in 2d where you can experience all the colors and the visual detail.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though the movie is set to be different than previous "zombie" movies, I found this movie to be very similar to thrillers that I have seen before. The story is sold and the acting from all is phenomenal. I found this movie to make me jump. The suspense is almost killing and the "zombies" in this movie are different than any that I have ever seen. I ,being a zombie fanatic, am in love with the traditional zombies from the classics such as, night of the living dead and 28 days later, but i found that the "Zombies" in World War Z are very realistic to the situation given. I use the quotation marks around zombies when talking of this movie because it is never told only suggested and mentioned in the movie that these are actually zombies. Based upon my research and love for the undead creatures I would say that these are not Zombies due to how they act in the film. The creators do have a few aspects that resemble the undead by a few facts that are seen in as little as the previews shown on TV. The trailer shows the creators piling on top of each other to get to the top of a tall wall. This aspect shows the creators need to spread the disease and to not stop under any circumstance. Overall the movie is a new hit to spread the "zombie" liking to the world and show the impact a disease has on a nation and a world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Zombie Genre Is Far From Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that 'World War Z' has finally been released is more of a miracle then finding the cure for a zombie virus. With a very troubled production behind it, 'World War Z' at one point was thought to be scrapped and not released. With the script going under re-writes, scenes being re-shot, the film going almost $100 million over budget and rumours that director Marc Forster and Brad Pitt had a falling out, it is safe to say 'World War Z' has had a bumpy ride before it had even set off. As for the film itself, Paramount are hoping the bad press surrounding the production is over shadowed by the film hopefully being a box office success and pleasing not just mainstream audiences, but fans of the novel too.Brad Pitt plays Gerry, an ex worker for the U.N and now full time father and husband who is caught up in a world wide epidemic. A zombie virus is spreading the globe and taking one country at a time. After taking his family to safety, it is now up to Gerry to go out into the world and try and find the cause of the virus and possibly a cure.Marc Forster has always been a director who focuses in characters, and here he is no different. The film isn't about the zombie virus, but more about Gerry's determination to get to the bottom of the virus and return to his family. This is Forster's best film since 'Finding Neverland'. Forster was hand picked by Pitt (who produces the film also) to direct and you can see why. Most film makers can fill the screen with violence, but if we don't care for the characters at the centre of the film then the violence can seem gratuitous. Don't get me wrong, the film is filled with blood and gore, but Forster never looses focus of the characters involved in the situations.Pitt gives a solid lead performance and all the supporting cast are excellent too, including a short but crucial cameo by David Morse. 'World War Z' does have its problems. We are less then 10 minutes into the film before we are swept away into the plot. Personally I would have liked to spend some more time with Gerry and his family, but the characters still become well established as the film goes on. The script also doesn't forget the political source from the original novel. We hear how different governments are going about tackling the virus which leaves our characters questioning if they are trying to go about their mission the right way.The script is full of edge of your seat moments. I can't recall the last time I was ever as tense whilst watching a film in the cinema. The action set pieces are great and the script tries to pull our characters way from certain clinches that may be found in this type of film. The soundtrack for the film is provided by Muse and is nothing less then spectacular. I saw the film in 2D instead of 3D and not at one point did I see any shot or set piece where I thought I was missing out on the 3D experience. The film was great without paying more money to wear a pair of glasses.Certainly the best film of it's kind since Danny Boyle's '28 Days Later' and proof that you can breath new life into a genre that is always being recycle. Tense, terrifying and utterly terrific, 'World War Z' is the best blockbuster of the summer so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killin' it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About six weeks ago, I was invited to a fifteen-minute sneak peek of World War Z, an allegedly troubled project from the usually untouchable actor-producer, Brad Pitt, and underrated director Marc Forster (Monster's Ball, Stranger Than Fiction, Quantum of Solace). Given the buzz- or lack thereof- I was understandably tentative, but was quickly sucked in by the film's grand scale and penchant for genuine horror. Having seen the finished product, the matter is no longer up for debate; World War Z is unlike any film of its genre before it. Endlessly marketed as another snooze fest holiday blockbuster, it is actually a taut, engrossing thrill ride seasoned with merciless, edge-of-your-seat terror, the likes of which haven't graced the big screen for a long time.Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN representative who gets called back into work courtesy of a virus that has rapidly turned most of the earth's population into a soulless, superhuman race of ravenous zombies. In his worldwide search for answers, Lane faces all comers head-on in an environment that would compel even the most reckless Marine to bail with a resounding 'Nope!' before word of the outbreak hits the evening news.Virtually every supporting character is useless, from Lane's inconvenient wife to his irritating children, but it doesn't even matter. Pitt carries the film with a grounded performance, crafting a rational, believable character that so deftly toes the line between the invincible action hero and the out-of-his-element everyman. Forster made the right decision injecting a main character instead of following the scattered journal entry format of Max Brooks' novel, giving the film the accessibility it needs to be successful without resembling a carbon copy of every blockbuster this side of the 3D revolution.And it is on that point that World War Z excels. Anyone expecting a fun but forgettable romp ablaze with heavy artillery and indiscriminate loss of life is likely to cop a pleasant shock. This is not to suggest that the film doesn't cater to the mass market. On the contrary, each set piece just gets progressively more ambitious, making a glowing spectacle of the film's $200 million budget, but it is the moments of deathly silence that are most effective and, ironically, most likely to turn the event into a holistic cinema experience; one in which you and 300 fellow viewers can uniformally share your inner cowardice amidst nervous laughter and clenched fists, jaws and many other parts of the human anatomy. Here is a film that has grabbed every potential setback by the scruff of the neck, thrown it across the room with the force of an undead army, and nonchalantly delivered a jaw-dropping masterclass in suspense for its troubles.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was quite an experience, it oozed the audience into the actual scene and did not let you get out until the credits started rolling. World War Z gets right to the action from the very beginning, and it creates the most hectic environments you can possibly think of. Brutality-wise, it's obviously not as gory as zombie flicks such as Dawn of the Dead but it fully pushes it's PG-13 rating to the extent. Throughout the movie, it blends it's genre of horror and action masterfully and even though there are a few laughs, it's overall tone is pretty serious yet still entertaining. The "father" role seems to fit Brad Pitt nicely and the trailer may have represented this film as if it was brainless but as far as zombie movies go, it uses it's brain. You will be jumping out of your seat not because of fright but because of how tense the scenes are. The score goes along with the numerous moods in the film. It's completely original, to every single detail, even the zombies(appearance and behavior are different from the average zombie). Overall, this isn't a movie but better, it's a journey that will contain surprises and above all fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just when i thought that Hollywood is having enough with zombie movies, here comes another one with brad pitt in it , so i said to my self if brad pitt is in this movie , there must be something special and different about it right?? , other than some intense scenes and good cinematography , the movie is pretty much decent and typical , brad pitt had to travel all over the planet to protect a doctor who gonna look for the origin of this epidemic but the doctor get killed before they even start....if the doctor is gonna die before starting anything why bother putting him in the movie at all??...so brad pitt is gonna be on his own and travel from one place to another in very repetitive fashion ... as soon as he reaches one place to another...basically every place he visits looks cool and under control at first before they start getting attacked by zombies ... then brad pitt had to leave to another place and the same happens over and over...so basically the idea is to show the same scenario over and over again until we are done and then we can call it movie .... but overall not bad flick</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling and Action Packed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This can easily be the most sensible zombie movie of all the times. It has a logical explanation for how zombies are formed and how it can be tackled. Brad Pitt carries the entire movie on his shoulder with a power packed performance. Best movie so far off the summer releases.The movie has a mixture of emotions, action sequences, thrilling encounters in a correct proportion. The director might have tweaked the book a lot but he has done enough work to keep the movie very much alive. The book lovers may dislike it but for others it is purely en-thrilling experience. One more plus point for the movie is the Cinematography. Usually the zombie movies are in dark and you would be always feel in dark. But this movie has bright light sequences and showing the pandemic in a very clear picture. This only adds weight to the quality of the scenes. From US to Korea to Israel to England.. the movie has traveled the globe. Good to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2nd Favorite Movie of The Year So Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Came back from World War Z and in my opinion an awesome film. I never really liked Brad Pitt in the past but I really liked and respected the role that he played in here as a family father and former military officer on a quest to save mankind compared to most of the playboy macho like kind of roles that he's played in the past. Not much to say about the other characters since they didn't' really play a huge role in this filmI really liked the 'your enemy is your friend' concept that they used in the film which I would rather not spoil here. The plot of the movie was very interesting and there were some really cool moments in the film. There were also moments where I felt like I was watching a video game adaptation. World War Z is definitely the best zombie films right now (even better than the Resident Evil series) This definitely listed down as my 2nd favorite film of the year so far (number 1 goes to Tom Cruise's Oblivion back in March). I would definitely see it again if I have the time</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The pace is fast, which makes almost every minute breath-taking. CG is nice, but watching it in 3D might not be really necessary. If the fact "the lead actor never dies" sounds acceptable, then WWZ is really a brilliant movie (yes, nobody expects Brad Pitt to die halfway through, right?)There isn't really a lot of blood, or violent scenes in this WWZ. No half- hanging intestines out of body, not much brutal cannibalistic shots.And of course, for die-hard fans of the original book, WWZ is only a rough adaptation. So if you treat the movie as totally unrelated to the book, you'll feel better when watching it.Score: 7 out of 10, plus 1 bonus mark for Brad Pitt as I like the star haha</fullReview>

We have enough violence in real life without seeing it in films. When I watch a film I want to be entertained and see a film that makes me laugh or at least make me feel good. There were films last year about the end of the world and now its all about after the end of the world. They make films showing violence and then wonder why kids go out shooting and killing people. Its about time we banned these films. People who like these films are sick in my opinion. I would rather sit and watch paint dry and than watch this sh*te!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie thinking it was not going to be good because of all the reviews on how bad it was. Good thing I didn't listen to the reviews. This movie was an amazing zombie film except that it was PG-13. Even though it was PG-13, it didn't need to show gore to be good. WWZ just didn't show a lot of blood but somehow it worked. At parts it can get really scary. World War Z had a lot of action and it kept you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Overall I was very impressed with World War Z. I would recommend to any zombie movie lover. This is one of my favorite zombie movies. I can not believe someone would write a bad review on this movie. -Nick</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vision of the end of all things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, this film is at its heart an existential horror film, not an action film. Within moments of the start of the film, the unknown threat is upon the protagonist and his family. Very soon, the dimmest outline of the beast come to devour the world is shown. The desperate race to flee, to fight, to combat, to do anything in response to that which exists only in my most symbolic nightmares is on.The Beast moves with speed, fury and determination, but its full dimensions always remains unclear, unknown and terrifying. It hunts, it lurks and it waits for every opportunity to consume mankind. In the face of this unknown devourer, our protagonist carries on with his mission with only the barest glimmer of hope of success or understanding of what he is facing, while all around him the world is consumed.As I left the theatre and made my way home overwhelmed by what I saw, a dream I had long ago that marked me arose. I saw the destroyer of worlds, the unthing, from beyond again, its long grim strides consuming existence with every step. Everything in the destroyer's path was annihilated and was as if it all had never been. No past, no present, no future remained in the wake of the unthing from beyond. The only thing to do was to flee before the end of existence, desperate to cling what remained as nothingness strode towards me.Allegorically, World War Z,with its teeming rivers of once human tentacles of destruction depicted the unthing of my dreams to me. The terrible all consuming horror summoned forth grips me still and I cry and whimper in fear. The destroyer of worlds was evoked in World War Z, as clearly to me as it was to Dr. Oppenheimer when he witnessed the first atomic bomb and the first unthing was put within man's grasp.I knew fear again, the fear that existential horror films rely upon to work and I knew that World War Z had done its job admirably. If you enjoy such films and enjoy glimpses of the destroyer of worlds, this one's for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read the book and I like zombie movies enough, but this movie is a unique mix of zombie, natural disaster, and the new end-of-the-world-super-disease genre. It has just enough scientific basis to make it plausible but at the same time the cinematography is absolutely brilliant. In terms of scale, it is also unusual in that this movie spans the entire globe, thus giving a relatively macro-view of what a global zombie pandemic looks like. Overall a must see!Positives: the fall of Jerusalem is arguably one of the best scenes I've in a movie theater in a long time. The initial buildup, the calm before the storm, the first victim, the gathering of momentum as the zombies begin to gain the upper hand, absolutely brilliant! Fast action without a lot of the cheap suspense of people walking around in abandoned places and being jumped by lone zombies. Lack of character development has been cited as a negative for this film but I'd have to say that most of the characters were surprisingly well-developed WITHOUT falling into the standard zombie apocalypse tropes. More importantly, it's a freaking zombie movie, exactly how much character development do you want anyways? It's a good mix between action and humanism, without neglecting either aspect.Negatives: ending was a little abrupt, some questions remain unanswered, less emphasis on politics, minor details.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War Z is extremely breath-taking and action-packed. This is the best zombie-movie ever made so far. The characters played their role very well, the story line was great. The ending and how the zombies are shown are uniquely depicted. I even find myself breathing nervously and scared, even covering my eyes in some scenes because it is really fascinating. I just really wish the movie was longer because it really happens very fast, but fast in a good way. Each and every scenes are very unique and I even find myself at the edge of my seat. But what I love the most about this movie is that it doesn't only focus more on zombies, because aside from being a horror movie, there are also some very funny scenes and lines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* You're probably wondering how they could make a PG-13 zombie feature movie scary. Well, rest assured, they didn't. You see, PG-13 is PG-13. There is nothing scary about something mom's are okay with letting their 23 yr olds watch. So to make up for the lack of fear caused overblown scooby doo episode, the filmmakers went for no gore and total CGI. Works for me! I never imagined that zombies could be so family friendly. How shortsighted I was. "World War Z" surprised me with its bloodshed level of ZERO. "World War Z" is not a scary movie but they did the best they could with what they had. What they had were PG-13 zombies. I enjoyed it.*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* ?The footage of the zombies is what's known as CG. No matter who they attack or where they are, the same shot of piles of the living dead heaping everywhere is shown. Keep in mind, this singular shot occupies at least half the movie. OK, cartoon zombies are right above psychotic sloths and right below Johnathon Winters as Mork's baby in the creepiness factor. So the absurdness of it all is quite apparent from the get go. The flick is fun somewhat through. I appreciate that they spelled out that this was World War Z. Probably not worthy of watching it more than once and promptly forgetting it except for playing a rather obscure trivia game. Writer Damon Lindelof is more widely known for his previous scriptwork "Cowboys &amp; Aliens" and "Prometheus" (which is quite possibly the funnest bad movie ever made) This man is ruining Sci-fi as a genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z(ombies)! Ridiculously Entertaining &amp; Thrilling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This World War Z is not like any other zombie movies. When I saw the trailer, I think this is gonna be like Resident Evil or maybe, Zombieland? Zombie-themed movies usually don't really appeal me, but I really enjoyed this movie.The opening scene is so common, followed by chaos caused by the zombies, then effort to escape, got shelter, then trying to fix things up. Actually the "zombie" term in this movie has a bit of twist. This is not like the zombies we know (or I know). This World War Z has different theory of zombies. The origin of the "Zombie pandemic" in this movie is not so exposed, it is described as sudden outbreak.As the usual zombie apocalypse-themed movie, the zombies kill all the innocent citizen because the citizen's own stupidity, or I called idiocy. I don't want to type like this but yeah, the citizen in one city are idiot enough to make so much noise which make the zombies more aggressive and let them get through the giant wall (the wall which zombies trying to climb in the promotional trailer). And Gerry (Brad Pitt) is dumb enough not to stop the citizen earlier. If he told them to stop making noises, maybe the citizen will be alive till the end of the movie.This movie is not recommended for those who doesn't want to get heart attack. So thrilling and this is what zombie movies should be! With the scary zombie's noise and score, you can jump out of your seat. Seriously. I jumped out of my seat at least 5 times. Well, people's level of scariness is different but this zombie movie is quite scary. And it's supported by "darkness" in all the scenes. The cinematography is just so good to scare the hell out of you.The ending? Nah, I called that medium-sized cliffhanger, I mean not so cliffhanger but you can still call it cliffhanger. And I hate cliffhanger. When the movie ended, I was just like, "That's it? That's it?!" This movie is just about 116 minutes and I think it can be lengthened to.. about 150 minutes (2.5 hours) to explain all the things.Sequel possibility is not so high. What will you do next? Deep-fried the zombies with flame-thrower? I think there will be no sequel for this. What? World War Z-2? To conclude all the things, this movie is far better than the typical zombie apocalypse movie. You won't get bored sitting for 116 minutes because it's always thrilling in the whole movie, except the first 5 minutes. So far the summer movies are amazing. This World War Z added the awesomeness of summer movies parade. Don't expect this movie to be like Resident Evil because you're dead wrong if you think like that. This movie is awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you are Making a Horror Movie, Don't Play it Safe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a movie is based on a book, a review can get caught up in comparing the book to the film. In this case, I listened to a good portion of the audio book. I could recognize, as with the majority of books, that it is not appropriate to compare two different forms of entertainment. A book can expand in situations that a movie has no time for. What a good screenplay can do, is flesh out some of the better characters, and inject them into the storyline somehow that works with the overall arc of the movie. This is true as our protagonist meets characters in South Korea and Israel. But the overall arc of the movie was not satisfying. The movie stayed too conventional, setting up the family, and making the film about getting safely back to the family. Important as this is, the detective work in tracing the source of a virus and solving the epidemic should also be given great weight in the story. Such is not the case in this film. It is, however, a successful achievement in how the story allows chaos to help dictate the direction. When things don't go as planned, then you prevent the audience from predicting the outcome, something we are starving for. The final summary of this review is like so many other blockbusters recently. - Has the potential for being better, if better care was taken in putting the story together - The action scenes are great, but that alone does not make for a satisfying movie - Some plot holes we can live with, but giant plot holes make us feel cheated.The most noticeable problem with this film, one big enough for me to not recommend this film, is the PG-13 instead of R rating for a horror movie. Worse, it seems obvious the movie could have been edited a lot scarier, but pulled it's punches at the moment of the big shock. Playing it too safe at every scary moment goes against the very point of the genre. With the moment of thrill being sanitised, you no longer have any expectation of being subjected to a scary film, and now just sit there as we miss all the good action off camera. Which takes us to the infamous third act. A great deal of publicity has been released about the reshoot of the third act, and the new ending feels tossed together at the last minute. At this point I was yawning and felt no scary thrills from our group of harmless zombies. There was a lot of laughter in the theatre throughout the supposed nail biting climax. And the homogenised storyline all but assured the telegraphed ending. So you have the conventional close to the film, but no. Sequel bait dictates that the story is not over, that all the efforts we have endured could be meaningless. This was an unsatisfying non-closure, and was ready for the credits to roll and head to the exit. I recommend waiting for the DVD, enjoy the action setpieces, and lament at the much scarier film it could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombie Movie for people who hate zombie movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Might Contain Spoilers* Brad Pitt needed a blockbuster. I guess that's why he optioned WORLD WAR Z and then proceeded to make a movie that used only the title of the popular Max Brooks book. The problem with this movie is that it is neither fish nor fowl. It's not really an adaptation of the novel because other than the title, it has little to do with the book. It's not really a zombie movie, at least not one that fans of zombie movies would like. Not sure what drew Pitt and company to the material since it would seem that Pitt cares nothing for zombie movies. I doubt he and Jolie sit around watching things like NIGHTMARE CITY or THE GATES OF HELL. He probably read or heard that zombie movies do well at the box office and probably needs a hit to be able to adopt more kids so he bought the rights to the book thinking it would provide the framework for a hit. It's a best seller and it's about zombies, right? Okay, so start counting the cash that will come in. However, he probably didn't know enough about zombie movies to know that part of the reason why they are profitable is because they are cheap to make. Most of the better zombie movies feature slow-moving zombies and what makes them scary is that while you can outrun them, eventually you will tire but they will keep on going unless you can find a way to stop them but how do you kill what is already dead? Most zombie movies are usually gory too. Seems to go with the territory as much as sex goes with porno movies. However, Paramount spilled anywhere from $170 million-$200 million on this movie and yet, couldn't put any blood or gore into it. With that budget, you could hire every make-up effects artist in Hollywood and have lots of blood and make-up effects but they didn't do that. Instead they hired the guy from TRANSFORMERS effects, Scott Farrar, and had him come up with ridiculously sped-up zombies that are laughably fast. The effect is less sinister than it is just plain silly. Hopefully Brad will learn his lesson and stick with other genres of films than horror. It's just not his bag. He's a good actor and all but he doesn't seem to even like zombie movies but he has succeeded in making the perfect zombie movie for people who hate zombie movies. If you actually like zombie movies, then go rent NIGHTMARE CITY instead of watching this. It's a better movie about the same subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"World War Z" is "The Walking Dead" on a global scale - and even more frightening!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ordinary day in Philadelphia becomes a horrifying fight for survival in a matter of minutes?.okay, maybe that's not too unusual, but in a matter of days, people are confined to a few islands of humanity where the walls seem to be closing in and no one is really safe. "World War Z" is truly frightening.It all starts with the best shot, best edited most heart-pounding opening credits I've ever seen (yes, I said opening credits) and it just builds in intensity from there. Zombies have been scaring movie audiences for decades, and, more recently, TV audiences as well, but never like this. This film is like an episode of "The Walking Dead" on crack. These zombies move much faster than most of the zombies you've seen on TV or in the movies and they work together in ways that make you believe that mankind is indeed doomed. Still, the movie balances the action and sense of dread with a humanity that is lacking in many zombie tales. As in most zombie stories, a bite from a zombie quickly turns a healthy human into one of the undead, and a shot or severe blow to the head is the only way to really stop them, but as lethal as these zombies are, they have a weakness."World War Z" star Brad Pitt, in a subtle, but intense performance, plays a former United Nations employee and man-of-many talents who is brought back into the fold to help figure out how this whole thing started. Pitt's character is smart, resourceful and absolutely determined to do anything he can to save the world, but mainly as a way to save his own family who waits for his return on a ship at sea. He embarks on a perilous around-the-world trek following clues and putting himself at greater and greater risk to prevent the apparently imminent extinction of the human race.The movie comes to an end, but the story's ending isn't so neat. That's not a criticism. It's an example of what this film does very well ? make the audience feel that if there were a zombie apocalypse, this is really what it might be like. One man living through and accomplishing everything that Pitt's character survives and does in this film makes him come off a little too much like a superhero, but it sure is thrilling to be along for the ride. I give "World War Z" an "A-".</fullReview>

The political, environmental and human overtones in this film set the bar for this genre; And set it apart from all the greats.Meticulously well written and directed, with a stellar cast and amazing filmography, this is easily one of the best entries into the 2013 Blockbuster season.

I found myself asking over and over again as to why this was even made. What new information can one gather from the already over-saturated zombie-fied world. Nothing clever.At a certain point, it dawned on me that it seemed wherever Pitt was the zombies seemed to have followed him. I completely tuned out when they (SPOILER ALERT) board an airplane and the zombies were there. I half-expected a passenger jumbo jet fly by and as Pitt looked out the window to see zombie pilots waving at him. Zombie Air logo on the tail. Then he just slowly closes the sunshade. It's that stupid.I sincerely disliked this movie, simply because it was lifeless (ironic enough for a zombie movie). Everyone plays confused. The epidemic seemed somehow...contained and didn't feel the slightest bit real. Probably because it was shot digital and looked terribly digital. I'm sure most people didn't care. There's just nothing new here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While World War Z may not be as offensively bad as certain other films released this year it is still insultingly stupid to anyone with even the most basic measure of common sense or logic to their name and by lazily handwaving the only element that may have given it some lasting appeal with hamfisted mother nature metaphors it ends up being a completely forgettable experience.I could go on to great lengths about all the little details that ruin this film but for something so unengaging it just can't find the motivation. There's no characterisation, the film wavers on tone and themes all the time, things happen for no good reason other than to move the action to another location, there's bad cgi, bad audio, excessive use of shaky cam to hide the bad cgi, professionals routinely act like amateurs, more bad cgi, more shaky cam and a tame and predictable ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most believable apocalyptic films yet..... but.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had everything to be brilliant. A believable idea and a cracking budget.This was a good film I enjoyed it and didn't particularly feel it was too long or at any point check my watch. Which is good. Certain areas ended up being slightly unbelievable and "all a bit to much" for instance the plane crash etc.. but a bit of poetic license and fair enough, why not! The film dried up slightly towards the end, you sort of new what was going to happen at the end before it did happen. But I want to stand up for this film as i have seen people commenting on certain aspects of the film that let it down.Zombies; They are not the normal bumbling Zombies that groan and shuffle about. These are quick "I Am Legend" type creatures. People talked these down, personally I think slow moving, brain eating zombies are slightly un-scary and certainly wouldn't provide tense moments in the film. These Zombies are apparently so due to an infection, one that does not alter the strength or agility of humans so why would they not be like human type animals? I cant get my head around the criticism here. I saw no problems with them.The Virus; Now on a few reviews I have seen people say "how could idiot zombies know who has terminal illnesses just by looking at them.. doctors cant do that" Now, this is a great part of the film - a clever new play on the Zombie film. The Zombies are actual like a Virus. A supped up version of a virus that could be in your system - that only attacks healthy cells in your body to make you weak and pass on the virus to other strong cells which means the virus will survive, not attacking unhealthy cells which will not "function" correctly.. So they go around killing all the healthy people (I actually think this is a really good angle to come from and this for me, makes the whole film believable) while ignoring the terminally ill ones.Brad Pitt; Why send him in one team? Especially when they all die within 25 minutes of them being introduced! Yes I struggled to understand why they didn't send lots of teams to investigate and crack on with saving the world, but to be fair i only over thought this after wards, not during the film. ANyway - he was sent because he is good at what he does,investigating. He does it well, he becomes a bit of a hero by realising this, fair play. But, you didn't really care about the character or his family or anyone really.. not enough character building in the plot affected this but it doesn't effect the film as a whole.Only a short piece, but the film is worth a watch and I will probably buy this on DVD when its released. A good idea and an enjoyable watch, not a best ever film but a good crack at tweaking an old favourite.Watch it with an un-critical eye and you will not be dis-pleased but be mindful, if you are looking for plot holes and errors, you will find them and ultimately ruin this for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get Back To The Zombie Basics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an OK movie overall, but I love Zombie movies. Here are my criticisms:1. Zombies look too much like normal, people, they're more like rabid humans 2. Zombies r 2 fast and too strong, fast and too plentiful (like the bus scene) 3. They can b burned 2 almost nothing and still b "alive"I think they should go back to George Romero's original formula with a few changes.On a positive note, @ least it's not like "I Am Legend" with CGI zombies. Too bad it wasn't more like either "Dawn of the Dead (1979 or 2002)".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I somehow had my expectations set up high with this movie, I don't know why. Maybe because I expect big budget films to surprise me now and again instead of being just another explosion and gunshots fest. Man, wrong again.The beginning of the movie, up to the titles, didn't make my interest go away. I was hoping to see some of the controversy shown there in the movie itself. All that about how humans are destroying the planet, and how there're people still denying facts like the existence of global warming and such. However, right after we see the title "World War Z", I got this feeling of uneasiness, when the film goes into its second scene, the family kitchen. Setting, faces, mood, conversation... everything made me have an ominous feeling. It was only the very beginning, so it could just be me and my natural suspicion. The action doesn't take long to start. Explosions and frenzy festival for everybody. The movie goes on and my feeling of dread stays there, and continues to grow, slowly but surely. But, hey, only 30 minutes passed by. A lot can happen. It might not be just ANOTHER survival horror revival. I saw a glimpse of hope with the investigation itself begins. Now, we will have some seriousness rather than shooting, running and growling. Oops, wrong again. After that, I lost all hope: This movie is indeed just another action packed Hollywood shallow spawn.I admit it, I don't have any interest in zombies, I don't even know how there can be a zombie genre. It's always the same with anything with zombies in it. Great for the zombie fans, I suppose. I don't even know what this film it's supposed to be exactly. I recall they tried to put drama into it. How can anybody find anything related to zombies to be dramatic?? Zombies make me smile, at best. The way they move, the way they look, the noises they make. "Zombieland", see, that's an alright movie because they make fun of the zombies (and fail when they try to be dramatic!). It's sad -and somehow, ridiculous- how little we are told about the zombies in "World War Z", regarding scientific facts. OK, granted, it's stupid to talk science when we are talking about people who go undead after being bitten. Although, c'mon, they don't even try.My expectations about those controversies shown at the beginning being treated throughout the movie were also destroyed, the final message being HELP EACH OTHER. Wow, how's that for a moral dilemma.And what about Israel's issue and what the movie depicts over there... Now, THAT is funny. I would love to see Israel doing what the movie shows. This movie giving credit to what they have done in real life is already by itself bad enough.Please, please, don't make more zombie movies, series, comics... Nothing. There're plenty of real zombies already here in the non- fictional world. Now, let the hordes of zombie fanatics have a go at me. Because this movie, unfortunately, it's once again simply another zombie movie for zombie people. Even though zombies are ridiculous, I believe a real process of human zombiefication started many, many years ago. You want proof? Count how many zom..erm, people find this review unhelpful.To be fair, this flick have some few alright moments. Although a few OK moments don't make a movie good. This is a motion picture, no still photography.Bottom line: thoughtless action, plenty of explosions, bloody rush and even helicopters and jet fighters! Kids, be happy. Shallow plot, pathetic intents of dramatization sometimes... What else is there to say? Millions wasted on this... Brain dead, alright.</fullReview>

And then the story leads Brad to Israel, we are told its a safe city but we already know whats going to happen at the wall, (they have shown it in a teaser).He then gets a last minute rescue by an airliner, but we know there must be a zombie on board... (they have shown it in a teaser)!!!!Get my drift...Don't worry if you don't get to see it, the big pieces of the jigsaw have already been show to you, I wish they did not give so much away in trailers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the end of the world as we know it. Again. 77.5%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie about a zombie apocalypse. Hmm...actually I was wondering whether the 'monsters' in this movie were technically zombies...I didn't think so, but later in the movie they are described in a way which fits in with 'conventional' notions of zombies.The opening credits pretty much blames the U.N. for the zombie pandemic...which perhaps makes lead actor Brad Pitt's character of U.N. 'trouble shooter' Gerry Lane an ironic hero (not sure if that irony still remains after a scene in Israel with a key figure there).World War Z (I say it "Zed" damn it! Perhaps it's meant to rhyme in the American way with "3"?) doesn't go in for long introductory scenes of life before the pandemic. There's a little of that at the start of the movie with Gerry's family (a wife and two girls). Such scenes are meant to ground Gerry but to me his family seem little more than props. Then again, Gerry doesn't seem a completely grounded character...but this is a zombie movie after all...what did you expect?Pretty soon the world has gone to Hell in a handbasket, overrun with 'zombies'. There are many tense scenes with Gerry (and his family) in imminent danger. Although retired from his U.N. duties, Gerry is roped into helping to defeat the zombie threat.Gerry ends up travelling to many countries trying to find the origin of the pandemic. Displaying the new fad of representing zombies, these hordes are not the shuffling slow pokes of a George A. Romero zombie movie...whilst not exactly supernatural seeming as in the movie "I am legend", they are a force to be reckoned with. I liked how they posed a greater threat as a group even though they were acting individually...as if their collective intelligence was far greater than that of any one individual. In any case, the action is basically all Hollywood...incredible odds, then overcook those to make the hero seem even more heroic. Then there are the Hollywood clichés to add even more tension to an already tense scene. At times such Hollywoodisations just over-egged the pudding for me.Previously I mentioned that Israel is a location for one of Gerry's trips. That section of the movie was interesting. It did make me wonder what was the subtext here? That it turns out that it was a good idea for Israel to build a wall between itself and the outside world? All in all, this was a tense and entertaining movie. The movie's zombies are unlike those of such pioneering efforts such as "Night of the living dead" and those not into gore and "Ewww!" will appreciate the different emphasis of this movie.Personally, I'd like to see a 'slow burn' zombie movie...taking the time to establish life before the threat and to slowly build into the end of the world scenario...hopefully drawing sympathetic characters in the process. Equally important would be to have the 'zombies' not be some sort of super human monsters...more in the George A. Romero mould...but then again, not technically either! I.e. a compromise between these two representations of zombies. The mechanics of how people turned into zombies in World War Z didn't really convince me...but I was happy to suspend disbelief.Saw this movie on an extra-widescreen and in 3D. The extra dimension doesn't really warrant the extra money at the box office though...however, I had some loyalty reward points which meant that I could see it in this form for around half the price of a half-price Tuesday regular 2D movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So world war z?Catchy title.Brad Pitt?200 million budget?This should be interesting. World War Z is a good movie.Almost.You see there is a problem.Take away the stunning visuals.The locations.The star.You get a classic hero saves all movie.I like hero movies.Its just that this movie should be about a global pandemic.With a side dish of hero stuff.Not the opposite.It kinda reminded me of War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise.Great movie.Lots of effects.But when you get more than twice the hero escape from impossible situations then you lose realism. And on the acting stuff.Too much situations on a few hrs.I mean the point of the protagonist is for audiences to connect with him.Brad Pitts character was flat.Totally.Maybe it was the acting.Or maybe it was the script.Or even directing(although i don't think that anyone could challenge an actor on a movie that he produces).So you get a flat protagonist.That is doing impossible things.I enjoyed Mr Pitt on Fight Club.He was perfect for the role of Tyler Dirden.Meet Joe Black.Oceans 11+1+1.Hell he even was almost very good on Burn after Reding.Problem is he isn't evolving.It seemed to me that Mr Pitt played a guy that looks and plays exactly like Brad Pitt.And overwritten.Oh and why not more David Morse?Maybe because he would steal the scenes?Because he is way cooler in roles like these?You should have made him the protagonist.He would most certainly pass a more realistic retired special agent whatever.He would go like "honey i have to go save the world.chill out.I've done this before.See you at dinner." No sobs and personal remorse or feelings.THE WORLD IS ENDING DUDE!!!!!!!!!!!! Now for the movie.Excellent visuals.I liked the anthill.The plane crash.The swarm of people capsizing the truck etc.It gives another perspective on Z movies.Less gore.This isn't a Fulci movie.Its something else.Its not pure zombie either.To be honest i enjoyed the first half hour.And the scene in Israel.And the last 3 minutes.Where masses of people prepare an attack on Z's.That would make a good movie.A scene where 1000 M1 Abrams would march against Z's .Millions of Z's.And eventually get owned by the sheer numbers.Where 200 attack helicopters shoot every single ammo they have and run empty.Of everything.And kamikaze themselves for the sake of their families.Where thousands of troops defend a city.And get eaten.Now that would be WWZ.Not this one.It still is a good movie though.But in my humble opinion it lacks grandeur...Producing and acting don't mix...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War Z, Selectively Bitchen on the Tim Scale of All Things Bitchen. Its a Zombie Flick. Yes, its a Zombie Flick with Brad Pitt, but its still a Zombie Flick. Big Money, Nice CG, great acting and story -- does the continental Hop the 28 Days/Weeks Later movies wished they could do. Surprisingly, the movie is not as intense as Superman was, although, there are several jump out of your seat moments. Poking fun at itself, the zombies can be comical and there are some good laughs...including a Hannibal Lector inspired zombie. He was awesome. World War Z offers a beginning at its end in a Louis Pasteur moment of desperation in action. That moment was both Inspiring and ...well... giggly. TBH, I kept wondering if someone in the flick was going to be sipping on a fine chianti during the scene...I'm left wondering if Brad Pitt likes Pepsi, or Suicidal Tendencies. Anyway...yeah, the movie keeps us weird black humored zombie types happy while managing to entertain the intrigued masses with its story.

		<shortDescription>too many inconsistencies to keep the viewer interested</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What started out as a run of the mill apocalyptic story involving zombies and the breakdown of society quickly(almost as quick as the zombies ran) turned into a series of badly orchestrated scenes that contained way way too many holes and plot inconsistencies to allow the film to progress.Some of the most annoying problems were zombie inconsistencies-apparently they were attracted by smell and noise but many times this seemed to be true only in very isolated circumstances. The scene in Israel where the zombies suddenly piled over the wall was apparently spotted only by Brad Pitt and not the numerous helicopters flying above!Would Brad Pitt really be given a phone to call his wife and not anyone in the military?Come on !!!The list goes on and on from scene to scene getting increasingly frustrating.Apparently this film went over budget-this must have surely been for the actors salaries because it could have easily been a very low budget attempt at recreating a bad version of 28 days later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst mainstream movie i ever seen!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay. First of all there is no real introduction to the characters. The action starts with in the first five minutes, so you really don't feel a lot for the main characters. The scene you see in the trailer where a garbage truck moves through a traffic jam and runs down a cop. But the character that Brad Pitt plays only thinks of getting out of there with no regards for other people that might be hurt. This happens in the first 5 minutes before you even know what is going on. Later they find out that the zombies are attracted to noise, and the louder the noise the more attracted the zombies are, witch results in the scene where the zombies jump in to the tall wall and climbs on top of each other as you also see in the trailer. And then get this! At the end the solution to defeating the zombies, is to inject all the soldiers with a deadly virus, because for some reason the zombies can not see a person that is terminally ill. It seems that the virus that makes the zombies needs a healthy host to spread the virus that kills them. Like that makes any sense at all!!! It is so stupid that i wish i had never used any money on this movie!!!</fullReview>

One thing I do have to confess is that I haven't read the book yet, im planning to though, but even then I don't think I'll bother comparing it taking into account that the writer said the only thing they took from the book was the movie's name. The movie was just very well done. I came in expecting an action flick,and encounter a movie that kept me to the edge of my seat till the very end. Taking into account the fact that horror movies these days suck,I was just really glad to feel like that watching a movie again,all the tense moments and the creepy moments are excellent and couldn't relax till the end of the movie. The zombies are great,im more of a classic zombie type of person, but these ones just really crept me out.The movie was fast paced,and I was satisfied with the ending.

		<shortDescription>Good for what it was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is way to overrated. I believe the movie itself apart from the ending was fantastic. Towards the end it got a little unrealistic in terms that suggest realism. For instance, the plane crash - This scene was such a let down as it bought suspense and tenseness but it was obvious that both the two characters Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) and Segen (Daniella Kertesz)survived such a unfortunate event. One thing I did like was the locations used. Not many zombie-horror films are set in multiple locations, however, with this movie I really enjoyed the fact that they used a small town in Wales and Jerusalem because it showed creativity. Just a little bit of my own analysis here; what I found controversial is that Jerusalem is believed to be the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the theme of zombies obviously is being resurrected from the dead - the living dead. Perhaps, Director, Breck Eisner is trying to make a point here. Who knows. Overall, this film was to typical. It showed good aspects to a zombie horror film but I wouldn't recommend if you're the type of person who likes a good dialogue and story line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you go to see this movie expecting some big Romero-like hit, then you will be disappointed. I knew that the moment the movie started, but for me it was still very good. World War Z is a cheesy and corny movie, with some interesting elements and imagery. I've seen it in 3D, which was actually good (big surprise for me), because it added to the dark atmosphere of the movie.There were some things that bugged me, which is why I gave this movie an 8/10, like the fact that Gerry(Brad Pitt) arrived in Jerusalem and after like, 2 minutes, the zombies climbed over the wall. I know the movie wants to be fast-paced and alert every time, which is good for a horror with Zeds, but at that moment it didn't work out for me. Another thing, which I seen in the trailer and it wasn't pleasant was the calm that Pitt had when the mirror from his car got wrecked. I expected him to curse, to be nervous, not to be so calm.The movie also had his funny moments, even though I think they were not supposed to be funny, like the sound that the zombie from the end of the movie made. Some may see it as a directing error, but for me it worked out better than expected.The imagery was very good, I liked the fact that many locations were presented. Another pro for the movie was the way they showed how much time the people had before the infection spread throughout the body. The moment with Gerry standing on the edge of the roof was very intense for me. Anyway, it's a good movie, in my opinion, and you should see it once. Just once.</fullReview>

My favorite part and in my opinion, the scariest part of this movie is the mass panic and the hysteria of people fighting for groceries, guns and shelter in the midst of a yet unknown terror. For those people that just wanted to see gallons of blood and brain eatings, this is not the movie for them. This movie goes in another direction. If I had two criticisms, it was the "movie science" they employed (Mother Nature leaves clues / Animals instinctively can detect disease, etc.) and that the zombies were simultaneously clever and stupid, fast and slow, weak and strong, whenever the movie needed them to be. Overall, and to my surprise, I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WORLD WAR Z - My thoughts and opinions....OK, so the 2nd movie in our drive-in extravaganza of fun was World War Z, the film based in name only on the Max Brooks novel of the same title.Since the novel release of WWZ, zombie fans clamored at the chance to see it once it was announced it would be turned into a feature film. Brad Pitt, who also stars, produced the film through his Plan B entertainment company which also bought the rights to the film the novel.After the purchase, it was reported the source material would be lightly used since filming the book as written wouldn't work not too mention drive the production budget into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Fast forward years later, the film still wasn't on its way to being green light because the budget was reported at $125,000,000, which makes WWZ the most expensive zombie film ever made. Once Brad agreed to join the cast, Paramount put the cash and director Marc Forster was announced to helm... I can't speak for everyone, but I knew this would be a disaster, Marc Forster, who directed Quantum of Solace, arguably one of the worst bond films ever made, was now directing his 10th film, and out of his resume only Monster's Ball was enjoyable. I equate him to John Moore, who has about the same track record in his resume.Filming begins in Scotland, and suddenly reports of blown shots, and other production issues begin filling out the horror news feeds, not too mention leaked footage taken BTS showing running zombies which make the DOTD remake zombies look slow, and top it with a release date change from 12/21/2012 to June 21, 2013 doesn't bode well for the production and we learn why in a bit. Still there may be hope, until the 1st trailer hits and the amount of CGI was just WOW. Fast Forward, April 2013, Vanity Fair releases a news article noting the films writer admitting the film is a mess, and needed some $70 million dollars worth of re-shoots because the ending of the film doesn't make sense. Now the bad JuJu vibes begin plaguing the thoughts of zombie fans world wide.Additional trailers being released doesn't seem to sway opinion that much, so opening weekend forecasts for box office began starting in the $35,000,000 range which is not good for a $200,000,000 zombie film. Now with $200 mil on the line, Paramount opts for the PG-13 route, to hopefully recoup the budget spent on the film, of course outrage ensues among fans of the book who are ticked source material is gravely ignored, and the fact PG-13 pretty much lets us know gore, if any would be minimal at best.Advance screenings begin and word of mouth begins to shift, WWZ is good... WHAT, internet fan boys the world over are crapping kittens that people are saying WWZ is enjoyable... are they right?Well, Yes and no. WWZ has its issues, CGI being the primary. However, it definitely went out of left field with the creation of a vaccine to make humans, food for our zombies, be non desirable to the zombies. I thought, hey, this is a cool angle, but also because of the non-gore, you now have zombies who can sense things about the humans, which is all new to the zombie lore we're all accustomed too as fans. I enjoyed how they used the Harvard scientist to tell us Mother Nature wants to get caught, as she leave bread crumbs on how to defeat her, we just have to be very observant. This was brilliant, especially as it is being said to our lead Gerry (Brad Pitt) who is a retired UN investigator who had keen skills for finding the source of outbreaks because of his observational skills as an investigator. Once these words are uttered you start to see the process in which Gerry thinks and acts in motion, it is hinted at once the outbreak begin in Philadelphia, and almost takes Gerry and his family from us, he watches as zombies attack and turn others and the rate at which they turn is about 10 seconds, which makes this virus more align with Rage from 28 days later, but all health and military folks tell us they are dead people. So it is not a race to save and convert the infected, it is a race to save the remaining humans. When Gerry explains the theory to surviving members of the W H O, they are at first taken back, but once put into a situation where our hero has to be the guinea pig, we learn so much more about how the zombie plague works.Because of these new items introduced into zombie lore, WWZ doesn't feel like the typical zombie films we have watched and enjoyed over the years thanks However, WWZ can't get all praise, the fact zombies only bite someone to infect them leaves us feeling cheated. What we have here is an amped up remake the recent remake of the crazies with a semi-zombie angle as opposed to a tried and true zombie film. Add to it the Brad Pitt family angle is only there to force him out of retirement when the military says either help us or find your own refuge.So we get typical clichés with a mix of something new that helps WWZ become a better film than it should be as a whole. I walked in with Extremely low expectations, but came out thinking, WOW, something new a different, it has flaws but works.I would definitely say WWZ is worth a solid B+ or A--, but until I can see the Blu-Ray in my home and catch whatever I missed in my drive-in experience... my rating stands firm at B+ for now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the preview with my wife during another movie we were like "meh", but I guess I fell into the hype yesterday and talked her into going to see it. Glad we did now. It was a good movie with a very fast paced and with many eye candy action sequences. You have to see it in the theaters.Overall the movie was worth going to see. Brad Pitt did a great job as usual acting. If you like zombies you will like this movie. If you like gore this may not appeal to you. Very well put together movie for the length of time they had to work with. Of course its not like the book. it is "based" on the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a world-sweeping plot reminiscent of Steven Soderberg's Contagion, an intense, kinetic pace tastefully interspersed with snappy dialogue, and a leading man, in Brad Pitt, up to the task of anchoring it all in the realm of suspended disbelief, World War Z may very well be the best modern zombie film yet to grace cinemas.To say it was an arduous task to deliver the movie might be this year's movie-related understatement, and there have been ? and there still remain ? many doubts as to whether or not it would all be worthwhile.Based on the novel, World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War, penned by Max Brooks, the son of comedy filmmaking legend Mel Brooks and actress Ann Bancroft, the movie's script went through several difficult and drastic alterations before filming wrapped in October of last year. Initially adapted in 2008 by sci-fi and comic book scribe J. Michael Straczynski, the screenplay went through a complete overhaul by Matthew Michael Carnahan, whose debut film, The Kingdom, delivered the kind of politically-infused action Paramount Studios and Pitt's production company, Plan B, were looking for.FOR THE REST OF THE REVIEW, PLEASE GO TO: http://tuffgnarl.com/world-war-z-review/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Zombie movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big Fan of horror movies and I see them all with great affection; released or not in India... Zombie movies are not as horror as 'Japanese ladies walking in white with long hairs' or 'American tooth-fairies'. However there are only few well-thought-of zombie movies like Shawn of the dead and Zombieland. Problem with others is limited budgets... A Decent budgeted zombie movie is always a good one.... World War Z is a good flick. The actions are great. Screenplay is gripping... Zombies not only can run but also jump in this one. Some of the scenes are breathtaking. I like Brad Pitt as an actor and love his movies. Now this one is also in my favorite list. You will expect it to be good b'coz it comes from a guy who has directed Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland, The Kite Runner, Quantum of Solace etc.etc?.. plZ watch it in 3D to njoy more...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly enjoyed this film. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the film once the action began. It was interesting to see Brad Pitt do something edgy and strong. It made me nostalgic for Interview With a Vampire. There were some parts that I felt dragged along such as the phone interaction between Brad's character and his wife. If my husband calls during a widespread plague, I'm not talking slowly, low or hesitant. I'd have a thousand questions or expect him to give me some useful information. Other than that, I thought it was thoroughly developed, the characters were full and vibrant. I cared about the outcome of the supporting cast, I rooted for humanity. The special effects weren't spectacular but they were believable. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better then it should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z had one of the most notorious and difficult production histories for a blockbuster, being disloyal to the source material having rewrites for its final act and 40 days of reshoots. It had disaster written all over it. But it turned out to be a well-made blockbuster and has more opportunity for a wider scope then most zombie films.Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is a former investigator for the UN who now lives a happy family live in Philadelphia. But in the background are reports of strange events around the world when suddenly America is swamped with zombies and Gerry has to get his family to safety. Gerry and his family get to be on a US Navy ship, but to grantee that they are allowed to stay on the ship Gerry is ordered to investigate the source of the outbreak, leading him on a mission from South Korea, to Israel, to Wales.One of the controversial aspects of World War Z was the fact that it given a PG-13 rating: but whilst the film lacks with blood and gore it is a film that does something no other zombie film could do, show the true scale of the zombie apocalypse. We see the international dimension of what happens and how different countries react and are affected. The director Marc Forster was strong at showing the breakdown of society in different forms, from the initial panic to a quieter aftermath.The opening of the film was well done up until the initial zombie attacks, where Forster relied too much on hand-held cameras and quick cut editing. Of course it was meant to show the panic and confusion of the situation of zombies emerging, but it was more annoying than anything else. Fortunately the sequence in Jerusalem (in reality Valletta, Malta) where the Zombies breach the wall and the Israeli army has to fight them back or being chased in the narrow alleys. You can even look pass the ropey CGI effects that were used.Forster does have a fast paced film for the most part with quieter moments allowed to breath with the final third being a bit slower. There is a find combination of drama and action, but there is a weird undercurrent of dark humour, from a man shooting himself in the head by accident and the actions of some zombies in the World Health Organisation Base. Added to that there seems to be a strange commentary about the Israel-Palestine conflict where the crisis unites the Israelis and Palestinians but their unity ends up leading to their destruction. There is also an even dodgier element where the head of Mossad revealed that the Israelis knew about the zombie outbreak and took actions to safeguard themselves. It could easily be argued that no one would have believed the Israelis, but another way to look at is it could be a commentary on conspiracy theories that Mossad knew about 9/11 and did not tell anyone about it. Or maybe I am reading too much into it.World War Z is very similar to Outbreak and Contagion with Gerry trying to find the source of the virus, with elements of I Am Legend. There are also influences of classic zombie films, like Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later, especially in the third act. Another element World War Z borrows from is Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds, using the idea of the panicking children and more importantly the use of Chinese whispers about how the virus is affecting the world.World War Z is an entertaining film, that is better then it had any right to be. Whilst hardcore horror fans, zombie fans and fans of the novel, it is best treat the film as it is, a global set blockbuster.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Planet of the Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The smell of blood was in the air, and the critics were baying. Production problems, re-writes (including a third act restructuring by premier go-to-guy Damon Lindelof), and a ballooning budget - it spelled a disaster that would have the critics crawling over each other to find the funniest words to describe its dreadfulness. As with John Carter before it, how disappointing it must have been to be presented with a half-decent movie. This is a brisk global thriller with some nifty set-pieces and a dogged determination to tell a straightforward story.I haven't read the source novel by Max "Son of Mel" Brooks, but by all accounts I wouldn't recognise it as the story told in this film. Brad Pitt (also producing) plays Gerry, a former UN worker who's worked in dodgy hotspots like Liberia, who becomes the reluctant saviour of humankind when the planet becomes overrun by "Zees". The zombies are portrayed like ants, bacteria, a Final Reckoning... This is the undead apocalypse in long-shot, which kind of muzzles their menace.Many modern movies feel overlong, but this is one that could do with fleshing out. While Gerry is gallavanting across South Korea, Israel, and, err, Wales, his family is in on a ship in the Atlantic, crying out for more character development. And for Gerry himself, it seems like every time he steps off a plane there's a chase scene waiting for him. Add to this the spoiler-tastic trailer and it all adds up to a cripplingly lack of tension.Tellingly, the best scenes in the film occur at the end, in the enclosed space of a science complex. It's here that the film takes a breath, and it most resembles the simpler, mostly superior zombie runarounds of yesteryear.Saying that, World War Z is a worthwhile addition to the genre. Purists may despair at the lack of gore and the absence of threat (Romero's original Dead series would never have indulged such an impervious and saintly hero), and readers at the departures from the novel. But mostly it should be enjoyed for what it is: a solid, workmanlike action-adventure, moderately original in its style and scope, if not its predictable plot developments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stereotype with a difference.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've not read the book but the movie made me want to give it a glance. The outbreak of an epidemic, an apocalyptic scenario, people running and hiding (the scary parts) and the protagonists searching for a solution; this would be a bird's eye view of the movie, as such a stereotype, but for me it was the details that did the trick, the plot had a certain realism to it (kind of like a serious version of Zombieland) and the execution and acting is good, enough to engage and even make one eager for a sequel.To elaborate, instead of a horde of zombies always chasing people around, there was some sense to the way things played out, how everyday behaviour could become a mistake and a cause of death (like a ringing cellphone when you are hiding from zombies who are sensitive primarily to noise) and how the fortification that kept a city safe could also turn it into a hell-hole. Even the temporary solution to curb the spread seemed sensible also it seemed reasonable that people were given priority (for safe harbour) not on the basis of rank and power but their usefulness in dealing with the situation. The protagonist wasn't a 'live on the edge', 'save all' hero but had practical reasons to risk his life (each time).The acting was good if not stellar (I felt Pitt was too much like Keanu Reeves) and the visual effects were good but not the best. On the whole I found it entertaining and worth the time, a serious (almost) no nonsense thrill ride.</fullReview>

The opening scenes when the zombie plague is starting to infect the populous is chaotic ( In a good way)and builds you up for what is to follow. There are some great moments in the film like on the ship where Gerry tries to say no to helping what's left of the government and they bribe him with the safety of his family.Lots of people will complain about the lack of blood and guts but this movie proves that you don't necessarily need that to build up suspense and get the occasional jumpy scene.

		<fullReview>Gerry Lane, having retired as a UN investigator to spend more time with his family, is caught up in the world-wide outbreak of a plague which transforms anyone bitten into a ravening (and incredibly fast) creature with chewing the unaffected as their top priority. Transferred with his family to an aircraft carrier, the price of their continued safety is that he heads up a mission to take epidemic doctor Guppy from Casualty in search of the source of the outbreak, a journey which takes him to Korea, Jerusalem, and -take a deep breath - Cardiff.I'm not a big fan of zombie movies, but I do love post-apocalypse stories, and this was a good one - I really enjoyed it a lot. After minimal set-up, it jumps straight into the action and never stops. There are those who have said that it is low on gore - it is - and that the structure is unbalanced, with the set pieces early on and the ending rather low key, and there is some truth to this, but neither was a deal breaker for me. I was engaged throughout, on the edge of my seat for much of it, and emotionally invested too.Brad Pitt, at centre stage, does satisfactorily although I find his haircut distracting. The rest of the case, mostly unknown, is also fine, but they are there just to serve a purpose. There are elements which leave you puzzled - David Morse's toothless gun-runner serves little purpose, the Israeli girl soldier is an odd character to bring in for such an extended period, and the zombie pyramid at the Jerusalem wall makes no sense given the number of helicopter gunships circling the area - surely they would at least have raised the alarm? The absence of bad language was very welcome, and the 3D was fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Very Best Zombie Film - EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brad Pitt - what an excellent actor. Normally this should have been just another stupid movie about silly ole zombies. Once you add an actor of Mr. Pitt's caliber, a movie's value tends to increase. That was probably the most brilliant thing the producers and director could have done. Sometimes quality actors are not just in a movie, but they become the movie and this is what happened in this case. He made everyone else look good. Like I said - this should have been a dog of a movie. And let's face it, lately, I have seen some real dogs?including one of steel?which actually left me expecting very little from this flick. Boy was I wrong. Pass me the ketchup and brains ? this movie was fun ? well directed ? funny ? high tempo ? no dead spots - everything you would want from an action movie. Also, there was no political undertones ? no hidden meanings ? no slowing of pace ? no rigid acting ? no self-reflections - no pontifications - this is stuff not needed in any movie. I was losing hope in Hollywood, they seemed incapable of turning out anything other than political dribble. This movie was some kind of redemption. I feel this movie was well worth the time and well worth the money no rust on this steel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting Cliff Notes Adaptation of Novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I really liked it, and I am grateful to the producers for omitting the grisly stuff. The blood-curdling shriek of these zombies was still ringing in my somewhat shaky ears an hour after I left the theatre; I didn't need to see human gore dripping from their mouths as well every time I closed my eyes.I am about two-thirds through the novel and can verify the objections of those who say it departs significantly from its source material, but so what? I recall the famous author who, when asked how he felt about what Hollywood had done with his books, waved his hand at his library wall and replied, "Hollywood hasn't done anything with my books--they're all right there." Besides, the novel begins with the conceit that it is not the "official" report of the war historical commission--the overarching narrative--but rather, a collection of oral narratives of various survivors from around the world. Hence one can approach the movie with the view that Gerry Lane's (Brad Pitt) story is just one of them, although one that turns the conflict in favor of humanity. Or, think of it as the Cliff Notes version. Either way, see the movie for the thriller it is (oh boy, is it!), then read the novel for a collection of other survivor stories and the sort of detail that could not be adapted to a cinematic structure.Were I to quibble, I'd rather the movie had not diverged so far as to have borrowed the 12-second bite-to-zombie transformation from 28 DAYS LATER. There are few known toxins that work that quickly, let alone any virus, which has to commandeer the DNA of a cell and reproduce itself in order to take over the host organism. But I rather liked the war-changing discovery that the screenwriters invented just for the movie in the retrofitted third act. It's a doozy.</fullReview>

Myself on the other hand is an average PC gamer who once in a while like a good movie! kinda like T2 or Aliens? i wont spoil your need for wanting to watch the World War Z but what i will say is after it was completed the Director realized he had in fact made many "Boo Boos" in the film's dialogue &amp; had to get almost all the cast back to Scotland where it was filmed, They then corrected errors and this is where we are today! the film is a little slow BUT lets not forget this was never going to be a T2 or a Die-hard? its more about the story &amp; what would happen if it REALLY well.."Happened"? the film cost $200.000.000 to make and when you consider Avengers in 2012 cost just a mere $20 million more it gives you the feeling its going to be a solid film! &amp; it is!!!! Don't listen to the people who gave it a negative review? they must of watched too many Fast and furious films? its not an action film? it never claimed to be and it never will be? go and see it and see for yourself! as we all know the game "WarZ" has strong similarities to it BUT the game failed at the beginning, this wont fail as it keeps you watching and thinking! hope this helps?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These Cannibals are Quick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What You Should Know ? These are not the slow-strolling-down-the-street zombies of yester-year. These cannibals are quick! And ready to rip into you faster than you can say World War Z. They can climb skyscrapers, take down helicopters, and even break into secure hospitals if there's an ounce of blood nearby. As expected they spend the first thirty minutes of the movie destroying the most significant cities (i.e. New York, Washington D.C. ? any place that has a well-known landmark) and its Brad Pitt's job to bring the epidemic to an end.What Works ? His long beard and even longer mane makes Pitt completely believable as a United Nations investigator. He's not a typical action hero. His mission isn't to save the world- just preserve what's left of humanity.What Doesn't Work ? The wife and kids. Every man needs something to fight for but these people aren't it. Mireille Enosase doesn't have the sexiness and strength necessary to play Pitt's wife. And Sterling Jerins and Abigail Hargrove are two complaining kids that would barely survive middle school let alone the apocalypse. Angelina Jolie and their third-world adopted kids would have endured the zombie epidemic with no problems.What I Thought ? Worth the Admission World War Z is worth the admission. Its action/drama/horror sequence is all the genres mixed into one and makes this summer movie so intense. Is it typical? Yes. A virus breaks out unexpectedly. Lots of people run and scream, some die, others are turned. There are aerial-shots of all the usual tourist attractions and in the end it's the race to find a cure. But still it's a fun and scary journey worth taking a tour to see ? at the very least worldwide zombies are more fascinating than the domestic ones you've seen before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AAh well 'Mr Pitt' returns with this mega budget Zombie action movie which is nearly perfect. People are complaining that the movie lacked some 'Zombie Violence' . It lacked scenes like " a zombie ripping apart someones intestines and stuff". Well folks , don't compare it with movies like 28 Days later , 28 Weeks later or the Walking Dead. It is not a movie based on a small group which is thriving for survival . There's a GLOBAL SCENARIO here. Population loss is in billions . They could not have possibly shown those kind of bloody scenes and such scenes would not even suit this kind of a story or a plot. The movie was dam good and very intense right from the moment it started. The background score added to the intensity of the movie. The 3d effects were superb . A very engaging movie. Loved the zombies &lt;3.The climax could have been better and characters more nicely introduced.The movie could have been more better if Pitt's character was given a certain qualities . Means that in the movie he was a simple guy . Not a 'braniac scientist' or a 'macho man' or an ex-Navy Seal who has a way with guns. This could have worked upon.But overall the movie is a must watch entertainer. Good Work !!! (y)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The is the scariest movie I have seen in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie worked and moved in a class all on its own. It brings the concept of zombie movies up to a serious point, the way Dark Knight elevated comic book movies into a serious realm. I want to start of responding to some points made by others. To start with, trying to compare this with other zombie movies borders on a bad idea. This may indeed be yet another zombie movie, but it takes the idea of zombie apocalypse to a whole new level. And also offers something all the more precarious that none of the others have really ever put forward, hope. I have noticed people trying to compare it to 28 Days Later. This is an immense mistake for one major reason. 28 Days Later is not a zombie movie. It seems like one but in reality none of the infected are dead. Not zombies. As far as Brad Pitt being in this, to be quite honest I was skeptical. I couldn't picture Brad Pitt fighting zombies and taking him seriously. He surprised me. He did an amazing job in this movie. Far better than people have given him credit for. Despite what many others have said, the zombies are actually quite realistic. Though when moving in mass (you will see in Jerusalem) you can tell there is CG involved it doesn't take away from it. Especially when seeing them up close. The make-up easily rivals Walking Dead. As far as the athleticism of the zombies, that can be easily explained. They are not limited by pain. Nearly every human body is capable of great speed, strength, agility, and dexterity. What stops us from doing all of those things, is pain, and our own sense of exhaustion. Take away the ability to feel pain, to get tired, to need air and food, and you have an unstoppable machine. Give it a single minded determination and you have a World War Z zombie. In an interview someone said that the zombies in this movie are treated as if they were, "a force of nature." They succeeded. The misfortunes you see that occur through out the movie, are so realistic and possible you can almost feel the doom to yourself proceeding each event. This not only leads showing great acts of selflessness and courage but also deplorable acts of cowardice and stupidity. I loved that this didn't rely on super amounts of gore. Modern horror movies no longer rely on suspense, surprise, and that adrenaline rush that leaves you nearly hyperventilating for the hero. Nope, just blood, and guts, and the biggest shock value possible. This movie doesn't leave you feeling like your popcorn is going to make a repeat performance. It gives you an adrenaline rush. One thing people also always talk about is the fact that zombie apocalypse couldn't happen. But the reality is that it could. All it takes is a virus, a single virus, and everything is possible. That sounds crazy, but new virus' are found all the time, develop and evolve all the time. Someone points out that zombies are such an improbable possibility, that unless some is saying, "what if it it possible?" then there is no hope for survival. Though I do not get where anybody would get the ludicrous concept that this movie is even remotely sexist, I guess everybody has to find a PC controversy to make themselves feel better. The need for Brad Pitt's character to emotionally develop throughout this movie is almost cliché. His character didn't need to emotionally develop, he needed to intellectually develop, which he did. To say that everything was felt and only impacted skin deep, completely misses the fact that zombie apocalypse isn't the place for emotional growth, and wasn't paying attention to how things played out between Gerry and many of the other characters. Now after this bit by bit response to other complaints, let me say this. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat (and many others in the theater as well, the only reason I noticed was because the guy behind my husband came close to falling off his seat and into my husbands lap.) I never hide my face during horror movies, but I did through this. It scared the heck out of me, and yet it left me contemplating. This is, without a doubt, the best zombie movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

True, it's not an in-your-face gory / blood and guts zombie movie, but that's all been done already! It's quite refreshing to watch a zombie movie that isn't just all about ripped body parts. The story line may be simple, and perhaps rather predictable, however the movie doesn't fail to keep your eyes completely glued to the screen and you on the edge of your seat throughout. Don't take to much liquids - the movie is about 2 hours long and you don't want to be missing any of it.Just don't get all critical and start analyzing each frame or asking intelligent questions (yes there were quite a number of questions left unanswered). Definitely worth watching. Just enjoy it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bias: Free-Advanced Screening/ Warry of production woes/ Not having read the source material for comparison.Review: Just like any audience member all that I want is a good return on investment; time wise, money wise or some combination of both. A feature film a film can succeed if its critically acclaimed or commercially successful, but money is usually the bottom line in Hollywood. Fortunately in both cases, my advanced screening of World War Z was free, it wasn't overly long and as a bonus I felt quite entertained.What sells me this film initially as a moviegoer is the mystery surrounding the film both narrative and production wise; and the questions it poses , what is the source of the outbreak? How is this effecting everyone and how are certain countries dealing with it? What is the cure? Is there a cure? What perplexes me as an industry analyst is why certain decisions were made regarding the production of the film. Why, for instance would you hire an indie director with only a little mainstream experience (Quantum of Solace) to direct such a large scale film? Or why on earth would you hire Damon Lindelof to write something that needed an ending? Not all these questions get answered but the film is sufficient enough.There hasn't ever been a zombie film on this scale before so this is something at least slightly new and ambitious. I can't say I respect the choice made for it to be an adaptation in name only because I have yet to read the book, and the original script was so well heralded. At least the political subtext lives on in the original source material, and can be be adapted later into a perhaps better film, that maybe shouldn't be tailor made for a mainstream blockbuster audiences. I wouldn't call this a big dumb zombie movie either as it seems like a cheap oversimplification. Funny enough that is what the movie is in regards to its source material.Brad Pitt tries to help Daniella Kertesz keep it together as he's in over his head at 30,000 feet. There were a lot of compromises made for this film, as evidenced by the script doctor leaving the film, the entire third act being replaced, and various re-shoots. The political subtext is nowhere to be found, and various characters are introduced and never show up again. All this was meant to be done in service of the movie and for the most part works. Each character feels real and two dimensional or is at least interesting, the film is well paced. It isn't glaringly obvious this film has holes unless you decide to sit back and think about it after the film is done. There are no major tonal issues or character defects here, but the film does change direction and speed a bit. I have two gripes about this film; one is the Lindelof trademark of characters either getting caught in stupid situations or making stupid decisions to advance the plot, which isn't as annoying as it was in 'Prometheus' or 'Star Trek Into Darkness' but enough to make you roll your eyes. The other gripe is that because this is a straight-forward action-thriller there is nothing for your brains to feast on afterwards. This is digestible B-Level entertainment.Steven Spielberg and George Lucas recently spoke at a USC conference predicting a film industry implosion. Production companies are spending more and more money on fewer and fewer films, and all its going to take is a few of them to bomb before everything comes crashing down (Say for instance; this film, The Lone Ranger, and Pacific Rim). The problem with this film is that quality wise it is not a great return on investment for it's 200 million+ Hollywood price tag or a $15 theatre ticket for the audience, I wouldn't pay full price for this movie in pointless 3D, but I'm sure a compromise of some sorts can be worked out.Verdict: B/+1/ Worth seeing on cheap Tuesday but not in 3D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well tailored zombie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The maker of this move really understood the ingredients of a good zombie movie, any zombie enthusiast would enjoy. Unlike what most people think, it's not about the gore (which this movie truly lacks in a good way). But it's about the sense of panic, fear, survival, and most of all a sense of safety, shelter, and comfort at times. This movie has it all in the right proportion. The geeks would be satisfied with the sci-fi side of it all. The mystery of the infection, and the subtle but quite fulfilling explanation throughout the movie.The action and visual effect is nothing less than stunning. I was in awe most of the scene.Never in a long time that a movie made me grip the handle of my seats because it's so thrilling. The cinematography, sound effect, and editing made it a roller coaster ride in a theme park.It was definitely money well spent. And I want to own the DVD right away</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was very very thrilling and it kept me on the edge of my seat, making me jump and fidget almost the whole time. it was worth the time and money. it didn't disappoint me at all and it was what i expected to see after i watched the trailer. it is true that this movie is very intense along the way. well some part of it was a bit cliché but it didn't outscore the greatness of it. Brad Pitt was very awesome as always. i just saw it an hour ago and i can't stop thinking about it. it is an apocalyptic end of the world horror film, it is about survival and protecting your family. you would maybe need to hide your face from the scariness during some parts. it was truly awesome though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood failed its audience by forcing on us a PG-Rated Zombie Apocalypse....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie squeezed 5 min of action into 2 hours of movie. Very boring dialog the characters were not explained very much. Jumps around a lot to different time periods. Acting mediocre at best. No chance for academy awards. No explanation connecting Brad Pitt's role with the stale Illuminati message. No explanation regarding his wife and kids. The movie leaves too many lose ends to ponder. I think they are counting on the big gun actor to pull traffic into this movie. All of the exciting parts were shown in the trailer for this movie. We kept waiting for the pace to pick up and it never did. I heard lots of disgruntled comments as people left the theatre, and I noticed a lot of people get up during to the movie to go to the restroom or to get a snack. If you have the patience, and the stamina... it is worth a look, but I'd wait for HBO.</fullReview>

Don't waste your money on this movie.When I saw the trailer I thought it was bad already. I gave it a chance since the book was great, but here are some problems:Bad acting - Brad Pitt is a great actor, but this movie was put together so quickly for the quick cash that it was so disappointing. You cannot get attached to any of the characters on the film.The only reason it will trick people into watching is because it contains Brad Pitt and has the rights to the successful novel.There's a minimum of 10 lines to submit this review, and I'm writing this just to warn people not to watch it. Every bad review will be countered by several good ones from the PR team. If you've seen this movie and agree it's bad please write your review.Bottom line: if you have ever watched Avatar The Last Airbender and was disappointed from the movie adaptation by M Night Shymaladingdong be prepared to experience the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombie Holocaust!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z gained a lot of notoriety from all the rumors of production problems, reedits and expensive re-shoots. From all those negative stories, you would be forgiven for expecting an incoherent vomit of a movie; that it's not only easy to follow, but also well made and gripping is a massive plus. WWZ tells the story of a mysterious global pandemic, the source of which is unknown, but which turns the majority of the earth's population into rampaging zombies. We see the outbreak from the perspective of Gerry (Brad Pitt) and his family, as they witness it first hand while stuck in rush hour. From there, Gerry ? a former government agent - is coerced back into action to find a cure and it is action all the way until the end.You have to admire this movie on many levels. It's supposedly a summer 'tent pole' release ? traditionally a time for family movies - yet, it features lots of zombies running around biting people while getting shot in the process. There are panoramic shots of zombies running amok and the ensuing widespread destruction. And even if the bloodletting and gore levels are appropriately sanitized and restrained for the summer audience, still you have to revel in the joy of an actual summer zombie movie. When has that happened before? When is it likely to happen again?Brad Pitt (looking about 35 here) makes for a solid action hero as he goes through one hellish experience after another. Strangely, he doesn't really have a regular counterpart/sidekick to bounce ideas/dialog off, resulting in a lot of him asking questions on behalf of the viewer. The one time it seems as if he's going to get a sidekick, said sidekick is dispatched rather quickly in an unintentionally amusing fashion ? presumably to give Brad/Gerry more to do. Furthermore, there isn't really the usual secondary subplot to cut to and as such as we see the chaos unfold mostly from his viewpoint. This has the unforeseen consequence of giving the movie a very 'chaptered' form; one-off events ? almost like little mini-stories in their own right - take place in one country after another with their own beginning middle and ending and usually as Pitt the lone protagonist as the witness.The zombie action is excellent and we see suitably large-scale set- pieces of wanton zombie destruction. There is a level of scope and ambition here that you just won't see in something like 'The Walking Dead'. Though it has to be pointed out that those wide vista shots of the zombie hoards building 'ant hills' to scale walls happens only a handful of times in the movie. Even at that, you've probably already seen them in the prevalent trailers, which admittedly takes away some of the 'Wow Factor'.Now onto the aforementioned 'productions problems' and 're-shoots' that littered this movie's gestation. It's hard to evaluate it without taking those 'issues' into account. Why? Because the telltale signs are so evident. The story takes strange turns, focusing on some elements while completely ignoring others. For example, early on in the story, we see Gerry and his family rescuing a young boy ? who we assume Gerry will semi-adopt and become a surrogate father figure to since his offspring are girls; this is how it seems it's being set up - yet the child is never seen or referred to again.Similarly, Gerry later takes a wounded Israeli soldier under his wing but she is so underwritten and cipher-like, you wonder: what's the point? If that's not enough, then take a high profile actor like Matthew Fox (of Lost); he features early on in the story and you assume he will figure prominently later; instead, he just shows up a handful of times in what could be the role of a background extra and one not worthy of Fox's talents. Just like John Cusack's shorn role in Terence Malicks's 'The Thin Red Line' (1998), what you begin to suspect is that Fox too was a victim of all the re-shoots/re-edits and his arc probably featured more prominently in the earlier version. And if you really want to nitpick, a scene at a facility, while admittedly a stand out that's very well executed, still feels very glued on? almost as if it came from a different movie. Yet another legacy of the re-shoots? Probably? it certainly feels that way.As for the pandemic, a reference is made to rabies early on in the story, then it's never really mentioned again. It's vagueness like this that rears its head again and again. Still, it's not the disaster that had been foreshadowed by some members of the media. Yes, it may feel chaptered but it's an intelligent film ? for a zombie movie, anyway ? that has stuff to say while showing you big spectacle. You really get the impression that this is truly a global pandemic.And that's the one thing this movie has going for it over a lot of movies of the genera: take any of the Romero zombie movies or any zombie movie from the last few decades, and what you find is the action/outbreak is always restricted to small areas/backwater towns. Not so here ? this is the real zombie deal on a massive scale. For the first time ever, you see a zombie apocalypse taking place in cities in populated streets and not just on some back road in the middle of nowhere. But there has to be a trade-off: you can do spectacle or gore but you can't do both. That type of thing costs money, and if you're spending a lot of money, you want your product to be seen by the widest audience possible ? meaning what essentially boils down to a bloodless zombie movie. Still there is enough good material in here to keep you interested and make the idea of a sequel/sequels a not altogether unwelcome proposition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Movie That's Worth Going To See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing I'd like to say is don't listen to these "people" complaining about lack of gore and blood, this might shock some but gore and blood is not needed to make a decent film - unless you're just blood thirsty in which you should mention that or just not bother. Also someone said zombies didn't kill anyone, well the point of the zombies was to spread the virus but I guess some people just don't care.The acting in this film is not bad - again unlike some "people" here - it's not the best but in no way can it be described as bad. I'm not the biggest Brad Pitt fan but I really enjoyed his character as well as the other cast picks.The story is honestly more complex that I had expected, usual Zombie films are very simple and stay around one area, World War Z however covers various locations and never did I have the thoughts of, "God, I'm tired of seeing this place", because anytime that got close the environment changed. I also laugh - or cry - at those mentioning that this is mindless action over story for those with short attention spans, I'm sorry but that is just not true - I could mention various zombie movies just like that though.I know a lot of people were concerned from the trailers that the zombies looked awful being CGI, well, I have to say that in the cinema they were pretty believable for the most part - especially comparing to other CGI I could mention.In the end this is a decent film that does have a consistent developing story that feels authentic and not artificial - something that a lot of movies lack. There is the odd moment like on the plane when Brad Pitt's character is cleaning a severed wound in which the person beside them seemingly doesn't care what was going on, but it's nothing movie breaking at all.Out of the current cinema listings World War Z is worth going to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the world was run by zombies, are you ready to fight and live your way out? My answer is, I haven't thought about it. Encouraged by his children, Brad Pitt stars in this thriller flick, WORLD WAR Z which deals with marathon trained flesh eaters.A rabies like virus is on the loose and its rapidly affecting humanity. Think of it as a biological warfare gone haywire and as a former UN employee, your previous boss and your conscience is dictating you to save not only your family but the also the world. The plot just revolves there but the transition of the scenes, character development and denouement were well executed enough to let you go through the next hour.And since its a zombie film, the thrill factor lets you scream on your seats or curse the characters on screen. It is like watching the pilot episode of THE WALKING DEAD.Although they did not find the perfect solution and the medical aspects were quite obscure, the ending gives the audience hope that they will eventually discover a better antidote later. Now, if you'll excuse me my ginger broth is ready.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As of this review, this film has an unbelievable 7.1 rating. It makes me loose faith in humanity, this rating. This is a movie that is just terrible. Only the star power of Brad Pitt could have moved people to not just walk out of this film. All zombie movies have the same plot really; people become infected with a "virus" and become zombies. The heroes find a way to survive and somehow save themselves. Stop. In this vein, the film is like all the others. The only remarkable feature of this film are spectacular views of tens of thousands of zombies attacking the world's major cities. The zombies themselves are detailed and quite good at being zombies. Only zombies in fact will like this film. Brad Pitt is flat, passive, detached, calm and boring beyond belief. Every actor is disposable. The final scenes where Pitt's character figures out "the answer" is mildly clever. The fact that he is some sort of soldier (we are never clear on just who he is actually) and that he figured what all the world's sciences could not is just not believable. A lot of money was spent on mediocre special effects, almost nothing on acting. It is a plain vanilla zombie film without a single redeeming moment and quite childish. This film demonstrates why famous actors should never be producers or directors.If it has any success it is because it shows us why this is almost always true. That more than one non-zombie human being could have found this film rated above a "1" is just incomprehensible to me. maybe the zombies are already here and writing reviews and making films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If you can fight, fight. Be prepared for anything. Our war has just begun." Gerry (Pitt) and his family start the day like every other day. They wake up, eat breakfast then head off to school and work. That's where the day begins to take a strange turn. When explosions happen and people start running no one is sure what is happening. After given safety Gerry is told he must go and find a way to stop what is fast becoming something that could end the world. I have never really been a fan of zombie movies. I really liked Shaun Of The Dead, but I'm not sure if that counts. I have to say that while the movie was a tad slow in a few parts this is a very good, exciting and fun movie to watch. The one complaint with this movie that I have is that it got a little repetitive, but that didn't really hurt the movie too much and the movie was exciting enough to keep you watching and tense almost the whole time. If you are a fan of zombie movies you will really enjoy this. If you aren't give this a try, I did and I enjoyed it. Overall, one of the best serious zombie movies I have seen. I give it a B+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. All this negativity toward this movie seems to stem from many users' notion that THEY know what a zombie movie "should be" and this movie isn't "it" How do you enjoy ANY movie with such strong preconceived notions of what the movie will be?Complaining about flesh not falling from Zeeks faces? Well, they're not supernatural; they're infected! Mad they jerk and twist and moan rather scream scarily? Well, jerking the head in random patterns seems a logical motion detecting mechanism for a virus. And screaming scarily would startle would-be prey. Mad they chomp their teeth in neutral? The virus spreads by biting...What I'm getting at is I loved what most zombie nerds apparently disliked about Z's Zeeks. They were realistic, natural, designed by nature, functional, NOT MAGIC! They were built for a purpose, SPREAD, and they are designed well for it.Great film, the action is intense and engrossing. All this without gratuitous gore, cursing, or sex? What's not too like (other than the Zeeks aren't "zombies" identical to other portrayals?)Go see it for an intense SciFi thriller starring Brad Pitt.

He also had some pull with his status in the health/government but got no special treatment overall, which made him a normal guy with some status as much middle to high class Americans that have been in school and are intelligent.

Earlier they were very fast like a track star but as the movie went on they seemed to slow down to normal human speed.The acting was good and the pacing of the flick was crisp. I couldn't help but comment on a female actor that stole the screen when she was in it. I am talking about the female Israeli solder that Brad Pitt takes under his wing she has a buzz hair cut but her presence was refreshing. Not a waste of money or time but I was a little disappointed.

		<shortDescription>Rent it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start by saying, rent it.I must admit, it was a nice zombie movie. Liked the cast. Liked the plot. But there were a few issues:1. I hate shaky cam. It's cheap. It's lazy. It's the product of The Blair Witch Project. It sucks.2. I could have done with a lot more War, and a lot less World. I get it, Brad Pitt saves the world. But he doesn't have to travel every square inch of it.3. Stop telegraphing. Seriously, if I can figure out what's going to happen five minutes before it happens, it's not a surprise. You need to put a twist on it.4. The movie sets up dramatic plot points, then wraps up those plot points with a hand wave.That said, it was above average. If you love zombies, the movie has zombie porn. Like Michael Bay loves his dramatic explosions, Marc Forster loves zombies. The waves of zombies. The crashing zombies. The climbing zombies. The twitching zombies. The lurking zombies. Unlike Resident Evil Franchise that just got silly, World War Z treats it's zombies with respect. Visually, I love the zombies.This is the part with the spoilerThe movie ends after what I consider the second act. The movie goes through all this trouble to set up Gerry's love for his family. His family is sent to a refuge camp by some dicks. We are obviously expecting after Gerry finds the immunity serum, to return to base, find his family was shipped off, then go and rescue them from the Refuge Camp as the zombies overrun the place.No zombies. The obvious thrilling conclusion is hand waved. It's like they ran out of budget or something. Immune Gerry running around, fighting zombies who ignore him while they try to eat his children. Kill his wife. Kill the kids. Or just make us THINK they are going to die. ANYTHING! I mean, Brad Bitt just figured out how to become invisible to zombies, take advantage of that and start to rack up the body count! Take a page from Zombieland and let Brad Pitt get his Gun-Fu on.Your third act's thrilling conclusion is a dramatic walk down a hallway? Seriously?So, that said, if you like zombie porn, go watch. If you are like most zombie fans and have ADD, then the director's inability to get the movie moving will drive you insane. Well, at least he didn't dwell on the obligatory Norman Rockwell picturesque life that you have to witness before the zombies show up. I think this would be better as a TV series. It's obvious the director wants to dwell on details that would be interesting, if we gave a crap about anything but zombies.In short, hire this guy for The Walking Dead. He'd be perfect. A movie with a two hour running time obviously wasn't enough time to show everything the director wanted, or the time needed to fit in the dramatic conclusion the movie so needed.P.S. If you introduce that a child has asthma at the start of a movie, then it needs to become a pressing issue later. It's like Chekhov's Gun. If you mention it in the first act, you need to have the gun go off in the second or third act. Otherwise, why is it hanging there?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went and watched this movie in theaters yesterday on 6/21/2013. I Was pretty excited about this film from what had been elucidated to me in the trailers. I have to say that if you're going to see this movie, be prepared for a of The Walking Dead and I Am Legend.One of the things that was nice about this movie is that there wasn't ever a moment of sluggishness in this film. There was always intriguing and exciting action that kept me the edge of my seat. There wasn't any boring filler, all fairly realistic (as realistic as a zombie movie gets) action. While the special effects of this movie were great, there is one thing that I didn't like. What wasn't desirable about this movie is just how fast and ravenous these zombies were. I mean ravenous is expected, but these zombies made it so that the humans couldn't do anything to stop them. My and I would hope others perception of the zombie apocalypse would be that at least humans could fight back against the zombies, but no, the zombies straight wrecked everyone. Which brings me to another facet in the plot that I adored. The resolution of this movie was great. Instead of a mainstream kamikaze finish where a "brave" group of zombie fighters goes out to finish off as many zombies as possible, the movie finished with a creative intelligent resolution, and leaves the humans in the running for a hopeful survival. I left out the resolution because I want you to go see this movie! World War Z is a great zombie thriller wrapped in good special effects, and great acting. If you haven't seen it yet, now's the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The End of The World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brad Pitt, the action hero, saves the world!! or Does he? "World War Z" is a tense thriller which benefits from a constant sense of doom. We want humanity to save itself from this pestilence, but it looks pretty grim. In fact, the solution might also spell the end for all humans.There are plenty of great scenes here, all the way from intimate moments between Pitt and his family to some moments that can easily qualify as epic disaster takes. There is something incredible about the masses of zombies going on a rampage trying to satisfy their hunger for human flesh. The scenes in Jerusalem are among some of the best in a movie. I wonder how much of it was CGI and how much was real extras. I would like that it was the latter.Pitt is on a crusade to find patient zero and save the world, but this is an almost impossible task, and the obstacles are immense. If the zombies are not stopped, it is over. After an incredible segment involving a desperate attempt to save himself during a flight, he conveniently crashes nearby his goal. The problem is that infection is rampant there, too, and the only way to get to a solution is through risking their own lives. I had flashes of "Alien" and some of those amazing Scott films where suspense was king, and gore took a backseat. For instance, that's what makes this a special movie. It doesn't disrespect the audience and lets us enjoy the possibilities. The hero might or not survive, and that's just the way things are. David Morse makes an interesting appearance playing a slightly demented character, and he brought back feelings of paranoia and madness which were all over the other movie where Pitt and Morse costarred, "12 Monkeys", and this might foreshadow a rather downbeat ending.It must be recognized that Pitt is a star, a man who wears his mileage with pride and is relatable. We cheer him on because he feels real and human. He is one of us. Will there be a sequel? If the film makers are true to the spirit of the film, this is the end, or is it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My family and I really enjoyed it. I had concerns before seeing it since I read a lot of the articles about the hurdles. But what a payoff for us!I never imagined it to come across so visually enthralling as the way you (Brad) and everyone who worked on it over the last two years have been able to put up on the screen. I understand everyone has different tastes, but this is a dish I will be going for seconds on...more like twelve helpings (good countdown scene) ;)Hoping the best for this title!P.S. Marc Forster did a good job from what I saw. The shaky cam was less intense and this worked. So whatever happened I'm guessing is hearsay and similar to what almost everybody deals with at work. I don't envy that kind of pressure, but I'll gladly pay for another WWZ. Good job.Came across the original ending after seeing the movie, and man, is it dark, which dark would've been good for this genre, but maybe use it for the sequel. I think the sequel(s) will be more in line with the book: h t t p://www.movies.com/ movie-news/ world-war-z-original-ending/ 12638?wssac=164&amp;wssaffid=newsThe Resident Evil movies don't hold a candle to this, but the endings are always big. Would've liked a cliffhanger for an ending to maybe keep that adrenaline going.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm actually glad it wasn't like every single other zombie movie out there with torn up bodies and gore everywhere, and I really like how they chose to make them fast because it was something different from what we have been getting recently. It added a layer to the movie that really doesn't exist in other zombie movies. Honestly if you are a huge fan of the book...just try not to compare them as you probably will be disappointed. But if you just want to see an intense action movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat for some good entertainment, I highly recommend this movie as it was really well done. I thought this movie would be terrible from the trailers and i was extremely surprised with how it turned out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great Zombie flick that surpasses that f which it is based on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z is probably one f the most tame zombie films you will ever see. This does not mean it is bad. No sir, no. In fact the lack of gore compliments this film, adding an air of realism, allowing the film t focus on a meaningful plot.I've read a lot of negative reviews for this film &amp; all I have to say to those negative reviewers is 'Stop being so nit picky! You have no actual cases to support your view! Stop complaining about it not being gory! This is not the Walking Dead! Its meant to be about plot not gore!' Moving past my rant this movie has excellent cinematography &amp; some superb acting from Brad Pitt. I only have three issues with this movie &amp; two of them are minor. For one I was a little bit disappointed at the movie's soundtrack (it was not as exhilarating &amp; dramatic as portrayed in the trailers). My second issue was the with the zombies (another audio issue); the noises they made were to un-human in that they didn't sound like any noise a human could or would make (even if they were dead). My only major issue with World War Z is that it is nothing like the book; it doesn't use any characters or vents from the book, which I can overlook considering that I find the movie much better than the book.As a screen adaption of the book by Max Brooks World War Z is meh but as a movie it is immersive, well acted, well scripted, well filmed &amp; well written. In all honesty you cannot compare World War Z the movie, to World War Z the book, as they are two very different peaces of literature, each with it's own merits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me say that this movie could be a 10 easily, but a few things make me give it a 9.First, If you are a Zombie fan, then this movie you will love.... love a lot. Cinematography is amazing, the acting is fantastic (which is usually my most common beef with a good written movie), the story itself is awesome and the pace of the movie is top rated.The down side..... PG-13. It hurt the movie regarding violence, blood shed, gore, and profanity. Too many (possible) violent scenes were left to the imagination of viewers on what it looked like. Little to none profanity???? I would be throwing F Bombs every minute if this were real lol R Rating with a UR on Blu Ray would make this movie a 10. Hoping the Blu Ray release has a R or UR rated version.If there is a movie you would want to see in the theater, you HAVE to see this one. Near Perfect Zombie movie without a doubt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looks like the Zombie genre is growing up. This movie goes beyond the usual blood and gore and individual heroics (Resident Evil series), to the next level. Brad Pitt is convincing in his role. But the story isn't cohesive, there is no sense of urgency in the whole movie. It doesn't build any palpable tension as the movie progresses. All in all, it could have been a truly great movie.And I can't figure out how this movie could have a $200M production budget. There isn't much of "action" that shows a well spent $200M (like in the Michael Bay Transformer movies). On a lighter note, if it were the US army/CIA and not the UN, this movie could have been made with $50M instead of $200M.</fullReview>

Don't listen to the people complaining about the movie I loved it. Well worth a $11 movie ticket. Will end up in my favorite zombie movies. Ain't gonna give away any plot cause the trailers gave away to much as it is. Lastly people need to learn how to rate. 5/10 isn't a good film. That means it is garbage. 6/10 is a decent film. 7/10 is a good film. 8/10 is fantastic film. 9/10 is a classic movie.

		<shortDescription>Z For Zombies. A for Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw the trailer at the Man of Steel's premier last week. It WHOA-ed me enough to buy the tickets 2 days before the screening. World War Z is the mother of virus-spreading-zombie film! Less than 5 minutes after the intro credits, the action already begins. No slow introduction, no rubbish talks. From New York streets to New Jersey apartment to Pyeongtaek military camp to Jerusalem fortress to Belarusian airplane to Welsh WHO facility, trust me, you will be GLUED to the screen, because the action are non- stop. Quoting my pal Fairuz, "there's no resting while watching this film". Your adrenaline rushes, anticipating and dreading of what would happen next.Salute to Brad Pitt for giving splendid performance as the (retired) UN- special-officer. The Pepsi-drinking scene is quite cool. After surviving the holocaust in the US soil, he's given the task to protect a promising-young virologist Dr. Fassbach in searching for the cure, the vaccine of the pandemic. Little did they know, what awaits them in South Korea. Didn't recognize any of the other cast, except for the WHO doctor, whom triggered my usual "who the heck is this dude/chick? So darn familiar!" sense. Later found out that he acted in Angels &amp; Demons and Narnia.The zombies look real enough. Have the standard of rabies-infected- people like in Rec. They're vicious and fast and? intelligent too. They react to something and they refuse to something. I won't spoil that. But I just gotta say this: the piling up to overcome tall fences is pretty sickening! I never thought Zombies could that. That's why I said, the Zombies in WWZ are smarter, than their cousins in Resident Evil or Dawn of the Dead. World War Z is like the fusion of Contagion, 28 Days Later, Dredd, Rec and Resident Evil. You enjoyed those films? Well, you certainly will LOVE World War Z then. Even if you haven't watched them, you would still be entertained.Verdict: Satisfaction-GUARANTEED! ;D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw World War Z last night, pretty good action flick but not a "Zombie" movie in the sense that I am accustomed to. Its PG13 rating was obvious, little to no blood. No head shots and seldom a fleshy bite. This movie would have been much better if it were rated "R" and Tom Savini did the special effects. Story line was believable and pretty well written. Acting was above average and cinematic special effects were very good. They delayed the original opening date to re shoot the ending. I'd like to see what original ending was like, this ending was a bit of a letdown but not a deal breaker. All in all I'd rate this a 6 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a traditional zombie flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw World War Z. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it after the bad early reviews but I thought it was really pretty good. It's not a traditional zombie movie at all?the zombies are more like an unstoppable, crashing wave and there's very little gore at all?it's distant or implied. The diving, leaping zombies require a little suspension of disbelief to be scary. My son said it looked like they'd been infected with CGI which is quite a good way to put it. That said, if you accept the basic silliness of gravity defying, climbing zombies (if you've seen the trailer you know what I mean) then you can enjoy it. There's plenty of suspense and the up-close-and-personal zombie encounters are rather creepy without being too horrifying. If you like zombies with mouths full of flesh and sinew, or chewing on handfuls of intestines you should go somewhere else for your gore fix. This is an *almost* family friendly zombie flick. If you to strap in for a bit of an action adventure ride with some well done, large-scale "battle scenes" then you might enjoy this.*mild spoilers* If you've read the excellent book be warned that this movie bears very little resemblance to it. They clearly intend to make a sequel (or sequels) and if they do (box office willing) then it might approach some of the scale of the novel. I hope they do because I'd rather like to see some of the stuff they hint at right at the end (Muscovites with flame throwers?yeah!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to create a profile on here just so I could write a review for this movie. Absolutely loved it.I have two biases you should be aware of: 1) I have a man-crush on Brad Pitt, and 2) I love the zombie movie genre. That being said, I have seen lots of zombie movies over the years, and many failed to keep my attention. This was not one of those movies.If you want lots of gore, blood, profanities and a movie that feels like an indie-film, you won't like this adaptation. If you want a genuine good zombie movie that will make you jump (at least in the 3d version i watched), tense up unknowingly and say to yourself several times "Man, this is good!", go see World War Z.I really liked it, and will likely spend another $25 to see it in theater a second time.Just my two cents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the best zombie film since George A. Romero's classic 'DAWN OF THE DEAD'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'WORLD WAR Z': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)'WORLD WAR Z' is probably the best zombie film since George A. Romero's 1978 classic 'DAWN OF THE DEAD', despite it's PG-13 rating (the film should have been rated R but the studio bought a commercial friendly rating for it). Romero was a big influence on the writer of the book it's based on, of the same name, Max Brooks. The book 'World War Z' is a 2006 sequel to Brooks' popular 2003 hit 'The Zombie Survival Guide'. It's a collection of different characters' accounts of a ten year zombie war and what follows. The movie deviates quite a bit from the book and centers on a retired U.N. agent (played by Brad Pitt) that travels around the world looking for a way to stop a zombie apocalypse. It was written by Matthew Michael Carnahan (who also wrote the political thrillers 'STATE OF PLAY', 'LIONS FOR LAMBS' and 'KINGDOM') and J. Michael Straczynski (who's well known for creating the popular sci-fi TV series 'BABYLON 5' and the comic book 'Rising Stars'). Two of the best writers in Hollywood, Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof (who both wrote over thirty to forty episodes of the immensely popular TV show 'LOST'), rewrote the entire third act of the film. With all that talent attached to writing the script you know you're going to get something good! Marc Forster (director of 'MONSTER'S BALL', 'FINDING NEVERLAND', 'STRANGER THAN FICTION' and the 2008 Bond film 'QUANTUM OF SOLACE') directed the film. The result is nothing short of spectacular!Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a retired U.N. investigator who is now a stay-at-home dad as the film opens. He's stuck in traffic in Philadelphia one day, with his wife Karen (Mireille Enos) and two daughters (Abigail Hargrove and Sterling Jerins), when the world suffers a zombie outbreak. Gerry and his family survive the night, on the run, and make it on to a roof top where they're rescued by Gerry's former employers. He's then asked to go back to work and travel the world looking for a way to stop the zombie pandemic before it wipes out all life on the planet. Realizing his family won't survive if he refuses Gerry reluctantly complies.The film is a masterpiece of the horror genre. It's also the first zombie film to take it's subject matter this seriously (since maybe Romero's early work) and portrays it (for the most part) realistically. Some fans of the book hate that it strays so far from it's source material but if you look at it just as a film inspired by a book (rather than the book in movie form) you should be able to enjoy it more. Even the author, Brooks, said Stracynski's last draft of the script was "amazing" and 'Aint it Cool News' claimed the film could have many arguing "whether or not a zombie movie qualifies as 'Best Picture' material"! I doubt it will be nominated for best picture but I agree it should. It's taken the horror genre, and zombie films in general, to new heights in respectable filmmaking. The filmmakers compare it to the 'Bourne' movies but I think it's even better. It works as a political thriller, an exhilarating action film and a creepy and disturbing monster movie. Pitt makes a great 'thinking man's action hero'; he rarely ever fights or uses a gun but instead thinks his way through every situation. All of the characters are intriguing and there's great cameos from the likes of David Morse and Matthew Fox (in a very small part). The film is full of great suspense, fast paced action, spectacular visuals and cool zombie moments (and the zombies look and act great). Forster's directing is more than adequate but once again it's the four grade A writers that really make the film work. It's full of good plot development and amazingly clever dialogue (with lines like "Mother Nature is a serial killer"). The movie should make George A. Romero proud.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGWqCYOhcJs</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most realistic Zombie outbreak film you'll see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People say it would be cool to see a zombie outbreak happen because they think it would be cool to see, I say watch this film &amp; your change your mind straight away. This film off the bat throws you into an intensely frightening scene of mass panic &amp; horror, World war z is about as real as your going to get a zombie outbreak &amp; is extremely intense and frightening throughout the film. This film really draws you into the story of struggle against an over whelming &amp; fast growing army of zombies around the world. This film is outstanding &amp; is the best zombie film ever, if any one tell you it sucked they lying or trolling the film because this film was cleverly made &amp; showed a realness to a breakout which made it even more frightening because this could happen.A warning if you are faith out heart I would be warned as this film does have a lot of intense moment's that make your heart bounce faster because it not just a zombie film, its a zombie that in your face frightening. It just the beginning story there will be a sequel as there are more than one book to this story. I recommend watching this film if you love zombie films because this doesn't disappoint</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some reason, I was recommended this film by two film aficionado friends of mine, who also came to see it with me.God, what an awful film - doesn't move, doesn't make me feel moved, the camera composition is supposed to make me uncomfortable, which it did, but the story - I couldn't CARE about this bloody film! This guy Brad Pitt is so overrated he must have been laughing at his fans all the time this movie was being watched! I don't get the movie its symbolism and messages but even despite that the movie remains a good and interesting one to watch. Yet at the same time I'm also still constantly thinking; why are you showing me all of this and what are you trying to tell with your story and certain moments. Not to sound too disrespectful but it's a quite pointless movie, since I got nothing out of it and in my opinion also is a movie you can very easily do without.In the end, however, what bothered me the most was the sheer amount of contrived dialogue that was packed into each scene. Real people do not spout off pithy observations of the nature of society at every opportunity. Overall, not a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War Z starts out with a bang. Barely after introducing the main characters you are caught up in their frantic efforts to escape and survive. The movie does an excellent job of making you care about the characters and their plights and drawing you in to the story and action as a result. The pacing is excellent as the story unfolds in an interesting way.My only complaint is that movie is over quite suddenly and feels very anti-climatic. This is not the ending I expected or even wanted for this film. Although the destination may have been disappointing the journey surely was not so I can genuinely recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>memorable action, moderate scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What more can we do with zombies? From its low budget thriller roots, we have seen the undead in comedies, westerns and even romance. World War Z however has what no zombie movie has ever got- get a mega-star to globe trot the world, spend gazillions in special effects and scary 3D, in short give it blockbuster status. Is that a good thing? Mostly so, because World War Z is a great action movie, but unlike what fans of the genre absolutely cannot do without- it is not scary enough, it is not gory enough.Based on Max Brooks' apocalyptic novel by the same name, it kind of deviates from the book which essentially is a 'commentary on government inabilities, corruption and human short sightedness. Brad Pitt acquired the rights to make a film version of the same, and converted it into a USD 250 million summer blockbuster replete with massive CGI and the usual "white man saving the world"theme. The start is awesome- at a traffic jam in Pittsburgh, Gerry Lane (Pitt) and his family have their first encounter with the zombies, who in turn are not like any other zombies seen before. They do not amble aimlessly. They turn within seconds, and know how to work together. They are an animalistic, feral lot- running, leaping and snarling. The violence hits searingly fast, although to get a PG13 rating, much to my dismay, there is no actual zombie chomping flesh, or for that matter, any blood on screen. The infection spreads across the globe with lightning speed and the only safe places it seems are the warships. To keep his family safe, Lane has to traverse the world to find a cure to the pandemic. All this global traipsing gives ample opportunities for the mega bucks to show. And show it does in some style- the zombie mountain shots as they overrun Jerusalem's mighty walls is incredible, as is the manic infestation sequence in the airline and the tense climax in a W.H.O center. The movie revolves around Brad Pitt, who plays an everyday superhero- he is resourceful, brave, unpretentious and driven. Everybody else is a placeholder, including Pitts on screen better half Mirielle Enos in her first big budget appearance. Director Marc Forster manages to create a panicky mood, and the changing face of humanity in face of unprecedented calamity. His job was to make R rated fare into PG13 impactful and that he does as well as one could.To sum up, this is a zombie flick for the masses, not zombie movie fans. Fans of the genre might be disappointed at the lack of blood and bones, they would be better off with Romero, Boyle or any episode of The Walking Dead. But for people seeking action set pieces with memorable special effects, this one is right up there with the years' best- 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was worth seeing, but was it worth making?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailers for World War Z, I thought, "Seriously? More zombies?" Just when I thought the genre had been done to death. I figured the TV series The Walking Dead pretty much capped it. Can't get much better than that for a zombies-are-taking-over-the-world scenario, not because there is anything about the zombies that hasn't been done before, but because The Walking Dead is a very well scripted survival series with an excellent cast playing well developed characters.I honestly had not read the novel on which this movie was based, itself a sequel. And I was quite surprised that there was a bidding war over the rights to it. Could it be really that different from everything else? Well, it's not remarkably different. There is nothing particularly unique about these zombies, or in the story. They have their own particular spin, and set of rules. They bite, and that spreads some kind of disease. Seen that before. They're quick. Seen that before too, but I think this is the most tireless I've ever seen them portrayed.But they aren't technically zombies... That is, you don't have to die first, and they don't seem to be "eating" people, just biting them. It's more like a super-virus with zombie-like characteristics, infecting people extremely fast (within seconds), while they are still alive. Once zombified, the victim exerts energy that would make the world's greatest athletes jealous. They are fast, tireless, feel no pain or emotion, somewhat strong, and really hard to "kill." There is also a way to walk among the zombies without being attacked, which is slightly unique. In some zombie movies you just have to act like a zombie, or disguise yourself with zombie stench, but World War Z introduced its own take.At any rate, it's a fast-moving plot with several visually spectacular sequences. Brad Pitt carries the film.As a writer myself, I think the screenplay missed the opportunity to vastly increase tension. They should have kept his family on the brink of danger. Instead, his family was given relative safety. I wouldn't have done that. There is nothing more stressful to a father and husband than to put his children and wife in danger and keep him from helping them. This would have been much more suspenseful and emotionally engaging.World War Z was a fun movie to watch, and while it didn't "redefine" the subgenre, it moved the needle a little bit by creating EXTREME zombie energy. (These guys are DESPERATE to bite people! They reminded me of a blend of army ant and killer bee behavior.) So it was worth seeing, but I have to wonder why it was worth making? Did the genre really need this? Was it worth the risk for Plan B (Pitt's company) to win the bidding war? Not so sure.For Pitt's sake I hope it does well enough for him but I would sure like to sunset the zombie subgenre because I'm getting fairly tired of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not like the book, but still worth a look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really hyped when I first seen the trailer for this movie and then equally bummed out when I saw the amount of bad reviews it was getting. However I gauge all movies by their IMDb rating and 7.something was good enough for me. I'm also a huge zombie fan; books, movies, games, recurring dreams, etc.Despite what some reviews have said, this movie has plenty of action, in fact it's almost non-stop. Maybe not as gory as some might have expected or hoped for (me included), but that doesn't stop the zombies or "zekes" from providing plenty of tense moments and scares. For me the story was reminiscent of the movie Outbreak, with Gerry (Brad Pitt) traveling from location to location in search of patient zero, while having to deal with hordes of the walking, running, climbing and flying dead at every turn. Of course, this movie is not perfect - for me the lack of gore was a bit of a let down. I mean, you would expect to see at least one or two scenes where the z-heads are tearing chunks out of some poor sucker. The story was also a little sketchy in parts and relies heavily on Brad Pitt to carry you through, but in my opinion it is still well worth a look if you can afford the ridiculous price of a ticket, large popcorn, coke and nachos....with extra cheese and jalape?os.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film without any high expectations and I must say, What a movie. No where near perfect but this film had some amazing scenes in it. Not just cheap special effects, I mean you can really tell they closed a lot of streets for this film. The opening scenes were fantastic. The zombies were okay, reminded me of the zombies in I am legend. The scene's in Israel were also fantastic and shot so well. I was also very impressed with Brad pitt's acting. However the ending wasn't so good, they could have ended it much better and there could of been a bit more action in the film. Overall this film was a good surprising summer action film. And not being the perfect movie, with the ending it shows that there's much room for improvement if we were to see a sequel.I was going to give this film a 3&amp;1/2 star rating, but when I think back to the amazing opening scenes, this film deserves a rating of4 Stars out of 5. (8/10)*However if your a fan of the book, you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

Now all of a sudden the acting in Zombie films needs to be award winning and an in depth plot driven masterpiece? ROFL! I love it when reviewers try to compare it to Zombie movies that have already been done! IT'S Dead People running around attacking living people, how original is it going to be? Give me a break folks! What it really boils down to I think, is a lot of die hard Zombie movie fans were expecting a gory head splitting flick and came up empty.REVIEW: My wife, daughter and I went and saw it last night not expecting anything earth shattering seeing as we were going to see a Zombie movie. The movie was fast paced, had a lot of action and for the most part it was a very interesting movie. The acting was good and there are several heart felt moments in the movie. If you have your heart set on seeing a gore fest typical Zombie flick you might want to find another movie. There is a PG13 rating for this movie so it is tame in comparison to a lot of other movies in this genre.

		<shortDescription>Entertainingly silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summer blockbuster + Brad Pitt. Heh, that's all I need to know. I'm in. From the apocalyptic vision presented on the poster, I thought it would be a disaster movie or a science fiction adventure. Imagine my surprise then when I found that I was attending my first zombie movie. Maybe I should have known this earlier, but maybe the former United Nations investigator played by Pitt should have known something was up with the world before he took his family driving in downtown Philadelphia where suddenly all hell lets loose. I'm glad I opted for the 2D rather than the 3D version. 'I can only take so much of zombies.It's a really good opening and the pacing is then well done with lots of racing around the world and scary encounters interspersed with periods to catch one's breath, but the final resolution of the crisis is lame and very oddly located in Cardiff of all places.The film is capable of all sorts of political interpretations. The United Nations - especially its agency the World Health Organisation - is presented in a favourable light which is a counter to the US Republicans who seemed to think the UN is a secret vehicle for world domination. Israel is portrayed as sensibly building a wall against the zombies which can be seen as endorsement for the wall around the West Bank. The solution to the 'war' - which is really a pandemic - is scientific rather military which might be a call for less dependence on force to solve world problems. The zombies themselves - innocent humans who are slaughtered without hesitation or thought - could be a metaphor for Islamic fundamentalists or even all Muslims. Or maybe this is just a well-crafted, but ultimately somewhat silly, zombie movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>7.5 Great action suspense thriller, lacking the horror aspect of it. "No real major spoilers just don't wanna be black listed""</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World war Z is based on a book that covered over 30 different encounters with "Zombies." Though there is only a few scenes that cover a story or two from the book its truly just based on the story of one family with the father an ex-united nations investigator looking for a way to contain and stop the outbreak. If your looking for a horror movie with tons of zombies then this isn't it. The "Zombies" are just rabies infected creatures that are pretty funny at times. There is absolutely zero blood pools of victims being eaten alive let alone attacked. Just a little bite and they move on to the next person. The movie does keep you at the edge of the seat for most of the movie with a good amount of comedy that will get the theater laughing. If your looking for great suspense thriller that won't scare you but still keeps you interested with great action scenes then buy your ticket now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Wrinkles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer so was looking forward to this film for a long time. Saw it tonight in 3d. I heard a few friends mention the critics were panning the film. A good sign because i am getting annoyed with negative reviews where critics need to define their self importance. I loved the film. Yeah it was a roller-coaster blockbuster heavy with action and CGI and cliché subtext about Israel,family values and the fears of globalization blah blah who cares. Brad was A***. He owned the screen and was in my view his best performance since fight club. Better than i am legend because the mystery narrative kept us on tight on the journey to find out where this would go. The solution was clever - yeah there were flaws - okay the zombies respond to sound so lets all sing comb ya my lord as loud as we can - these were tiny flaws -who cares. Watching Brad on the 100 foot screen in HD 3d and extreme close suddenly made me conscious that- oh my god look at those wrinkles under his eyes. But then i though yes. He looks great. Thank god he does not get it fixed. The line look great - he looks great. Where we used to wait to see his 6 pack boring now i like to that face - its called character. Hopefully other A stars will learn and stay away from the nip and tuck crew who destroy character and begin realize that you can look good older - with wrinkles and look really cool. My only critics of the film is the ending. It felt rushed - and did not allow the audience of the satisfaction of solving the ,mystery -IE how did the virus start - whats the cure. if i were to make the film i would have taken him to India - ground zero - and made some clever connection with some made made testing by a pharmaceutical company that went wrong. residents evil meets omega man but essentially giving the audience information that helps with a vaccine after he discovers the cause. I need my cinematic orgasm - IE closure of narrative not just voice-over at the end. But much better than war of the worlds- love Spielberg greatest director on planet but he was having an off day when he made that. Only regret is watching in 3d. Apart from avatar hate 3d as makes films look darker. otherwise 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The second best zombie film ever made, a true masterpiece! The contagion of zombie movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many loyal zombie fans out there, a true legion. This film succeeds where so many zombie films in the past have failed. This film for once, was not a typical rehash of a group of people trying to hold up and survive a zombie apocalypse. This was an excellent story, it was so well written. Yes, its PG13 and you die hard zombie fans out there would love to see people's face get ripped off and ate, or guts being torn out from victims. Lets face it people that is a bunch of bs, you don't have to show people getting eaten alive and ripped apart for it to be a zombie film. This film was extremely intense throughout, there were very little moments where you weren't cringing on the edge of your seat; or do what I do during intense films covering one of my ears with my fingers as I am trying to watch the film but look down towards the floor just to anticipate a flinch moment. I loved this film so much, because it was extremely realistic it was not some lame explanation on how zombies became infected. This was not a movie where zombies mysteriously just rise from their graves and start attacking people, no mystery toxin gas or goo, or some random unexplained zombie deciding to attack people. I loved how this was written, this is truly the contagion of zombie movies. I have a deep respect for the classic zombie films and George Romero the godfather of all zombie films, those were great and helped pave the way for generations to come. This however, is the most realistic, superbly written zombie film to ever come out. My favorite and greatest zombie film in my opinion is 28 Weeks Later, but this film is frightening because of how realistic it is. I was scared, because instead of zombies wanting brains it was legions of infected simply wanting to spread their disease like a virus which is so much more believable. Brad Pitt was phenomenal in this film, he was an excellent actor. Seriously, go out and watch this and be forewarned to not bite your nails or engage in your nervous ticks, because this will have you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie. The soundtrack was also excellent, it made the film a lot more intense. It got insane, but still remained suspenseful and realistic. I appraise this film, because it was a zombie movie and yet it wasn't full of gore. Which is amazing, this film just proved to Hollywood and broke the molds of proving to everyone that a zombie film can still be a zombie film without the gore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>apocalypse-zombie style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would call this movie in one sentence as "apocalypse-zombie style" and here is my review:STORY AND PLOT: This movie is a sci-fi thriller with apocalypse background and zombies as a main course. though the story line is simple the script is strong enough to make this movie a thumbs up in critics and audience.CAST AND PERFORMANCES: there is nothing much to discuss in this category as the casting has been kept to minimal and the whole story revolves around the character of Brad Pitt. the characters played by his wife children and his fellow colleagues are short lived but yet they did their job in their role. and what more to say about brad as he played his role in ease .TECHNICAL DEPARTMENTS: the first thing i want to speak in this category is the OST/BGM in this movie which i personally liked very much. The graphics though not very realistic can take your breath and especially eye feasting for thriller movie lovers. The rest of the technical departments has done their job well.MY ANALYSIS: this movie is a definite must see for thriller lovers but the i felt the story line similar to I AM LEGEND movie and have to see how much non thriller lovers can receive this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very intelligent movie. Probably the best take of the Zombie genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first say that this movie is not for the kind of people who resent Zombies. People should watch only the kind of movies they like, and not complain about the good movies of the genres they don't like. I think that's why this movie has got those many negative reviews.It has everything a modern Zombie movie watcher would want. It has gory, violent and probably the best Zombies(on the same standards of The Walking Dead). It has good screenplay, good acting, very believable storyline. And, most importantly, it has logic in it. Not mindless at all.This is movie treats 'Zombie' as a disease. Like an epidemic being broken out, and people trying to find out how to control it. They use the behavior of nature and evolutionary concepts to find a work-around to survive the Zombies which makes it only more meaningful. The story has been treated very well.Coming to the movie itself, it has very good effects(A few scenes with the zombies are just out-of-the-world!), has some very subtle beat- stopping moments, good, ironic humor. The background score is good, not something you'll exactly remember after the movie, but, it's an essential part of the movie.In all, for Zombie-lovers, this is probably the best movie. That too in times of being deprived of the Walking Dead episodes, this movie will keep you high for a good amount of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Repetitively gripping, ferociously captivating the audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's pretty hard to describe the this movie without spoiling it, but if you haven't been exposed to any content, simply walk to cinema and watch it uncontaminated. I have to give credit to the trailer for being subtle enough to not ruin the tension. World War Z is an apocalypse movie with plenty of seriousness, incredibly quick pace and neatly hidden scares lurking steadily. The fresh set pieces bring more substance than the usual thrill as they constantly move forward while keeping the audience invested in the journey. Brad Pitt delivers a great performance, the movie can't ask a better protagonist. He displays calmness and desperation with equally refined stature. The whole movie is about this man who keeps getting in life threatening situations without resorting to hulking up to usual action role. It's fascinating to see how he struggles for dear life, and those of others, as he goes through such extreme frays.There are some novel ideas that are inspired by wise internet proverbs "If it looks stupid but it works, it ain't stupid". These bits provide more natural survivability to the scene and prevent it from being too silly. Graphical gore and action are well executed, creating threats are seemingly more lively. Gripping sequences are thrown frequently without much delay between them. These captivate audience by steadfastly lurching the action in consistent occurrences.Effect of 3D is somewhat lacking, at least in my experience. Some might not work well, although the graphic prowess of the movie itself if certainly above average. The way it changes setting is remarkably done, providing sense of progress as it goes along. One minor complaint I have is the ending is a bit bland, it doesn't conclude or wrap the movie in any significant way. Seeing the scale of the crisis, it's understandable for not being resolved instantaneously, but it feels less interesting that the previous parts of the movie and a bit prelude for sequel.World War Z is a frantic fast-paced fervid ride, and it's even more so if you watch it without any prior knowledge of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The book is pretty entertaining, but because of the style, that being short stories, it is still pretty weak. However, the story in the movie flows nicely and makes sense. I am also very glad that they changed the ending of the movie from the original planned version. I've read about what they originally had and it just sounded like a mess. I also am grateful for the lack of gore in this movie as gore wouldn't make any sense at all for this type of story. Besides massive amounts of gore is over-used and is just a bore now. I am glad the director actually had an imaginative mind and could tell a story using words rather than shock effects. I loved how the movie played out and I loved all the characters in the movie. Definitely a good movie to watch and re-watch.</fullReview>

Brad Pitt is excellent from start to finish. The best thing about this film is the fact that nothing is overdone. No action scene is dragged out to long, like man of steel and others have done. And no silly decision making takes part by any of the characters, such as running up stairs instead of using the front door to get away from the bad guy as seen in most horrors.

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable to a point, but it leaves you wanting more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I saw World War Z. World War Zombie. When was the last time they actually said "zombie" in a zombie horror movie? The Walking Dead made it "cool" to say "infected" or "walker" or "undead." But I haven't heard anyone actually say zombie in a zombie movie. This movie fixes that. Sure, it is a trivial thing, but I still found satisfaction in the fact. I guess you can say there are a lot of trivial things about World War Z, the film, that make you happy. But, then again, there are also many trivial things about this film that make you want more. As a zombie movie, it isn't really a zombie movie. It is a summer action movie sprinkled with some zombie-like thrills and chills. A REAL zombie movie is a movie like Dawn of the Dead. This movie, though enjoyable for the most part, is a watered down version of what a good zombie movie SHOULD be. Though there are negatives about this movie, I still do recommend it.The plot is your typical zombie movie plot. Well, I'm not sure about typical. Most zombies movies are about people trying to survive the zombie apocalypse, and in the background they have subplots about finding a cure or some sort of vaccination. This movie is about people, well, particularly, one man, trying to find some sort of cure for the zombie apocalypse, whilst surviving amongst it. I like the way this movie switches plots around because it doesn't feel like your average zombie movie. But the movie does repeat itself in a sense, but I'll get to that later. More specifically, Brad Pitt plays a UN employee who is traveling the world searching for a way to stop the spreading zombie pandemic. As more and more cities go dark, the more hope is lost. Brad Pitt also has a family, a wife and two daughters, who are left on a ship as he goes off on this quest. They don't really contribute much to the story, which is kind of a complaint, because this subplot could've added more depth to the characters and more emotion to the overall story. But, no, Brad Pitt just calls them every now then to remind them: "Hey, honey, I'm alive!" This is a good summer movie. I'm going to say that right now. I did enjoy the movie for what it was, a summer movie. But the fact that they watered it down to a PG-13 movie upset me. The zombies in this movie are just there to remind you that it is a zombie movie. They don't actually do anything other than run around chasing people or just stand there. Sure, they pounce on someone, but they leave it at that. The movie has no zombie violence, which is good in some ways because it appeals to a wider demographic, but most of us would like to have some REAL zombie action. Even though, also, they stepped away from the regular zombie plot, it still does feel like a generic zombie movie, except watered down. The movie is enjoyable, yes, but it isn't good for much more then thrills. There's no emotional depth to it, which I would've enjoyed, especially when there was a strong subplot they could've used between Brad Pitt and his family. As I said earlier, the movie does kind of repeat itself in the sense that Brad Pitt goes to a place where it seems safe, then stuff goes down, then Brad Pitt goes to another place where it seems safe and yeah. They vary it up a bit. There was also one thing that I didn't buy at all in the movie, and it is kind of spoiler-y so I'll highlight it with astericks. ******When that kid shot himself after tripping. Seriously? That's all I can say.****** Overall, those are just complaints I had. I think I have a lot of complaints about movies that are similar to others, but I don't let them bother me as much as others. I still really enjoyed the movie for what it was, a fun summer movie. I had fun watching it, and it is enjoyable. So a very light 7.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge zombie fan; my favorites include, 28 days/weeks later and Dawn of the Dead. World War Z has become a new favorite. I can honestly promise anyone would like this movie. I have read some of the negative reviews, and I cannot believe some things that people are saying about the film. This was the PERFECT zombie film. It was different. Leave all prejudices of zombies at home, because this movie will introduce a new type of zombie. Brad Pitt was amazing. I expected nothing less than an excellent performance from Brad Pitt, and he delivered. The other actors were quite unexpected in my opinion; i loved the diversity. I hate seeing the same actors playing the same roles (and often playing them terribly). This cast was superb. I could go on a rant all day about what I loved about this film.

		<shortDescription>Not 28 days, but it will do for this summer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like Zombie movies, crave them so to speak, then you'll be pleased with World War Z, a work in the genre somewhere between Night of the Living Dead and 28 Days, my fav. Actually it is closer in quality and modest believability to 28 Days, with a bit of Contagion, as UN operative Gerry (Brad Pitt) struggles to find the source of the pandemic that is consuming the world. The implausibility of most horror films is built in; the genius of the filmmakers is to make us believe anyway.Unbelievable, yes, ludicrous no, for it speaks even in its grand setups of human vulnerability and the capricious power of Mother Nature. Although 28 Days had a minimalist approach, fewer zombies and more good guys, WWZ has a focus on hero Gerry with close-ups aplenty?but then it's Brad Pitt, who was born to be photographed.The zombie tropes are all there if you're checking: the hero coming out of retirement, the loving family he has to leave to save the world, the unreal transformation of millions into undead monsters, the good guy bitten, and so on. Yet director Marc Foster has assembled the best looking zombie horde to complement his star's good looks. Foster has also depicted thousands of zombies climbing and being shot down in vast groups, and image I have not encountered except in films about Nazi atrocities.The almost two hours are as fast paced as the virus?nary a moment of peace?from transporting Gerry and his family to various safe spots to running from the legions of zombies to finally a relatively quiet World Health Organization lab, where the creatures are ready to stop Gerry from finding their weakness and producing an antidote. The allegorical implications of HIV or chemical warfare are there if you want them. Otherwise, it's just an enjoyable ride along the suspense express.However, I have to admit the pandemic has a ring of truth to it , as if Ma Nature had decide another Black Plague would be good to get the population to reasonable size. For that scenario, see Dan Brown's Inferno. For nothing more than edge-of-your seat thrills, World War Z will do for a good old-fashioned adrenaline rush.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing to Do With the Book, Except for the Zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer for this film was very exciting. It did not show anything really about what the film was about, except for some big unknown event that was turning the city into sudden chaos one morning.I found out that there was a book that inspired this film, so I sought it out to read it. I was surprised to discover that this book, and I guess likewise the film, is about ZOMBIES! The trailers (wisely, I thought) did NOT show zombies at all. The book by Max Brooks was a compilation of short man vs. zombie stories which were happening all over the world. More than 50% into the book, I did not read any scene that remotely resembled the scenes shown in the trailer. I was ready at that point to concede that this Brad Pitt film will have nothing to do with the book except for the main fighting a worldwide zombie infestation premise. And I turned out to be right."World War Z", the film, is about Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), a UN special operations agent, who had retired from that job to be with his family. (This character Gerry Lane was NOT even in the book.) We follow Gerry's adventures as it starts in his home town of Philadelphia, PA, as we saw in the trailer, when he gets his family to safety, and was then assigned to play a vital role in the zombie fight. The rest of the film brings Gerry to Korea, Israel, and Wales as he was able to observe and hypothesize a possible weakness in these zombies. The latter third of the film happens in a WHO facility where he was able to actually conduct the experiment he needed to prove his theory. Can Gerry discover the key to turn the tide of the war to the human's favor or will the zombies continue to spread their plague?The zombie scenes were NOT unnecessarily gory. There were NO scenes of exploding heads or trailing guts or gushing body fluids which are commonly seen in other zombie movies, even as these were very graphically described in the book. While horror purists would call this lame, the way it was done in this film was not any less exciting, yet makes this movie more accessible to more people. This could have been a spectacular gore fest, but obviously the filmmakers had a different vision in mind.The scenes of the mass zombie attacks were very well-executed by the computer-generated visual effects. The Jerusalem scenes were especially disturbing and heart-racing. The scenes on the Belarus Airlines jet plane were also exciting as they were unbelievable. They try their best to give credible scientific approach to the problem, and I would give them props for that. This is even if the plan was on the simplistic side, and shaky in the medical sense. Opportunistic infections, anyone? However, they did prepare us for that solution by the statement a character makes at the beginning of the mission.Brad Pitt did well as the lead actor. He was practically the only known name in the cast, and he dominates the screen with this star presence. Yet, we can still empathize with his character Gerry and the difficult situations he got into, no matter how incredibly lucky or superhuman he may have become. He had a "sort-of" commercial for a particular soft- drink brand towards the end, which was amusing, yet still well- integrated in the action of the scene.Even if the film had almost nothing to do with the book, I found this movie quite absorbing and intense, and ultimately entertaining and satisfying. Maybe they should have just changed the title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good not great end of the world story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brad Pitt's return to guy flicks is well intended but it does not live up to the high expectations associated with a Pitt film, nor does it do justice to the film's source material.World War Z, based on the bestselling novel of the same name by Max Brooks, follows former U.N. employee Gerry Lane as he scours the globe in search of the cure for a zombie plague.The story perhaps had good intentions and big ambitions during initial drafts but I suppose due to rewrites and editing, this was lost. There was nothing overly special with it but it was not by any means a bad movie. The effects and acting were good, and the plot was fine. For a movie where the main plot point is to search the globe for patient zero and discover the cure to save humanity, one would think there would be some sense of urgency; however, this was not conveyed. The urgency in each situation was there, but for the overall film it seemed he was merely doing his normal, day-to-day job.One issue that has resonated with me is Matthew Fox. As a fan of Lost, I was excited to see him in the movie, but his role is very small, useless, and that of a nameless actor. Perhaps originally he had more of a role and ended up being cut. Fox could have been cut to seem like a cameo appearance or cut altogether but he ended up as nameless "Parajumper." Hopefully DVD extras or a sequel will flesh out this awkwardly placed actor.For a zombie movie the director, Marc Forster, played it far too safe. There was very little in terms of gore, blood and violence, which made for a disappointing horror and zombie movie. The previews also gave the impression that World War Z was an action movie but all action is shown in the preview, which could be disappointing for action movie fans.Like many similar movies, we are expected to suspend reality that the hero can face so many obstacles and come out the other side while many sidekicks are lost; this is no different. I am okay with this though, I enjoy the ridiculousness of it anyways. The children in this movie though should have gotten him killed right off the bat, further cementing the idea to drop the kids in the event of zombie apocalypse. They were overly annoying and needy, even for children.Now, in comparison to the book, of which I am a huge fan, it is even more of a let down. The book is an amazing novel that examines both the brutality and compassion of humanity in times of war. It examines different people from all over the world before, during and after the "Zombie War." It is more than just another zombie book. Perhaps due to time constraints, budgets, editing or any other number of reasons, the core of the story is lost. The idea of a U.N. investigator travelling the world and the recounts of Israel are the only aspects of the film that resemble the source material. Hopefully Forster is given the opportunity to make the trilogy he imagined and attempt to redeem himself, but due to the problems with the first movie, this seems unlikely.Although this review may seem like I disliked the movie, I actually found it to be quite enjoyable. I am simply very disappointed that the filmmakers made another race against the clock movie, even though it had so much potential to be thought-provoking and original. If only Danny Boyle was behind it; we could have had one of the greatest zombie movie ever created.World War Z was my biggest let down of the year so far. After a great weekend that included Man of Steel and This Is The End, I would suggest passing on it in favor of these more enjoyable movies. I would suggest seeing it at some point as it is a good movie, but it does not need to be on the big screen or in 3D.From the blog: tilfilmdouspart.blogspot.com</fullReview>

I am nothing but disappointed.I mean what was Brad Pitt doing in the entire movie!He simply moved from one place to the other ordering people to do stuff without doing anything on his own.Even towards the end, when he was trying to run away from the entire fiasco, he leaves behind the case which controlled the zombie satellites.. .. -: I guess the reason behind this was to help Pitt in saving the day! Lol...the zombies could have easily fled with the controlling device!Nothing special about the action sequences! :/As a matter of fact- Suckerpunch movie was way better than this one! Probably the reason why I had so many expectations from this movie!In a nutshell....Not Recommended! Anyway, the movie is not even close to my expectations..

		<fullReview>Well, this was a zombie movie with OK additions to the concept. The collaborative scenes of the zombies (such as the scene where zombies use each other to climb a wall) were quite good both from the CGI side and the idea side. On the other hand, the virus spreads ultra quickly. This was not a good idea from my point of view. A whole city gets sick in a few seconds. Acting was not that great I am afraid. A lot of characters just pop up and than turn into a zombie. The directing and story telling was not that great either. I believe the biggest success of the movie was the good advertising. Just to sum up, the movie was not boring and had some positive contributions to the zombie concept. But, it is not a movie that I will remember as a great zombie movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as people say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not as bad as people say it is, it's only that people were expecting another thing completely. The movie is way different from the book, where the book is more of a thriller filled with suspense and investigative work, the movie is an action film with some scares here and there. But that was very clear from the trailers.However, the movie tries to explain the reason behind the pandemic, which most zombie movies won't even bother to do, and you get to root for humanity, whereas movies such as Resident Evil makes you root for the main character only.So maybe I won't go watch it again, but as far as 2013 goes, this is one of the best blockbusters of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>new zombie movie ? nothing new ... it reminds me of an old movie where a monkey spread-ed a virus and the hero was trying to find the cure . this is not a bad movie if you ask me , it has something new , something unusual , and while Brad Pitt on board , you have to say it is a good movie , still in a good shape and an action movie star as usual . the plot was weak and the pace was fast and this is what made it bearable . there are some good things in the movie that made me say it is not a bad movie , in brief , Brad Pitt , Good sound Effects , good zombie action scenes , perhaps this is why i gave it 7 out of 10 . if you are looking for something new , you should give this movie a try , or perhaps if you want to spend some time doing something new :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B- film with a decent lead character (Pitt) and an awesome storyline, but lacking in many areas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider myself a big fan of zombie books, movies, and TV shows. I'm not an aficionado per se, but I really get into almost anything that has to do with zombies (and vampires, but that's a different subject). To be completely honest, I haven't read the book (I have, however, read Brooks' Zombie Survival Guide), so please keep that in mind while you're reading my review.The film felt really rushed. In fact, it was rushed in just about every aspect. The amount of traveling that Pitt's character does is enormous, and covers more than half of the globe. Unfortunately, much of this travel is completely left out of the movie and would have made for some awesome back-stories. The most rushed part of the movie, however, was the end. You're left with what would be a great ending and a wrap-up of the events that preceded it, but much is left to the imagination as to the resolution and how it happened. Basically, you have to come up with the 5 Ws on your own: who, what, when, where, and why?*Possible Spoiler Below*I did not like the zombies in this film at all. It was as if once someone was infected, they morphed into a slim, fit running machine that could achieve incredible speeds. In other words, once someone "turned," their physical bodies changed to become fast and swift. I have never seen this before in a book or in a film: when someone "turns," they retain their body mass and abilities before they turned. *End Spoiler*Finally, I was disappointed with the lack of blood and gore. I feel that to add a sense of realism to a zombie movie, blood and gore are essential. The lack of blood and gore made the movie great for younger audiences, which I suppose is the reason why it has a PG-13 rating.Overall, it was a decent, B- movie that, I believe, doesn't quite make it into the true "film" category. It was at best a movie, at worst a flick (there's a difference you know!). It was rushed in various aspects, and the lack of blood and gore, as well as the zombies' characteristics, completely reduced the realism of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical summer blockbuster, all visuals, no characters...which isn't a bad thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z is an apocalyptic drama that lacks the same bite as The Walking Dead but packs enough of a punch to satisfy summer audiences. With it's melodramatic dialog, intense action sequences and Brad Pitt, it elevates a rather tiresome genre to new heights. While the film is absolutely stunning as an action thriller, it lacks in one of the most important elements of an apocalyptic drama...characters that the audience can relate to and sympathize with. Running at a little over an hour and half, World War Z could have easily been a three hour epic that included great characters along with its great action. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver any memorable moments throughout the film. Overall, World War Z features a good performance from Brad Pitt, great action sequences, and a story in the vein of Contagion. It is highly entertaining and is definitely a recommended watch but I fear it would fail to impress with repeat viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this today. I was looking forward to it because I really enjoyed both the book and the audio book. Author Max Brooks was inspired by The Good War, an oral history of World War II by Studs Terkel.Written ten years after the official end of the zombie war by an agent of the United Nations Postwar Commission, the book is a series of oral interviews with survivors of the global war against zombies.The movie takes place at the beginning of the war as a U.N. investigator attempts to locate Patient Zero. This story is not told in the book, and the "solution" postulated by the movie is not, to the best of my recollection, included in the book. But it is a valid theory and a plausible story.I enjoyed the movie and was not disappointed. There wasn't a lot of gore and in the end the victims of the Z-virus were pitiable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Losses are incalculable....and that's just the investors talking! A Dead movie project comes back as a mindless but still quite swift Zombie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story behind the making of "world war Z" is of course more fascinating than the film itself. A best selling cult book that took real world geo-politics, military planning, history and personal experience then threw in zombies way before the cast of Sense and Sensibility or Abraham Lincoln were fighting them, a bidding war between star players and high hopes. Then the script re-writes, the production delays, the film losing all sense of shape and direction as it is passed from hand to hand, a reputation as a bad joke growing, all satirical and political aspects that made the book so popular trimmed away layer by layer till all we were left with was just another Frakking Zombie movie! Then a disastrous premiere in London and lukewarm critical reception leading to this.With films such as this, one has to be more understanding, aware that what we are seeing is the salvaged remains of a greater idea rather than a complete piece of work, a fire damaged good up for cheap sale. So do not go in expecting something spectacular or magnificent.As an international thriller it works OK, and Brad Pitt is as good a central figure as any other leading man. There are plenty of Zombies and plenty of action, and Marco Beltrami's score hits all the right notes.The main problems (for us anyway) are: (1) The structure. We start off with Brad and his all-American (actually half English) family enjoying their all-American family life when suddenly they are caught up in stock "sudden city-wide panic and chaos" and flee from crashing cars into supermarket chaos then into a high rise for some "Raid/Dredd" corridors of despair hide and seek then "chased by hoard onto roof and jumping onto helicopter just as hoard reach them, trying to grab onto the landing gear" before they reach "ultra professional cool under fire military centre" (this time in a ship) Then Pitt, an ex top UN investigator, is forcibly re-instated and goes off on a "quest for the source of the outbreak". What follows is basically the same silly premise repeated four times. He arrives in South Korea, gets a little bit of info, then Zombies break loose and kill everyone he was helping. Then he arrives in Isreal and gets a little bit of info, then Zombies break loose and kill everyone he was helping. Then they get on the first airliner out of Tel Aviv and finds a little bit of info then Zombies break loose and kill everyone on board, then they arrive at World Health Organization centre in Wales where Zombies have broken loose and killed everyone, and then he arrives at the answer to the viruses spread, and finds the solution. All the problems of a post-Zombie world. the whole point of the original book, are lightly brushed over with a Muse soundtracked cosy coda. It is repetitive, especially the second and third acts, which are the same thing repeated. (2) Unoriginality. As per above precis, everything here is stock and by the book, Nothing new or fresh at all in a genre that is virtually burned out. Even the Zombies and the scenes they are in are identical to those in any of the "Resident Evil" films. You sit there constantly waiting for Mila Jovovich to burst in all guns blazing doing her high kick moves, or at the very least a boss monster/licker to leap out. As a result the film feels too samey. (3) Silliness. Whilst clearly not the original intention, the end result looks silly and often plays like a Hannah Barbera Saturday morning cartoon. Everything that can go wrong goes wrong every single time, and Pitts brilliant solutions (blow up an airplane in mid air? On the spot amputations on a hunch?) come from nowhere and are ALWAYS proved right! This is not helped by the seriousness and stiff lipped manner everything occurs, which only adds to an unfortunate air of camp and silliness. The book was written by Max Brooks, but at times the film seems more inspired by his father Mel!Acting wise everyone is good, Pitt is fine, if not exactly super emotional. Mireille Enos as Pitt's wife and Daniella Kertesz as the Israeli woman soldier who becomes his sidekick are good, as are James Badge Dale as the commander of the South Korean outpost, and Peter Capaldi and Pierfrancesco Pavini are solid as the WHO doctors in the final segment. Fana Mokoeana appears as his old UN boss and handler while Ludi Boeken makes for a suitably philosophical Mossad boss in the Tel Aviv scenes.Special effects are mostly OK, but are often weak and rushed (plane crash-jerky zombies) Scotland and Glasgow pass for Wales and Philadelphia while Malta passes for South Korea and Israel (not too badly actually). Budapest PASSED for Moscow till all those scenes were cut to avoid making it "too political" (Ha!) Like previous disaster stricken projects such as "The Invasion" and "The Island of Dr Moreau" there is a kind of flatness, a weakness and lack of drive, a sense of cracks papered over and corners held together with duct tape just enough to be able to sell it off cheap and make what little can be made on the lost investment. As cruel as it is, we actually enjoyed it more as a sort of unintentional comedy "MSTK3000" style than as a serious sci-fi horror thriller, for which it is highly entertaining. So if nothing else, you can enjoy it as a sort of comedy, preferably at a midnight show with friends after a few beers!It isn't a summer blockbuster, and it isn't a film version of "World War Z", but there is far worse out there, and a with a little charity for it's hard life it is actually quite a good night at the cinema,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. Brad Pitt did a really good job in the movie! The movie is also really fast paced and full of thrills. This is more of an action zombie flick than a horror flick. It has some suspenseful scenes that can reflect a horror film though. Marc Forster has become a blockbuster director, and he previously was more of an Oscar type director, but ever since Quantum of Solace where he did an exceptional job with the action sequences, he was able to enter the realm of blockbuster entertainment. His direction is exceptional, and his style actually adds a bit of "grit" to the action scenes and the overall film itself. It's a unique and entertaining film that I recommend, though it does diverge from the source material, and it can be a little uneven. Give it a watch at the theater!</fullReview>

Pretty clean movie too. If you like this genre you will like this movie, if you don't you may not. That simple. Action sequences are incredible. Acting is pretty good too. Listen, if you think you will like a good End Of The World (EOTW) movie, then go see it.

		<shortDescription>Brilliant summer blockbuster with a surprisingly good story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off...I don't care about the source material. I have not read the book yet and I probably will read it but even then I wouldn't care whether or not this stayed true. I am always ALWAYS able to separate film from literature because its really the only way to enjoy them in their own way. Second of all, I don't care this movie is PG-13...in fact I applaud them for not going full on gore, R rated splatter-fest. The way the film is it can appeal to a wider audience and be appropriate for more people. The lack of exploitative gore does not make this a lesser zombie flick. The Zombie genre has just been beaten into a tiny pulp. And yet I am consistently impressed with what film makers and writers manage to do with the genre. Films like this and Warm Bodies and shows like Walking Dead prove that there can still be some fun and entertainment left in a very, very tired genre. World War Z is a zombie flick obviously but its also created to be a disaster movie. It has that style and feel. You will travel from the US to Israel to India and throughout the world. The film does not give you even a moment to breathe. From the opening scenes to the very last it is a go-go-go adrenaline rush that leaves you breathless. The story is actually very well crafted and even the CGI that I thought could break this film is done pretty well.No one can doubt Brad Pitt's star quality. The man exudes a cool, quiet confidence and has great chemistry on screen. I actually found his character a little dry in this at times but Pitt's charisma will win you over. He shows a certain intensity and yet he borders on bland at times which is unfortunate. It doesn't hold the film back and I think the character was just meant to be very in control of every situation. Relative newcomer to the big budget Hollywood scene Mireille Enos plays Pitt's beloved wife. She does a really good job, showing some great intensity. Best of all, she's not a traditional Hollywood beauty but rather someone who looks down to earth and a regular person and I liked that. Her and Pitt had good chemistry. Daniella Kertesz was really great as Segen, the impromptu partner to Pitt's Gerry Lane. Kertesz could easily be a focal point for sequels and her story was captivating. Her mostly supporting role was worthy and stand out. David Morse has a very small cameo role but I feel compelled to mention it because his character was fantastic and twisted. Sterling Jerins and Abigail Hargrove both do a great job as Pitt's children. They don't get a lot of screen time but they fulfil their roles very well. Peter Capaldi, Pierfrancesco Favino and Ruth Negga don't even get character names and yet all three of them did a great supporting job towards the end of the film.In many ways, World War Z is an ensemble cast. Outside of Pitt everyone only gets a little bit of screen time but there are some really great performance. A film like this, chock full of special effects and non-stop action could nearly forget all about story and character development (I'm looking at you Man of Steel) but World War Z proves that you can have all that AND a good story and great characters that you actually care about. The film went through countless production problems and I was pleased to find out that it doesn't effect the final outcome at all. I honestly attribute a lot of that to direction Marc Forster who is quickly becoming a solid force to be reckoned with after Quantum of Solace, Finding Neverland and even the lesser known Machine Gun Preacher. He knows how to tell a story and utilize his actors in a big way. He knows that a film needs to be more than just glitz and glam. Certainly the film left itself open for future instalments but I also didn't feel like they left anything out and that it was left open just for a cash grab. The story was complete, it well done, the pacing was near perfect and it didn't feel too long or short. As usual in my opinion the 3D was completely unnecessary. Visually the special effects ranged from decent to really great. The CGI on the zombies was perhaps slightly overdone but far less than I anticipated. This is the sort of summer time blockbuster popcorn flick that makes Summer films worthwhile. It shows up Man Of Steel and Iron Man 3!! See it!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**I didn't mark this review to contain spoilers, but it does imply the nature of the end of the film. You have been warned.**In my opinion, by the end of a movie or series of movies, there needs to be resolution to any and all conflicts. Zombie movies do not typically do this, even after the movie it seems like there is no hope for humanity, after all, how would you resolve a zombie apocalypse? Not only did they provide a solution in this movie, but it made scientific sense. The ending was great, and this is certainly my favorite zombie movie ever, no contest. I never finished the book, but the movie blows what I have read thus far out of the water, and that's a rare opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent zombie movie more than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie a high rating since I am a zombie movie lover. This review will contain spoilers so please skip it if you want to avoid any spoilers. The movie starts off with a bang and gets to the point in minutes. The only thing that I really didn't like about the movie, were the sprinter zombies which I am not a fan of. Seeing that zombies get some mysterious super speed that no human has is kind of ridiculous but acceptable in this movie because it makes the movie a whole lot more intense. Overall Brad did a great job with his acting in the movie as did the other actors. I really liked how the movie developed and how one of the doctors at the beginning of the movie, which I though was going to be one of the main characters, died off in seconds. The movie was killing off characters quite fast (not the main ones of course but rather secondary roles). I really enjoyed the zombie airplane scene since it was really intense. Overall the movie was very intense from the start and ended in that matter where I was able to catch my breath and go home without fearing a heart attack. The ending also leaves room for part 2 what I would like to see one day. If you like action movies and zombie (and Brad Pitt) then this will be a very enjoyable action, triller, horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a truly horrifying zombie apocalypse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many zombie movies have we all seen where a small group of 5-10 people manage to kill of hundreds of zombies and left us thinking how the heck humanity got in such a sorry state in the first place? Not this movie. Humanity is totally screwed when giant walls of zombies come at you at breakneck speeds bringing down helicopters and knocking over buses, not even guns able to slow them down. As you can tell by the trailer it is up to Brad Pitt's character to try and find a way to stop the zombies. This guy seemed to have the worst luck in the world, or maybe it was the best? In any case I'm voting to have Brad Pitt to be the new Chuck Norris due to the amount of balls this dude had in this movie. This movie was amazing and definitely a step up from all the other zombie movies I have seen, and I have seen quite a few. And if you want a good movie to take your girlfriend to this is it, she will be clinging to you the entire time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Surprise of 2013!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z is one of those rare films that is so terrifying and thrilling, that even through all the panic inducement, you can't stop watching. Brad Pitt is believable as Gerry Lane, an ex- UN investigator who quit to spend time with his kids, but when the zombie apocalypse begins, Lane is re-enlisted to investigate the source of the zombie outbreak. You may say you've seen zombie movies before, but you've never seen one like this before. This film has such a massive scope and scale, and that's what separates it from every other zombie movie I've ever seen. The film plays out on the world's stage, with Lane jetting from continent to continent in his investigation, seeing how different parts of the world have been ravaged by the pandemic. This large canvas allows World War Z to induce a greater feeling of hopelessness than if we simply were told the rest of the world was dark, but actually seeing it creates more fear in the realization that nowhere is safe. The other factor that marks World War Z as a benchmark in the zombie genre is the way the zombies are represented.While this is not the first time we have ever seen zombies run and not shuffle, the way director Marc Forster chose to have the zombies working together in ravenous packs, to where they're more like starved animals hunting prey, makes the proceedings actually feel more realistic. By infusing the zombies with real animal-like behavior found in nature, Forster simply reverses the notion that becoming a zombie makes you a brainsucking goon and rather reverts humans to animals. Of course, this a Summer blockbuster, and what really makes this worth the admission are all of the aforementioned things coming together to create large action set pieces that are memorable and frightening.The action in this film is on par with any major Hollywood action movie, with tons of explosions, destruction, and mayhem. Forster edits the film in such a way that we don't really get a very good look at the zombies till nearly halfway through the movie, creating this fear of what we don't know, wreaking havoc in the world that we do know. It was a brilliant move that may not payoff for folks wanting to see the zombies in full the moment they first appear, but these cryptic glimpses make the action all the more intense. Plus, it helps that pretty much everything bad that could happen in a zombie apocalypse, does happen. Such as zombies on an airplane, or zombies climbing on top of one another to vault over a wall, or a ton of zombies ramming into a bus.World War Z is just a great film that is packed with thrills from start to finish. I've never felt more anxious while watching a film, and yet I would gladly watch this movie again. While I have not read the book, and can understand why a person who has would be disappointed, I was thoroughly impressed by World War Z. I think it's the story that really intrigued me, the way that the filmmakers cleverly created a large scale tale of survival and desperation that pays off in the end with an ending that is not cheesy, but believable and feels well earned. For a film that had so many production woes, with countless rewrites and pricey reshoots, World War Z actually works and manages to be emotional, scary, and cool.I give World War Z a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

There are also critics who suggest this is a fine film that should have been called something other than World War Z.

Brad Pitt reminded me of John McClane from Die Hard in his inventiveness and smart, straight-ahead thinking. He is very practical and logical in his actions - he just doesn't have the clever one-liners.This film has a high opinion of the human spirit - higher than I do - and a keen sense of politics. It doesn't feel rushed, even though it clocks in at a brisk 116 minutes.I enjoyed Star Trek, This Is The End, and liked Man Of Steel, despite that film's problems. This is the only summer film so far that I have admired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Entertaining, Globe-trotting Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World War Z, while based off the Max Brooks novel of the same name, is in no way a direct adaptation, and happily, this works for the film's benefit. When Gerry Lane, a former UN worker is tasked to help a scientist travel across the planet to discover a cure for the rapidly growing zombie infection, he also is troubled by leaving his family behind while the world around him collapses into chaos.Directed by Marc Forster, WWZ is easily one of the most entertaining and epic zombie films ever made. Now this being said, many zombie fanatics will disagree, I know this, as some think you need bloody/gory violence and flesh-tearing. This movie proves otherwise, and the zombies here are among the most frightening zombies I've ever seen, being very reminiscent of the "rage-infused" zombies of 28 Days Later. Brad Pitt is at his A-Game here, being both believable as a father and an unsung hero. Mireille Enos was great as Karin Lane, being the very sensitive, but careful mother who knows how to deal with the situation instead of screaming her head off when zombies are at her back. The cinematography is absolutely stunning and breath-taking, especially after the incredible plane crash sequence. The music by Marco Beltrami is award-worthy, capturing both the horrific atmosphere of a collapsing world and human drama of what we're capable of in such disastrous times. The script, though, while well-written, went from being Oscar-material, to a normal blockbuster script that (happily) doesn't insult your intelligence, or become stupid. But there is plenty of room to make a sequel or two because the story here is much to grand for one film.Overall, World War Z is one of the best blockbusters of the year, with good acting, directing, and polished visuals that have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. I would have to say, this is one of Brad Pitt's best films</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding "Zombie" Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a surprise this movie is. I am always skeptical of "M" rated horror films (PG-13 in the U.S.), they are usually to tame to be scary but this film was genuinely scary and suspenseful. I have been watching horror movies since I was 3 years old (over 50 years ago) so very little scares or surprises me ... this film did! I felt compelled to write this review because I saw there were many negative reviews on IMDb and I simply don't understand why? I suppose most Zombie buffs would be looking for more gore but do not be put off by that, I nearly made the mistake of not going after reading some of those reviews, however the lack of real gore is not an issue! This is an intelligent Zombie/Virus movie and certainly about as realistic as you could get and I've seen probably every Zombie movie ever made. By realistic I mean that if we did actually have a Zombie apocalypse, I believe it would be very close to what is portrayed in this film, it is believable in that way. It cost me $50.00 to see it last night and I went away thinking it was money well spent, that doesn't always happen at the movies!</fullReview>

And there is no place to hide when almost every body is affected and zombies are sprinting faster than usain bolt. I mean they are so intense and claw, scratch, bite, scream, and do anything to get their next victim. Everyone in the audience heart was probably beating so fast. It's so suspenseful.But a great great great thing they did with this movie is not make it graphic and bloody. Anyone can go see it and enjoy it. It's appropriate for all ages. But it is still super intense and does not let you off the roller coaster until the end! Lets just say that this is the most entertaining movie I've seen all year besides man of steel. Everybody in my theatre have a standing ovation at the credits and we clapped and cheered! World war z feels so real and puts you into the shoes of all the characters. We get a firsthand look at the end of the world through Gary lanes eyes. (Brad Pitt did such an amazing job, as did the whole cast). It looks amazing in 3d also. Maybe even better than any other 3d I've seen in the past year. I recommend this not to zombie fans but to any kind of movie fan who likes having a good time at the cinema</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshing Zombie Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Philadelphia, the former UN Investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and their two daughters, Rachel and Constance, are trapped in the traffic jam. Out of the blue, they witness several car crashes caused by the attack of hordes of zombies. Gerry runs with his family and he steals and drives a RV, heading to Newark, New Jersey. Gerry calls his old friend, UN Secretary General Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena), who promises to send a helicopter on the next morning to rescue Gerry and his family. Gerry stops at a supermarket to get supplies and medicine for his asthmatic daughter and the RV is stolen. They flee to an apartment building and a Latin family helps them, lodging the family in their apartment.On the next morning, Gerry invites the family to go with them to the roof, but they prefer to stay in their apartment. However they are attacked by zombies and the boy Tommy joins Gerry and his family in their runaway. The helicopter brings them to an aircraft carrier anchored offshore New York City and Gerry is assigned to travel to South Korea with the virologist Dr. Andrew Fassbach (Elyes Gabel)to seek out the patient zero to develop a vaccine. When the team arrives at the base, they are attacked by zombies and Fassbach panics and has a fatal accident. Gerry has a conversation with an insane ex-CIA agent (David Morse) that is imprisoned and he goes to Jerusalem to talk to the Director of Mossad Jurgen Warmbrunn (Ludi Boeken) to learn why he built a wall and transformed the city in a safe zone. When Jerusalem is attacked by a horde of zombies, Gerry observes that the zombies do not attack terminally ill persons. Now he travels with his escort Segen (Daniella Kertesz) to a research facility in Wales to disclose his findings to the scientists. "World War Z" is a refreshing zombie movie, with a tense story full of action. I know that the movie is not faithful to the novel, but the plot is a combination of zombies and virus movies and entertains. The characters are likable and the special effects are top-notch. Matthew "Jack Shepherd" Fox is wasted with a minor role but in accordance with a research in internet, his character would have an important role in "World War Z", having an affair with Gerry's wife and taking care of his family during his journey seeking a cure to the epidemic. The dark ending, with Karin trading her body to survive, was changed by Paramount to a commercial (and probably better) conclusion. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Guerra Mundial Z" ("World War Z")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything I wanted in a zombie movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really didn't want to have high expectations for this movie but now it has officially made it to my top 5 favorite zombie movies of all time. Right from the beginning you are thrown into this world where the chaos starts and escalates like wildfire. You are really given a sense of how quickly and easily civilization could break down. This movie really managed to capture the sense of hopelessness, fear and urgency of a zombie apocalypse.The crowd scenes are just spectacular! The Cg is amazing and so visually stunning. The intensity of those raging hordes of zombies is something I haven't seen since 28 days later. It was gripping right from the beginning.I have to say that there were a few bits here and there that got laughs where they weren't necessarily meant to. But overall I was thoroughly entertained and my thirst for a good zombie movie was satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a disaster movie, it works. Irwin Allen couldn't have made it better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the potential exists for a thinking-man's zombie movie, then "World War Z" is probably about as close as you are likely to get. Here is a movie that tries to one-up the zombie genre by bringing it to an epic scale. It doesn't entirely succeed, but what it does, it does very well. Somewhere between grand special effects are characters smarter than the plot probably allows them to be. But this isn't a character study, it's a well-made disaster movie. Irwin Allen couldn't have made it better."World War Z" is lean on plot, heavy on action and lays out an apocalyptic scenario with the grandest of production values - every single dollar of the film's $170 million budget is there on the screen. The scenario is known by anyone following the trailers, the TV ads or who might have dug into Max Brooks' epic 2005 novel. If you're still blind to this plot, stop reading now.Where the book was a narrative, told in personal logs, the movie is a straight-forward action picture. It opens brilliantly with ominous news footage over the opening credits, saddled with a theme that reminds us of Tubular Bells, that scary music from "The Exorcist." Somewhere in the flurry of news footage are some snatches of information about an epidemic, but you have to listen to catch it. Something is happening, the world is going topsy-turvy and what lies on the horizon will cause nothing less than an extinction level event. News of the threat doesn't seem to have affected the household of The Lane Family where everyone is happy and smiling in their sun-splashed kitchen. Dad is Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), a former U.N. investigator; his wife is Karin (Mireille Enos) and they have two precious daughters.No sooner do we meet the Lane family then the world goes completely to Hell. If you've seen "28 Days Later" or "Zombieland" or "The Walking Dead," then you pretty much know what is happening here. People are being bitten by the undead ? their bodies contort into a pretzel before they jump up and run at a clip that doesn't seem quite human. Whatever is effecting the undead has collapsed their capacity to become winded. When they scream they sound like a raptor with strep throat.Gerry seems to have a keen eye for details, noticing things in the midst of the ravaging cannibal invasion that others seem to miss. As the undead hoards pour over the population, he stays one step ahead, trying to get somewhere, anywhere that can give him some answers on how to stop the thing. In that, "World War Z" becomes one of those Gotta-Get-There movies in which a character must get from one location to another without getting killed. That means the every location that Gerry visits becomes infected by the ravages of zombie attacks ? up to and including an airborne jetliner, Philadelphia and even Israel. No place is safe.Where "World War Z" succeeds is in the production values. There's something the feels very real about the situation and the movie is paced at a level that doesn't feel like a special effects show ? there are moments when we feel as if we are there. This is a movie that has been crafted on the technical level with loving care so that, subconsciously, we don't feel at a distance from what is happening. Giving the movie a realistic feel is a smart idea because when the zombies begin their attack it makes things just a little more plausible, even if you believe that they can scale a 200 foot wall like an ant colony.The movie isn't as sharp on the screenplay level. "World War Z" is a movie that, for all its grand production and ominous tones, turns out to be, in the end, just an exceedingly well-made disaster movie. It doesn't break any new ground but it looks good, it moves at a good pace, and it gets the job done.*** (of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was great and they had Brad Pit and all those wonderful special effects but still, the movie was a pathetic attempt to show how the world will end. Every once in a while buildings were falling, volcanoes were busting and the whole Earth was crinkling up like cellophane. But the emotional expressions of the actors were not enough, even the zombies did a better job than the actors. The special effects were awesome and the ending was superb but still the film remained a tedious watch. The starting was pathetic,I mean people trying to save great works of art, building submarines, what the hell? We are talking of a zombie epidemic for god's sake! Event the part when everybody is disagreeing to tell the public that the zombies are forthcoming. A mind blowing performance, it deserved every award it got and even more . Don't miss it for the world! Open your mind, and World War Z will be one of the worst flicks you ever saw."Resident Evil: Apocalypse" and "Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars" are still better watches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every movie has two parts separated by interval. This movie too has those. The one before interval can be called disappointment and one after interval is strictly space-filler.The movie could have been a lot better. The dialogs were weak. Pitt's like a guy of 12-13 year old! Many other things are in this movie which are hard to accept. Anyways, couple of good laughs are in store while one watches it. Funniest scene is (meant to be tragic, though) when an outdated CGI-generated tornado of zombies starts looking like something from the 90s, we are talking "Jumanji"-era special effects here, folks. :) One feels that movie is too stretched. It could have been made shorter by half an hour, at least, without loosing anything from story.The movie doesn't leave a lasting impression. I came out of movie, talked about it for 5 minutes and that's it :) Finding Neverland from the same director is a much better movie. For this World War Z! I will give 1/10 for some laughs and hair cut of Brad Pite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read the book so I'm not giving a review, this's just my note after a weekend meal. Customers who only expect some brand new ingredients, please don't order this $200.000.000 main course! Gourmets who are fans of sophisticated chefs within readiness of enjoying the art of cuisine, please follow me!So it's time for this dish World War Z. This one is not a fastfood to instantly fill the curious stomachs of people who never know the meaning of fine-dining. Because this one is made of known ingredients cooked in a known way, but definitely it's another healthy combination becoming a well-decorated dish, placed in front of you with nice table accessories. When you see it you say 'Fantastic!' and when you taste it you say 'Wow, delicious!'... yeah, it's just delicious. How beautiful it is when a fine-dining dish is simply delicious! Well, because we are talking about fine-dining, now before its arrival on your table I look at the menu and see the main course here: "World War Z" - Roasted zombie/undead and stir-fried disease-disaster served with Pitt's Chronicle sauce.You'd like to discuss more about it? Okay.1. Zombie is roasted - means you won't see so much blood as on the raw undead or zombie sashimi. But you know, it's been soaked in some spices before the roasting process so that it smells appetitively good. What spices? Watch and find them! Reviewing the trailer is a hint.2. Disease-disaster is stir-fried - means if you'd tasted movies like Contagion and you are a gastronomer indeed, you realize there's something new seasoned in here. Hint question: Stay at home through out the pandemic or leave? 3. Pitt's Chronicle sauce - means it's a chef's secret, it's the way chef expressed himself. His life, his experience, his talent, his fate. I don't give you hints anymore. I tell you the following spoilers. Brad played a role in 12 Monkeys. Brad (and Angie) adopted children from poor countries. Brad loves his family. Brad adores UN and WHO. And Brad's Hollywood life, there's supposed to be some pandemics (I don't know what they are, maybe greedy, cheating, stress...) that Brad's once had to face up to them.Okay I stop now, the food is coming. P/S: Zombies don't care if human blood tastes delicious or not. If you're not a zombie, what are you waiting for to award Brad Pitt, the chef, and his kitchen Plan B a long applause?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will write this review without giving too much away I hope. I was anticipating this film for several months and just could not wait to view it. The storyline is very good and Brad Pitt as ever gave a terrific performance, the way in which the film develops is intriguing and kicks off almost right away, the panic that ensues is so believable and horrifying too, furthermore the brutal reality of what mankind was facing was also quite dramatic in its creativity for instance there being no place for "survivors" everyone had to be a cog in the gearbox to earn a right to sanctuary, the CGI effects were first rate, and as the film progresses you are shown the futility of mans attempt to stem this horror I also liked the way in which a "cure" was sought I thought that to be very classy and originalWell worth the ?7.30 to watch and I would watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazingly Boring Artistic "Disaster-Piece"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look, the Americans have given us some pretty good things, like banjo music, jazz, American Idol, insipid superhero films, and the like, but World War Z is not one of them. There are some people who simply should not try to make movies, and Hollywood bad-boy Bradley Pitt and his friends definitely fall into this group.I've now seen World War Z, Ocean's Twelve , Troy , Megamind , and The Reptile, and I've noticed these defining characteristics of Bradley Pit films in each: 1. A flimsy, vaguely defined plot 2. All the tension removed and replaced with long, drawn out, pointless scenes and convoluted subplots 3. A baffling, confusing denouement, usually supposed to convey irony, but leaving the audience's heads spinning 4. Then, before the closing action is completed and before the plot has had a chance to resolve itself, the end credits elbow their way in.World War Z, however, is one of the most sustained examples of this. (1) The cinematography was quite impressive but the overall result was oh-so-dull. I am sure there was a "point" but I just could not be bothered to try to understand it. (2) It beggars belief that the crummy hacks out there calling themselves critics say this movie is a "masterpiece" and draws comparison with Kubrick's 2001. Is it because of the slow pace and special effects? Kubrick used those for a reason: to tell a story, to help advance the plot and create a sense of expectation and/or suspense. World War Z is nothing like that, because there's simply no plot. You don't know who to root for or sympathize with. There's no hero, no challenge, no arc. It's just a 2 1/2 hour collage of short scenes. I saw several people leaving the room after just 15 minutes of projection; others kept checking their watches every few minutes (myself included.) (3) Do they ever explain in the film exactly how the zombies would be affected by burning the dolls? And why wouldn't Gerry just run back to the secret passage to his house? I'd also like to ask why he needed ZOMBIES from various nations. They did say that he was loose with his money, but nobody ever said he was going on a journey not unlike Phileas Fogg's. I was telling myself to "stay calm", to "be patient" and I thought my patience was rewarded when started the part with the family-friendly zombie outbreak scenes.(4) Then, just as the tension in the final scene comes to a head, the film ends, just as befuddlingly and cryptically (no pun intended) as it began.Not to mention, THERE'S NO PLAGUE OF ZOMBIES! America should just go back to the things they're good at, like guillotining random people and producing drug-induced literary works. Horror is not for them.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you serious? At least an 8 out of 10...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly was not expecting much from this movie. Being a fan of the original World War Z book I was pretty appalled when I heard Brad Pitt was cast in the screenplay adaption. After hearing they were trying to lower the rating of the movie I was equally disappointed and originally planned on boycotting the movie altogether.So anyway, I was hanging out with a mate today and he convinced me to watch it despite my protests. In the end I decided it was better than seeing that garbage looking Gatsby movie.So I sat down and the film started. IT WAS AWESOME! There were explosions, military guys flying around in helicopters firing M240s and hordes and hordes of insane rabid zombies... Nothing was bad about this movie! It could have used a bit more gore, but that's it! Otherwise it was a perfect example of what a film should be. It was scary, fun, violent and didn't try too hard. So I saw, go watch World War Z and enjoy it. I rate it up there with other movies I enjoy, such as Predator, Terminator 2, Avengers and Dawn of the Dead. If you don't enjoy the film that's fine. You are a tool (the kind of douche that watches films like with flowers on the cover and drinks overpriced wine). If you watch it and enjoy it, congratulations, you are the kind of person I would have a beer with and you have excellent taste in movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z Review: Will you survive the zombie apocalypse?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombies are, quite ironically actually, everywhere these days. Whether it's on TV with The Walking Dead, the British series In the Flesh or the cast of any reality TV show, they have taken over the airwaves in a lot of people's lives. They have also made decent work of the movie theatres as well. With films like 28 Days Later and its sequel 28 Weeks Later, the Resident Evil series that just doesn't seem to want to die, or spoofs like Shawn of the Dead and Zombie Strippers (yes, that movie actually exists, look it up). It doesn't seem to matter whether it is slow zombies or fast zombies or zombies who dance on a stripper pole, people seem to like them despite ongoing talk of the coming zombie apocalypse.Just as with vampires and werewolves and other supernatural creators of myth, zombies have their own mythology attached to them. Generally with zombies it's that things in society have gotten out of hand and we need to rebuild what we are currently living in. So in that way, World War Z is just like any other zombie apocalypse story, things fall apart rather suddenly on a monumental scale and we get to watch it happen. What is different about World War Z is that it takes a really interesting approach to how things fall apart.In following Brad Pitt's character of Gerry Lane, a retired U.N. investigator, we get to see how a security conscious world deals with the tragic circumstances they find themselves in. The presumption of most zombie apocalypse movies is that everything goes under, every country in the world loses their governments and the entire system we have set up is destroyed. World War Z asks if that would actually happen. If a government is on constant alert for terrorist attacks and threats from foreign governments, would they actually be left unprepared for the zombie apocalypse? As a result, World War Z is very different from traditional zombie movies. Just as I said in my review of Man of Steel however, that may not be something that people enjoy. It means that a lot of the things that long time zombie fans like about watching the zombie apocalypse don't necessarily happen. If you are such a person, you may be left wanting by World War Z. You get some of what you want but not everything. Still, for a movie that so many people were nervous about given how much bad press it got for re-shooting half of the movie and other problems, it works really well.I enjoyed the movie and I am not traditionally a fan of zombie movies. It worked well and while some elements weren't explored as much as I would have wanted them to like the relationship of Gerry Lane to his family, I still think it's a movie worth seeing. They also made good use of 3D which many recent movies haven't because they have been conversions. This is a movie that you might actually want to see in 3D.Will you survive the zombie apocalypse? Maybe, but you will definitely survive a screening of World War Z and come away thinking it is a great experience.To check out more of my reviews, go here:http://andrew-heard.blogspot.ca/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MUCH better than expected!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from viewing a special screening of WWZ, and I must say that myself, and the people I was with, were all very impressed. When the trailer initially came out some time ago, we all felt that it looked a bit rushed and cheesy... that it would likely be long on action (and probably exclusively of the CG type), and short on practical effects, story and character development. Well, while there are some impressive displays of CG throughout the film, the movie does, thankfully, retain its ability to keep the viewer emotionally invested in the goings-on and the characters circumstances. This can be a very tough ratio to balance, given that the movie studios tend to push too much for action much of the time in an effort to generate ticket sales, neglecting the story.World War Z is impressive in that it incorporates action and the CG elements into a larger whole. Meaning they are used to serve the story, instead of being its substitution.This is the type of movie you'll go into and as soon as it starts, it's over. Almost two hours have gone by, and they just fly. The pacing is perfect, as out protagonist treks the globe, racing to find a reason to hope. The effects and cinematography are superb, which adds to the overall thrill. An amazing adventure, be sure to catch this one. You'll be glad you did.10/10 (especially to offset the other vapid reviews already posted here)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War Z</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard about this film many months before its release, because I heard about the leading actor being involved in a new zombie movie, and the title was certainly well chosen, from director Marc Forster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland, Stranger Than Fiction, Quantum of Solace). Basically former United Nations employee Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is stuck with his family in a heavy traffic jam in Philadelphia, and on the radio they overhear a rabies outbreak spreading worldwide, and then all of the sudden explosions go off and people start biting and attacking other people, these are zombies. People bitten become a zombie after 12 seconds, and after escaping the disaster, and spending the night in the safety of an apartment, they are picked up by a helicopter sent by Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena), also Gerry's former UN colleague. They are taken off the coast of New York City to a U.S. Navy vessel, and the analysts and military personnel discuss the outbreak, Dr. Andrew Fassbach (Elyes Gabel) says it is a virus they must find the origin of to find a cure to those infected as zombies. Gerry, being expert as a former UN investigator, is sent to investigate, he is given the dilemma that if he does not agree his family will be taken off the vessel, and the team travel military base Camp Humphreys in South Korea where the word "zombie" was first heard. After getting out of another attack he is informed by survivors that the zombies are attracted by noise, and that the best way to kill them is to shoot or hit them by the head and incinerate the body, and imprisoned for treason former CIA operative Gunter Haffner (David Morse) tells him to go to Jerusalem, Israel. Once there they meet Mossad leader Jurgen Warmbrunn (Ludi Boeken) who explains about troops some time ago fighting against undead soldiers, and following this the country quarantined itself, but they still allow all nationalities of uninfected civilians to enter, and due to the noise from inside the zombies manage to climb the high wall to get in and attack. During the attack Gerry noticed certain civilians being ignored by the infected, and he escapes with escort soldier Segen (Daniella Kertesz), who is saved from infection having her bitten hand amputated, but on the plane a zombie stowaway attacks, forcing a grenade to be exploded, causing suction for the infected, while the passengers are safely belted, but the craft crashes. Gerry and Segen seem to be the only survivors, and they reach their diverted destination, a W.H.O. (World Health Organization) research facility in Cardiff, Wales, and to the scientists Gerry explains his theory that the zombies will not bite people already seriously injured or specifically terminally ill, as the host would not have a virus spread and reproduce, he says it is not a cure, but is could work as camouflage. He volunteers to try and get to the wing containing a range of terminal but curable pathogens to inject himself and try this theory, but the wing is surrounded by infected zombies, so he and two others make their way as quietly as possible without obvious detection to the wing. Gerry makes it to the storage vault while the other run and get out before the door is bolted, he injects himself with a sample and waits a few minutes for it to spread in his body, and he opens the door to a zombie who simply looks at him and walks past, and he successfully walks through the facility without any zombies trying to bite him. In the end Gerry returns to his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and two children in the safe zone in Freeport, Nova Scotia, a vaccine is created to be supplied worldwide for people to inject themselves and become camouflaged from the infected, soldiers are able to kill and incinerate the masses of zombies, and humanity continues. Also starring James Badge Dale as Captain Speke and Lost's Matthew Fox as Parajumper. Pitt is I agree a bit too calm most of the time, but he is a reasonably good choice as the man trying to help stop worldwide chaos, I also agree that there is not enough bloodshed in this film, most zombie movies you would blood and guts all over the place, and there are no big scares, but the story has good ideas about pandemic solution, and the conclusion to the problem is clever, it is exciting enough to enjoy with its special effects as well, all in all a likable action horror drama. Good!</fullReview>
